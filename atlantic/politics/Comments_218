<comment>What kind of credibility does a church started by a king have anyway?  The Episcopalians should sever all ties with the Church of England.</comment>

<comment>Same one that allows Christian persecution.</comment>

<comment>You mean kinda like Islam?  Or is Islam much worse because it takes gays up to roofs, ties them up, and throws them off roofs, then if they're not yet dead, they bring out hungry dogs?  Or, if that's not what they like to do, they stone gays to death.  Islam certainly treats gays well, doesn't it?</comment>

<comment>You mean kinda like Christian persecution, torture, and murder of folks for imaginary "crimes" such as "heresy," "apostasy," and "witchcraft" for two thousand years?  Christian thugs in Africa have been beating and burning "suspected" gays to death, thanks to the stupidity and hatred they learn from Christian missionaries. Better turn that critical gaze upon yourself before you point your self-righteous finger at others.</comment>

<comment>Do you have a frikkin' time machine, DEARIE?  Maybe we can zoom you up to the year 2016.  You seem to be stuck back in some age somewhere.Because I happen to live in 2016.  Just thought I'd throw out the year in case you don't know.  And in 2016, it's the f***** Muslims ONLY.  And 2016 is not the year Muslims started terrorizing people.  They've been doing it since 610.  1400 years, DEARIE.  Stop sounding so ignorant.</comment>

<comment>Are these then your best excuses for you to be like radical Muslims to do wicked things unto others as what you would not want others to do unto you ?When you choose a lifestyle of homophobia to put discrimination laws and acts unto gays who you judge WRONGLY to then physically harm them, you commit the same mortal sin as those terrorist.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsMatthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”</comment>

<comment>In genesis, it says sodomy, (anal intercourse), is an abomination unto the Lord. In MT: 19: 3-12, Jesus says, "For some are born that way and aren't meant to marry." He also, says, "Men are to live by every word that cometh out of  the  mouth of the Lord thy God."</comment>

<comment>Where do you see the words "anal intercourse" in the bible ? Are you reading the kamasutra or the proper bible that talks about Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm ?</comment>

<comment>Sodomy has ALWAYS meant anal intercourse...until modern gay legal beagles spun it to mean so many other things. The bible says: "For a man to lie with a man as with a woman is an abomination." A man has only one orifice that be  layed as a woman, (BJs don't count!), ergo anal intercourse. Stop being an ass.</comment>

<comment>Because of biblical passages of words NOT from Christ but from the Mosaic laws that prohibit eating of shellfish or wearing clothing of mixed materials, and biblical words from the self-proclaimed apostle Paul (who has never met Christ physically as the original 12 apostles handpicked by Christ, and also predicted the return of Christ during his lifetime), you religious homophobes gave yourselves to an anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia and bigotry to defy all the commandments of Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, for you to finally commit the mortal sin against the Law aka Great Commandment as in Luke 10:25-37, to put discrimination and hate as good to physically harm others. Plus religious homophobes often claim that the bible is words of God, yet when Christ spoke with His own mouth when He walked as a man, religious homophobes give Him the middle finger to all of His teachings, just like the Pharisees.Indeed woe to homophobes who lie and deceive others to put discrimination and hate as "good" and the highest law of the entire bible(Great Commandment) of equality and love as "bad" - Christ's version of Isaiah 5:20. Homophobes will all perish and not have eternal life, for the wages of their mortal sin is death.</comment>

<comment>You are one sick puppy! Jesus appeared to Paul after the resurrection, and the apostles embraced him. Jesus said: "Man is to live by every word that comes out of the mouth of the Lord thy God." He also said, in MT: 19: 3-12, "For some are born that way and aren't meant to marry." SSM and every abomination that's spawned by sodomy is an abomination. There is righteous discrimination against those who defy God.</comment>

<comment>Hope you're suckin' off Jesus really soon!  Don't forget - the Lord hates a spitter!</comment>

<comment>In the late 17th century Jesus appeared to St. Margarette Mary, and asked her to tell Louis XIV to consecrate France to HIS sacred heart. A 100 yrs went by and none of the French Kings complied with his request. Then in the middle of the French revolution, in a dark, dingy, dank, stinky basement, with his family by his side, Louis XVI found a bishop, and complied with the Lord's request. Alas, it was too late, and  divine justice had to take its course. France and the world is  still reeling from its results. Next year will be the centennial of Fatima, where Mary appeared, and made several prophecies. The last one is unfolding before us. She said that if  her request weren't fulfilled that it would rain fire from  heaven, and that it would start at Kieve. Today Kieve is the capital of the Ukraine, and the west and Russia are having very serious disagreements over it. If the west goes to war with Russia over it, it will indeed rain fire from  heaven as nuclear warheads blaze over our heads. The scenes in those dumb zombie and apocalyptic flicks don't even come close to the suffering that will come upon mankind. It's just a yr away, and peeps, all of us need to get our spiritual affairs in other. For those that survive will wish they had died. So mind yourself as you contemplate the Truth...for it is about to manifest itself upon the world- us. It won't be the end, but many will  wish it were. God bless!</comment>

<comment>If only that clumsy skank Mary had gotten an abortion people wouldn't have to put with scum like you.</comment>

<comment>Get thee from me Satan! Her prophecies all came true, and the last one will shortly come to pass. You've been warned, and a yr like the last the one passes swiftly. Wiki Fatima!</comment>

<comment>So if I decide to believe in that skank do I get to screw her in heaven?  Do you get to watch?</comment>

<comment>You just make atheists look REALLY bad.</comment>

<comment>You would be gone if the Moderator were paying attention.  But the real consequence is when you come before the Lord on Judgment Day and are reminded of your words here. Whoa!  I would not want to be your shoes.</comment>

<comment>You're confusing eisegesis with exegesis, Ralph, and the text doesn't support your reading in of your prejudices....</comment>

<comment>It's you who are confused! The only interpretation of scripture that matters is the one from the Vatican's magisterium which is guided by the Holy Spirit. Others come from the mind of mortal man, and often tend to be demonic as is your case.</comment>

<comment>The Magisterium has never addressed human sexual orientation, ralph.  Sorry, you are mistaken.</comment>

<comment>The Holy Spirit guided the holy fathers and established the Magisterium at the council of Trent when the bible was codified into what it is today. The bible addresses that issue in genesis, and in the gospel. The error is yours!smokersodysseycom</comment>

<comment>Sexual orientation is not addressed in Holy Scripture or Holy Tradition, ralph.  You are mistaken.</comment>

<comment>My goodnes how peeps keep beating on a dead hoss. Read  MT: 19: 3-12.</comment>

<comment>No such thing as "sexual orientation" apart from what a human CHOOSES to do sexually! If you're not choosing your orientation during sex, you're being raped!</comment>

<comment>"Traditional or Biblical marriage" is so enviably "sacred" to homophobes that they love to get lots of it in their lifetime just like Kim Davis, Kardashians, Donald Trump, Rush Limbaugh and is also exclusively for sinners like rapists, pedophiles Duggars, adulterers Evangelist Grahams, murderers Charles Manson, homophobes, terrorists like Osama Bin Laden, thieves, etc.. so long they come as a man and a woman for such celebration.Churches are selling booking at wholesale prices when you do bookings of 2 and above, with repeated customers having loyalty points. That's why gay marriages are often turned down by homophobic churches as they mostly don't meet those criteria and minimum booking requirements. Those so-called 'Christian' businesses like bakeries, photographers etc... have that similar policy.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>We're human, ergo sinners!  You look at sinners, point them out as an example, and judge our faith...this makes you just as bad them. You are blinded by sin, and can't see the good the faithful do. You peeps talk about how our faith is dwindling yet every Sunday my Church filled SRO.</comment>

<comment>When you are not a Follower of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, you don't follow the LAW, His Great Commandment which is to love Christ and love your neighbor AS YOURSELF, by doing unto other as what you would want others to do unto you.What Christ called good you call evil, what Christ called evil you call good. Your definition of sin is the opposite of what Christ defined in the LAW.That's how you ended up with a lifestyle of homophobia to judge gays WRONGLY, and then condemn them by legislating man-made laws to physically harm and ill treat them, while at the same time, those laws make you celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman.Indeed, woe to homophobes who lie and deceive others to put discrimination and hate as "good" and the highest law of the entire bible(Great Commandment) of equality and love as "bad" - Christ's version of Isaiah 5:20Matthew 7:21  “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’  And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.Homophobes will all perish and will not have eternal life for failing to do the will of the Father(Great Commandment - He and the Father are one), for the wages of the mortal sin is death.</comment>

<comment>You're one sick puppy and I'm not going to read your drivel. By your own deeds you condemn you're self. You're toying with HOLY SCRIPTURE, the WORD of God. You must be an atheist for any man who believes would not be doing what your are. God forgive you!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, I'm a "sick puppy" as I follow the LAW, while you are swine who don't know what are pearls and a dog who don't know what is sacred. Indeed you are toying with the HOLY SCRIPTURE, the WORDS of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. Indeed I'm an "atheist" to not believe nor follow your homophobic god who tells you to do everything that Christ said NOT to do.Christ does not forgive people like you who continue to live an anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia to be doing wicked deeds unto others as what you would NOT want others to do unto. When you judge gays WRONGLY and condemn them with discrimination laws of hatred, you commit the mortal sin of hate that is against the LAW.Matthew 7:21  “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’  And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.Homophobes will all perish and will not have eternal life for failing to do the will of the Father(Great Commandment - He and the Father are one), for the wages of the mortal sin is death.</comment>

<comment>Next year will be the centennial of Mary's visit at Fatima. All her prophecies came forth, and the last one is now unfolding in the world. In the 3rd secret she says, that a "Divine castigation will befall the world, it will begin at Kieve, and it will rain fire from heaven." Today Kieve is the capital of the Ukraine, and the West and Russia have a very troubling disagreement over it. If they should go toe to toe over this it will indeed rain fire from heaven as nukes fly over our heads.The survivors will wish they were dead and those dumb zombie and apocalypse flix won't come close to describing the hell that will be unleashed on earth. It isn't the end of the world, but many will wish it were. Me advice to you- get your spiritual affairs in order because time is getting short. Tempus fudgit  me pal. God bless you on your journey.</comment>

<comment>See, when you are NOT a Follower of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, you do not believe in Christ, but other "Gods" rather. That's why again you will not be saved. Indeed you hate Christ and all of His teachings, in addition to your anti-Christ lifestyle to be a homophobe who defy the LAW.The President of Russia is just like you, a homophobe who does not believe in Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm and who do wicked thing unto others as what he would NOT want others to do unto him.You all will perish in the pits of hell, for the wages of your mortal sin is death.Good luck!John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.﻿John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.</comment>

<comment>You keep cherry picking scripture. Consider that God HIMSELF condemned sodomy, and Jesus said, that we are to  live by every word that come forth from the mouth of God, ergo confirming God's condemnation of SODOMY. Doya git now? Your cherry picks are directed at righteous people, who are truly those who do God's will. Your delusional ignorance is truly mind boggling. However by the end of next year you folks will truly know the truth. Good bye and God bless!</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, when you are an anti-Christ who is a swine who don't know what are pearls, you cherry pick scripture that are NOT from Christ to justify your defiance to ALL the teachings of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. Just because you believe as long as it's with the person of the opposite sex, you perform SODOMY with the opposite sex, thinking that it makes you as "better" person.Indeed, your projection of your delusional ignorance is truly mind boggling to still be trying so very very hard to justify your mortal sin against the LAW, to put discrimination laws unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, so as to hate and ill treat them.Good luck with your anti-Christ belief still to be a dog who refuse to acknowledge what is sacred to continue to trample over the LAW.</comment>

<comment>Please quit responding to Sims.  He is a broken record with  no capacity to actually listen to anything you say.  Unless  you agree with him, you are automatically a homophobe.   He craves internet attention (he must be a very lonely guy) so you are only encouraging him.</comment>

<comment>As protestants have long believed, you confirm that many Catholics do not actually follow Jesus, but obey the Vatican instead.</comment>

<comment>Protestants follow churches started by men who determined what is heretical and what isn't. You name the church and I'll tell  you who started it. By what spiritual power did Henry, (or any other man), established the church of England. His motivation- miffed at the  pope. Ours is a faith of miracles starting with Creation, Adam & Eve, Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, and the prophets, and Jesus and the saints. When Jesus breathe on the apostles, HE told them as HE put his hand on Peter's head, "On this rock I will build my church, and the  powers of  hell will never overcome her; receive the HOLY Spirit, whose sins you retain, I will retain in heaven, and whose sins you forgive I will forgive in heaven." There was no bible for four hundred yrs, and the faithful celebrated Jesus through tradition, and the works of HIS disciples and  apostles. Then at  the end of the 4th century the holy fathers codified the bible. The traditions were many, all could not be included, and there were many many documents purporting to be sacred at the time, but the HOLY SPIRITwho guided them, rejected unholy scripture. It was unholy then and it is unholy today even as they pop up at some archaeological dig. It boggles me mind that you people claim to believe God, yet refuse to believe what Jesus said. The HOLY SPIRIT guides the church it is within it. I know some clergy err, but they are human. Even King David sinned as he committed adultery with Bathsheba, and murdered her husband. It matters not what sinful men do, but believe the HOLY SPIRIT is within the Catholic Church, and the bible is catholic property, plagiarized by English kings, abridged, censored, and edited to suit their liking. They omitted many books, and changed many things, e.g.: the Niceen Creed. You also reject His mother who filled with the HOLY SPRIT carried Jesus for 9 months. How demonic it is of you people to believe that after such an amazing, (there are no human words to describe it) spiritual experience, that HIS mother would participate in carnal activity. Jesus said, I am come to fulfill the law, and the lawis writ in stone says "Honor your father and mother," how then can we not honor HIS mother as HE does. Stop pointing fingers at the church Jesus started, and do HIS WILL.,</comment>

<comment>"Protestants follow churches started by men who determined what is heretical and what isn't. You name the church and I'll tell  you who started it."So do Catholics.  The difference is they follow the Pope instead of Jesus Christ.Your hypocrisy is extraordinary, as you run about here screaming that most Christians are heretics.</comment>

<comment>Ahhhhh...but, it is Jesus who started the catholic church. The pope is only HIS representative, as that title has been handed down from the begin, Peter, by the Holy Spirit through the ages to the present, and on into perpetuity. Do you not believe that when Jesus place HIS hand on Peter, as HE breathed on him, and said: "Receive the HOLY SPIRIT, whose sins you forgive, are forgiven, and whose sins you retain, are  retained in heaven; and on this rock, (Peter), I will build MY church, and the powers of hell shall never overcome her. The Holy Spirit is within the Church, HE guides her and keeps  her safe through all  the turmoils of the world. 2,000+ yrs and counting. The Pope is indeed a man like you and I, but  he is  anointed by the Holy SPIRIT Spirit to make sure the WORD is kept HOLY. You people are reading an abomination created by English Kings who omitted many books from the original to suit their needs. You should read the original sometime.</comment>

<comment>"but, it is Jesus who started the catholic church."Perhaps.  But it was Pope after Pope who led the RCC into apostasy and sin."The pope is only HIS representative,"Nice heresy.</comment>

<comment>Only the magisterium of the Church determines heresy, and the magisterium was established by Jesus as is documented in the gospels. Any man who is in sin whether he be pope or man is under the jurisdiction of divine justice, and no man has the right judge him. Jesus said the powers of hell would never overcome HIS church, ergo since the HOLY SPIRIT is with it, it is not in apostasy. Some priest or even popes may have been but it is not, for it is the HOLY institution of which Jesus is its cornerstone. From where the church stands only protestants are in apostasy; one, for desecrating the bible, (it was never to be changed, yet English Kings and Luther did it anyway); two, for following false scripture; three, denying HIS mother; and four-  the demonic notion that HE had carnal brothers. You people are on thin ice! The sad part is you're either in disbelief or denial, and either is as bad as the other. May HIS gracious presence enlighten you, and bring you out of your damned darkness.</comment>

<comment>"Only the magisterium of the Church determines heresy,"Nope, and of course, there is no Scripture to substantiate that claim.  Instead, ralph, Jesus gave to all of his followers a test, in Matthew 7:15-23, for recognizing false teaching, what we now call heresy.  And by that test, the RCC has been teaching more than one heresy for much of its history."the magisterium was established by Jesus as is documented in the gospels."No, it is not."Jesus said the powers of hell would never overcome HIS church,"So, since the RCC has been overcome by greed, influence peddling, sexual scandals, it must not be Jesus' church." the demonic notion that HE had carnal brothers."So you are calling the gospels demonic.Mark 3:31Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.Matthew 12:46While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.Luke 8:19Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.John 7:3Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do.Acts 1:14They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.To list a few.</comment>

<comment>You people love to quote scripture...out of  context. The magistgerium is all of the teachings of the gospel. It is is the basis on which the church decides heresy, no one outside the church has the spiritual authority to do so. Neither Henry who started the Anglican church nor Luther nor any other protestant. Look pal, in the Filipino language there is no gender. I've been married to one for forty yrs, and often she refers to someone as he or she who is clearly the other. In Africa there are many languages which do not differentiate twix sisters, brothers and cousins, they're all the same. In Aramaic it was the same! But, consider this- Mary carried Jesus for 9 months during which time she was full of the Holy Spirit, for HE, JESUS, AND THE FATHER ARE ONE, and the SAME. So how in any human beings sane mind, cananybody then believe that after that HOLY experience, for which there aren't any human words to describe, that she would participate in any carnal activity. That is a most DEMONIC thunk, brother. But that is what many protestants belief. You're in APOSTASY!  When Jesus was on the crossand told HIS mother as HE pointed to John, mother there is your son, HE said that to her as we all of us are her sons and daughters. You folks are in demonic darkness. Pray for enlightenment.</comment>

<comment>"You people love to quote scripture...out of  context."You've got that backwards, liar.' You're in APOSTASY!"No, I'm in relationship with Christ through the Holy Spirit.  And with your " DEMONIC thunk" remark, you are come very close to, if not actually committing the one unforgivable sin." You folks are in demonic darkness."And yet, it is you folk who slaughter, torture, maim, slander, brutalize, steal, persecute, destroy human lives.  The RCC has a horrific history of violence for material gain.</comment>

<comment>If you were truly in a relationship with the HOLY SPIRIT you would love HIS spouse, Jesus' mother, and truly know the truth. You have a very sick notion of what is the Church, and it is why you are blind to the truth.</comment>

<comment>Your theology on this is rather bizarre.  So by your reasoning, Jesus' mother Mary is either an adulteress, or a polygamist.Which is it?"You have a very sick notion of what is the Church, and it is why you are blind to the truth."No, and that is why you must slander me over and over again.Did you take communion without repenting of your sins against me?  If you did, you took communion unworthily, which in the RCC is a mortal sin.I think you should provide me with the email address of your parish priest, so I can send him your emails, and he can verify whether or not you took communion unworthily.</comment>

<comment>For 4 hundred yrs there was no bible, then in the early 5th century the HOLY SPIRIT guided the holy fathers to codify the bible. It was NEVER to be changed. For a thousand yrs it stayed pure, then one dumb English King, miffedbecause the Holy Father wouldn't give him a divorcetranslated it into  English. It was the age of pen and quill, and it took them more 60 yrs to do it. In that time English kings edited, abridged it, and in short censored it. For 4 hundred yrs the church celebrated Jesus through the holy traditions handed down by the apostles, too many to be included in the bible, which was supposed to be a guide for the clergy. After it was translated, as the holy fathersfeared, any and all idiots read it, decided, they we'rereverends, disciples, bishops or apostles, (there are only 12). They open up storefronts, and start their own churches, some with some of the most demonic notions. Today there are over 34,000 denominations. Remember Jesus breathed the Holy spirit on them, who were the early church, and as he placed his hand on Peter's head, said, "On this rock I will build MY church, and the powers of hell shall never overcome her." Perhaps that's not part of your gospel!Jesus also said, "Think as God thinks, not as men think!" With this in mind know that Mary's union with God is a spiritual one, as daughter of the Father, spouse of the Holy Spirit, who has been with her since Jesus' conception, and Mother of Jesus. You people have some of the mostdemonic notions concerning our Holy Mother. She had one child, "Jesus!" Consider! that if she had other children, then when HE was on the cross, why weren't any of them there beside HIM, siblings who would've taken care of their mother? HIS mother! No one was there! Only the apostle John, to whom Jesus asked to take care of his mother, when HE said, "Mother there is your son!" I have not slandered you, I've only  responded to your demonic notions of what is holy and dear to us. The church FYI is the faithful, the clergy its caretaker, and our beloved pope, Jesus' shepherd on earth who is chosen whenever the need arises by the HOLY SPIRIT. Jesus said the Holy Spirit would be with her, the church, till the end of time...do you not believe HIM? If you don't, then YOU friend, are truly in apostasy. Read the original bible sometime. Next year Mary's last prophecy at Fatima, (which was confirmed when she appeared at Akita Japan, in the early 70's...check  out: http://tinyurl.com/jkzuvcj)comes to fruition. Research FATIMA some! God bless you!</comment>

<comment>That's a rather bizarre argument.  It reminds us that the initial church existed with a much larger set of texts about Christ and God, and that the RCC has chosen to deprive Christianity of much of those works.", then one dumb English King,"Remember, when you attack someone's intelligence, as you just did, you put yourself in danger of the fires of hell, according to Jesus."You people have some of the mostdemonic notions concerning our Holy Mother."Your vicious slander is sin.  As a reviler, you are self-barred from the Kingdom of Heaven, unless you repent.Bear mind, the only notion I presented is derived from your own words."God bless you!"The verbal abuse in your posts means that you don't mean that, and so, you are breaking the command "thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain".Or, God is not your Lord.  Which is it?</comment>

<comment>"For some are born that way and aren't meant to marry."That's not biblical, ralph.  Sorry, you are mistaken.</comment>

<comment>Read MT: 19: 3-12. It is the gospel.</comment>

<comment>Theses words-- "For some are born that way and aren't meant to marry."-- are not found in any "gospel".  Sorry; not even the most errant human "translation" (not even the Living Bible!) has that wording.  You are mistaken.p.s.  I'm a biblical scholar, a Southern Baptist-trained theologian, pastor, minister, teacher, preacher.  You couldn't pull faux-wool over my eyes, even if you dressed as Superman while trying to do so.</comment>

<comment>Your reading the wrong book, the KJ is  an abomination. Henry commissioned the translation of the Holy Book. It was the age of pen and quill, and it took the English 60 yrs to doit. In that time like a man who goes to a Chinese restaurant and orders what he likes from column A and column B, so did the English scholars translate the bible, leaving out many books, and translating only what suited them. It's foundation being that one King wanting a divorce so he could have a male heir against God's holy wishes, (he never did get that male heir after disposing of so many wives...did he?), had it translated. It is unholy! However that phrase is indeed in the  "Oxford Study Edition, "The New English Bible," New York Oxford University Press. Check it out!</comment>

<comment>The KJV, otherwise known in the English speaking world as the Authorised Version, is an outdated translation.  In fact, it was outdated about as soon as it went to print, but that is beside the fact.  And it was commissioned by James VI of Scotland, James I of England.  That version is not an "abomination".  It is not "unholy".  You're starting to sound goofy, misguided and foolish.</comment>

<comment>Hardly mepal! At Trent the holy fathers were guided by the Holy Spirit and it is He who codified the bible. All translations of it came from the mind of man, who censored, and abridged it, the result not being what the Holy Spirit intended and thus an abomination. However, it  was  Henry's idea to translated it, and since it was the age of pen and quill, it took them 60 yrs to do it. During that time other Kings put their notions to it. You may say it isn't unholy, but it since it is not what Gold put together it is.</comment>

<comment>More good news.  Of the thousands of earliest manuscripts in Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic (not to mention later in Latin and Coptic), it is amazing how few differences there are between them, mostly obvious copying errors or accidental deletions.  But I would never say that one particular version or translation is clearly more holy than the rest, just because some Christian group a thousand years later said so.   New manuscripts keep turning up and the scholars and linguists keep getting more proficient in the accuracy of their translations into other languages.   And languages are constantly changing. It is an ongoing process.Secondly, anyone can go on to a Bible website (like gateway.com or biblehub.net) and compare more than a dozen translations into the English--- the meaning of the passages stays the same almost always.  God's truth comes through.  And where they occasionally don't entirely agree, it is always on something minor, never having to do with an essential Christian doctrine.  The scriptures are reliable.</comment>

<comment>If you accept the gospel, you accept Jesus, the Holy Spirit,and the miracles they wrought forth, like Paul who never met Jesus in person, yet had that prodigious encounter on the way to Damascus. Or the decent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles at Pentecost. So it boggles me mind that anybody who accepts these things has trouble accepting that Jesus breathe the Holy Spirit on the apostles, as HE placed his hand on Peter's head and said: "Upon this rock I will build my church, and the powers of hell shall never overcome her. The Holy Spirit guides their descendants, as it did at the council of Trent when the bible was codified. It was the work of the Holy Spirit not of the men whom he used to bring it forth. It is never to be changed! To negate that is to negate that Jesus breathe the Holy Spirit on them or that He started His holy church upon them. Where then is you faith if you don't believe HIM? The English and Luther not only translated the bible, but they omitted passages, and books not to the their liking. The Nicene Creed most especially because Henry wanted to start his own church, and just  because he was miffed with the pope...and by whose spiritual authority? That Jesus had brothers? How demonic is that? Mary was full of the Holy Ghost when she conceived, an overwhelming experience that lasted 9 months, so how then is she going to engage in carnal activity after the ultimate spiritual experience. It's a most demonic thunk indeed! The magisterium is the final authority on the authenticity of scripture. No other church has a guiding authority to rule on what is or is not a heresy. Know that there were countless bogus documents at that time and the Holy Spirit rejected them. That they keep popping up today makes them no less bogus today than they were 16 centuries ago. Our faith is one of miracles starting with Creation, Abraham, Joseph, Moses and the Prophets, and Jesus and the Saints who keep coming even to this day. They have never stopped. There are over 10,000 of them. It's like 5 of them a year, and they all witness the Truth even unto death as martyrs. God bless ya!</comment>

<comment>Great cut and paste skills there goose!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, you homophobes copy the Westboro doctrine and paste it to your lifestyle to become an anti-Christ homophobe who hate Christ and the LAW.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.John 13:35 "By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>Such Biblical ignorance is truly amazing. Sad. Very sad.</comment>

<comment>hmm since you are an "expert" of the Bible to not have "ignorance", show to the world where is it written for you to put discrimination laws of hatred unto gays who you judge wrongly only to then celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman ?Show to the world which part of the bible allows you to have a lifestyle of bigotry to defy ALL the commandments of Christ, the God who has NEVER EVER condemned homosexuality nor SSM for you to come and lie, deceive, judge WRONGLY, condemn , hate others by discriminating them with the last act being the MORTAL sin against the highest law of the entire bible (aka Great Commandment of Christ)?</comment>

<comment>Again, amazing ignorance. Maybe you can write a song!</comment>

<comment>So where are the verses? Still waiting for you to show the world your amazing "expertise" of no "ignorance" !</comment>

<comment>Your comments are increasingly nonsensical. Sad, very sad.</comment>

<comment>Still waiting for you to show the world your amazing "expertise" of no "ignorance" !</comment>

<comment>Your empty dismissal is the only thing that communicates ignorance in this exchange.  Well, that and your typos and grammar errors.</comment>

<comment>Oh no! I didn't realize I was confronting the grammar police . . . Silly boy!</comment>

<comment>Your dismissal accomplishes nothing.  Your general incompetence with written communication, though, does call into question the accuracy of everything you post.</comment>

<comment>Funny taize, but THAT (for sone are burn that way) is the exact same passage you used in another string when you tried making excuses for homosexual behavior. It's funny when a liberal gets caught in a straight up lie! </comment>

<comment>"You are one sick puppy!"Nice sin.  That phrase condemns you as a reviler, whom Paul said would not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven."SSM and every abomination that's spawned by sodomy is an abomination."As a reviler, for you are, you are barred from the Kingdom of Heaven, according to Paul, unless you repent.</comment>

<comment>To condemn sin for righteousness sake is righteous for there is indeed discrimination. You have no idea what  you're reading, and are spinning Holy Scripture for your own evil ends...for even Lucifer can quote scripture. So you're in his company, pal.</comment>

<comment>"To condemn sin for righteousness sake is righteous for there is indeed discrimination."You are not doing anything that is for righteousness sake, or that is righteous.  You are working evil."for even Lucifer can quote scripture. So you're in his company, pal."That, of course, applies just as well to you.  And you are the one promoting the destruction of hundreds of millions of people.</comment>

<comment>I am not promoting anything. The Catholic Church welcomes effeminate people of all races...as long as you're celibate. All of God's children are welcomed. We love the sinner for we are all sinners, but we hate the sin. The sin is on the one who dwells in it, and loves it. You guys are spinning scripture to justify your sin, and that is indeed a terrible sin. May the grace  of our beloved Jesus awaken you from your darkness- Bless you!</comment>

<comment>"I am not promoting anything."Yes, you are.  Lying about it doesn't change a thing."The Catholic Church welcomes effeminate people of all races...as long as you're celibate."They would have no priests if they did not, but effeminacy is not the issue here." We love the sinner"Nonsense.  And ralph, homosexuality is not a sin, neither is homosexual sex a sin for homosexuals." You guys are spinning scripture to justify your sin,"No, you are simply bearing false witness.  What is the standard penance for that sin, Ralph?</comment>

<comment>My foundation and understanding of scripture is as the Holy Spirit codified it. I nor any priest  had anything to do with that.You don't like it, take it up  with HIM who said it "IS" a sin. HEwho hears the TRUTH, and spreads it is not in any sin of falsifying the truth, for it is as it is.</comment>

<comment>"My foundation and understanding of scripture is as the Holy Spirit codified it."No.   You are now committing blasphemy by declaring that the "magisterium" is the Holy Spirit."You don't like it, take it up  with HIM who said it "IS" a sin."I am.  I am taking it up with you." HEwho hears the TRUTH, and spreads it is not in any sin of falsifying the truth, for it is as it is."But since you don't tell the truth, and it seems have never heard it, your are guilty of false teaching.</comment>

<comment>The truth is the gospel and scripture condemn sodomy. You apparently don't believe scripture, and anybody who does you condemn as a liar. Isn't that about right? I never said the HOLY SPIRIT IS the magisterium. The magisterium is the gospel and its teachings according to Christ. But Jesus didbreath unto the apostles and said: "Receive the HOLY SPIRIT." They were the bricks and mortar of  the church as Jesus is its cornerstone, and the HOLY SPIRIT has never left it. The HOLY Spirit is in and guides the church, and the powers of hell shall never overcome her. HIS words! Repent, and sin no more, lest your sodomy take you to hell.</comment>

<comment>"The truth is the gospel and scripture condemn sodomy."The truth is that your claim is essentially worthless because it is contingent on your false meaning of sodomy.  You are a liar about the Bible."You apparently don't believe scripture, and anybody who does"Yet it is you who repeatedly violate the law:  Thou shalt not bear false witness.Because of evil people like you, preaching 'homosexuality is sin', real humans are murdered and raped around the world, and have been for some 17 centuries.  You are absolutely accountable for your share of that violence.And Ralph, remember what Josh Duggar taught the world - people who revile homosexuals have deep, shameful crimes hidden in their past.  The real question about you is what terrible thing did you do, that drives you to slander hundreds of millions of people?</comment>

<comment>Paul never met Jesus? Seriously? So their meeting on the road to Damascus doesn't even count in your book? Cute . . . Talk about selective citations! That's funny!</comment>

<comment>Paul would say anything to make himself credible as being "handpicked" by Christ. And if Christ met Paul physically in Damascus, why didn't He pay a visit to his own beloved mother, brother and his hand picked apostles ? Why don't the Bible don't mention more about Him other than Paul making such claim ?Furthermore Paul did mention also that Christ would return in his lifetime!!Anyway you look even more cute to bring Paul so strongly as your idol, but fail to obey his words as said in Gal 5:14. But that's not funny, but sad rather to turn your ears away from the LAW.Proverbs 28:9 If one turns away his ear from hearing the LAW, even his prayer is an abomination.</comment>

<comment>Have you even read the Bible? Do you not know how much of the NT is written through Paul? Apparently not, but you go right on with your fairy tale cupcake! Apparently you think only the OT is the Bible. Sad,</comment>

<comment>Nooooooooo, Fred....Paul glossed the OT from his post-conversion perspective, but the text was already in place both in the Hebrew and the Greek as well as Aramaic...</comment>

<comment>You're a sad, sad little man!</comment>

<comment>I've read your bible, but I don't like your homophobic god who tells you to defy the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm.You should read the PROPER Christian Bible that talks about Christ! Sad.</comment>

<comment>You too are a sad, sad little man!</comment>

<comment>Thank you again for your Westboro 'concern' and wishes.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>Not to mention the numerous times Jesus, as God, condemned homosexuality in the OT. Or how about when Jesus DOES define marriage as being between one man and one woman in the New Testament! Your side continues to be the worse ones at picking and choosing scripture, as well as manipulate it's meaning to meet your desires as opposed to seeking His meaning and will. Good luck with that. Forest Gump may well be proud of you, but not God!</comment>

<comment>hmm if you were to be a Follower of Christ, you would have followed Christ as a person who walked as a man in flesh, instead of treating whatever is in the OT that fits you to be of "God".Your reasoning is the exact method terrorist uses to radicalize their people, such that you can also use Exodus 35:2  (For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a day of sabbath rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it is to be put to death.) to then start harassing and condemning those who work on Sabbath !!If you didn't cherry pick the bible to skip the most important part before those phrases which you think "define marriage as being between one man and one woman", you wouldn't be DIVORCE among all other celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman.Good luck with your Westboro doctrine to have exchanged the truth of what Christ preached PROPERLY, for words not from Him but other apostles and false prophets.</comment>

<comment>Jesus came not to replace the OT, but the fulfill every bit if it AND to establish a new covenant. We have a choice . . . To accept the gifts of Jesus from God OR reject it. Should we reject it, we are indeed under the old covenant and will be judged accordingly. If we accept the gifts, it is apparent in our "fruit." Sadly, many are like you and think YOU get to decide which parts are worthy of your praise, but that's not how it really works. Either accept Jesus and ALL He says, or reject Him and pay the price. Good luck. I pray you seek God and He will find you!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, that's why He gave the Great Commandment, the LAW, just as it was in Lev 19:18 !!Leviticus 19:18  You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsMatthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”Good luck!</comment>

<comment>The short-term bliss of ignorance will be replaced by real pain and sorrow, if you fail to repent my friend. I'll pray for you.</comment>

<comment>Don't waste your time praying for me, as when you choose a lifestyle of homophobia to defy the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, your prayers are not only in vain, but an abomination unto Him. That's why you will continually lose and fail, and you will not have eternal life.Good luck, and enjoy your short-term bliss of ignorance and hatred towards Christ and gays on earth, your homophobic world is in it's end of days.Proverbs 15:8  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.Proverbs 28:9 If one turns away his ear from hearing the LAW, even his prayer is an abomination.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:21  “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’  And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.</comment>

<comment>My dear scripture challenged friend, if you actually believe anything from the Bible,  you should know that no prayer is lost with God. Indeed, you should follow your own advice and "do this and live" . . . Lose yourself and seek His truth to live! </comment>

<comment>My dear Christ challenged enemy who hate Christ to be a Westboro homophobe anti-Christ, when you turn your ears away from the LAW, your prayers are an abomination towards Christ.They are words from my Christian Bible, not my words :Proverbs 28:9 If one turns away his ear from hearing the LAW, even his prayer is an abomination.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”No matter how hard you keep trying over and over again to justify your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia to defy the LAW, for you to put discrimination and hatred as good unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, you will always fail and lose.Good luck debating still against the LAW to justify your anti-Christ lifestyle.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”</comment>

<comment>My dear friend . . . Your true position is exposed when you call me names and declare me your enemy in Christ. The words you share are indeed from a Bible, but one must always seek to discern truth by comparing scripture to scripture, not scripture to human understanding. You see my friend, true love needs no explanation and cannot be molded to the desires of the human heart. True love reflects the heart of God. When He says "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul," and the second, "Love your neighbor as yourself, in these is the entire law and gospel," he is not referring to love as a human feeling. He is referring to love as the sacrificial act He made for us. Acknowledging such means we die to self and allow Him to live through us, so when we are faced with the temptation of any sin, we can rely on Him to get us through it. He calls us to "Go, and sin no more." He does not wink and say, "live for yourself and have fun!" I pray for you as a brother in Christ and with the love He has for us both.</comment>

<comment>My dear anti-Christ enemy, I don't lie nor hide of who you are, playing the victim card will never be able to allow you to sweep away nor hide all of your mortal sins of your lifestyle of homophobia and bigotry to lie, deceive, judge wrongly based on words NOT from Christ, and then keep defying all the other commandments of Christ, including His Great Commandment to condemn and hate gays with discrimination laws to physically harm them.Your actions of wickedness speak louder than you continual words of lies and denial.No matter how hard you keep trying over and over again to justify your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia to defy the LAW, for you to put discrimination and hatred as good unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, you will always fail and lose.You can continue to lie and deny of your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia and bigotry as much as you want to deceive yourself and some, but you can never deceive all nor Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. I'm only here to expose you of your wickedness.Ephesians 5:11  Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.Good luck debating still against the LAW on why you should hate Christ to disobey His commands of the LAW and not have eternal life.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands.</comment>

<comment>Obviously, I can only pray for you.</comment>

<comment>Only your homophobic god will answer your prayers, but to Christ, your prayers are an abomination when you choose not to believe in Him, to hate Him when you disobey His commands, and not to have eternal life when you defy the LAW.Proverbs 15:8  The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.Proverbs 28:9 If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.</comment>

<comment>Again, I can only pray for you.</comment>

<comment>Good luck with your Westboro prayers to your homophobic god.</comment>

<comment>You poor tormented man.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm happy for you that you Westboro homophobes are not poor tormented man, enjoy while you can, it will not be the same soon on judgement day when you hate Christ to defy His commands of the LAW.Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;I'm enjoying my "persecution", just as told by Christ :)Good luck.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, you have no idea how close to the truth you are and how damning your position may be for you. </comment>

<comment>Sadly, you have all the idea how close to the truth you are to defy the LAW. Your master satan has indeed taught you well.</comment>

<comment>Imitating my responses with the childlike parroted comments really speaks to your lack of the ability to think for yourself and form your own thoughts. You know that right? It is painfully obvious you are committed to your delusions. Good luck. I'll pray for you.</comment>

<comment>hmm are you so mad to be hearing on how stupid you are ?</comment>

<comment>You sure "hmmm" a lot. Should we guess why that is or do you want to pretend more and act like no one knows why?</comment>

<comment>hmm still feeling so mad for being a Westboro homophobe ? Then, simple, stop being one, believe in Christ and follow the LAW if you want to have salvation and to be saved.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”</comment>

<comment>"My child, arise and walk away from the darkness."</comment>

<comment>Indeed, heed your own advice :)</comment>

<comment>This may well cause you great distress, but I would prefer to seek and follow God's advice, as opposed to any humans. Try it! You will find His peace!</comment>

<comment>Well, when I have Christ and the LAW, I have not only peace but eternal life!Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Good luck with your 'peace'!</comment>

<comment>Again . . . Just WOW!</comment>

<comment>Thank you. Now go and repent.</comment>

<comment>The amazing Captain Oblivious does it again!</comment>

<comment>So, why do you have so much hatred towards gays and Christ ? What have they done to you to be so angry ?</comment>

<comment>Unlike you my friend, I harbor no hate toward anyone. Why do you hate truth and anyone who doesn't agree with your chosen behavior and lifestyle?</comment>

<comment>hmm if you don't hate truth, then why do you judge gays WRONGLY and put discrimination laws of hatred unto them to physically harm and ill treat them ? Do you think I'm doing the same to you which you consider as "hate" as what you do rather in your ACTIONS of your chosen behavior and lifestyle to adopt the Westboro doctrine ?Why do you hate gays and Christ to be always lying about the truth of what He preached in the LAW so as one can have eternal life?John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”</comment>

<comment>I don't, but your hate is clear.</comment>

<comment>How clear ? What laws did I or the Democrats have passed that discriminate against you as hate for you from marrying the person you choose to love ?</comment>

<comment>I will leave you with your choice to be ignorant and hateful. I will not waste any more time on you.</comment>

<comment>So sad, that you choose the religious belief to sacrifice your salvation of eternal life by celebrating the mortal sin against the highest law of the entire bible, the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Leviticus 19:18  You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;Galatians 5:14  - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”You bitterly reject any gay couple who wants to exchange marriage vows to love one another in all circumstances of life till death do them part so as to live by the Golden Rule as in Matthew 7:12 to fulfill the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ, yet you freely participate and celebrate the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman.John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”Christ loves you, but when you fail to believe and disobey Him, you hate Christ and the Father, and Christ doesn't know you (Matthew 7:21).</comment>

<comment>You are a terrible criminal in the eyes of God. Your salvation is in jeopardy.</comment>

<comment>"Get the behind me Satan!"</comment>

<comment>Spending this life being endlessly tormented and harassed by the pitchfork wielding loons you refer to as "Christians" is most certainly not "bliss".Quite looking forward to a blissful escape from all the Christian piffle myself.</comment>

<comment>There's the door; don't let it hit you on the way out.</comment>

<comment>So many bouncers at the front door to His house. You are not in His house yet, Christian. Policing others outside that door is a futile and puerile thing to do. Focus on your own actions for the time being.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you thought you were making a complete thought somewhere in there, I'm also sure I can do nothing but pray for you too.</comment>

<comment>Don't do that. It's downright creepy.Praying for my life to be dismantled is nothing but passive aggressive wishful thinking based in judgmental delusions.Creepy.</comment>

<comment>Praying for the Lord to show up in your life unmistakenly so that you have zero excuse for your heresies and immoralities.  So that you might repent and be saved.   However, you are so entrenched in your sinful views that I truly doubt that will ever happen, but God is still all-powerful.  On Judgment Day, you won't be able to say I didn't try to intervene.(Ezekiel 33:7-9)</comment>

<comment>It is as easy for you to judge my actions and beliefs as "heresies and immoralities" as it is for ISIS to condemn your actions and beliefs as "heresies and immoralities".Your condemnation, based on your interpretation of "Gods word" is your meaningless judgment of me.We all follow our own paths. My path is no more (or less) valid than yours.Your condemnations of the paths followed by others is nothing other than you stating "that is not my path", but you insist on doing it in a manner which seeks to deflect those others off their own true paths onto a path of your choosing. You seek to lead them & control them.Your approach is inherently selfish. It is based on a quest for power and control over others. It is deceitful as it seeks to deflect others from their own innate truths.You are vastly inflating your own importance, you are arrogantly, deceitfully and selfishly seeking dominion over others. You are rejecting the notion that their paths may well be Him working in mysterious ways.I reject your advances, and I remain true to my own path. Your path is not my path. I will not deflect you off your path, but if you seek to deflect me off mine, then be warned: I clear my own path and navigate onwards.</comment>

<comment>If there were no God (meaning the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Father of Jesus), then you might be right. Moral relativity would rule.  Your perception of what is right and wrong would be no better or worse than mine.  And all of our discussions here would be so much flatus in the wind.But if the Bible is truly inspired by God, then it matters (eternally) which side we take and what we choose to believe.  I happen to believe that absolute truth exists, that is, an objective reality that is revealed by the scriptures.It is not that I personally am right or am qualified to judge you;; it is that the Holy Scriptures are actually true because inspired and authorized by God Himself ("God-breathed" as Paul wrote in 2 Timothy 3:16-17).  I only pass on what they reveal about right and wrong.  I do happen to be well educated in the scriptures.But of course I will never convince YOU and I'm fine with that.  However, this may be helpful to a few agnostics listening in.</comment>

<comment>Sorry my foolish friend, but there is only one path to God. "For the gate is narrow," is pretty clear that we can only get to Heaven by following Him and NOT by doing our own thing as you imply!</comment>

<comment>Indeed the gate is narrow, and the road is wide. When you homophobes who defy the LAW to judge gays WRONGLY, and condemned them with discrimination laws of hatred to physically harm them, you commit the mortal sin and you will not live, for the wages of your sin is death.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.John 13:35 "By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>Sure . . . In the same way society "wrongly condemns" other sexual deviates and criminals . . . Fool!</comment>

<comment>hmm if you "condemn" other sexual deviates and criminals, why do you put discrimination laws unto gays only, but then celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman ?Thanks to you "Christians" who embrace "traditional marriage" or "Biblical marriage" and then legislated man-made laws to only impose such belief while legalizing discrimination towards gays, the 2 muslim shooters of the San Bernardino as a bi-national couple had no issue entering this country, to have a marriage license and to finally have a graceful burial and a honorable death certificate acknowledging their "traditional marriage" and "biblical marriage" as "a man and a woman". While Jim Obergefell had to go through a hell of an ordeal to fight for such honor for his partner, just because of his true love to a person of the same sex.If those Muslim terrorists were to go the recent Oregon or Colorado "Christian" bakeries who were fined for refusing service to gay couples, they would have gotten their wedding cake without any questions asked as they fit the "biblical marriage" a "man and woman".If those Muslim terrorists were to go the recent Oregon or Colorado "Christian" bakeries who were fined for refusing service to gay couples, they would have gotten their wedding cake without any questions asked as they fit the "biblical marriage" a "man and woman". And if those terrorists couple were to go to Kim Davis, the multiple divorcee homophobic "Christian" at the Rowan County in Kentucky to apply for their marriage license, she would have issued them their marriage license without any questions as they fit her requirement of her "religious belief" that only allows her the "religious freedom" to celebrate the "Biblical marriage" as "man and woman".</comment>

<comment>At least you seem to hmmm well!</comment>

<comment>Still awaiting for you to show the world your amazing "expertise" of no "ignorance" !</comment>

<comment>You are not sorry, I am no friend of yours, and I am no fool, fool.</comment>

<comment>I truly am sorry the truth is so foreign to you, yet I would still be open to calling you friend.However,"It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt."</comment>

<comment>There are many truths, but only one body of fact.Fact is the enemy of truth.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it's quite the opposite . . . There is only one truth!</comment>

<comment>And no doubt you proclaim to be the holder of that truth?Go chat to a Muslim about it, then a Hindu, then a Buddhist, then an Animist etc etc.There are many truths.If you seek a battle for supremacy of a single "truth", then you seek global war and the annihilation of those who differ. You become the destroyer of worlds and your God becomes it's Satanic overlord.There are many truths, but only one body of facts.Fact is the enemy of truth.</comment>

<comment>No, the truth is not mine. It is God's, yet He wants to give it to all. You my friend are using human reason to address the things of God. There is but one truth and one God. The "facts" tend to change from time to time, relative to what is understood to be truth at any given point in time. Many facts have indeed changed when actual truth is exposed . . . . Or at least the latest version of the truth according to humans. The multitude of religions is a perfect example. We humans have merely created all kinds of bogus religions in order to better suit our needs, but it does not change THE truth! It us sadly funny how, in your humanistic view, you think annialation of everyone who disagrees with God is the only option. THE truth is, when exposed to the light, those who reject Him will wish for annialation after it's too late, which is the eternal separation from God that they have CHOOSEN in the here and now!</comment>

<comment>You cannot refer to me as your friend without lying.Couching expressions of your hate in flowery words and attributing them to your "God" is both deeply dishonest and cowardly.When are you going to wake up to the fact that the majority of LGBT have walked out of your religion in despair and disgust at the treatment they receive from the likes of you?When are you going to wake up to the reality that not only have you driven them out, but you continue to argue and rant and rave about them despite the fact that they are not of your religion and are most unlikely ever to return to it?When are you going to actually start addressing the mess within your own communities instead of endlessly arguing about a small community that you are not a part of and who has absolutely no interest in being a part of your community?This whole issue revolves around the fact that your doctrine does not accommodate LGBT, but you have built civilizations and nations with constitutional frameworks that are incapable of doing anything other than accommodating everyone.You are hoist by your own petard, and you are arguing among yourselves about that fact.The only way you can get your way in society is to totally dismantle civil society and rebuild it from scratch.Your only alternative is to alter your doctrinal approach to LGBT.Change the state or change the church.Nasty pickle you are in, especially when you consider just how many non LGBT have abandoned the hate of the churches and will not support any attempt to dismantle the state.Arguing among yourselves about the gays will change nothing, it will achieve nothing. They have no obligation whatsoever to bestow you with any form of authority over them. They have no obligation to sacrifice themselves to save you the bother of addressing the cock ups in your philosophical mess.You are stuck in a shrinking vortex, spiraling in towards nothing.Arguing about the gays will get you nothing.</comment>

<comment>Sorry my friend, but is YOU who is "deeply dishonest and cowardly." One cannot pretend to be without fault and to actually care about others while demanding the church "change doctrine" to meet the demands of sinful humans. Even the idea that we cannot be friends who respectfully disagree about LGBT behaviors indicates you have no real desire to seek reconciliation. In your mind, you are convinced that you know better than anyone else, including God, what it means for us humans to love one another. True love speaks the truth to those we care about. True love does not encourage behavioral choices that inherently harm the inner most being of a person and their relationship with God. The church seeks to discover God's direction for each of us. Have we always done so properly? No. Have we failed to "love others as ourselves?" Of course! But twisting His Word and adjusting doctrine to meet the selfish desires of humans is "deeply dishonest and cowardly," yet what we sinners have always tried to do. Until each of us admits we are by nature, self-serving and therefore sinful, we are doomed. You are indeed right about one thing. We can either "change the state or change the church." Sadly, because we are human, we cannot change God's church, so the state will have to change. Unfortunately, the reality is, we will not do that either, because of those in rebellion against God, so we are left to pray for each other, including our enemies, as we wait for Christ to return. Good luck with your gospel of hate, which is actually a position founded solely in opposition to God. I will pray for you, my friend.</comment>

<comment>Nowhere have I ever "pretended" to be without fault.Careful about bearing false witness. I am human, all humanity is deeply flawed.If you disagree with "LGBT behaviors" then don't do "LGBT behaviors". Nobody is forcing you to engage in "LGBT behaviors".Your choice not to engage in "LGBT behaviors" is a choice that only pertains to yourself. You can choose anything you like, but your personal behavioral choices cannot be foisted on others and imposed as mandatory.If you seek to take dominion over the lives of LGBT who do not disagree with "LGBT behaviors", then you will meet extremely stiff resistance, and you will fail.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you feel the same way about other sexually deviant and criminal behaviors too . . . Otherwise you're just a hypocrite!</comment>

<comment>Boy, you and Fox News Jesus really hate anal sex. I know enough about your religion to know that when you take your own laws and call them God's by claiming they are unchangeable and from the Almighty, you commit grievous sin. You are a goat. And, I suspect at the last judgement you shall be screaming and frothing at Jesus as you plunge into the lake of fire. Your law is sin. Your life is sin. Your criminal assumptions that you enact God's will shall lead whatever God exists to exterminate you from the face of creation. Quite frankly no one cares. Scream and vomit and scream and yell and scream and tell us how gays are so terrible. The more you barf out, the more your life becomes worthless. The population of North America has forsaken you and your criminal intent. You are nothing but a criminal. Your religion is a crime. Your beliefs are a joke and worth nothing. And the sole reason you are trash is because you actually worship a God who commanded you to love people, and instead you have done the opposite. The greatness of your sin against this God is monstrous.Why are you bothering even discussing this anyway. Gays have left your filthy satanic churches. You can do nothing now to harm those who have left. You have lost your power and it has left you sitting in a pile of your own shit screaming and rocking back and forth, vomit spraying from your worthless mouth. Go kill yourself and make everyone happy.But, for you filthy conservatives, here is a warning. Your God has a millstone prepared for you. And, if you harm any of your young people who have not yet escaped your grasp, your fate shall be terrible indeed.</comment>

<comment>Your hate is out of control . . . Again, "Get the behind me Satan!"</comment>

<comment>No one can truly hate someone that they do not know.  They may be against what the other stands for and may even hate their judgmental words and accusatory style of writing (as I feel toward yours).   But that is not hating the person.   I certainly do not hate you (nor anyone for that matter) but I greatly disagree with your point of view and think you are not only in error but are extremely bigoted;   you are consistently hateful and accusatory to conservative Christians who just happen to believe what the Bible reveals.  And the Bible DOES clearly and consistently reveal that homosexual behavior is a sin.   Your online habit of accusing people like me (who simply believe the scriptures)  of being hateful and homophobic is absurd and its motive is quite transparent.   You see, you probably believe that if you can convince people that traditional Christian doctrines are wrong and that those who hold to them are evil, then you can make progress in pushing (as in “pusher”)  your pansexual agenda (sexolatry) on our culture.   If you can sway more churches to become like the Episcopal Church, then you make progress.   Of course, for traditional, orthodox believers like me, this is not progress at all but rather is regression into the moral sewer.   http://www.virtueonline.org/st...</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you have no idea how the last sentence of this comment tells the rest of us who you really are and whose you are. Seek the One True God and He will find you. Flee from Satan while you can.</comment>

<comment>Even all the other religions are not anti-Christ as you Westboro homophobes. So sad of your poor choice of religion.</comment>

<comment>You might want to study the doctrine of The Trinity a bit, Fred, and look at the specific context for his discussion of marriage - in a 1st Century Roman/Jewish setting, marriage could ONLY be between a man and a woman due to the various civil laws concerning inheritance, household leadership, and the relative roles of men and women....</comment>

<comment>And you think I need to study up? My dear friend, God is no respecter of man, nor his laws. Good try though!</comment>

<comment>"homosexuality" is not addressed in Holy Scripture, fred. Sorry, you are mistaken.</comment>

<comment>Seriously? Have you even read the Bible. It's one thing to be silly enough to claim Jesus didn't speak directly about the subject, but to claim the Bible doesn't address it takes "a special kind of stupid!" </comment>

<comment>I'm a biblical scholar, a Southern Baptist-trained theologian, pastor, minister, teacher, preacher. You couldn't pull faux-wool over my eyes, even if you dressed as Superman while trying to do so.</comment>

<comment>I am reminded of that famous line from the Will Smith classic, INDEPENDENCE DAY, when the President's wife is dying and he tells her she's gonna be fine. The First Lady responds with a smile and says, "La, la, la, liar."</comment>

<comment>Goofy.</comment>

<comment>Indeed . . . It's goofy of you to make such outlandish claims! </comment>

<comment>What I have posted here, fred, is based on sound premises, sound arguments, sound conclusions of Christian Ethicists from all mainline Trinitarian Christian seminaries, divinity schools, and theological colleges, on both sides of the Atlantic.Time for you to catch up... on the last 30-40 years of scholarship and ethical reasoning within the faith traditions of Judaism and Christianity, fred.  Time to leave Bedrock behind.</comment>

<comment>God doesn't really care about your, human "scholarship and ethical reasoning" and they certainly have nothing in common with "the faith traditions of Judaism and Christianity." But you keep deceiving yourself my friend! It is a choice you make, much like the choices we all make when it comes to who we have sex with. Even some pedophiles and criminals claim they were "born this way," but it doesn't change the truth about the behavior!</comment>

<comment>Criminal behaviour and sexual orientation, fred (from Bedrock?) are mutually exclusive things.Who you may have had sex with before you were married wasn't related to your sexual orientation, fred, but your choice to be irresponsible or promiscuous with reference to behaviour, activity.  Sexual orientation is not behaviour; it is not activity.  I'm really sorry for your confusion and mistaken-ness.Let me ask, do you claim to follow Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour?  Your behaviour here prompts me to question your faithfulness in doing so.By the way, God called me and led me to pursue theological education-- so that I could be best prepared to lead the church, on the one hand, and the unethical, immoral treatment of our faithful, Christian LGBT sisters and brothers, on the other. That you seem not to understand that prompts me to question your Christian education-- day in day out, week in week out, month in month out, year in year out, decade in decade out.All but one Jewish 'denomination' and all mainline Christian denominations accept as true and proper what I have posted here with regard to the creation and care of God's LGBT children.  You, fred, are out of step with what is clearly the movement of the Holy Spirit over the last 40-50 years.Sexual orientation is not a choice.  It is scientifically proven to be inborn.  About this there is no longer any doubt.  Catch up, fred.  Join us in the 21st century, please, for Christ's sake.</comment>

<comment>As a social scientist myself who keeps  up on these things, I must say that you are in serious error about the science regarding homosexuality.  .  Research study after research study show no genetic markers for same-sex attraction and likewise it has been abundantly proven to be changeable in a large proportion of people so afflicted.  Just a small sample of the data is summarized here:http://www.mercatornet.com/art...http://blog.godreports.com/201...You are even in more serious error about the theology and anthropology associated with these issues.   Remember, until this most recent half-century,homosexual behavior was regarded as abnormal and even a crime everywhere on this earth, and this throughout all of recorded history.  Even the Romans, where it was relatively common, made it against the law.   Look it up.Theologically, there is a difference between temptation and sin.   The sexual attraction for another person not one's opposite sex spouse is called temptation.  If you obsess and fantasize, it becomes lust (a sin, Jesus proclaimed), and most certainly if  you act out this desire it becomes blatant sin.  It is true that temptation is not a choice and everyone is tempted in different ways (even Jesus was so tempted); but what you do with that temptation IS a choice.  Behavior is always a choice.  Fortunately, due to Jesus' sacrificial  death on the Cross, with repentance and faith, sin can be forgiven and the sinner can be transformed.  There is Holy Spirit power available to change homosexuals into heterosexuals and I am witness to many such cases.In 2nd Timothy 3, Paul warns that in the last days, many religious people will have  “a form of godliness but denying its power.”   Surely he is referring to denying the power of the Holy Spirit working in and through believers.  It is the Holy Spirit who transforms us into sanctified children of God.Your typical LGBTQ talking points are based on neither rationality, nor scientific facts, nor sound theological doctrine.  Your words go far afield when you compare them to what the scriptures reveal.    You may call yourself a minister but you have shown yourself here to be grossly deceived and because you promote these heresies, you are a false shepherd.  Both Jesus and Paul had some strong words of condemnation about such as you--- anathema to preachers of "another gospel."</comment>

<comment>It's fine to have and hold an opinion, Bruce.  But one may not offer it as fact unless one is able to back it up with sound premise, argument, conclusion.  The things you cite are out of date.  It's only in the last 50-60 years that medical professionals and other scientists have bothered to seriously study sexual orientation (not "attraction". Stop with the "attraction" game, Bruce, please).  All medical and scientific professional associations not consider human sexual orientation to have always included those who are not heterosexual.  It is established practice to consider those who flaunt stuff like you flaunt here, if they claim to be scientists, as unethical.  You have not kept up, Bruce.  You are behind.  Get thee from behind, Bruce.</comment>

<comment>Modern up to date scientific research is with me on this, taisegoose.  You are the one who is behind the times.  Of course the LGBT lobby will say otherwise, but there is no science to support it and absolutely no scripture or Christian tradition to support it.  Show me the research ...  and I will show you more which refute it. </comment>

<comment>Our tausegoosed friend likes pretending to care about truth, and even claims to be a trained Biblical scholar. It doesn't really matter which lie he promotes today, the truth of God doesn't change with the scientific "flavor of the day." Homosexuality, and ALL strings LGBT, were, are and will continue to be immoral.</comment>

<comment>The commandment "To love thy neighbor AS THYSELF" and the Golden rule are not suggestions written in the bible, but they are the LAW, the highest set of laws of the entire bible that Followers of Christ obey and do to have eternal life. Congrats to all gay couple exchanging marriage vows to love one another in all circumstances of life till death to them part, this is how the Great Commandment is fulfilled when we stay in a faithful relationship with our partner and treat all other people around us as what we would want them to treat us. To love God means to love thy neighbor as thyself, by doing unto others as what we would want others to do unto us. Other religions also preach similar rule of karma (do good reap good, do bad read bad), empathy, compassion, mercy, live and let live, etc...Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.John 13:35 "By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Homophobes who profess to be religious, and use words not from Christ but from Moses and Paul, to lie and deceive to justify why they will not follow the LAW, will be condemned and will NOT have eternal life. There's no such thing as Christian homophobe, discrimination and hate are NOT values of Christ. And that's why homophobes will continually lose again and again when they defy the LAW, the highest law of the entire bible.When homophobes disobey the LAW, they have hated Christ, and Christ doesn't know them.John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.Matthew 7:21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’Homophobes will all perish and will not have eternal life for failing to do the will of the Father(Great Commandment - He and the Father are one), for the wages of the mortal sin is death.</comment>

<comment>You have no idea what love is my friend. Seek and find Him!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, I have no idea that discrimination is actually "love" to your Westboro cult. So sad of what you believe in, and to hate Christ so much.John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>"abnormal and even a crime everywhere on this earth, and this throughout all of recorded history"That simply, quite simply, isn't so.  Even some places in the Western Church same sex relationships were recognised as acceptable and blessed by the Church.  In Europe alone- never mind in many other places on the globe-- same sex relationships have been accepted and not accepted like an uneven pendulum swing.  There is no longer any need for the pendulum to move, at all.  In God's created order-- order, Bruce, order-- we have always have non-heterosexual sisters and brother in the human community.  Always.  The gene pool, our worldwide DNA pool, has ALWAYS included those who would not turn out to be opposite sex oriented (not "attracted").  Always, Bruce.  Scientific fact.  Can't be denied.</comment>

<comment>I can indeed deny it with scientific data and anthropological  history.  Prove I am wrong.   Your opinion means nothing.</comment>

<comment>And marriage is not a theological category, Bruce.  It is a human social construct, a construct that has never been monolithic throughout human history.Marriage and sexual orientation are not-- I repeat, not!-- related to the Church Universal, neither the Western or Eastern Mother Churches nor any expression of Protestant/Reformed Churches.  Never have been, never will be.Marriage is taken for granted within Holy Scripture, not "ordained", created, regulated, monitored, etc., by God, Moses, the prophets, Jesus, the Church.You remain uninformed, to be perfectly polite about the matter.  Grossly mistaken to be truthful.</comment>

<comment>Sexual orientation is not related to "lust".  Some who lust-- biblical definition of lust- to desire (property) that does not belong (property law) to the one who wants what is not his-- fall into behaviour or activity that is immoral, unethical, illegal, yes.  But that is not related to theology.  The composers/compilers of the Torah were concerned that the property of Hebrew males be protected from other Hebrew males.  See Genesis 38, Er, Onan and Sherah and Co.  This is ancient Hebrew property law in action.  Not marriage as we understand it today and not anything to do with the sexual orientation of Hebrew males then or humans today, of any sort, creed, nationality, ethnicity, tribe, clan, etc.</comment>

<comment>Sexual orientation is not related to "sin".  Period.  How many more times must this very soft rubber toy hammer pound upon your brow?</comment>

<comment>"power available to change homosexuals into heterosexuals"No.  Not at all.  Some people who fell into the habit of having same sex (either initially promiscuous, adult-to-child, experimental, as in young adults, or otherwise) copulationary relationships may find that they are not homosexual, not oriented to the same sex.Conversely, thousands upon countless thousands of people who married young, raised and family and grew into middle age have discovered that they are, in fact, not heterosexual.  Common as tornadoes in the Midwest, Bruce.By God's design, by God's will, by God's order in Creation, Bruce, we have sisters and brothers who are not heterosexual, never have been heterosexual, never will be heterosexual, can't be changed-- by the power of abusive peer pressure-- from non-heterosexual orientation to opposite sex orientation.  Can't happen.  Doesn't happen.Orientation is not behaviour, not related to behaviour.  People may change their behaviour.  They cannot change the orientation with which God has blessed them.  You are mistaken, Bruce.  So mistaken that you run the risk of committing the unpardonable sin-- calling something God has created that which God has not created.  See St Mark 3.20-30 </comment>

<comment>"sanctified children of God"  have always included those who were not, are not and will not, when they grow into adulthood and engage in adult relationships, be heterosexual, Bruce.  You must understand this.</comment>

<comment>"the scriptures reveal" nothing, not one single, solitary thing, about human sexual orientation.  Christian Social Ethics does and has done for the last 30-40 years.</comment>

<comment>"these heresies"  You are so far off base, Bruce.  I'm afraid you are not even aware of the patristic definition of "heresy".Biology is not a subject about which we may say it is heretical.  All branches of science are agreed that human sexual orientation is inclusive of those who are not-- and cannot be made to be-- heterosexual.  Science deals in facts.  Heresy has nothing to do with biology, social anthropology, sociology, psychology, etc.  Sorry, Bruce, but you are mistaken.  Sorely and sadly so.</comment>

<comment>"you are a false shepherd"Anathema"gospel"has not one thing to do with human sexual orientation.  </comment>

<comment>mercatornet:"Science has been enlisted to depathologize homosexuality in so far as it can lend credence to the assertion that homosexuality is an immutable condition. The immutability issue is as irrelevant to the moral nature of homosexual behavior as it is to alcoholic behavior. Alcoholics, by definition, are alcoholics for life. If they wish to remain sober, they may never drink again."I taught both Introduction to Philosophy and Introduction to Logic, as well as Critical Thinking at the undergraduate level, Bruce.  That paragraph is chock full of logical fallacy and uncritical thinking.  If it were printed on soft enough paper, I'd blow my nose on it and dispose of it....</comment>

<comment>godreports:Rebuttal:http://health.spectator.co.uk/..."Dr Whitehead’s ‘findings’ are being tossed around in a pool of counterknowledge, bogus information dressed up to look like fact. What I find fascinating about counterknowledge is that its raw material – conspiracy theories, urban myth, fake history and fake science – spreads from one marginalised community to another, even though those communities may despise each other. Conservative Muslims, Jews and Christians want to believe that homosexuality is environmental, because if it’s genetic that makes it difficult to justify their belief that it’s sinful. As soon as they find a study that reinforces their worldview, they jump on it, without asking too many questions about its methodology."</comment>

<comment>https://www.newscientist.com/a...http://journals.cambridge.org/...</comment>

<comment>"If it is genetic that makes it difficult to justify their belief that it's sinful?" Not even close to the truth! Birth defects of all types are a result of sin, so even IF there was ever any actual evidence that all LGBT behaviors were genetic (they aren't, they're learned behavior as is ALL sexuality)  the reality is the behaviors would continue to be sinful. But putting sexual CHOICES in the same box as actual birth defects is an insult to those with true birth defects.</comment>

<comment>So if birth defects of all types are a result of sin, why don't you put discrimination laws unto those who are physically challenged, and those with autism ? Why only pick on gays who you judge wrongly for you to do wicked things unto them as what you would NOT want others to do unto you ?Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAWw and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>Ignorance at its finest . . . FYI fool, we have a lot of laws that "discriminate" against other birth defects . . . We don't allow blind people to drive, restrict the ability of the cognitively impaired to sign contracts and more. You can't really be that dumb . . . Oh wait, yes you can and do CHOOSE to be that dumb!</comment>

<comment>Those laws are not called discrimination as if we allow them, they will cause HARM UNTO OTHERS as what we would not want others to do unto us. I'm only referring to discrimination laws as in marriage!You Westboro homophobes indeed have no sense to know what is wrong nor right, and too dumb to realize how you are swine who don't know what are pearls, and dogs who don't know what is sacred.You can continue to lie and deny of your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia and bigotry as much as you want to deceive yourself and some, but you can never deceive all nor Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. I'm only here to expose you of your wickedness.Ephesians 5:11  Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.Good night, I'll reply ALL of your comments tomorrow, if any.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Galatians 5:14  - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”</comment>

<comment>Now you're getting the picture! All you have to do now is move past the point where you think YOU get to decide what cause harm and what doesn't. Seek God and His will and you too can have life!</comment>

<comment>Good night, I'll reply ALL of your comments tomorrow. Meanwhile go and repent if you are NOT a swine who don't know what are pearls, dogs who don't know what is sacred.Dear homophobes, when you choose to defy the LAW, the Great Commandment, the highest law of the entire bible that give eternal life, you have committed the mortal sin when you embrace discrimination and hate as good to ill treat others, just as the Sodomites did, to demonstrate their hatred towards people they didn't like to not welcome, by sexually raping them. Homophobes will all be condemned when you choose to defy the teachings of Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, to celebrate the sin of hate and the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman, for the wages of the mortal sin is death.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;And no amount of grace nor faith nor apple polishing can save you when you have done evil deeds of the mortal sin of hate.James 2:17-18 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.Congrats to all gay couple exchanging marriage vows to love one another in all circumstances of life till death to them part, this is how the LAW, the Great Commandment is fulfilled when we stay in a faithful relationship with our partner and treat all other people around us as what we would want them to treat us. To love God means to love thy neighbor as thyself, by doing unto others as what we would want others to do unto us. Other religions also preach similar rule of karma (do good reap good, do bad read bad), empathy, compassion, mercy, live and let live, etc...Only some anti-Christ fools will still try to reply and argue why they should defy the highest law of the entire bible by using words not from Christ, but from the other apostles. And anti-Christ  fools like rapists to use the misinterpreted passage of such sex criminal to leave his parent's house to then be in one flesh with his victims as male and female.</comment>

<comment>Good night, I'll reply ALL of your comments tomorrow.</comment>

<comment>Don't bother until you consult the One True God my friend! </comment>

<comment>I don't follow your homophobic god who is NOT Christ.I'll reply ALL of your comments tomorrow, promise.Good night, go and repent of your anti-Christ lifestyle.</comment>

<comment>Sorry my friend, it is your homomaniac god who is not Christ!</comment>

<comment>So when I follow the LAW, the Great Commandment, to you this guys who preached that is not Christ ?So tell me what you homophobic god tells you to do in his "LAW" or "Great Commandment" ?</comment>

<comment>Unlike you, I will not pretend to know you anymore than you expose yourself to me. I know you're a fool. Other than that, I know it is not love when we encourage others to sin.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, it's not love that you have when your actions of what you do is to legislate laws of hatred towards gays who you judge WRONGLY, and worse still you encourage others with such laws to celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman.You are the fool, and you are so angry that I've exposed you against the words of Christ of your wicked and evil deeds.</comment>

<comment>Sure, because real love supports the sins of those we care about. Thanks for clarifying your position and setting me straight. (No pun intended!)</comment>

<comment>Indeed, your real "love" support the sins of those we care about, that's why you put laws against gays who you "love" so much only to make you celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman !Good luck with your "love"!</comment>

<comment>Even the verse of John 3:16 shows how you religious homophobes are condemned again and will not be saved, when you have failed to believe in Him to not follow His commandment in action of good deeds, but of wickedness when you homophobes have put discrimination laws of hate unto gays who you have judged wrongly.You religious homophobes think that believing in Christ means only having faith and that you will be saved by grace, apple polishing to sing praises and trance dance with rap songs in tongues. But when you homophobes have disobeyed Christ to judge gays wrongly (for a sin that even Christ never condemned as a gay couple loving each other faithfully is not against the LAW), condemned and hate them with discrimination laws to physically harm gays, you homophobes have demonstrated your hate towards Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm.James 2:17-18 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</comment>

<comment>Again, your repetitious and hateful accusations of homophobia for people you do not even know is not only very wrong but has obvious motives.  You have no better arguments than name calling.  Because of your constant ad hominems (look it up), all your comments should be deleted by the Moderator.</comment>

<comment>When you choose a lifestyle of homophobia, you do not bear the fruit of Christ as you have adopted the Westboro doctrine to not believe in Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm.Your actions of what you do, speak louder than your continual words of lies, denials and foolishness.You only attack me with ad hominems as you got nothing from the Bible of the words of Christ to defend your lifestyle of hypocrisy to be doing everything that Christ said NOT to do.If you want respect, you have to earn it from what you did and continue to do rather in your actions to judge gays wrongly, and to have casted the 1st stone to condemn them with discrimination laws of hate to physically harm them.Indeed you are so wishing to be the moderator as you want to delete my comments or block me, which is consistent in what you anti-Christ homophobes love to do : to do wicked things unto others as what you would NOT want others to do unto you.Thanks again for showing to the world how you are a so-called "Christian, psychologist, theologian, teacher, mentor", as nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing, putting lies after lies because you have been shamed and exposed of who you are against the words of Christ.No matter how hard you keep trying over and over again to justify your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia to defy the LAW, for you to put discrimination and hatred as good unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, you will always fail and lose.You can continue to lie and deny of your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia and bigotry as much as you want to deceive yourself and some, but you can never deceive all nor Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. I'm only here to expose you of your wickedness.Ephesians 5:11  Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.</comment>

<comment>I know what homophobia is and what it looks like.  I do not hear anyone posting on this website indicating any symptoms of it.  I certainly have neither hatred nor fear of homosexuals (nor of homosexuality).I simply believe what I read in the scriptures, and I have had extensive training in the interpretation of Holy Scripture.  The Bible is quite clear:   Genesis 18-19 (Sodom and Gomorrah, which as Jude 1:7 indicates is not just about hospitality), Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 20:13, Deuteronomy 23:18, Romans 1:27-28  and 1 Corinthians 6:9-1.   Furthermore, there are NO scriptures indicating that homosexual behavior is OK or that same sex marriage is an option.   </comment>

<comment>You homophobes have another irrational fear of being called homophobes, and that's why you bury your head in the sand to try to deny that word of its existence and to deny yourselves of who you are. But let's see what a couple of official dictionaries as used in all educated societies says :Merriam-webster dictionaryhomophobe : a person who hates or is afraid of homosexuals or treats them badlyOxford Dictionarieshomophobe : a person with an extreme and irrational aversion to homosexuality and homosexual peopleIf you homophobes had left your westboro cult so that you can get some proper education to rehabilitate your brainwashed knowledge, you would have learned more things to be a better person. You have to put so many laws to 'protect' your fear of gays on your 'religious freedom', plus you have the fear of being called of who you are as homophobe bigot.When you choose a lifestyle of homophobia to defy the LAW, the Great Commandment, the highest law of the entire bible that give eternal life, you have committed the mortal sin when you embrace discrimination and hate as good to ill treat others, just as the Sodomites did, to demonstrate their hatred towards people they didn't like to not welcome, by sexually raping them. Homophobes will all be condemned when you choose to defy the teachings of Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, to celebrate the sin of hate and the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman, for the wages of the mortal sin is death.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;And no amount of grace nor faith nor apple polishing can save you when you have done evil deeds of the mortal sin of hate.James 2:17-18 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.Congrats to all gay couple exchanging marriage vows to love one another in all circumstances of life till death to them part, this is how the LAW, the Great Commandment is fulfilled when we stay in a faithful relationship with our partner and treat all other people around us as what we would want them to treat us. To love God means to love thy neighbor as thyself, by doing unto others as what we would want others to do unto us. Other religions also preach similar rule of karma (do good reap good, do bad read bad), empathy, compassion, mercy, live and let live, etc...Only some anti-Christ fools will still try to reply and argue why they should defy the highest law of the entire bible by using words not from Christ, but from the other apostles. And anti-Christ  fools like rapists to use the misinterpreted passage of such sex criminal to leave his parent's house to then be in one flesh with his victims as male and female.</comment>

<comment>It is not fred who needs to 'catch up' on the science but you.  Sexual orientation has absolutely NOT be been proven to be inborn.   That is a rather extreme lie.  No studies have proven this and many studies have been done that show that have failed to show that it is genetic, especially identical twin studies where one turns out homosexual and the other heterosexual.   I had twin friends (boys) in my youth and one ended up going one way and the other, the other.  Whatever the reasons, they were not genetic.</comment>

<comment>So many lies and so little time. Let me only address three for now.First, the is absolutely no truth to your claim that science has proven sexuality us inborn. At best, bad science uses bias anecdotal conclusions to promote the concept . The truth is actually worse. There is no such thing as sexual orientation apart from what one chooses, exactly the same as with criminal behavior! You choose what you do and then make the excuse of, "I can't help myself, because I'm born this way!" I will grant you one thing. Whether sexual deviancy or criminal activity, there is often a psychological aspect that contributes to the behavior! Additionally, and this is the biggest factor, the environment a person lives in makes a big difference. Raised in an environment that either tolerates or promotes sexually or criminally immoral behavior, everyone is more likely to follow such. THAT in no way makes the choices innate nor acceptable!Second, the lie that all mainline Christian and Jewish churches agree with your position is laughable. Indeed, SOME humans of nearly every religion have fallen victim to the LGBT lies, but all that proves is Satan's reach knows no bounds. God is the same today, as He was yesterday and will be tomorrow. He does not redefine sin in order to accommodate human desires.And finally, your insistence that my treatment of your LGBT friends is somehow unethical and/or immoral is typical twisting of the truth. Because I love as God loves, I refuse to lie to people just to make them feel better about themselves. I could remind you how Jesus responded to the apostle challenging Him, when He said to the apostle, "Get thee behind me Satan!" Was Jesus being hateful and intolerant (or immoral and unethical?) But I will also mention when Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well, the prostitute about to be stoned by the crowd and others, he told them the truth and then sad, "Go, and sin no more." He did not say, "Go, enjoy your sin and we'll change the rules and pretend your sin has magically become a non-sin." And I will most assuredly follow Him, rather than Satan and his minions.Continue to claim you are a trained theologeon. Just know the truth remains the truth, regardless of our sinful desires.</comment>

<comment>http://journals.cambridge.org/...https://www.newscientist.com/a...Scientific verification.Sexual orientation is not a "choice".</comment>

<comment>Re-read the reference you present as evidence. The second sentence tells you there are conflicts with other studies. More importantly, there is no evidence of causation presented. I readily admit people can be born with traits generally attributed to the opposite sex, but it is the environment such persons are in that determines how those traits manifest in our lives. We ALL make the decision regarding the direction we go and are 100% responsible for the behaviors we choose to have. We expect sociopaths to control their behavior and we should expect the same from those suffering sexual dysfunction too. Sadly instead, good people are manipulated into thinking we cannot control our behavior. </comment>

<comment>"God is the same today, as He was yesterday and will be tomorrow."A theological tenet which I choose to use in order to make the case for God making/creating non-heterosexual children since the beginning.  Always has done so.  Always will do so.  God gives us sisters and brothers who are not heterosexual.  Simple as pie, fred.Sexual orientation is not "sin".  It's biology.  Period.  Nothing whatsoever to do with "sin", morality, etc.</comment>

<comment>God cannot stand against Himself. Seek Him and He will show you His truth.</comment>

<comment>"Because I love as God loves"If you did so, fred, we wouldn't be in opposition here.</comment>

<comment>That assumes YOU are with God, but the truth is, your words place the creation over the Creator. So you and I are not in opposition. YOU are simply in opposition to God! I am on your side and only want to see you in Heaven with me. I would never judge you and claim you can't be there too!</comment>

<comment>"how Jesus responded"To the money changers, the "sacrificial" animal sellers, and their animals?  He drove them from the place YHWH had made for them-- foreigners and eunuchs-- in the Courts of the Gentiles, an episode from the ministry of Jesus recorded in all four gospels, fred.  Jesus re-made, re-opened, space for the sexual minority of his day.  He quoted directly, evidently, from Isaiah 56.1-8, where the eunuchs who had already been accepted by the people of God in Exile were assured of a place and name 'better than son or daughter' back in Jerusalem/Judah.Read it and rejoice, fred.  Catch up, brother!!!  :-)</comment>

<comment>Yet another lie my friend. I challenge you to find anyplace in scripture that says a eunuch is a homosexual! A eunuch is generally a "defective" male, and often unable to "perform" as a typical man, but was usually castrated. However, he indeed might be a homosexual, but even then, it was not from God. As with all birth defects, it was the result of man's sinful nature. During Biblical times, he was not even allow to be in the "church" according to Mosaic law. Yet another attempt to manipulate scripture to meet your desires!</comment>

<comment>BTW, the Isaiah passage you quote simply tells us that, regardless of our past, we can all be forgiven if we follow His covenant . . . But the bigger message of the OT is that we cannot do so. We cannot even keep the Sabath my friend!</comment>

<comment>"the truth remains the truth"oh, I'm confident of this, fred.  The truth is that God has always had children who are not heterosexual.  And we straight folk are not at liberty to tell them they may not court, fall in love, love, get married/partnered, raise a family, grow old together, etc., etc., etc.  Catch up, fred.  See the Light!!!</comment>

<comment>Sorry my friend, but God clearly tells us homosexuality is an abomination. That truth will never change!</comment>

<comment>"God clearly tells us homosexuality is an abomination"Who is "us"?How do you think God "told" (said?) this:  "homosexuality is an abomination"?Where did God do this?When did God do this?With whom did God do this?How did God do this?Why do you think God would have done this?Could you kindly point out how you came to think, feel, "believe" this, thanks?Would you mind offering a definition of 'abomination' as you understand it, please, thanks?</comment>

<comment>Seriously? I thought you were a trained Biblical scholar!</comment>

<comment>Seriously.  Always have been serious about the Bible, Holy Scripture, the word of God.  Absolutely.  I ask you because I am certain that you are not.  But I was hoping that I could get confirmation from answers to the questions I raised.</comment>

<comment>Sure you are cupcake. The simple fact that you are implying the Bible isn't clear about homosexuality being a sin tells me you're not serious. Not to mention how many times marriage is defined as being between one man and one woman. I can only pray for God to soften your heart and open your mind to His truth.</comment>

<comment>"I can only pray for God to soften your heart and open your mind to His truth."Our prayers are identical.Humanity, as a whole, has only just begun to learn about human sexual orientation over the last 50-60 years, fred.  So it's impossible to read misunderstandings prior to 1955 CE or limited understandings ever since then into Holy Scripture.  Similarly, you can't take an Airbus or a 777 to Canaan, ca 1700 BCE.  It's impossible.Marriage is assumed in Holy Scripture, not "defined".  Never defined.  Lots of snapshots of lots of kinds of marriages, of the Hebrew people alone, and others.  But no definition.  Marriage, as we generally think about it nowadays, is a Victorian fabrication.  Not biblical by any means.In the Bible the coupling together of two pre-teens was done by the fathers of the pre-teens, without their consent, consultation, knowledge, acceptance, etc.  That's the biblical truth.  That what all Hebrew men and all Hebrew boys of a certain age expected in their society.That is not where we live.  And that simply. does. not. need. to. be. said.  or. explained.  Catch up, fred (from Bedrock? or talk to Barney about it.)</comment>

<comment>fred, for good measure:"God clearly tells us homosexuality is an abomination"Who is "us"?How do you think God "told" (said?) this: "homosexuality is an abomination"?Where did God do this?When did God do this?With whom did God do this?How did God do this?Why do you think God would have done this?Could you kindly point out how you came to think, feel, "believe" this, thanks?Would you mind offering a definition of 'abomination' as you understand it, please, thanks?</comment>

<comment>So you're one of those who, rather than seek the true message of the Bible, prefer to claim everything in it must be God approved? Slavery is in there, so slavery is good. Lot's daughters got pregnant from him, so incest is good. Polygamy is written, so it is good. And of course, my favorite, David, a "man after God's own heart," committed both murder AND adultery, so those have to be good also. Oh wait, that doesn't line up with your liberal agenda, so YOU get to decide what is and is not actually in there. Sorry my friend, but not only did God say homosexuality IS dteatable, He/Jesus clearly defines marriage. It's cute how you claim to be learned regarding the Bible, yet it is so obvious you seek your "truth" in the Good Book, without concern for what it actually says. It is sad that you think right and wrong have anything to do with "where we live."</comment>

<comment>fred,I see that you can't be bothered to answer the sort of questions that any Bible 101 undergraduate student would be asked to answer by their conservative evangelical college/university professor.Since 1991 I have taught students of all ages, 18+ - 70+, in many higher education and further education settings.  All of them would have been able, with their peers, to answer all the questions I posed to you, twice.  C'mob, fred, you're not shy.  Boldly go, man.  Catch up with the class.  Please, thanks.A.  Slavery is always wrong.  It is against God's revealed will.B.  Incest is always wrong.  It is against the law in every society I know of.C.  Polygamy is not accepted by Jews or Christians, on ethical, practical grounds, not theological or religious grounds; Islam and the Church of Jesus Christ, Latter Day Saints both still allow polygamy (for different reasons, perhaps) and they do so based on the same culture represented in the Hebrew Bible at certain periods of history.  Polygamy may be good in some circumstances; see Isaiah 4.1 **D.  Murder is always illegal.  When people are found guilty of murder they serve time in prison (in civilised countries) or they go on "death row" (in uncivilised countries).E.  Adultery is always harmful to human societies.  Some couples survive the immoral behaviour and some do not.F.  Jesus did not "define" marriage.  Period.  It is ridiculous to make such a comment.fred, "homosexuality" is not in the Bible.  "Homosexuality" is not addressed in Holy Scripture.  The word of God does not have one recorded jot/iota or tittle about "homosexuality".  It is impossible to claim that "homosexuality" is in the Bible.  The Bible notes that some heathens, pagans, worshipers of other gods may have had some religious ritual that involved the mixing of human 'seed' (seminal fluid, semen, sperm) with human fecal matter.  This may have been an ancient idea associated with animistic "beliefs", following the agricultural religions of the city-states which were neighbours to Israel/Judah.  St Paul makes a reference that is not dissimilar-- those who were Greek or Roman god worshipers may have engaged in copulatory acts as part of a religious ritual outside of Judaism of Christianity in the first century.  In both instances, the 'abomination'/'detestation' is related to idolatry.  It is not related to human sexual orientation.  In fact, the Jews understood that all humans were naturally opposite sex attracted (they knew nothing of orientation), so that means that the men the composer of Leviticus pictured, and the men St Paul pictured, were, indeed, assumed to be naturally opposite sex attracted, and only did these rituals-of-a-reigious nature outside the home, in temples.  Then they went back home to their wives."you claim to be learned regarding the Bible"No.  I need not make such a claim, when I exemplify my knowledge and understanding here, post in and post out, without fail.  You on the other hand only pronounce common misunderstanding.  When challenged, you refuse to answer."you seek your "truth""No.  I apply the art and science of exegesis and hermeneutic to Holy Scripture.  You seem to not know of these tools.  Shame."what it (the Bible) actually says"I both read and understand the Bible.  I.e., I know what it means, not only how to state the words from a lectern, pulpit, or teaching platform."you think right and wrong have anything to do with "where we live.""What is "right and wrong" (legal/illegal, ethical/unethical, moral/immoral) depends on where one lives.  This has always been the case.  For example, none of the Mosaic law applies to Christians.  Noahide law*** applies, as far as Jews are concerned-- and St Paul stated this clearly in his letters, to all gentiles, among whom we Christians number.**Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying,“We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes;just let us be called by your name;    take away our disgrace.”That's a clear call for polygamy, by women, 2700+ years ago.  This was a period of Hebrew history when polygamy had passed into the mists of time.***https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>So many words to promote your lies . . . You do know repeating a lie doesn't magically transform it into a truth . . . Right? As far as not answering your questions, why would I play that game? Besides the wordiness of this latest post, just two points from it expose your true nature. You claim to have Biblical knowledge yet deny something as basic as Jesus defining marriage and homosexuality being referenced. In what world should a sane person attempt to have a lengthy serious discussion with the likes of you? Please, at least admit that would be only your fantasy world!Your sad attempts to bend the Word of God to your desires can only harm you.</comment>

<comment>Leviticus 18:22 in both the King James (authorized) Version and in the English Standard Version (probably others but I have not fully researched it) used the English word "abomination" for men having sex with men.  The NIV uses the word "detestable" which is close enough.Who are "us"?   Come on, pastor, surely you know.  The Bible (both OT and NT) was written for all mankind, inspired and  authorized by the Holy Spirit.  This first to receive these words were the Hebrew people  and Moses had the Leviticus laws written down.And the fact that the Levitcus 18:22 prohibition was repeated in  Leviticus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 23:18, not to mention in the New Testament (Romans 1:27-28  and 1 Corinthians 6:9-10) means that these prohibitions were addressed to the Church of today as well as to humanity forever.You are beating the same old broken drum and it cannot stop people from hearing the truth.  I am sorry that you don't like the truth. </comment>

<comment>"Leviticus 18:22 in both the King James (authorized) Version and in the English Standard Version (probably others but I have not fully researched it) used the English word "abomination" for me having sex with men."No.  Not by any stretch of anyone's imagination, Bruce.  The Hebrew word behind the English word 'abomination' is a specific reference to an ancient, non-Hebrew, ritualistic, worship practice of some tribe(s) which were neighbours of Israel (but even that is countered with the probability that this was simply a propaganda tool used against the neighbour)."The Bible (both OT and NT) was written for all mankind"The Hebrew Bible, the Torah, the Nevi'im, and the Kethuvim (the Law, Prophets and Writings) are for the Jews and the Jews alone.  The Greek New Testament is for Christians, alone."Moses had the Leviticus laws written down"The Torah, as a scroll, was composed as we know it in the 6th century BCE.  Some of the written and/or oral traditions behind that 6th century BCE composition go back further in time, but not to Moses."these prohibitions were addressed to the Church of today as well as to humanity forever"No.  Leviticus is only for the ancient Hebrew.  Jews have been understanding those texts anew for many, many centuries.I love the truth and I love truth, Bruce.  This is precisely why I continue to counter much, if not most, of what you post here.</comment>

<comment>Stubborn insistence on ignoring what the scriptures actually command does not count as a rational argument.  Diminishing the authority of the scriptures as you consistently do actually puts you in hot water.   I guess we are going to have to agree to disagree on the Holy and universal nature of the Bible.   2 Timothy 3:16-17.http://www.virtueonline.org/ba...</comment>

<comment>"what the scriptures actually command"Show me this, Bruce.  Please.  Thanks."Diminishing the authority of the scriptures"Is something I may not do.  Before I ever contemplated taking/making the vows and promises of ordination, I loved the Bible and committed my life to honouring it, respecting, valuing it, loving it."the Holy and universal nature of the Bible"There is no such thing.  You are confounded, confused, misguided in your thinking in this regard.  Unless, of course, you are able to define what you mean by that nonsensical statement, to my mind."2 Timothy 3:16-17."Good, wholesome verses.  Pity that so many do not understand them.</comment>

<comment>And yet, everything you continue to say is in direct opposition to 2 Timothy 3:16-17!</comment>

<comment>Your projection tells everything about you to oppose 2 Timothy 3:16-17, as you are trying so very very hard to justify that putting discrimination laws and acts of hatred unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, is good.To you homophobes, doing wicked things unto others as what you would NOT want others to do unto you, is good.Woe to homophobes who lie and deceive others to put discrimination and hate as "good" and the highest law of the entire bible(Great Commandment) of equality and love as "bad" - Christ's version of Isaiah 5:20Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>Just curious . . . Do you claim to be born a fool or did you learn to be one? </comment>

<comment>Does a wise man join the Westboro cult to become an anti-Christ homophobe like you ?</comment>

<comment>So you're still learning . . . Thanks!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, I'm not a fool like you who join the Westboro cult, who also hate Christ to not obey the LAW.No matter how hard you keep trying over and over again to justify your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia to defy the LAW, for you to put discrimination and hatred as good unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, you will always fail and lose.You can continue to lie and deny of your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia and bigotry as much as you want to deceive yourself and some, but you can never deceive all nor Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. I'm only here to expose you of your wickedness.Ephesians 5:11  Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.Good night, I'll reply ALL of your comments tomorrow, if any.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Galatians 5:14  - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”</comment>

<comment>Seriously? The OT is only for the Jews and the NT only for the Gentiles? Stop dude . . . I thought we were having a real discussion/argument, not a joke fest! And you expect us to believe you're  some sort of scholar? Now THAT'S even funnier than when you first made the claim.</comment>

<comment>hmm so the OT which talks about the LAW, is to be ignored by you homophobes ? Why is that you can pick and choose all sort of biblical verses to justify your act of mortal sin to defy the LAW ?Leviticus 19:18  You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>More jokes in the form of Biblical ignorance and personal attacks and assumptions. Funny . . . Still sad, but funny!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, when you homophobes hate Christ, you don't believe in Him and all of His teachings of the LAW. So sad, but not funny when you choose the mortal sin to not have eternal life, for the wages of your sin is death.</comment>

<comment>Amen my friend!</comment>

<comment>Proverbs 29:5 A man who flatters his neighbor  spreads a net for his feet.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, you lack an understanding of what that verse really means . . . Not to mention that you really need to read and comprehend the entirety of Proverbs 29!</comment>

<comment>So sad, that you choose the religious belief to sacrifice your salvation of eternal life by celebrating the mortal sin against the highest law of the entire bible, the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Leviticus 19:18  You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;Galatians 5:14  - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”You bitterly reject any gay couple who wants to exchange marriage vows to love one another in all circumstances of life till death do them part so as to live by the Golden Rule as in Matthew 7:12 to fulfill the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ, yet you freely participate and celebrate the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman.John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”Christ loves you, but when you fail to believe and disobey Him, you hate Christ and the Father, and Christ doesn't know you (Matthew 7:21).</comment>

<comment>Again with the exhaustive reply full of lies and misinformation. What a waste!</comment>

<comment>hmm since you are an "expert" of the Bible, show to the world where is it written for you to put discrimination laws of hatred unto gays who you judge wrongly only to then celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman ?</comment>

<comment>Please . . . Do show where I have ever promoted all the sins you keep claiming I have. You're a sad, sad little man.</comment>

<comment>Your actions of what you DO, speak louder than any of your continual words of lies and denials.Still waiting for you to show the world on where does it say in the Bible for you to have a lifestyle of homophobia.</comment>

<comment>Still nothing? Well, except for more nonsense!</comment>

<comment>hmm you are still singing the same song of a broken record. Still waiting for you to show the world your amazing "expertise" of no "ignorance" !</comment>

<comment>So I'm the one singing a broken record. You are oblivious to reality.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, you are a broken record. So where in your bible does it say to love God , by hating gays and putting discrimination laws unto them to physically harm and ill treat them?John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>I challenge you to show where I have ever promoted harming homosexuals in any way . . . Please! You can't because I haven't. You simply think they are hurt when others don't accept their immoral behavior as good. Sorry my friend, but YOU are the one who hates God and thinks you know better than Him.</comment>

<comment>When you choose a lifestyle of homophobia and you are here to support discrimination, you demonstrate how you support laws and acts that physically harm gays who you judge WRONGLY.Why don't you do the same thing unto those with REAL sins of adultery, rape, pedophile, etc... but rather you welcome them openly when they come forth as a man and a woman ?Why do you hate Christ so much to keep lying over and over again ?John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>Based on YOUR definition, it is impossible to "wrongly judge" homosexuals. Sorry if "righteous" is outside your limited word set!</comment>

<comment>We judge people based on the act whether it is according to the LAW or not, that's what is sin or not.You can continue to lie and deny of your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobiaand bigotry as much as you want to deceive yourself and some, but you can never deceive all nor Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. I'm only here to expose you of your wickedness.Ephesians 5:11  Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.Good night, I'll reply ALL of your comments tomorrow, if any.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Galatians 5:14  - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”</comment>

<comment>So to be clear, now you're saying YOU and your friends are allowed to judge everyone else . . . Good to know! (Such a fool!)</comment>

<comment>Did gays judge you homophobes to put discrimination laws of condemnation as what YOU DO rather ?You can continue to lie and deny of your anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobiaandbigotry as much as you want to deceive yourself and some, but you can never deceive all nor Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. I'm only here to expose you of your wickedness.Ephesians 5:11  Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.Good night, I'll reply ALL of your comments tomorrow, if any.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.John 14:15 If you love me, obey my commands.Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Galatians 5:14  - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”</comment>

<comment>Again with the denials of scripture. Good luck with that!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, you are in denials of the PROPER scripture of what Christ said. Good luck with that!Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.Tell me which part of your scripture tells you to defy the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm ?You haven't tell me anything of what you believe in the Bible, except your continual rhetorical lies.</comment>

<comment>You should keep this old saying in the back of your mind at all times . . . "It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt."BTW, you completely miss the point of Matthew 16:27. We cannot do anything to become worthy of Heaven. We will all indeed be rewarded according to what we have done. But the key us we either believe in Jesus and what He has said and done OR we reject His gift. It is that simple!</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, you prove yourself of your continual hypocrisies to be the swine who don't know still what are pearls, to be the dogs who don't know still what is sacred.With hatred so deep inside you to have heart that is so hardened, you continue to demonstrate how you have a log in your own eyes and making a fool of yourself to not keep silent but trying so very very very hard to tell others of the speck of dust that is not even there in gays.Your ACTIONS are clear as daylight for you to judge gays WRONGLY, to then pass condemnation by legislating discrimination laws of hatred towards them only to make you celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman!Your actions and deeds of wickedness speak louder than your continual words of lies, denial and utter foolishness.Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.Matthew 7:21  “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’  And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’Good luck justifying your mortal sin again, and to be such fool to hate Christ by not obeying His commands.</comment>

<comment>Sure Simple Simon . . . You are right and I am wrong and the point of Matthew 16:27 is that we can earn our way to Heaven. Thanks!</comment>

<comment>Simple fredpiott, then good luck with your deeds to defy the LAW by putting discrimination laws unto gays who you judge wrongly, and to celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman.You are in the right path for your homophobic god to reward you of your deeds.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>Thank Captain Repetitive!</comment>

<comment>Indeed, you know yourself to be repeating your nonsense to justify your anti-Christ lifestyle, but completely failed.Good luck.</comment>

<comment>Got me again!</comment>

<comment>Indeed!</comment>

<comment>Again, Matthew 5:10-12</comment>

<comment>Absolutely, I'm so blessed for the persecution that you did unto me, that's why all your discrimination laws of bigotry are taken down. When you have failed the LAW, you will not live, for the wages of your mortal sin is death.</comment>

<comment>As it is your choice to reject the free gift of salvation through Christ and Christ alone, so too it is your choice to view the correction of a potential brother in Christ as persecution. Was Christ "persecuting" the Sadducees and Pharisees?</comment>

<comment>Your refusal to take responsibility for your sins against GLBTQ people is obscene, but your attempt to blame people who have been beaten, raped, murdered, stripped of civil rights, slandered, is entirely evil and sociopathic.</comment>

<comment>Seriously? When did I "attempt to blame people who have been beaten, raped, murdered, stripped of civil rights, (and) slandered?" And exactly what did I blame them for? Too bad for you that repeating a lie doesn't magically change it into a truth. BTW, pretending a person's sin is not a sin and calling it "love" is actually hate. Seek the truth!</comment>

<comment>"Seriously? When did"I quoted it, so your pretense only means that you are dishonest."Too bad for you that repeating a lie doesn't magically change it into a truth."Yet it is you, liar, who are attempting that very thing. Too bad your conceit and arrogance won't cleanse your sins."BTW, pretending a person's sin is not a sin and calling it "love" is actually hate."That is why you are guilty of hate.  And slander.Homosexuality is not a sin, but your vicious attacks on GLBTQ people most certainly are, as are your lies and false accusations, and of course, that incredible obese ego that convinces that you can accomplish anything with petty dismissals.I sought the truth, I found God, and God told me that people like you are workers of iniquity because you bear evil fruit.</comment>

<comment>No, you didn't . . . And you are making it extremely difficult to accept the possibility that you are not also, Sims, Simon, taize, goose or any number of other monikers. The circular nature of the arguments you "each" use is so similar. Then again, it could be the proof of the "mental illness" or the existence of the oft rumored "LGBT Handbook." 😜</comment>

<comment>"No, you didn't . . ."Such extraordinary conceit.  Your lies about my life are sin, based entirely on your fantasy that you are God."The circular nature of the arguments you "each" use is so similar."Prove it.  Provide quotes.  Bear in mind, that 'circular logic' as you call, at least as pertains to my posts, is entirely a figment of your ego.Of course, by your reasoning, one must conclude that you are Josh Duggar, you know, the guy who molested his sisters and their friends when they were children, and then made a stink reviling GLBTQ people in public.So, Josh, how's it going?</comment>

<comment>No actually, I'm done with you AND your alter egos . . . Play with yourselves! Later</comment>

<comment>I see.  You are running away because you are completely unable to defend your position.I wonder if you have the integrity to live up to your dramatic exit.Your incompetence and deceit are your fault, and your sin.</comment>

<comment>You got me funny boy!</comment>

<comment>“Do you see a person wise in their own eyes?  There is more hope for a fool than for them.” (Proverbs 26:12, NIV)</comment>

<comment>Bear in mind, Bruce with no excuse, the passage you cited describes you.  You obviously believe that you are wiser on this matter than GLBTQ people, as if you could possibly know their lives and relationships with God better than they do.</comment>

<comment>I did not say who was wise in their own eyes, I just quoted the scripture.  But since you had to quickly put me down, then you have proven it was you all along.</comment>

<comment>Your intent was clear, as apparently is your hunger for the fires of hell.</comment>

<comment>We will see, won't we, who ends up where.   Your dream tonight will give you a clue.</comment>

<comment>See, that is how I know you don't know Christ.  Those who know Christ don't have to wait and see.I know that my Redeemer lives, and that I will share in His resurrection.  I don't have to 'wait and see'.And perhaps, you revile GLBTQ people in public, not just because of some horror you've committed, but because you have no faith, and hope to convince God that there is someone more deserving of Hell than you.</comment>

<comment>Yes, GLBTQ people are blessed because of folks like you.  But that is not a license for you to continue to slander and revile us.</comment>

<comment>I neither slander nor revile you and your fellow "GLBTQ" friends. I speak only the truth out of genuine love, as opposed to a hatred of God, disguised as love. I will not apologize or feel bad fur speaking the truth. The truth is the only chance we humans have if being reconciled with God.</comment>

<comment>"I neither slander nor revise you and your fellow "GLBTQ" friends."Yes, you do."I speak only the truth out of genuine love,"No, you do not.  You lie out of conceit and sin.". I will not apologize or feel bad fur(sic) speaking the truth."No one asked you to do that.  You were asked, and will be repeatedly asked, to repent of your sins against GLBTQ people." The truth is the only chance we humans have if being reconciled with God."But since you do not tell the truth, you are not reconciled with God.</comment>

<comment>More "I'm rubber, you're glue" mentality. Still doesn't work! Not only have I repented of my "sins against GLBTQ" (sic), but I have received forgiveness and been reconciled. Now please, do the same. Relent if your sins against your fellow GLBTQ folks and be forgiven.</comment>

<comment>"More "I'm rubber, you're glue" mentality."Not at all.  Why do you persist in making false accusations."my "sins against GLBTQ" (sic),"There is no typo or misspelling in GLBTQ."but I have received forgiveness and been reconciled."Oh, but forgiveness is not a one shot deal, and you clearly are not reconciled with God, for you continue to slander and revile people for the sake of your pride."Now please, do the same. Relent(sic) if your sins against your fellow GLBTQ folks and be forgiven."There is no sin against GLBTQ people in my posts.Are you truly incapable of a reasoned rebuttal?  Or just too conceited to even try?</comment>

<comment>Sorry dude, but lying to each other so you all feel better about your shared sins is a sin! As for the "no typo or misspelling in GLBTQ," it depends on the day if the week and which of you telling me your lies as the which letters you use to describe "your side!"</comment>

<comment>We are not the ones telling lies.   You are, and they damn you." As for the "no typo or misspelling in GLBTQ," it depends on the day if the week and which of you telling me your lies as the which letters you use to describe "your side!""Nope.</comment>

<comment>"I neither slander nor revise(sic) you and your fellow "GLBTQ" friends."Yes you do.  Lying about your sin doesn't make it go away." I speak only the truth out of genuine love,"No, you do not speak the truth, nor do you speak out of love.  It is not love, fred, to call our innate, God-given capacity for love and intimacy "worthy of death and damnation" - sin. Nor is it love to declare that we must either spend our entire lives devoid of intimacy and love - to please you and your idol, under pain of death, harassment, slander, and abuse (in descending order).  There is no love, there is nothing genuine about your posts on this matter."as opposed to a hatred of God, disguised as love."Now that is what you are actually doing.  See, you hate God so much that you come into public places as you vilify hundreds of millions of His Children, and to make it worse, you do so in a way that portrays God as evil, cruel, unjust, capricious, insane."I will not apologize or feel bad fur(sic) speaking the truth."No one has asked you to do so, your characterization is dishonest and sinful.  You've been asked to repent of your very real sins against GLBTQ people and against God."The truth is the only chance we humans have if being reconciled with God."And since you do not tell the truth, or apparently even recognize it, you have no chance of reconciliation with God, do you?</comment>

<comment>My truth challenge friend, it is hard to take anything you say seriously, when you continue to whine about me slandering you, while each of your posts is an increasing attempt to out slander the previous!</comment>

<comment>"My truth challenge friend,"Nice slander. Please repent.</comment>

<comment>Truth troubles you that much eh?</comment>

<comment>No.  Your lies trouble many people.</comment>

<comment>"You should keep this old saying in the back of your mind at all times . . . "It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt.""Essentially, fred, you are calling Sims a fool through insinuation.  Jesus had something to say about that:Matthew 5:22But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.You probably felt a little pleasure at dismissing Sims like that, but in doing so, you put yourself in danger of the fire of hell.</comment>

<comment>Sorry Marky/Sims, but the passage you cite is only applicable to brothers in Christ, and you have made it clear that we are not. Whaa!</comment>

<comment>"Sorry Marky/Sims, but the passage you cite is only applicable to brothers in Christ, and you have made it clear that we are not. Whaa!"Oh, but your false assumption about me, as well as your claim, only shows that you disregard Christ's teachings.</comment>

<comment>Try reading Galatians 5:13 too . . . "You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh; rather, serve one another humbly in love." You see my friend, that's just one little example of how you fail to view scripture as a whole. Real love is of God, not the flesh!</comment>

<comment>So, why do you indulge the flesh of the opposite sex ? Why don't you serve one another humbly in love, but you hate others, yet still arrogant with lots of hate ?Why are you such hypocrite to tell me of biblical verses which you yourself don't follow ? Just like you believe that marriage is "man and woman", which was actually the condemnation of DIVORCE between man and woman, yet you celebrate that sin to marry any person who is a divorcee as long as they come to you as man and woman ?Your hypocrisy is everywhere in every of your comment and what you do in your lifestyle of homophobia.</comment>

<comment>Again, the old saying applies."It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt."Your comments here are a combination of nonsense and straight up lies about what I have said. You're a fool!</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, the fool is yourself, as the more you keep talking, the more you demonstrate how you don't know the words of Christ, to be a swine who don't know what are pearls, dogs who don't know what is sacred. You are trying so very very hard to justify your anti-Christ lifestyle to defy all the teachings of Christ and the LAW, and trying to silence me of exposing you.Your hypocrisy is everywhere in every of your comment and what you do in your lifestyle of homophobia.</comment>

<comment>I don't know if I'm gonna be able to look at myself in the mirror ever again, now that I know hypocrisy is a lifestyle, yet homosexuality is not! I'm sure glad you explained it to me. Next we need to wrk together to get al the pedophiles and other criminals their rights, so they aren't punished just for following their hearts according to the way God made them too! </comment>

<comment>hmm we don't need to work together to get all pedophiles and other criminals their rights, you ARE already giving them their rights to marry when you have put discrimination laws unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, to then have a lifestyle of hypocrisy to celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman.Thanks to you "Christians" who cherry pick the bible and pervert His teachings of the condemnation of Divorce as in Matthew 19:3, but only take the subsequent verses to embrace "traditional marriage" or "Biblical marriage" and then legislated man-made laws to only impose such belief while legalizing discrimination towards gays, the 2 muslim shooters of the San Bernardino as a bi-national couple had no issue entering this country, to have a marriage license and to finally have a graceful burial and a honorable death certificate acknowledging their "traditional marriage" and "biblical marriage" as "a man and a woman". While Jim Obergefell had to go through a hell of an ordeal to fight for such honor for his partner, just because of his true love to a person of the same sex.If those Muslim terrorists were to go the recent Oregon or Colorado "Christian" bakeries who were fined for refusing service to gay couples, they would have gotten their wedding cake without any questions asked as they fit the "biblical marriage" a "man and woman".If those Muslim terrorists were to go the recent Oregon or Colorado "Christian" bakeries who were fined for refusing service to gay couples, they would have gotten their wedding cake without any questions asked as they fit the "biblical marriage" a "man and woman". And if those terrorists couple were to go to Kim Davis, the multiple divorcee homophobic "Christian" at the Rowan County in Kentucky to apply for their marriage license, she would have issued them their marriage license without any questions as they fit her requirement of her "religious belief" that only allows her the "religious freedom" to celebrate the "Biblical marriage" as "man and woman".</comment>

<comment>You are so cute when you're in a rage. BTW, you might want to consider taking an English Composition class next semester so you can come up with something new to write. Your old materials are boring. It doesn't matter how many times you write the same lie, they are still lies. I have more important stuff to do than respond to any more of your nonsense today. I do however pray you find His peace soon.</comment>

<comment>hmm your projection tells me more about your anger to have your hypocrisy all exposed of what you DO in actions of your lifestyle of homophobia to be such hypocrite and anti-Christ. Anything new that you can try still to justify your lifestyle ? It's not working anymore!Don't waste your time praying as when you are turn away from the LAW, your prayers are an abomination, that's why you always fail and lose.Proverbs 28:9 If one turns away his ear from hearing the LAW, even his prayer is an abomination.Good luck.</comment>

<comment>"Second verse, same as the first!"</comment>

<comment>Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsMatthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.When you failed the LAW, you will not live as you will not have eternal life.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>I pray the Lord will grant you understanding of the passages you so love to quote.</comment>

<comment>When you hate Christ and turn away from the LAW, your prayers are an abomination unto Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm.</comment>

<comment>Again my friend, ONLY Christ is capable of successfully navigating "the LAW" . . . Thanks to His life, we can only reject the gift He freely offers to each of us. Once again, you directly deny His work, both pre and post the incarnation. Very sad, but you still have time to seek the truth. I pray for you and yours.</comment>

<comment>hmm so basically to you anti-Christ who hate Christ and the LAW, all these verses are useless :John 14:15  If you love me, obey my commands. John 10:30, “I and the Father are one.”Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsMatthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Galatians 5:14  - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.</comment>

<comment>Not at all my scripturally challenged friend. However one must always consider the totality of scripture. It is improper to view individual passages as lone concepts, standing apart from the rest of scripture. All scripture must be proofed and understood with all of His Word. One cannot redefine love in their own image and then base all of their "understanding" through their own position. All scripture is God breathed and therefore must remain true the Him, never to His creation. You cannot conceive of a reality consistent with me truly caring about you and your eternity based solely on the fact that we disagree on the morality of a single human behavior. You cannot even acknowledge that it is a behavior! Yet you play the word game to deny other behaviors are very bit as "innate" as homosexuality. Indeed, divorce, pedophilia, lying, cheating and stealing are equally behavior choices a person CAN make. And yet each of those too can and do often claim they cannot help themselves - They are "born this way." You see my friend, THAT is exactly why you need to take a second look at hoe you defend your position. Either the same rules apply to everyone or YOU are twisting the truth to support your position and your position alone. Several times you have insinuated that I somehow support "divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile . . . murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc" when I have made it very clear that those are all also sins. They are no better and no worse than homosexuality. However, in each case, anyone who actually promotes any aspect of any of those is doing the same thing as you and your pro-LGBT friends. They are twisting the truth to support their little claim to be different than all the other sins. Call me a bigot, a hypocrite or anti-Christ all you want, THAT is exactly the same that each of them do and THAT is exactly what Matthew 5:10-12 is referencing, in spite of your claim to the contrary.Honestly, I am disappointed in myself for allowing you to suck me back into this discussion. I keep hoping that I can find the right words to get you to see the truth, but just as God hardened the heart of Pharaoh with each passing warning from Moses, you too just dig your heals in a little deeper. I will no longer respond and will let God deal with you.</comment>

<comment>hmm more hypocrisy and contradiction from you !"All scripture must be proofed and understood with all of His Word", yet when Christ and other prophets gave the LAW, you exclude them ALL!!"All scripture is God breathed ", yet when Christ spoke with His own mouth when He walked as a man in flesh, you treat Him to not be God enough for you!!You talk about morality, yet you have no idea what is morality when you reject the LAW to do wicked things unto gays who you judge WRONGLY, and with the discrimination laws you put you  celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman !!!As an anti-Christ, you are completely messed up to see everything upside down. What Christ called good you call evil, what Christ called evil you call good. And that is because of what we continually see, you hate Christ and you don't follow the LAW.</comment>

<comment>" Yet you play the word game to deny other behaviors are very bit as "innate" as homosexuality."No, they are not.  Like most bigots, you are so intent on equating homosexuality with something bad, you forget the correct comparison - homosexuality equates to heterosexuality."divorce, pedophilia, lying, cheating and stealing"And these are behaviors that are predominantly committed by heterosexuals, and strongly tied to heterosexual marriage." You see my friend,"You are clearly not a friend to any GLBTQ person."Several times you have insinuated that I somehow support "divorce, adultery, rape, pedophile . . . murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc" when I have made it very clear that those are all also sins. They are no better and no worse than homosexuality. "What you do is show that you actually have no moral sense at all.  You see, Fred, divorce, adultery, rape, murder, homophobes like yourself, thieves, terrorists like yourself, all inflict harm.  Homosexuality does not.  You, and everything you mentioned, are much worse that homosexuality.But clearly, you either do not understand the concept 'harm', or you willfully disregard it when it suits you.  Either is the necessary foundation for evil.Further, those things you listed violate consent, while homosexuality does not.  So consent is also, obviously, not a factor to you, and yet, violating consent is also a key component of evil."They are twisting the truth to support their little claim to be different than all the other sins. "Says the guy who either rejects the notion of harm and consent, or disregards both to suit himself.  Sorry, the twisting is entirely on your side.  Homosexuality is not a sin.  Persecuting and slandering homosexuals, and progressive Christians as you have done, is sin.By one of the very passages that evil people use to condemn GLBTQ people, you are convicted as a slanderer, a reviler, and unless you repent, you will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</comment>

<comment>So now you're back to using human reason to determine right and wrong as opposed to God's Word . . . And you call me a bigot etc, yet claim to be on the higher moral ground. Sorry dude, you cannot flip-flop on the issues and selectively interpret and apply God's Word! And of course you conveniently ignore the harm caused by LGBT behavior, as evidenced by extremely high suicide rates even where it has been "accepted" for a some time. Sorry my friend, but we don't get to decide what is and is not sin. Peace</comment>

<comment>"So now you're back to using human rationale to determine right and wrong as opposed to God's Word"No, I'm not.  And you provide no evidence for that statement, so you are bearing false witness, again." And you call me a bigot etc, yet claim to be on the higher moral ground."You are a bigot, but I have made no such claim.  Why do you continue to sin against me in this fashion?"Sorry dude, you cannot flip-flop on the issues"Since I have done no such thing, your false insinuation is further sin.The most obvious thing about your post, though, is that you completely failed to address, much less challenge or refute, any of the positions I provided in the post you are responding to.That creates the impression of both abject failure on your part, and a concession, from you, that you realize everything I wrote is correct.You are a slanderer, a reviler, a worker of iniquity.  Real humans are murdered, raped, tortured, around the world because of the evil belief you proclaim and defend.  You cannot be serving God in this matter, and frankly, probably not in any other as well.</comment>
