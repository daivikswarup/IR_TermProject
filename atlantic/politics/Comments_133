<comment>Pres. Obama has shown that patience and diplomacy are effective tools to achieve American foreign policy objectives unlike war mongering chicken-hawks in the GOP.</comment>

<comment>The GOP would not start a war with Iran.  They might have done as well as Obama did (though I doubt it).  They would have liked to have credit (remember, the House and Senate, both controlled by the GOP, ratified the treaty).' The real pity is this idea that anything Obama does is wrong, no matter how well he does it.  Some may remember that what GOP now ridicules as "Obamacare" it just adored when it was Mitt Romney's health care plan.It is unbelievable to me that the GOP base is stupid enough to buy this line and trot it out over and over.  We used to be a nation, united against our enemies.  The GOP has ruined that.  When will the working class Americans betrayed by the GOP stop voting for them?</comment>

<comment>You make very good points. The GOP is very good at creating bogey men and situations that scare uninformed people. It's amazing how easily people can be manipulated by GOP scheme of "us" v. "them." I mean look at what Trump says about Muslims, Mexicans, etc., and he is the GOP front runner - really sad.</comment>

<comment>Gay Barry has only a year left to bring American down. </comment>

<comment>After lifting America up for 7 years, can he do it in just one year? Can;t wait to see how Gay Barry makes out!!xoxoxo</comment>

<comment>Our children and grandchildren will be paying for his narcissistic blunders. </comment>

<comment>Yeah because peace is so much more expensive than war....or something.</comment>

<comment>how expensive was the Munich agreement? Pretty high price to pay for less than a year of peace</comment>

<comment>Iran is a 2nd rate power. Not a re-armed Germany.</comment>

<comment>exactly so why is SAM bending over instead of taking out their Air Force?</comment>

<comment>Pre-emptive war? Its illegal for one thing.</comment>

<comment>Taking American Hostages is an act of War, or at least it used to be.....</comment>

<comment>Gay, black, and no war with Iran? Slam dunk! Easily one of our better presidents.BTW, every president has narcissistic tendencies. Some are more productive than others.</comment>

<comment>Nicely put.</comment>

<comment>“We’ve achieved this through diplomacy without resorting to another war in the Middle East”=========Obama just schooled the entire GOP presidential field. Poor neocon Rubio looks downright silly right now.</comment>

<comment>Rubio has become a little man in lifter shoes.</comment>

<comment>Those boots were classy. Rubio got style, with just that hint of sleaze. Reminds me more of John Edwards everyday.</comment>

<comment>hey, that's not fair...to Edwards.</comment>

<comment>you have to an absolute fool to see any success in trading prisoners for hostages...especially with Iran who has already shown they'll just go out and kidnap a new batch of hostages....</comment>

<comment>Obama keeps racking up points while the Republicans accomplish nothing.</comment>

<comment>Obama has handled the whole Middle Eastern situation with great mastery.  This does not apply to the nimbus of Islam generally.  The result is Donald Trump.</comment>

<comment>He's been reactive rather than proactive, but that's not a bad thing considering what happened before.</comment>

<comment>Not just that, but focused on achieving tangible results rather than symbolic gestures.That the first requirements of the Iran nuclear treaty were upheld without question by both sides is a BFD.Looking back over the past 7 years, it's clear that Obama will go down in history as leader of an immensely consequential US government.  What's even more consequential is this is not the first major achievement related to nuclear proliferation in his tenure (that was the 2010 NPT Conference in New York, work on which started in the second Reagan administration), and the first directly laid the groundwork for the second.</comment>

<comment>Republicans accomplish one thing. Showing how out of touch they are with reality. Even a good thing for the country in the mind of a Republican is a bad thing for them. The party of doom and gloom.</comment>

<comment>This is why they resort to name-calling and fear-mongering.</comment>

<comment>Repubs and Dems have been pretty much the same where supporting wars are concerned... only the media sheep see any difference...</comment>

<comment>You mean that Bush started this back in 2008?   He had a lot of nerve.</comment>

<comment>(music- to Hooray for Castro-)Hooray for chicken-hawks!Hooray for chicken-hawks!Someone in the stands yelling hooray for Chicken hawks.One, two three four, who we gonna yell for?Chicken hawks, that's who!</comment>

<comment>Close GITMO and do something about guns and Obama might get his face on Mt. Rushmore.</comment>

<comment>He will get there anyway.</comment>

<comment>Huh?</comment>

<comment>Yep!</comment>

<comment>Does Mt. Rushmore have a backside for knucklehead Obama's face?Next from Iran: Death to America, the evil Satan.</comment>

<comment>President Obama's diplomacy stance has paid off. For those who don't think the Iran deal was a step in the right direction they are wrong. The President is under no illusions they will be 100% trustworthy but they are being watched by the powers that be as to keep them in line. The 9 U.S sailors released within a day. The 5 Americans released recently is a sign of how diplomacy has worked. All this wouldn't have happened before the Iran deal, the sailors may have been taken as prisoners an those prisoners released would have remained in jail. So for GOP to say especially the buffoon Trump to say the Iran deal was a 'bad' deal is absolute nonsense. The art of the deal Trump style would have been to bomb the hell out of Iran. That's his answer to everything. So it's just he is a Republican as he can sing along with John McCain...bomb bomb bomb Iran!</comment>

<comment>Obama's surrender to Iran continues. First, the agreement to allow Iran to get nuclear weapons, the payment of 150 billion,  and now the release of these criminals.  It is, consistent with Obama bowing and scraping to muslim dictators,and abandoning our men in Benghazi.Iran thanks us by seizing our sailors, forcing them at gunpoint to their knees, hand on their neck, the commander apologizes, and the female sailor forced to cover her head with a scarf.Iran is the major supporter of muslim terrorism and is responsible for many American deaths.Yet Jimmy Barak Carter, and his stooges Jean Kerry and mrs bubba, thank Iran.This is not incompetence but purposeful weakening of American power, and part of the radical transformation of the USA promised by Obama</comment>

<comment>Here is a fact for you as regards the $150 billion. That money belonged to Iran it was frozen so it was never ours to start with that's just a talking point for the GOP. Still when did facts ever get in their way? Benghazi issue is just another red herring it won't matter how many investigations they have on that they will never be satisfied. They've had numerous already and no wrong doing has been found so it's about time they moved on.</comment>

<comment>After the Iraq war, you would think the GOP would be a bit more introspective about Neo-Conservative foreign policy. After a trillion dollars and blood shed, we got what?</comment>

<comment>Off by only 8,823%.  $1.7B.  http://news.yahoo.com/us-pay-i...The rest of your post has approximately the same level of truthiness.</comment>

<comment>It'll be interesting to see if the sanctions relief keeps the moderates in "power" in Iran for a while longer. The Ayatollah may be a hardliner, but he's apparently shrewd enough to let Rouhani and Zarif do thing despite saber rattling from a conservative government in Israel and a conservative US Congress. If sanctions relief results in an economic upswing, they'll have even more popular support and the Leadership won't want to install a hardline government that might screw it all up. Plus they probably realize that getting rid of ISIS will be much easier with US cooperation. They need us more than we need them in the fight since their top two allies, Iraq and Syria, have lost territory and thousands of their Shi'a residents it's actually an existential threat to them. It would also be better for us too. While we could conceivably get it done alone, the aftermath will be much less messy if Iran is involved in resolving the Syrian political mess and supporting the Iraqi government. </comment>

<comment>Less expensive, anyway.</comment>

<comment>Amidst the chants of "Death To America", launching missiles near Amerian ships and jamming the signals of boats to provoke Americans, Obama swaps hostages for prisoners, and removes the sanctions that had been working, and were so close to bringing Iran to its knees. Iran will now have funds to pay for its terrorist operations and build nukes. Obama is a knucklehead, and he will not be able to detect whether Iran is building nukes;</comment>

<comment>"Death To America"========You don't really get that, do you? Chanting "death to America" is nothing more than Iran's hard liners firing up the conservatives. The U.S. has the same issue when conservative teabillies shout "bomb Iran".</comment>

<comment>Nobody in the west is asking to "bomb iran".  Sanctions have worked well.   Liberals don't understand who they are dealing with in Iran, or any of the ME nations, and that Iran 'leadership' is disingenuous.   Iran will continue funding terrorist operations and will build nukes.  The Western appeasers are incompetent and will be held responsible.</comment>

<comment>You deny anyone is calling for bombing Iran and then outline a justification for bombing Iran. Can't have it both ways. If you're a neocon warmonger, just be what you are. Don't hide behind rhetoric and lies.</comment>

<comment>You are clueless.</comment>

<comment>Who is calling for bombing Iran?</comment>

<comment>John Bolton has called for war, so you're wrong.</comment>

<comment>Who is saying we should bomb Iran?  Name names.</comment>

<comment>First response is free - Aside winnieww and his fellow war mongers:Matthew KroenigDick CheyneyJohn R. BoltonNorman PodhoretzJohn McCainJoshua MuravchikThomas McInerneyTom CottonMax BootDaniel Pipes, etc....</comment>

<comment>landmark nuclear deal followed quickly with more sanctions because, surprise!, Iran went ahead with ICBM tests.</comment>

<comment>Iran is taking full advantage of the Obama/Kerry Fools combo:  Capture American sailors and get billions in return!</comment>

<comment>Weren't those prisoners released?</comment>

<comment>The Obama foreign policy can best be explained by showing photos of Obama bowing to muslim dictators, Benghazi where Obama/mrs bubba abandoned Americans to die, the 150 billion payment to Iran, and the ten sailors on their knees, hands on their neck, with Iranian terrorists pointing guns at Americans.</comment>

<comment>Iraq war: 4,425 US servicemembers killed, 32,223 wounded in action. I guess those kind of results are more to your liking.</comment>

<comment>Obama only has to look at Israel to see the result of his capitulation to fearless leader... Every prisoner swap with Hezbolah is immediately followed by the kidnapping of more hostages to replace the ones traded away. Even Reagan's Arms for Hostages folly just got more Americans kidnapped as soon as hostages were released...</comment>

<comment>How about you explain what Obama surrendered?  Have he disarmed our military?  Has he renounced future action against Iran?  Better yet, please explain how the current GOP candidates would do better than Obama did.</comment>

<comment>I don't think any of them would have even entered into a discussion on reducing sanctions until they released the latest batch of hostages. Some may have gone further and added that they remove their troops from Lebanon as well...</comment>

<comment>The sanctions in question were only effective because the international community recognized that we were negotiating in good faith.  The sanctions were something that all of the major players (meaning the P5+1) agreed to.  The goal was to minimize the threat of a nuclear Iran.  That has been accomplished.  And a case can be made that it was because we were negotiating in good faith on the nuclear deal that Iran agreed to release our sailors as quickly as they did.  Diplomacy is the politics of the possible.  Our goal was to advance our interests at minimum cost.  That was achieved.  The only way one can say Obama has capitulated is if one's goals were maximalist.  And maximalist goals are very, very unlikely to be realized.</comment>

<comment>so many inaccuracies , so little time.....#1. The goal of the sanctions was to prevent Israel from using its military power to end the Iranian nuclear program, that is still on the table#2 The goal was not to minimize the threat of a nuclear Iran, as stated by Clinton , Kerry and Obama, it was to prevent it. again see#1#3 Iran released the sailors because they did not want to endanger implementation of the agreement. The Iranians have been taking Americans hostage for 36 years, they only passed on this opportunity to ensure sanction relief. #4 Iran has a third world military, the US is the worlds lone superpower, anything short of achieving maximalist goals is capitulation,,,,</comment>

<comment>So many cognitive distortions, so little self awareness.1) Bibi does not have the stones to launch a preemptive strike against Iran.  And even if he did, he would further isolate Israel from the rest of the world.  Not to mention that even by John Bolton's admission, such strikes would not end Iran's program, it would only set them back.  Leave it to a fanatic to not consider the unintended consequences of a preemptive strike.2) Iran is a signee of the nuclear NPT.  As such, they are legally entitled to a nuclear program.  There is no way to 100% ensure any country will not build a nuclear weapon.  You can only minimize the risk.  The P5+1/Iran agreement does that.  What's your better real world alterative?3) The US messed with Iran's internal affairs 60+ years ago.  The unintended consequences included Iran taking Americans hostage.  It's also worth remembering that if the negotiations had fallen apart, Iran would still be getting back their money because the countries that were holding the money weren't going to hold on to it forever.  So your third point makes zero sense.4) This point hilariously encapsulates how guys like you are divorced from reality.  First of all, the other P5+1 members did not share your maximalist goals.  Secondly, what makes you think Iran would agree to those conditions?  We sanctioned the daylights out of them, and yet Iran went from 165 centrifuges in 2003 to 22,000 ten years later.  It's not the regime that was hurt by the sanctions.  It was the Iranian people that were hurt.  Your thinking is deeply un-conservative.</comment>

<comment>Obama is the worst president ever</comment>

<comment>So even though President Bush started a war that killed 4,400 Americans and 461,000 Iraqis, and as a result took out Iran's oldest enemy, your conclusion is Obama is a worse president.  What an erudite analysis.</comment>

<comment>Well, now we know he is a Shia Muslim and not a Sunni.</comment>

<comment>Is that so?  Then why is he enabling Sunni Saudi Arabia in their combat operations in Yemen?</comment>
