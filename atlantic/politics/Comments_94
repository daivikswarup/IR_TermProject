<comment>Everyone should wear furry pink bunny suits (with footies) at war protest marches.  They would be much more compelling.</comment>

<comment>On the subject, I heartily recommend the book 'The Better Angels of Our Nature', by Steven Pinker. It makes the compelling case that we're actually in the most peaceful, free period of human history ever, and that it's only going to get better.</comment>

<comment>Except that Pinker seems to think that 1st world countries going to war with 3rd world countries don't count and that's how he arrives at the conclusion that we're more "peaceful."</comment>

<comment>He looks at the probability of a person dying in a violent manner, rather than by the number of wars that are fought or people dying in them. And by that metric the truth of that statement is self-evident. Now, as to whether this is predictive or merely descriptive, that I can't answer.</comment>

<comment>Then he must be assuming a lot of his data since I'd find it hard to believe he was able to compare violent deaths in the roman era to today's statistics.</comment>

<comment>Constant barbarian invasions, slaving, gladiator fights, pirates, palace intrigue, slave revolts, mass crucifixions, plagues... seems like now is better than Roman times.</comment>

<comment>Only if you ignore the Third World, which Pinker does.</comment>

<comment>He uses archaeology. A lot of ancient graves have remains showing skeletal traumas that don't seem to be nearly as common today. But yeah, he has to stretch on his margins of error because the archaeological record isn't nearly complete enough to allow valid statistical comparisons. For instance, what if it turns out that people with military honors were more likely than other people to be given a substantial burial having fair chances to survive the years? That would create an injury bias in the stats.</comment>

<comment>Once again, back to my original point, Pinker dismisses the entirety of the Third World in order to back up his claim. He deliberately focuses on First World Democracies to say people are less likely to die a violent death.P.S. I'm guessing he believes an ax blow to the head vs a gun shot is more violent even though the end result is the same.</comment>

<comment>If that's true (and I have no reason to think that it isn't), it does submarine the entire thesis.  It's akin to writing a book on the 1% and extrapolating it to declare prosperity for the 99.</comment>

<comment>No ? Yes ? Maybe ?</comment>

<comment>Only if history is not judged with modern viewpoints.</comment>

<comment>that is one of the hardest things to do as a historian</comment>

<comment>I always have problems with the actual demand that historians "judge" as oppose to "explain" the past. I think, for the most part, "judgement" should be up to the reader. The historians task is to explain the past as best they can. (And yes, I understand that this task also requires some "judgement"). With that said, modern viewpoints can help improve the work of explanation. Feminism, for example, has helped create a re-evaluation of the record of the past, where we are less likely to write large parts of humanity out of the record.</comment>

<comment>Interpretation of the evidence is one of the jobs of a historian.  The much-maligned "social history" that started in the 70s speaks to your point.  Many felt the traditional ways of interpreting the evidence needed new filters.  Hence the rise of feminist history, ethnic histories, and books like Four Generations, which re-examined old evidence in a new light, namely a focus on the lives of average folks as opposed to political and cultural leaders.</comment>

<comment>That being said, history written pursuant to some kind of political agenda will not be good history.</comment>

<comment>Those were not filters but expansions, the need to include more of the heretofore invisible made so by those who wrote history to fit their p.o.v.</comment>

<comment>Yet feminist history is a wholesale fraud, painting the most privileged group in history, women in the West, as hopelessly oppressed.There's a lot to be said for aiming at objectivity.</comment>

<comment>Neither is appropriate, judging or explaining. In fact, both are very nearly impossible if one's aim is true.History of past people and places and events is best when viewed and shared, allowing a range of thoughtful intellectual inspiration, commonalities, and variant interpretations of facts and events lived by real people. This is why memory is so important and ought be respected not rewritten or qualified to mold to today's standards - which change hourly.</comment>

<comment>The most admirable historians are those who come closest to Tacitus' ideal, to tell history "without anger or bias."  Also those who share Barbara Tuchman's understanding that "in real life every age is a checkerboard of light and dark."</comment>

<comment>Love, love Tuchman. She was my go-to when assigning history reads to college students who often arrived with next to zero elementary, middle and high school history instruction. ::sigh::</comment>

<comment>That may be because Tuchman was a superb and accessible writer. Her history, however . . . .</comment>

<comment>An anti-war march 25 years ago?  That would have been Desert Shield/Storm.  I remember that The Progressive or Mother Jones or some such released an issue of anti-war "voices of reason", and pledged to do so for as long as the war lasted.  The war was actually over before that issue even reached the shelves.</comment>

<comment>I was just thinking that this morning. It's been that many years already. I remember that war as I was in high school at the time and it was much talked about by my friends and I.Dang. The time went by fast.Furthermore, we're still flying the same warplanes we flew in that war, and they weren't new even then. This country needs some new aircraft.</comment>

<comment>“'An invented past can never be used,” James Baldwin writes, 'it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought.'”And then we see the confusion and rage of those who tried to cling to it.</comment>

<comment>True, and telling wrt the increasing hysteria of Western feminists whose false narrative of oppression is coming apart at the seams.</comment>

<comment>That's an interesting example to bring up.  I'm not sure, however, it's supportable.  I mean, in looking at only concrete, historical facts, if there was no oppression of women in, for example, the US, how do you explain the fact that they couldn't own any property or go to college until the 1850s, vote until the 1920s, file for divorce until the 1930s, hold certain jobs until the 1960s-70s, etc.?I'll leave aside the notion of "increased hysteria" to avoid undue complication, but it's quite a curious, possibly telling, phrase to employ when making your argument.</comment>

<comment>just to state for the record, no historian ever, anywhere, should ever have any thoughts of activism or activists in their mind while working, unless that is the direct subject of their inquiry.  History is not to be written with or for an agenda.  Folks with an agenda may find a history suitable for them but we should never go into a work with that in mind.</comment>

<comment>Tell that to the Texas state school board.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Texas state school board has been dismaying historians for decades now</comment>

<comment>And scientists.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure they deny the existence of both.</comment>

<comment>Umm, what does this Telegraph column have to do with whitewashing the Civil War, or teaching the "controversy" about Darwin?Or are you just trolling.</comment>

<comment>Oh how cute...  I'll bet you also believe that campaign contributions don't affect politicians. </comment>

<comment>The problem with a lot of histories except for the very recent is that the written material we have to rely on is essentially from activists of one color or another. Most historical narrative and the lessons we can presumably learn from them are built upon assumptions and biases.Maybe that's why we only realize we're repeating history when we actually do it, since we aren't able to form the pertinent narrative from the sources until after it's taken place.</comment>

<comment>If you find an aspect of history which has been suppressed for 200 years, you might well have an agenda - to dig it up and present it to the public. I have no regrets.</comment>

<comment>For my part, I have certainty.I am certain that this vale of tears will come to an end upon the extinction of our species.Prior to that, I'm reasonably sure it will be a sh*tshow until the last day, but I concede that it is possible, however unlikely, that humans will be better than they are. There's nothing actually stopping us other than our innate characteristics which give rise to all the evils we do in the world.But if I had to bet, I'd bet on our extinction. That will put an end to the whole farce.</comment>

<comment>Guess we can "hope" for a plague....</comment>

<comment>The best thing for this planet would be for a) humanity to get its sh!t together, or, barring that, b) a virus to put an end to the whole sordid experiment.  My money's on "B."</comment>

<comment>most realistic is that humans muddle through for several millennia and then we expand into the galaxy for several more</comment>

<comment>Expansion into the galaxy is a hard sell based on what we know right now. But who know? Maybe the vast distances between stars will one day be traversed. For now though, it's essentially an impossibility. A light year is an unimaginably large distance. 100,000 light years (roughly the diameter of our galaxy) even more so.And that's just the easiest problem to perceive.</comment>

<comment>Hiya Sandy!Long time no see.How's it going?How's the Horde?Hope all is well and Merry Christmas to you and yours!</comment>

<comment>Here's where real hope is: http://vhemt.org/</comment>

<comment>That's enough of your Pollyannish uplift, young man!</comment>

<comment>Hmmm. This discussion seems to assume that we all know what we mean by "hope" and it is thus treated as some kind of transhistorical construct that means the same thing to everyone over time. Moreover, hope here is conflated with social justice, as if hope cannot be something that is embraced by those who want tyranny to reign, or racism to be permanent, or the subjugation of women to be the order of the day. Thus, war or economic/social inequailty or environmental devastation cannot possibly be the thing hoped for, the fulfillment of someone's dreams.So, perhaps the best way to think of hope is to look at how it is deployed by particular actors and communities in a specific time frame. One could say, for example, that during the civil rights movement, hope was -- for those involved in the movement -- political resistance. Donald Trump's hope, and the hopes of the far right, might (or might not) be described as a politics of retrenchment or as a reassertion of white male supremacy in a moment of extreme economic inequality. And for those who roll their eyes about hope: we could wonder about whether their idea of hope ultimately reflects their profound investment in the current political and social arrangements or their sense of powerlessness or even their inability or unwillingness to imagine alternatives to what is.</comment>

<comment>Our civil-rights historian sees history as something that happened primarily in North America, vaguely between 1776 and now, and race as a driving factor. A better perspective around the question of "hope" might be this - for the majority of humans on this planet, has there been a better time to be alive?If not, it would seem that hope is alive and well.</comment>

<comment>After having finished Baldwin's "Go Tell It On The Mountain," I guess the answer to this question has to be "No."</comment>

<comment>What a mess this article is.“You may as well lie to your psychiatrist. ‘An invented past can never be used,’ James Baldwin writes, ‘it cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought.’”I think it’s pretty safe to assume that the author’s target here is sanitized, white-washed, nationalistic history.  Fair enough.  But he’s being tremendously disingenuous by not acknowledging that the most ardent advocates in the academy of a politically-infused “usable past” tend to be leftist activists.“Forcing the happy story means embracing delusions about who Americans have been, which inevitably lead to delusions about who Americans are.”As does forcing the dreary story.  The “glory story” and the “gory story” are both bad history. Nuanced, responsible history is always far more complex than that.</comment>

<comment>What a mess this article is.No kidding, right?</comment>

<comment>the point is that activist history is not good history.</comment>

<comment>Activist history is just activism.Hope is hope. It does not need activism or any ism at all.</comment>

<comment>If your goal is the elimination of white supremacy then neither history nor anything else will give you hope.  It is just one (particularly vicious) form of stupidity that has always been and will always be with us.On the other hand, just look at the progress civil rights has made worldwide over the past 200 years and continues to make today.  If you think this is insignificant, your ancestors living under Jim Crowe or slavery would disagree.</comment>

<comment>Is the author's point that racism is somehow worse now than in the Jim Crow days?  I know that, by Betteridge's law, the author is clearly trying to prove a false point, but I'm not even sure what point the author is trying to prove or disprove.There's something about historians being useless (agreed, Tom Wolfe's writings capture the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s better than anything a historian wrote), some points about racism where I cannot figure if they are ironic, counterpoints, sarcasm, or serious.  There's a mention of Ta-Nehisi Coates, who attracts controversy across the Atlantic commentary boards like a lightning rod, especially as his own articles are comment free.I've seen sponges give better supporting arguments.  Not Spongebob Squarepants, but actual sponges.  Is the outstanding brilliance of Spongebob Squarepants unique?</comment>

<comment>e: completely misunderstood your post the first time around.The author's point seemed to be that telling the truth about history doesn't really go with the positive attitude required to be an activist. There are (in every country) certain structural forces that will always try to create inequality and put things back to "the way they were". So many of the gains that they might achieve (e.g. the Voting Rights Act) may eventually be rolled back or watered down (e.g. the removal of the preclearance requirements and the southern states immediate adoption of Voter ID laws/the efforts to kick Latinos off the ballot in Florida/etc.). </comment>

<comment>@golden_bearI completely understand your point about the balance between history and activism, which starts with a straightforward hypothesis and offers evidence and examples to illustrate that hypothesis, as a good author would.</comment>

<comment>What's honest history?Why is "Cracked Magazine" far more accurate (and a thousand times funnier) than 90% of the phony baloney propaganda still being (haha) taught in academia?An alien might think Eddie Bernays is our ultimate philosopher.</comment>

<comment>I think that history and activism don't mix well, but not for the reasons expressed by the author.I think humanity has progressed in many ways.Ten thousand years most of the planet was populated by small bands of our ancestors, that fought continuously for resources, lived at the mercy of the weather, and faced a short precarious life in which a broken bone could be the end of them.One thousand years ago, humanity had developed a few relatively advanced civilizations that allowed the ruling class to enjoy certain conforts at the expense of a working class who lived with mostly nothing. War and slavery were reminders of how life's little value.As recently as 500 years ago, the world lived in a so called "Malthusian trap". Technology was thought of as fixed, he absense of progress meant that the world could only sustain so many people. Such was a world in which war, diesease and famine were believed essential for existence.Nowadays, I live in a middle income country in which vaccination is universal, 99% of the population has access to electricity, about 90% has acces to running water, about 80% graduate from secondary school. Some people might perish from complications related to malnutrition in the country's most secluded rural towns, but our main health problems have become cardiocascular disease and diabetes, obesity related.Another example is Western Europe, whose borders were terribly fluid a 100 years ago. They still are I suppose, but nowadays conflict gets channeled hrough referendums and in constitutional courts, rather than with troops.So I think that history's message to activists who want change, and want it now, the lesson is this. Change is coming your way. For the most part for the better. But new challenges will also come. And even when the change you want is coming, it probably will come later rather than sooner. </comment>

<comment>I have often said, there is no hope for this country until the white population decreases to less than 50%. But it is coming. 2045, they say.</comment>

<comment>Here are some headlines from the last few months from a major city with a minority population of whites.  Enjoy your new country.http://www.al.com/opinion/inde...http://www.al.com/opinion/inde...http://www.npr.org/2015/12/15/...http://www.al.com/opinion/inde...</comment>

<comment>Where is this often said? These are some very racist people you are dealing with.</comment>

<comment>But without the witness and evidence of honest historians (and journalists), activists would have no arguments to support their protests with. It's hard enough to protest, even with the facts on one's side.</comment>

<comment>But what do we hope for? We hope for Reason. And Reason requires honest History so that we may argue for Reason. And this is how honest historians provide a vital service for activists.</comment>

<comment>Is it not dishonest History, and the dissemination of dishonest History, that most thwarts Hope? Consider the person wrongly accused of a crime and imprisoned. What hope does that person have except that the honest History might come to light and be admitted? The dissemination and acceptance of honest History is all that gives us Hope. The triumph of honest History is in fact our only Hope.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter how honest history is, if no one wants to hear it. The amount of narratives makes it too easy for people to take a buffet approach to history, rather than cobble together what is most likely true based on the entirety of the narratives.</comment>

<comment>Honest history will always have hope—John Hope Franklin.</comment>

<comment>I question the current discipline's personification of "white supremacy," ascribing it nearly supernatural, shape-changing powers which manifest when it's "compelled to change...form." Nell Painter is admirable not least in being able to claw her way up the ruthless academic ladder at a time when some of her reviewers wouldn't befriend her ideas, but she still comes with a point of view. Sure, the USA harbors social discrimination that favors whites more often than it favors blacks, and probably will for a long time, given that in-group dynamics are a cultural universal. Yet American whites lack the sense of solidarity as a racial group needed to maintain an ideology of supremacy. Even Peggy McIntosh's 1988 "white privilege" concept, assuming it remains descriptive of American society, is a far cry from supremacy; she must look to the possibility of being followed about in a store for an example. Inevitable push-back against the American black lobby's ongoing demands brings some ugly rhetoric to the surface; yet very few educated whites buy the once-fashionable genetic inferiority theories, few want blacks returned to a position of subjugation, and few tolerate levels of bigotry taken for granted 80 years ago. If white supremacy had been so viable as is claimed, I doubt either the Civil War or the Civil Rights Era likely prospects. This is because agitation by blacks and their allies, while it matters a great deal, wasn't sufficiently powerful to force wholesale political change in America by itself. Cooperation came from the racist side as well, not through love of blackness, but an admission that supremacy ideology and democracy cannot countenance one another's faces. They chose to value the latter higher.</comment>

<comment>"...history; which is, indeed, little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind."Gibbon said it in 17 words, the author in 1296.</comment>

<comment>"But the external structures of white supremacy . . ."  WTF?</comment>

<comment>Its simple, you are supposed to think. Just accept. And if you don't just accept their view then you are a racist.</comment>

<comment>This article paints activism with too broad a brushMinority activism is illegitimate, where as majority activism should be encouraged even if it diverges from "neutral history"This means that the purpose of history is always to serve as an instrument for nationalistic influence, anything less is just stamp collecting</comment>

<comment>Hope is against all odds. History cannot defeat it, nor living in a war zone, nor being abused. It is the human spirit and the intangible essence of life. I know that my ancestors and my children's ancestors were sent to the desert by two different empires to die. I know that in the last five generations our families have lost five languages (three European, two Indigenous). I know my history.But I'm still here.I've been scarred and battered,My hopes the wind done scattered.Snow has frizz me, sun has baked meLooks like between 'me they done tried to make meStop laughin', stop lovin', stop livin.But I don't care.I'M STILL HERE. -Langston Hughes(From memory--sorry for errors.)It is irrational. I don't care. I have two children. So I hope.</comment>

<comment>I've been deeply affected by Coates' thesis on whiteness as a perspective that guarantees privilege.  It helps explain the persistence of racism without racists because racism is reformulated simply as entitlement instead of discrimination.  Somehow the former is more palatable than the latter. Everyone wants to feel entitled right.At the same time I am reminded of that moment in the movie "12 Years a Slave" when I start to feel sympathy for the slave owners, whites so trapped in a pernicious and morally corrupt system that all they can do is accept what has been called an "Auschwitz logic" where good become evil and evil good.  Everything backward yet in its place.  American racism continues to function like this.</comment>

<comment>These arguments seem to point towards segregation as the solution. Is that what you are proposing?</comment>

<comment>How  about an end to white entitlement and an acknowledgement that racism is real.</comment>

<comment>Honest question.  What exactly would that accomplish?</comment>

<comment>An honest historian would look at Africa not as backwards or stuck in the past. I think a fresh look should be given to Africa as being ahead and the future.Africa is where all humans come from. Its the place where humans have lived the longest. Its also a continent with mostly open borders and many many cultures all living together.And its my theory that Africa tells us what our futures will all be like in places with open borders and free trade. Its a mess basically. The people of Africa are basically doing the best they can in a free trade open borders world. And the best you can do in such a world is a mess.I'd like to see an honest historian take this approach to viewing Africa. I think a fresh look at Africa would be sobering about where globalization is going to take us. </comment>

<comment>The politically expedient lie.     The fabrication that agendas andpolicies of political forces are built on.     “Supply and demand”.  Trickledown economics.  A rising river lifts all boats.     But include, too, “Religion isthe cause of all the world's wars”.  White, heterosexual, Gentilemen are the cause of all the world's troubles.  All women arenecessarily better than all men.  Blacks are not inherently deficientspiritually, morally, intellectually.  Homosexuality is not amanifestation of severe mental problems.  God is not present.     The tenets that underlie Liberalparty swindles may never be questioned, may never be put to analysisand scrutiny, since that will prove them untrue.  The rule is simplyto exclaim, “How can you believe something like that?”  Eventhings like “supply and demand” are steadfastly taught in school,but more leeway is permitted in dealing with most basic credos thatsupport the Republicans.  The reason is the power structure of thetwo groups.  The Liberal party plays mostly to  the “rank andfile”, the general populace, individuals who, for the mos part, areshiftless and never likely to proceed very far.  Individuals whocouldn't raise a genuine, politics shaking objection is they wantedto.  Individuals who could be fed garbage without any worry thattheir believing it will contaminate the overall system.  It's theirnumbers, and nothing else, that make them a political force.  So,while they are fed garbage to keep them content, that garbage isinsisted upon so they will be a reliable power source.  On the otherhand, the rich are allowed to control the system and so must knowwhat's what.  They will say the truths withheld from the dopes.  Bythe same token, though, the truths they know and those they espousepublicly are not the same.  So the tenets they claim are the basisfor their beliefs are allowed to be challenged.  At least in the eyesof the rubes.  Note, though, the leaders of the Liberal party are allmillionaires, too.  They engage in the judicious withholding of truthand espousing of lies just as much as the Republicans.     Incidentally, a case in point.  Onthe Phys Org website today, there is an article, “Evolutionarybiologists have analyzed political opposition to evolution and foundit has evolved”.  A throwaway line in the article, though,encapsulates huge amounts of information.  The reference to the“courts” disallowing the teaching of Intelligent Design becauseit posits a religious view and violates “church and state”.  ButGod is present and is the ultimate cause of all.  Therefore, anylegitimate explanation of anything must involve God.  But “thecourts” have ruled that, even though God is the ultimate source ofall and a necessary part of all truth, to refer to Him is “religious”and, therefore, is not allowed to be spoken!  Anything taught inpublic school, then, must be a calculated, fabricated“interpretation” of carefully sifted facts, backed up byfraudulent “evidence” and “proofs” that the imbeciles are toostupid to question!  Note, for all the emphasis on observation andproof, Darwin did not see a single species arise from anotherspecies!  His observation was of animals that fit their environment,but that is consistent with God being the Creator, also!  It'spraised roundly, but “The Origin of Species” is just conjecture! Another fact the liars who are called “scientists” won't admit!     The orangutan elites in “Planetof the Apes” are expected to be despised for requiring that allscientific declaration be consistent with religious faith.  Yet “thecourts” have declared that any permitted “explanation” foranything must never involve God, even though God is the source ofall, and they are praised!     In a similar way, “the courts”declared, without proof, that embryos and fetuses cannot havehumanness in them.  To facilitate the obscenely clandestinelyprosperous abortion by craven whim industry.  Too, it's not mentionedthat homosexual forces harassed the American Psychiatric Associationwith threats of disrupting all meetings and with blackmail of APAmembers, to force them to remove homosexuality from the Diagnosticand Statistical Manual.  Shills for universal malignance only saythat it was removed, but never once do they mention why!  A conditiondocumented to, among other things, have rates of suicide up to onehundred times as much as everyone else, and to engage in use of harddrugs like heroin as much as twenty times as often as everyone elseand they are trying to claim that is not a mental problem?     The fact is, much if not most ofwhat everyone from “schools” to the “news” claims is just alie, fabricated to promote political powers.</comment>

<comment>The author describes himself as a historian and an an activist.That says it all about what is wrong with our educational system and why millenials are so misled about American history and so out of touch about the reality of American society today.</comment>

<comment>A realistic view of history should lead one to be very hopeful. As serious as the problems are today, they cannot be compared to Jim Crow, much less slavery. Knowing history should give one an appreciation of how just our society is compared to societies in the past, even though it still falls far short of ideals.</comment>

<comment>Sentiments like this make me want to explode, but I will point out an obvious thing.  There must be improvements in all things racial if only for the difficulty protestors have in actually pointing to real events instead of simple feelings.MIcroaggressions are a far cry from our past.  It is willful deceit to act as if history precludes hope.</comment>

<comment>However, if one would like to give up hope, note that the following paragraph is seen as thoughtful by many:"But Coates makes a strong case that the essence of white race politics is self-exoneration and that this truth goes marching on. As in hope and historical narratives, self-exoneration as a driving force will make the bearer crazy, and much of our culture is an illustration, from the well-meaning liberal to the vituperative bigot. As the sociologist Eduardo Bonita-Silva says, America suffers from racism without racists."All who embrace such discussions as meaningful may very well need to abandon all hope.  </comment>

<comment>I remember when "the truth" about Abraham Lincoln's views of African Americans was suddenly made known broadly, maybe 15 years ago(?) -- he wasn't at all sure about actual "equality" and wasn't confident that black and white Americans could successfully co-habitate ... he proposed at one point that American ex-slaves colonize Panama with American assistance, there already being a large black community there, made up of many Haitain ex-slaves who had fled after the rebellion. The African American delegation consulted said no-thank-you.During the recent (ongoing) Princeton/Woodrow Wilson scandal, I similarly suspect that many of those outraged about Wilson's views on race -- he was a segregationist, born 1856, and a witness, if young, of the  reconstruction -- he believe that a generation of segregation was better or "safer" than immediate co-mingling. It does not sound as if he was remotely apologetic or ashamed of his racism. He courted black voters and was apparently very angry when confronted with charges he had failed on his pre-election promises ...I am reminded of the harassed and destroyed all black countries -- as written about by Toni Morrison in Paradise ... https://www.washingtonpost.com...I think it would help if people understood racism better ... I'm not sure how well I understand it. The most interesting book I've ever read in which it was subject was Louis Menand's The Metaphysical Club about the period from the civil war to about the 1880's as I recall -- as the implications of evolution dawned and set science at odds with both the bible but also a lot of superstitious and fallacious "common sense". Over time, I have come to wonder "what racists believe" and suspect that there are several, perhaps a dozen "flavors' ... Wilson for instance was cordial in meeting with black leaders ... he re-segregregated government offices "for the comfort of "eveybody"" ... but what did he "really" believe? I think a better understanding of the shades of gray ... that smiling and courteous behavior be underpinned, as with Wilson, by belief that believe in the "goodness" of segregation ... or with Lincoln, doubts about equality, could still not only demand an end to slavery but fight to bring it about. Sometimes I wonder what racists think about those of us who rail against racism ... do they think they have the "truth" or do they think we're faking it or that so we'll learn our lesson. It's a subject rarely discussed, but the racism of Wilson, a Southerner, and re-segregation did not prevent his reelection ... it may 'horrifying" to realize how different things were then ... but it helps make "change" more clear ... America 100 years ago was another country ... lynchings all to common in the south .... we have miles to go, but we undeniably come some distance...</comment>

<comment>I studied history during a period of optimism-- when the Berlin wall had fallen and the cold war seemed to be ending.  The massacre at Tienanmen Square seemed to be an unfortunate diversion from a general pattern of improved human rights that followed improved technology. Well, I was in that young adult phase of life where I felt invincible and hopeful and the world was full of possibility-- the feminists had fought a good fight to make the world easier for me and all sad things were a matter of history not to be repeated.  Then came 9/11 and that particular jolt of reality which coincided with the onset of middle age and the systematic closing of opportunities one experiences with age and the need to settle in on a particular career, and try to sustain that career throughout a couple of economic recessions.  None of the promises of the progressives are stable right now-- civil rights are still an issue as evidence by police brutality incidents and the inequality in the justice and prison system.  Reproductive rights are under constant attack and women still do not have equal pay protection in the law.  Unions are being decimated in private industry and in many government systems.  Even public education is being deconstructed and privatized.It was a hard lesson of middle age to realize that fighting for human rights in any sphere is not building a foundation upon which one may erect a building.  It is housecleaning.  Thankless, repetitive, housecleaning that allows you to enjoy about five minutes of being done before another mess is made to clean again.</comment>

<comment>While I appreciate the points of your article, you are ignoring a critical element of history. Research indicates that technological change is the dominant force driving general change in the world, and has been for a long time.Long thought to be linear, technological change is now known to be exponential. Further, the exponential progress of computer power is now itself driving technological change in nearly all areas.While I agree with those like Gerd Leonhard who argue that technology is a neutral force, capable of either great help or great harm, in my view historians should give more attention to projecting the kinds of institutional changes that are likely to arise and that should arise in response to this technological tidal wave now roaring towards us.The most destabilizing factor in the near-term is the threat posed by accelerating automation to the workforce and to social stability. (I offer a new solution to this in my new book, A Celebration Society. Though I am no historian, I do bring together diverse historical lessons from little known ancient governmental systems and societies, such as the Venetian Republic and Central Middle Ages).From my amateur's perspective, the value of history lies in the lessons it teaches to guide our future conduct. To offer correct lessons, the historical perspective needs to properly reflect the most influential force.</comment>
