<comment>What happens however when the Grinder is grinding in the opposite direction to what is desirable. Incrementally achieving something is not a reason to vote for someone if they are incrementally moving towards something you completely object to.</comment>

<comment>"Incrementally achieving something is not a reason to vote for someone if they are incrementally moving towards something you completely object to."I think that goes in the "You can't please all of the people . . ." category.</comment>

<comment>No, Hillary's actions will not please any liberal. She is a Reaganite conservative and will govern that way.</comment>

<comment>If you genuinely think this then you are an idiot. </comment>

<comment>You're right - she is FAR more of a hawk than Reagan ever was.</comment>

<comment>Your right, I don't think she's as hawkish as the last Bush. Although I'd hate to find out I was wrong. </comment>

<comment>1. PRO-WALMART!2.PRO NAFTA!3.PRO MASS Incarceration4.Pro Bank Deregualtion5. Pro TPP6.Pro WARHillary is a goldwater republican.</comment>

<comment>No she is not.</comment>

<comment>Hillary and her husband have a record that is decidedly ANTI- Progressive!!You cant be a progressive an be a anti- union lawyer for WALMARTYou cant be a progressive and be for Repeal of Glass StegallYou cant be a progressive and be for NAFTAYou cant be a progerssive and be for the TPPYou cant be a progressive and be for the Iraq warYou cant be a progressive and be for the Keystone pipelineYou cant be a progressive and not be for universal HealthcareYou cant be a progressive and not be for universal education through collegeYou cant be a progressive and make millions from WallstreetHillary is no progressive!She isnt even a democrat.</comment>

<comment>Seriously??? You believe all those trolling lies??? U cannot b taken seriously.</comment>

<comment>Those are called FACTS.....Dispute ONE.........good luck!!</comment>

<comment>With a corporatist slant.In a way she's deceived herself, she should have just been herself.</comment>

<comment>Sure, I'll accept that, as it puts me in the same class of idiots as Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Jeff St. Clair, Bill Moyers, Slovoj Zizek, Naomi Klein, Barbara Eherenreich, Michael Hudson, Thomas Piketty, and thousands of other left intellectuals. But you don't know who any of those people are, do you? I didn't think so.</comment>

<comment>You mean Bill Moyers who worked for warmongering conservatives JFK and Lyndon Johnson?</comment>

<comment>You may be more like in the Alfred E. Neuman catagory.</comment>

<comment>The Third Way politics of the Clintons were/are an attempt to by the center left to co-opt the policies of Reagan in order to win elections. A calculation that Labor and the Far Left would stick with the Democratic Party as it courted business interests and moderate republicans with the adoption of Neoliberal economic policies.  The DLC and the Labour party in the UK saw the adoption of Reagan and Thatcher's agendas in their Third Way project as the only way to build winning coalitions.  There is really very little difference between the Obama and Reagan administrations, especially outside a couple social issues like gay marriage, and Hillary is running for a continuation of the policies Obama has put in place.  It is not idiotic in the least to describe her as a Reaganite.</comment>

<comment>Your right if Nixon was a candidate today he'd be to the left of Hillary. </comment>

<comment>You gave no idea what a Reaganite is.</comment>

<comment>Sad but true. I remember Nixon. He tried to get healthcare done but was unable to get Kennedy to agree. However, they did get the Clean Water Act done. If Nixon was running for president today he'd be to the left of Hillary. The Democratic party was different back then, but changed when it sold it's soul to the corporatists. Same with the Republicans. </comment>

<comment>"I think that goes in the 'You can't please all of the people . . .' category."I just wish she would spend some time pleasing the liberals who theoretically make up her base rather than the Republicans who oppose her at every turn.</comment>

<comment>As an aside, I really enjoy your username.  It's like an obscure reference inside of a reference.</comment>

<comment>Thanks!  I'm glad that someone else gets it.  The best references are a bit obscure, IMHO.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely, I don't disagree with you on that. The author however doesn't seem to mention (whether they know or care is another topic) what Hilary wants to push. But surely before we have a discussion about who is capable of doing more, the most imminent and important reason to vote for a candidate is "what" it is they want to do and while I do not dislike the Atlantic, it is at the very least entertaining, I have noticed so much more emphasis on their type of politics rather than on what they want to achieve respectively, to the author this seems almost irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>Best to check out her site. It may not be up to date because she's changed several positions recently. Her site did not have much inthe ways of any detailed policies when I checked a couple months ago but she suely has added more.Also check out Bernie's site. He has fairly good detailed plans and has stuck with his positions.If you need help, ask. Your unlikely to get unbiased info through Atlantic,  but I do have some unbiased policy analysis and discussion sites I can direct you to.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for that. My point was more about the argument being made than my own lack of knowledge. That said i am always happy for more and i would love to check out some of your policy site</comment>

<comment>The problem with that is she needs to please some Dems. She's Republican-lite. For those elite in the business community that she's bound to please, there is a much, much larger base that she will be a sad disappointment. And her experience with foreign interventions, and predisposition to do more only will please the neocons, which again is a small sliver of the base (how many like Iraq or Libya now?).Lui has written better work than this and should have spent his time and tried to do better. However, her whole campaign has had plenty of time, staff, and tons of money for little achievement. You ahould check out Bernie's site and see if there are flaws in his proposals. </comment>

<comment>We had this same argument back in 2008, where Obama was the "gadfly" who had the benefit of being unexperienced in Washington politics, therefore he was seen as untainted by it. Back then, Clinton was the "grinder" too, mocking Obama about how he and his supporters thought the heavens would shine down upon them magically to solve all of Washington's gridlocks.BTW, I was and am a huge Obama supporter.Fast forward 8 years, and Obama has seen that Clinton had a lot of good points. If he were to run again, he'd be the gadfly.That's the problem with young voters. We simply have no memory or historical perspective. Generally speaking, we're always going to like the gadflies over the grinders because everybody wants to be the revolutionary hero and difference-maker. Nobody wants to be the generation that made unglamorous incremental progress.Therefore, Clinton's main challenge is tying incrementalism to a grander revolutionary arc.</comment>

<comment>"Obama has seen that Clinton had a lot of good points. If he were to run again, he'd be the gadfly."I'm curious if you've ever listened to the President's appearance on Marc Maron's cast.  Obama makes clear his belief in grinding and incremental change.  Dispelling some of the exaggerations Clinton managed to tag him with in '07-'08.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Obama ran a nuanced campaign in 2008. His message was "hope and change," but he also talked about giving insurance companies a seat at the table in health care negotiations.</comment>

<comment>"But in reality, she was often making the case internally for more liberal approaches, and often clashed with aides who were more centrist."citation, please.</comment>

<comment>Do your own research. Read news from the 1990's like some of us did when it was fresh.</comment>

<comment>Surely you understand that it's the responsibility of the person making the claim to provide supporting evidence and that those assesing the claim are well within their rights to demand that evidence.  Or is it that you just enjoy being rude?</comment>

<comment>Actually, we're going to have to politely disagree about who's responsibility it is here, but more to the point, this isn't a thing that can be "proved" with a link. There's the whole process of history and current events, which is messy and complicated. I have done my share of scrolling through the microfiche and film in the basement of libraries. I don't know if libraries still keep microfiche, but old newspapers are how you research the news of the time.For those of us who lived through the time, we are well aware of Clinton's liberal and progressive work and influence on the B. Clinton administration. It isn't something that just shows up in a link. Not trying to be rude, but I am getting tired of the "please cite/provide a link" thing as if everything has a link. I apologize. You were just the instance that I responded to.</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic "hit" parade continues, marching dutifully along singing Hillary's tired old song.</comment>

<comment>This article is a thought-experiment about what HRC can do to improve her presidential campaign. The very first paragraph explains both this AND that the author did the exact same thing for Sanders last week.Yes, he did the Sanders piece BEFORE Clinton's. I strongly prefer Bernie, but yelling "HILLARY UNFAIR ESTABLISHMENT PREORDAINED CANDIDATE BLAH BLAH BLAH" at every single article she's mentioned in is just shortsighted and wrong.</comment>

<comment>No its not - she is a proven liar, but has already paid-off the media to defend her name and "reputation." If ever a witch deserved to be burned...</comment>

<comment>The idea that Clinton will be able to accomplish anything is total nonsense. Quite frankly, Bernie's approach has much more chance of success.If Hillary were president, the fact is that her approach would be to try and "work the levers of power" from behind the scenes, and try to be a "one woman show", but the Republican are going to stone wall her like no one has ever been stone walled before. She would face the most resistance of any president in history.The Republicans will do anything and everything to stop her, even she's trying to do something like lower taxes on oil companies. No matter what she wants, they'll do the opposite, every time! And, no doubt, she'll bend over backwards trying to accommodate them!On the other hand, what Sanders is going to do is rally the public, and put public pressure on Congress to act. For Sanders, the people are his weapon of choice to get legislation passed. He'll have people protesting in the street, calling their congressmen, calling into talk shows, writing op-eds, etc. And, he's going to rally people to the polls to get a Democratic congress, and even if he doesn't, he'll create so much public pressure on Congress, they will have to act!Clinton's approach WILL NEVER WORK.</comment>

<comment>How is Bernie going to get people to pressure Republicans where the overwhelming majority of their constituents are virulently opposed to him? How the hell is him calling the entire Democratic party a group of corrupt neocon sellouts going to rally people to elect a Democratic Congress?!Jesus, you live in la-la land. Now I understand why people like you didn't vote before, it's because you have zero understanding of politics.</comment>

<comment>I'm not so sure that there are that many people who are "virulently opposed" to Sanders.  Certainly nothing on the scale of people who do virulently hate Clinton, Trump, or Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Really.  You don't think that all the RWNJs who flip out about Obama being a "socialist" - despite being to the right of Clinton - aren't going to go even more crazy with an *actual* socialist in office?  Keep in mind that those people are ~30% of the population, more than the ~20% or so of solid progressives.I know you're not the person I was replying to, but remember that what brought people out in 2009 to contact their congresspeople wasn't to push for Medicare for all, or the public option - it was people screaming that the ACA was a government takeover of healthcare that would lead to death panels euthanizing grandma.  How do you think those people are going to react to an actual government takeover of healthcare?</comment>

<comment>I was making a distinction between the opposition to his policies he will experience and the notion that people are opposed to *him* the way that they are to Clinton, Cruz, Trump, or Obama.  He simply doesn't inspire hatred.</comment>

<comment>With Obama, "socialist" is Republican code for "the black guy." Bernie is mobilizing huge grassroots support. Hillary is courting Democratic superdelegates. Which one do you think will be more effective in helping win back state legislatures, reversing voter suppression, undoing GOP gerrymandering, getting money out of politics, etc?</comment>

<comment>Which one do you think will be more effective in helping win back state legislatures, reversing voter suppression, undoing GOP gerrymandering, getting money out of politics, etc?Neither.  All of these things, to the extent that they're realistic ("getting money out of politics" is more rhetoric than policy) require effective state and local level action by the Democratic party.  They are not presidential issues.</comment>

<comment>Republican voters are just as tired of the political coruption as the Democrats. ... if you are willing to hold your nose there are plenty of choices. The bully pulpit is one tool Obama had and didn't use effectively. Bernie could tip the balance in the Senate just by Internet fundraising against vulnerable Republican senators. </comment>

<comment>Republicans' idea of "political corruption" is government taking over healthcare, raising taxes, giving free stuff to minorities, and letting disease-carrying terrorist immigrants in to take our jerbs - all the things Sanders wants to work in favor of.  How do you plan to square that circle?</comment>

<comment>If you can't convince the Republican voters , out fund raise and turn out the majority of Democrat voters. That won't happen with Hillary. Grinding doesn't excite anyone.</comment>

<comment>Trump voters like Bernie.Everyone hates Hillary except corrupt democrats.</comment>

<comment>Trump voters are overwhelmingly ignorant racists.  You think @WhiteGenocideTM likes Bernie as much as he does Trump?</comment>

<comment>They hate the establishment and they like self funded people.Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders? Some voters can't decide ...www.cnn.com/2016/.../new-hamps...</comment>

<comment>Like the people in 2008 who couldn't decide between Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul.  So fixated on their opposition to foreign interventions and big banks that they ignored the fact that their reasons for doing so were completely different, and they disagreed on everything else.  Thus are the fruits of profound ignorance.You're saying that like it's a good thing, rather than an indication of the complete failure of democracy in this country that people have no idea which candidate supports their views, and very likely don't know enough to have opinions at all on many of the issues that matter.</comment>

<comment>the enemy of my enemy is my friend.Paul and Kusinich were CORRECT about the Banks and WARS.....talk about ignorance.</comment>

<comment>Clinton's accomplishments amount to bullet points on her personal resume, rather than tangible improvements in governance or the everyday lives of Americans. What Clinton grinds away at, and what she has always pursued, is the accumulation of prestige and influence. At that, Hillary and Bill enjoy almost unrivaled success, as attested to by their accumulation of $140 million or so.</comment>

<comment>I think that Zaid Jilani's well-regarded piece @ AlterNet -- the one that crowned Sanders "the Amendment King" -- provides evidence that Sanders is not merely a Gadfly but has long been, in fact, a quintessential Grinder.I realize that this undermines the effectiveness of your narrative's dichotomy but then *certainly* nothing says that an election narrative has to correspond with the truth.</comment>

<comment>If he were still around, Vince Foster could provide expert testimony that Hillary gets things done.</comment>

<comment>We all know Ted Cruz is the real Grindr in the campaign, with his Teddy Bear looks and bearskin pics.  Just makes ya wanna get all cuddly.</comment>

<comment>He makes a really adorable pseudo-human.  Once his designers figure out how to get him out of the uncanny valley, he'll be a force to be reckoned with.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, it'll take more than a few shots to remove that vision from my mind.</comment>

<comment>I suggest Fireball, although Teddy Bear recommends a nice Appletini.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, it may take both in tandem.</comment>

<comment>OK, let's accept your premise that Clinton is a Grinder. Now tell us exactly what is it that Clinton has ground out? Here's a hint, to get you started: Why Hillary Clinton Doesn’t Deserve the Black VoteFrom the crime bill to welfare reform, policies Bill Clinton enacted—and Hillary Clinton supported—decimated black America.By Michelle AlexanderFEBRUARY 10, 2016http://www.thenation.com/artic...Need more hints? Here:Iraq. Syria. Libya.I'd say your characterization of Clinton is groundless. Or perhaps, Grind-less.Sanders, on the other hand? He's been grinding it out for his platform for decades. Some Grinders have to do so, for so long, to make one meaningful, necessary change. Like a political revolution?Regard Nelson Mandela. What did Mandela accomplish? Not many things. Just one important thing. Mandela was a gadfly. Such an annoying gadfly, his country kept him in prison for decades. Until he wore them out.What about Gandhi? Same story.We in the U.S. need to reverse course on the skewing of inequality of income and wealth. Few things are probably as important for the health of our social fabric.Sanders has focused his entire life and career on what matters most. Clinton has been focused on her career.</comment>

<comment>The author fails to recognize that Bernie supporters don't want another Grinder. We've had that for the last 7 years. Yes, governing requires compromise. You can't go in and get everything you want. Bernie supporters know that he's not going to get single payer passed. What we like about Bernie is that, unlike Obama and Hillary, he's at least willing to try. Hillary and Obama take things like single payer off the table before negotiations have even begun. It's no wonder Republicans see Obama as such a pushover. How do you respect an opponent who's making concessions before he's even sat down at the negotiating table? Grinders like to pat themselves on the back and say "I was able to make a deal with the other side." But making deals just for the sake of saying you got something done isn't something to be proud of. It actually makes you look weak. Oh and let's not overlook the REAL reason Hillary is opposed to sweeping change. It's because her big donors oppose change.</comment>

<comment>Gadfly is a pejorative.You must love nazis.</comment>

<comment>So, when Clinton sold out all of the Democrats who opposed the Iraq war, and gave it a bipartisan legitimacy it in no way deserved, what was she grinding for?  When she voted to beef up our internal surveillance of citizens with her votes for the Patriot act, what was she grinding for?  When she lent her voice to efforts to increase incarceration rates and open up private prisons, what was she grinding for?Bernie supporters who oppose Clinton do so not because they don't want half measures, but because they are concerned that she'll choose full measures that are out of line with their values.</comment>

<comment>I worry about the deals she will make with the Republicans. They will obstruct her as much as they've obstructed Obama, if not worse. But to get something done, anything, she might have to make one of those "grand bargains" Obama was reportedly ready to sign with the GOP Congress. Goodbye cost-of-living raises for SS recipients, and who knows what else.</comment>

<comment>"Getting things done" is only desirable if you approve of what gets done.What Hillary "gets done" is taking care of Hillary. Does anyone remember that the prime target of Progressive-Era progressives was ... corruption?</comment>

<comment>Grinderman - No Pussy Blues</comment>

<comment>Endorsing a proposition as disruptive and foolhardy as the Iraq War doesn't seem very incrementalist. Neither would supporting interventions in Syria and Libya (ideas, which reports suggest, Clinton pushed for as Sec. of State). Also, ending Glass-Stegall (an act very long established at the time) doesn't seem to be something a "Grinder" would do either. It seems as though Clinton is only for an incrementalist approach when the issues are potentially disruptive from a progressive point of view.I find it interesting that people speak about Clinton as though she's a really skilled manipulator of the difficult machinery of Washington politics, with major examples where she's gotten major things accomplished when less skilled operators couldn't. What about healthcare in the 90s and all the inner fights that Liu says she lost within the Clinton Administration? Hillary Clinton is such a lightning rod and so hated by Republicans that her proposals - even if they're milquetoast - aren't likely to be implemented either. It's the worst of both worlds; she's a polarizing centrist.</comment>

<comment>"Polarizing centrist." That's too funny. On matters of war, she's center-right, and on matters of by-the-people-for-the-people, she's pure pay-to-play.</comment>

<comment>Grinding toward personal enrichment at public expense ... not a good thing for democracy</comment>

<comment>The only certain result of Clinton's grinding -- whether or not she's nominated or elected -- is the further enrichment of the Clinton Foundation and of sundry Clintons.</comment>

<comment>She gets things done alright.1.NON-Union Walmart is now the countries largest employer ,destroying main street and sending US money to Communist totalitarian China with its gulags and slave labor, paying so little its employees qualify for food stamps and other state and federal help to survive.2.Pushed for mass incarceration {of Blacks} who were left behind by her polices.3.Pushed for and endorced NAFTA that not only destroyed US jobs and wages but Mexican ones4.Pushed for Keystone that would have been an environmental disaster5.Pushed for TPP that would have US workers comepeting with literal slaves6.Clinton also had no problem with deregualtion of banks that defrauded the western world and wants to let them continue their criminality.Thats just her economic disasters.</comment>

<comment>Foreign policy is parallel. She is a conservative </comment>

<comment>She is worse than an consrevative she is a neoCON.</comment>

<comment>To make the case as a Grinder, doesn't Clinton have to show some actual accomplishments?  I.e., "working within the system, I got the ___________ legislation enacted, solved ____________ as Secretary of State."Anyone care to fill in the blanks?If she's going to run as "someone who gets things done," doesn't Clinton need to identify something that she's actually gotten done?</comment>

<comment>She helped get the invasion of Iraq done.On the other hand, I heard one of her spokespersons excuse that vote by saying "That was a long time ago." So, maybe she doesn't want to take credit for that accomplishment.</comment>

<comment>And the invasion of Libya! Which means that she was instrumental in starting the flow of MENA refugees to Europe.She has lots and lots of accomplishments!</comment>

<comment>"[Hillary's position on the TPP] was not only a substantive flip-flop. It was so naked it amounted to a bold and clarion statement of faith on behalf of flip-flopping itself. It suggested a whole style of campaigning and method of governing based on the principle of unprincipledness.She’ll get things done. (Whatever those things happen to be.)"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10...</comment>

<comment>She makes the windsock Romney look positively consistent and principled.</comment>

<comment>Roughly speaking one might call them the FDR and LBJ approaches, no? Problem is that LBJ employed his considerable ability at horse trading, using back channels, and working the system to get things done to actually...get things done. He didn't back off Great Society or civil rights because it wasn't serious enough; he damn well made it serious. Hillary doesn't have that ability, or even the inclination to try. The "triangulation" of the Clintonistas isn't grinding, it's finding the sweet spot where you don't HAVE to grind, and who cares where that actually is.Speaking of LBJ, he was both probably the best dealmaking President of the century, and really, really coarse. A favourite tactic was to try to intimidate the other side by showing off his penis. Just something to keep in mind when the respectable classes talk about how vulgar and uncouth the outsiders are.</comment>

<comment>LBJ also reportedly liked to hold conversations with people while he was on the can.But whatever, the guy was a political genius. If it weren't for that war, he'd be the greatest modern president.</comment>

<comment>Economic illiteracy on the left is Clinton's biggest problem. Leftists insist NAFTA destroyed the middle class even though there's no evidence to support it. They also believe that Glass-Steagle's repeal is the primary reason for the 2008 financial crisis even though it had little or nothing to do with the crisis. It was effectively a dead law when it was repealed and had nothing to do with the selling of toxic financial packages.As long as leftists get their information about the economy from Lyndon Larouche posters, Clinton will be fighting a headwind of idiocy all the way to the convention. After all - Bernie Sanders voted against the 2008 bank bailouts that saved our economy from complete ruin and his supporters love him for it. </comment>

<comment>Between all the people who don't understand economics and all the people who understand economics very well, there's precious few people who want to vote for Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Conjecture. At the end of the day, Americans will vote for the person they think will f$&k up the economy least. That means Barry Sanders couldn't win a general election against Michelle Bachman.Hillary Clinton has been accused of many things. Being stupid or cluless about the economy isn't one of them. Barry Sanders has been praised for many things. His astute knowledge of the economy - or even basic comprehension of how it works - isn't one of them.</comment>

<comment>The national mood has changed. The problem is not that Clinton is stupid or clueless. The problem is that she is for the 1% class. We saw that act already, and mounted by someone much more likeable -- Barack Obama. Americans really want change now.</comment>

<comment>Well said </comment>

<comment>Barry Sanders couldn't win a general election[...]Barry Sanders has been praised for many things.Wait, Barry Sanders is running for President now?  Count me in.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>The guy can't even spell his namesake right (Ashurbanipal), so what do you expect?</comment>

<comment>NAFTA turned Mexico into a narco-state. It was not the American demand for drugs. After all, Mexico had been supplying drugs to the US since the 1960s without much of a problem. What happened?What happened is that NAFTA flooded Mexico with US-subsidized Big Ag crops, leaving millions of small Mexican farmers unable to compete. Most of them had only two options: enter the US illegally and hope to find work or become drug dealers. Some did both, of course.The increase in drug dealers led to increased competition, and because disputes in the underworld can't be settled in court, they are settled with violence.</comment>

<comment>Respectfully (as respectfully as i can say it) that's absurd. There's been no increase in the number of drug dealers. The cartels were alive and well long before NAFTA and their primary bread-winning products aren't grown in Mexico. The cartels are fighting over territory and market share. THEY decide who's a drug dealer in Mexico. They are in effect corporatized crime. The idea that a guy goes from being a farmer to cutting off heads with a chainsaw because He had to compete with US corn-growers is hyperbolic and far fetched.Mexico had a trade deficit prior to NAFTA and today enjoys a surplus along with a larger economy and higher wage workers. There was indeed a shakeup in Mexico's agro-industry but Mexican agriculture is alive and well. Small farmers moved to the cities to get jobs in factories or to the US to wash dishes - not to become button men in the Mexican mob. These are two totally unrelated affairs.</comment>

<comment>Interesting conspiracy theory with no basis in reality.</comment>

<comment>Seriously, to anybody who thinks that this article is proof of the Atlantic's bias towards HRC:The very first paragraph explains, clearly, that this is a thought-experiment about how to improve Clinton's presidential campaign. It also states that the author wrote a similar article about Sanders last week. Conclusion: Author not biased, is just playing with campaign theory. I'm all for Bernie, but ya'll need to chill out.</comment>

<comment>"Of course, Clinton will hardly need to make explicit contrast to Sanders, whose record in Washington is relatively free of legislative accomplishment."Totally free, I think you mean.Not that Clinton has a whole lot more to show.</comment>

<comment>Come on, this is just stupid and illogical. Sanders has spent eight years as city mayor, sixteen years in the US House of Representative, and nine years so far in the US Senate. Meanwhile, Clinton has served two terms in the US Senate, four years as Secretary of State, and the rest of her life, she's been Bill's wife. But Sanders is the gadfly?Clinton is not a grinder, anyway. She and her husband have cultivated a false image of being big progressives, but they're not. They don't hate gays, granted, but they're corporatists. They're the folks who did the Republicans' dirty work, slashing at the social safety net, passing NAFTA, and ending Glass-Steagall. And Bill was the cool one. You really want to see what his wife is capable of?</comment>

<comment>Clinton is not a gadfly or a grinder, she's a lobbyist.</comment>

<comment>Well said; this is exactly right.</comment>

<comment>It hadn't occurred to me before reading this, but Clinton needs to cultivate Barney Frank. There's a voice who understands how things get done, and who can be entertainingly dismissive of those who don't. Regardless whether it's on behalf of Clinton, I would love the hear what Frank has to say about all of this.</comment>

<comment>I heard an interview with Frank in which he supported Clinton. I don't think Frank is a fan of Bernie's. Barney moved to the middle-of-the-road over the years.</comment>

<comment>As much as I like Bernie, and have for years, at this point in our history we would make a grave mistake nominating him to represent the Democratic party for president in 2016.We are a deeply and closely divided nation. The next president is going to have to govern with nearly half the nation hating them and wanting them to fail from the 1st day. And Congress is also likely to be divided. Democrats need a candidate who first and foremost is likely to win the general, and he or she needs to know how to use the executive office to consolidate the gains made by Obama and to make a bit more progress, while helping the Republicans complete their journey off the cliff.</comment>

<comment>LOL hillarys strong suit is that she has the support of all of the democrats in congress, where as Sanders has none, and that is where business will get done..not in the oval office..sanders cannot and has not built a consensus or trust and respect among those he has worked with on a daily basis and those who best know his capabilities are among that group, not among the american idol voting young</comment>

<comment>She just needs to start winning some states. Voters see their choice. Clearly your unfamiliar with his work in Congress. </comment>

<comment>I see your point, but not having friends in Congress might be a testimony to Sanders's good character. Congress is a pit of sleaze, bought and paid for. I admire a guy who isn't part of that.Btw, I don't see why Clinton supporters think a GOP Congress will work with Hillary. That party will do its best to obstruct her. The only thing they'll agree on is which country to invade next.</comment>

<comment>Clinton a grinder? Wallet vacuum, at best.</comment>

<comment>How about the fable of the Hack Political Writer and the Lame Story That's Already Been Written 1,000 Times This Election?</comment>

<comment>What exactly has Clinton gotten done?</comment>

<comment>I think Sanders probably has the aptitude to govern effectively. If he's elected he'll probably learn very quickly what he needs to do in order to lead the country and then he'll look a lot like Hillary Clinton. The Bernie Bros will howl that he's betrayed them the same as some of Obama's supporters did when they realized he wasn't their President but is instead the President of the United States. If Sanders wins and doesn't figure that he'll be a colossal failure.</comment>

<comment>So Hillary needs to re-create herself yet again?  The reason she can't win is because she's a phony, always has been.  Her answer about her honesty was priceless.  I'll try my best to be?  Really?  I don't think I ever lied?  Really?  They should of asked her, so you were dodging  sniper bullets in Bosnia?  She's laughably out of touch with reality.</comment>

<comment>one of the problems is that, while hillary clinton is very intelligent, she tends to try to get too clever by a half. this leads her to believe that she can fool people with clever answers. for example, her answer to the question of disclosing the transcripts of her paid wall street speeches was ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Uh, no.  She's a blatant pathological liar.  That's her problem.  </comment>

<comment>hillary clinton's campaign is based on the premise: "don't dream for too much, be practical, be gradual"; that is the kind of message that will appeal to older voters who don't want too much change. thus, it is no surprise that hillary clinton does so well with older voters. she is the better candidate for the political status quo.for bernie sanders to be effective requires that voters go all in on change. that means not only voting for president, but voting for congress, voting for governors and voting for state legislatures. so if there is an energized public that is willing to commit to a sustained effort of political change; bernie sanders is the better candidate.one of my criticisms about the supporters for barack obama in 2008 is that they voted for president and thought that they were done - they didn't vote in 2010 when the congressional elections were at stake and didn't vote in state elections. the koch brothers and sheldon adelsons of the world played the long game better and realized that they could limit any "damage" by president obama by focusing on congress, and on state and local elections.on the other hand, president obama didn't help himself with his "compromise" reasoning; it's not that compromise is a bad thing, but his concept of compromise - that compromise is a means to *avoid* conflict - is a bit misguided.</comment>

<comment>Clinton is neither gadfly nor grinder, she's an enabler.Not the good kind.</comment>
