<comment>Religious freedom is the right to start your own church in good faith from the government that it's not a scam (too much faith, if you ask me, but we err on the side of freedom). Religious freedom is the right to wear a yarmulke in a public school without being harassed or told to take it off. Religious freedom is the right to say prayers in public and to be free of mandated religious prohibitions and to practice religion or not without registering your affiliation with the government.One must notice proponents of "religious liberty" demand something for or from someone else. Religious liberty wants to refuse gay people secular services. Religious liberty wants to pick and choose which medical benefits its employees should have. Religious liberty wants its iconography on state property and your public taxpayer funded institutions to ask you to sit down and pray with them. Look at this story, private for-profit schools (colleges here, but also schools participating in voucher programs) are worried they're going to lose their taxpayer funding.Your right to swing your fist ends at my face.</comment>

<comment>One must notice proponents of "religious liberty" demand something for or from someone else. Religious liberty wants to refuse gay people secular services. How is that demanding something from someone else?  It would seem that by whether you provide or decline to provide goods or labor, in neither case are you asking anything from anyone else.  Do you think you're entitled to the services of others?</comment>

<comment>How is it not troll?It is basically asking they accept the status of second class citizens as a way of pandering to their bigoted beliefs.</comment>

<comment>So is the bible bigoted and hateful? The bible clearly define marriage as between a man and a woman. It also says sex with the same sex is a sin just like other sins people commit. Yes all Christians have sinned and will continue to sin,, but, these Christians do not try to deny that what they have done goes against god. However, gays want to deny that their behavior does not go against god's word and call the church belief on homosexuality bigoted to get the church to change their belief on this one sin... </comment>

<comment>Discriminating against someone because they don't follow your religion is religious discrimination.</comment>

<comment>Wrong! Your comment is off base.. Religion does not have to accept all behavior. So is it discriminatory to deny polygamous and adulterous behaviors? Most churches frown upon those actions!!!</comment>

<comment>If I am not a member of your religion or follow the tenets of your religion, then you are discriminating against me because of my religion. If you decide to open your door to the public, then you must accept all of the public. What your religion accepts as conduct is irrelevant to what you may do in public.</comment>

<comment>How would one have a business and not open their doors to the public?  Where are the Christian-customer-only businesses?  You want to preclude anyone who strictly follows their faith from doing any business at all.  I'm not a person of faith and won't decry people being coerced into making rational decisions but at least admit you are leaving them little choice.</comment>

<comment>You probably don't realize, but until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it was permissible, and often happened, that businesses would refuse to serve Jews. A half century earlier, Catholics were often denied service. It was in light of that previous discrimination that the religion of the person was added to the classes of discrimination in the CRA-1964.When you open a business, you have obligations to society as well as privileges. A business may discriminate, BUT, only in very narrow areas. Contrary to the extremist's claims, a business is not required to engage in business to satisfy a customer that they would not ordinarily do. Thus, a Jewish butcher could not be forced to sell pork if he did not normally sell pork. But if that Jewish butcher sold chicken then he could not refuse to sell a Muslim customer that chicken.You want to preclude anyone who strictly follows their faith from doing any business at all.Really? If that person strictly follows their faith to the point it interferes with the public's right to not be discriminated against, then maybe that person should stick to staying inside their church / temple / or whatever.</comment>

<comment>I am only saying the opposition claim to infringement on their religion is based on the fact that they will be precluded from practicing any business period if they continue to strictly adhere to their religion.  Your other post implied they had some other non-public business option but I see here in your last paragraph what you mean.  Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Is there a Papal Bull or a statement by Martin Luther or John Calvin or Brigham Young or whoever where they specifically state you can't run a business that serves people who aren't in the religion if you're in the religion? As I recall, Christianity tends to place a premium on spreading the Good News to everyone. That's why In-And-Out Burger prints those Bible Verses on its packaging, but doesn't refuse you service if you're gay.</comment>

<comment>At least in the case of Brigham Young, yes. This has to be historically contextualized: It was the 1850s, it was legal to murder Mormons in Missouri, Mormons had just been kicked out of the last five places they had settled, and thousands of Mormons had died as a result as they abandoned their homes in Illinois in the middle of the winter, essentially at gunpoint, and walked to the Great Basin. Then a Southern sympathizer, wanting to get the US Army out of the way in case the South revolted, convinced President Buchanan to send the Army to Utah to crush a supposed Mormon rebellion that wasn't really happening.So there was very much an us-verse-them mentality, and Brigham Young told Mormons not to do business with "Gentiles" (non-Mormons, in 1800s-Mormon-speak).There is also the Biblical mandate that Jewish people only charge interest against Gentiles (non-Jews, in Bible-speak) (Deuteronomy 23:19-20). Although that wasn't a blanket prohibition on doing business with Gentiles, there are other passages that were sometimes interpreted as prohibiting any interaction at all with non-Jews.</comment>

<comment>Surely, though, that must have been overturned by subsequent Temple theology, much like the racist and polygamist elements of the early Mormon Church have been sanctioned?</comment>

<comment>How does that follow?  They can still sell their wares to the many others who are not gay.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand.  Your statement seems far-fetched.  Do you actually believe that if a shop owner is allowed to say "I won't serve you because you are gay," that that shop owner would never have any OTHER customers?  Seems to be a distortion of reality here.  There are plenty of other religious bigots who WILL frequent that business, no fear about that.</comment>

<comment>Under the law they can't do that.  They don't have that option.  However wrong it is, this is their argument about how their religious freedom is being infringed.  Their right to do business is curtailed if they want to strictly follow the teachings of their church, which again I do not endorse in any way.</comment>

<comment>Imho that is a ridiculous position to take, since all they would do, presumably, is double-down on their "fish advertising."  But I do understand that's the way the state would look at it.</comment>

<comment>That still does not mean that customers can coerce speech from the business owner. If the KKK wants a cake from a black baker, must he oblige?</comment>

<comment>If KKK membership were a protected class, then the black baker would have to oblige (I have no idea how, in your hypothetical, the KKK decided to throw some business to a black business owner, but sure). It's not, though.Title VII specifically names "sex, race, color, national origin, and religion" as protected from discrimination. Membership in the KKK fails to meet any of those criteria. Similarly, I suppose, you could refuse service to Rotary Club members.</comment>

<comment>"If KKK membership were a protected class,"Yes, some animals are so very much more equal than other animals, aren't they? Why should black bakers have rights forbidden to religious bakers? Aren't the laws supposed to apply equally to all? To quote Angelo Codevilla,At increasing speed, our ruling class has created “protected classes” of Americans defined by race, sex, age, disability, origin, religion, and now homosexuality, whose members have privileges that outsider do not. By so doing, they have shattered the principle of equality – the bedrock of the rule of law. Ruling class insiders use these officious classifications to harass their socio-political opponents. An unintimidated statesman would ask: Why should not all “classes” be equally protected? Does the rule of law even admit of “classes”? Does not the 14th amendment promise “the equal protection of the laws” to all alike? He would note that when the government sets aside written law in favor of what the powerful want, it thereby absolves citizens any obligation to obey government.http://www.powerlineblog.com/a...</comment>

<comment>I think you might have missed something: It's not that black bakers have rights that religious bakers don't (in fact, I'd hazard most black bakers are religious bakers), it's that the KKK isn't afforded the same protections as a church. If the KKK established itself as a religion, with a 501(c)3 designation with the IRS, then members of the KKK would be protected from discrimination. Of course, to do that, they could no longer discriminate their membership on the basis of race, which would destroy the KKK (this might be the worst possible hypothetical you could have chosen, by the by. The Rotary Club would have been far better).We have, as a country, established these protection for certain groups because it became apparent (and then, later, morally unacceptable) that without the rule of law to protect them, the country would engage in discriminatory practices against them. White citizens would keep black people from voting, from spending money freely. Protestant citizens would prevent the Catholics and the Jews from doing the same. WASPs would keep Italians, and Poles, and Russians, and Blacks confined to their own small neighborhoods in impoverished areas of cities, and direct their city fathers to spend less per capita than other areas.Moreover, these laws are applied equally and to all. There is no one in the United States that lacks sex, or race, or color, or national origin, or religion (even Atheists count as having a religion) as defined by the law. Discrimination against any on the basis of such protected classes is illegal, full stop. Thus the NAACP cannot restrict its membership solely to black people (as the Spokane, WA chapter learned to its embarrassment). Want to join the National Organization for Women as a man? You're welcome to pony up $35 and get your annual membership! Interested in joining the Order Sons of Italy in America even though you're Irish? As they say in Rome, "no problema!" The Catholic priest can't kick you out of St. Patrick's, even though you're Anglican.</comment>

<comment>our ruling class has created “protected classes” of Americans defined  by race, sex, age, disability, origin, religion, and now homosexuality, whose members have privileges that outsider do not.And that is false, regardless of who said it. The goal is to provide everyone with equal protections and opportunities under the law. No one has a statutory right to more equality or have more privileges than an "outsider". But go ahead and try to show an example.Does not the 14th amendment promise “the equal protection of the laws” to all alike?Yes. That is why under Section 5 of the XIVth Amendment, Congress is entitled to enforce that concept with appropriate legislation.Yet, if you believe your right to discriminate is being infringed, then you are wrong. Under our Constitution, you do not have a right to discriminate against another person.Nadine, you never fail to live up to our expectation for bigotry.</comment>

<comment>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is a collection of statutes, and the public accommodations provisions are not based on the Fourteenth Amendment.  Do you contend that Congress has, pursuant to its powers under the Interstate Commerce Clause, prohibited discrimination against members of the Ku Klux Klan?  If so, please cite the statute number where such prohibition is codified.</comment>

<comment>Angelo Codevilla sounds like the kind of person who, in the name of equality, would give people in wheelchairs the right to use stairs like everyone else.Such 'equality' is useless, of course.</comment>

<comment>Tom, thanks for making my point better than I ever did (or could)! If discrimination prevents a group of people (gays) from participating fully in a bedrock institution of society (marriage) then the proper role of the Federal Government is to prohibit that discriminatory action (fundamentalist Christians in the common marketplace refusing to provide services to gays).No need to consider motive, just end the discrimination.</comment>

<comment>It depends.Recently a lesbian baker in Colorado was asked by a hate advocate to bake a cake with a long, hateful writing on it. She offered to bake the cake and decorate it, but she would supply the materials and allow the customer to write on it.When the customer complained, the Civil Rights division agreed that the baker had made a reasonable accommodation.http://rhrealitycheck.org/arti...Contrast that with putting two grooms on top of a cake or two brides. The cake is the same in every respect as that prepared for a traditional marriage couple with that exception. There is no hateful message requested or anything that would imply hate. </comment>

<comment>If he was just buying a cake, yes. If he wanted a cake with a burning cross on it and a racial epithet, no. But a pastry is content neutral.</comment>

<comment>Yes, if the business owner is in the business of making cakes for the public.</comment>

<comment>It depends on the specific laws but in general that Black Baker will have to provide a cake if he doesn't want to end up in court.Now if the KKK wanted a decoration showing a Blackman getting hung they could safely be refused. In the same way in a place where discrimination against Gay's is illegal the Baker would have to provide a Wedding Cake if they normally sold Wedding Cakes. They could probably refuse to have same sex figures decorating the cake.</comment>

<comment>A similar case happened in Colorado. A lesbian (although that is irrelevant) baker refused to bake two bible shaped cakes with derogatory writing. The baker offered to bake the cakes and supply the equipment but the customer could write his own verses.The Civil Rights Division decided that the baker made a sufficient accommodation. She was not required to produce something with "derogatory language and imagery."http://www.thedenverchannel.co...</comment>

<comment>No, he or she does not have to oblige.However, such a refusal has nothing to do with religious discrimination. It has to do with the reality that the KKK, like the Nazis, classifies some human beings as subhuman and treats them as such. Why would anyone agree to serve anyone else who promotes the idea that you (and all like you) are subhuman?</comment>

<comment>Because if you don't serve them, you are no different from them in using arbitrary standards to discriminate against others.</comment>

<comment>Bollocks! It is hardly an arbitrary standard to refuse to serve anyone whose creed is that you are an inferior person or subhuman undeserving of any rights before and under the law.Those who exempt themselves from treating others as equal are de facto the enemies of mankind and civil society. To refuse to serve them is quite justified on those grounds.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Private vendors used the same argument to refuse to serve blacks.At least you are consistent in being for discrimination of all kinds, except when you 'feel' you are being discriminated against.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You clearly have not understood what I have said in earlier postings.</comment>

<comment>Second reply: Why did you not understand that I said earlier on this thread that in this situation any Jewish baker has an inherent right of refusal? I also gave the reason why: which had nothing to do with religious beliefs.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, bub.I don't consider a whole assortment of people as my "equals"Nor do I need to.Think on that before you respond.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter what you think. What matters is how you act. When you act in manners that deny the rights and freedoms people have -- limited only by the reality that you may not infringe upon their freedoms any more than they can infringe upon yours -- then you are denying the fundamental principle that underlies equality before and under the law.When you throw that away, you have effectively thrown away your own freedoms and your entitlement to fundamental justice, one which arises solely out of your civil equality with others before and under the law.I hope you can understand that civil equality is the cornerstone of a free and democratic society. It does not give way to a distorted sense of religious freedom that permits anyone to de-construct civil society on religious grounds.</comment>

<comment>Freedom of association is one of the cornerstones. It also is a freedom to NOT associate.There is also no duty to associate.The baker who chooses not to cater is exercising that right.Your argument fails because you expect people to act even though they are exercising a right not to act.</comment>

<comment>Of course you are free to associate or not with anyone you want to. That is not to be confused with the 'freedom' to discriminate against anyone on so called religious grounds.</comment>

<comment>Except when you choose not to associate with a "protected" class.Right ?Funny, how you keep forgetting that proviso</comment>

<comment>You are not free to discriminate in any fashion whose effect is to reduce or  eliminate the exercise of human rights by anyone else.Freedom of association in its negative sense means that you do not have to enter into a partnership, become friends with, or become  a companion with anyone you choose not to in your private or public life. You can, for example, join a group of like-minded citizens and refuse to join other groups.It is very twisted reasoning that leads to your idea that freedom of association implicitly allows discrimination in the exercise of civil rights by anyone else.No freedom sanctioned within a civil society gives you any rights to discriminate against others</comment>

<comment>You're like a child reciting catechism by rote with no comprehension.</comment>

<comment>You simply have no comprehension that all human rights are civil rights, mutually endowed upon each other. When you refuse to respect those same rights amongst others, you are claiming that while you have rights before and under the law, they don't.Rights are not 'own' rights, but mutual and held in common. When you treat a right as a property that you can exercise without limit, then you are, in effect, claiming an ownership that you do not have and that no one need recognize.</comment>

<comment>You're really stupid.</comment>

<comment>WOW...Took you a whole month to gestate that post ?And you call others stupid ?<snicker>Crawl back under your rock, you pathetic cockroach.</comment>

<comment>Danke for confirming it. I just read the article.</comment>

<comment>Whatever..Enjoy your rock.</comment>

<comment>Interering with the public's "right" is very one sided.Who is interfering with the right of the businessman or woman to run their business?Next you will be telling me that the customer doesn't have the right to take his or her business elsewhere...Which has been the way most Americans view these things...</comment>

<comment>It is accepted law that a public business may not discriminate. If your intent is to discriminate, then don't open for the public.Try reading the Constitution sometime. Start with the preamble. Businesses have no rights, the people do.</comment>

<comment>In light of the Hobby Lobby farce decision, I wonder what will happen when a twenty-first century Ollie McClung sues in federal district court, claiming that his deity tells him that serving barbecue to black and white customers together in his dining room is an abomination, but offering take out service only to black customers is honky dory.  (Not a far fetched claim in the South, BTW.)</comment>

<comment>Farce is right.</comment>

<comment>In a few years, the Obergefell decision will be ranked in the same league as Dredd Scott.</comment>

<comment>In a few years Obergefell will be in the same class as Brown v Board of Ed., Loving v Virginia, Arizona v Miranda, US v Windsor, and Heart of Atlanta Motel v US.Dred Scott v Sanford is in the same class as Gonzales v Raich, and Burwell v Hobby Lobby. Decisions just waiting to be overturned.</comment>

<comment>LOLTalk about deluded.Dredd Scott had some tragic "unintended consequences"..So will Obergefell.And the problem with so-called progressives, is that being short-sighted and totally enamored with their imagined solutions, they NEVER consider the long-term.One only has to look at what's happening with Obamacare, and the recent spate of $15/hr minimum wage results.</comment>

<comment>Is the monkey-boy off his meds again?Obergefell is good law and consistent with several previous decisions. Hobby Lobby is bad law as it creates a new form of discrimination out of nothing and is contrary to previous decisions.Obamacare is not perfect. It is though, a hell of a lot better than what we had before. The unfortunate part is that the health care industry has found the holes in the law and are using that to expand their wallets.Just keep dancing there monkey-boy. Just keep dancing.</comment>

<comment>I think the answer is going to involve repealing or severely limiting the RFRA. The ACLU is right on this one.</comment>

<comment>Then he will be charged by the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ.Hobby Lobby was a poor decision. However, it was based upon the concept that the government offered an alternative of having someone else pay for the birth control. This was set up to mollify religious institutions that morally objected to reproductive rights. Alito expanded this work around to non-religious institutions. His reasoning (true or false doesn't matter) was that a woman would still be covered regardless.I think the CRA-1964 is fairly settled law. I also think Hobby Lobby will be overturned soon.</comment>

<comment>HL is also self-insured. All claims are,paid directly by HL, hence the permission of a religious exemption.</comment>

<comment>Many a place of business or places to stay overnight had signs that read:  NO JEWS AND NO DOGS ALLOWED.In the North.  In the South, no black would have dared to show their face at the front door of many places, and although they could shop at stores, they could not try on shoes or clothes but had to hope that if they bought them they would fit as they would never be able to return them.,   All these establishments were usually run by good Christians or Jews.</comment>

<comment>They should have special signs saying "Christian customers only - all others need not enter".  See how that public pronouncement affects their bottom line.  Some would not have a problem with that.</comment>

<comment>I might be fine with this if it were somewhere, like, say, San Francisco where you know that sign would only appear in a few businesses.  The problem is when whole towns start putting up that sign.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps they need their own country.  Discriminationville.</comment>

<comment>See below, re: Uganda.</comment>

<comment>I think most people who discriminate based on gayness would probably also discriminate against Africans...</comment>

<comment>True. For a long time the Bible was used to discriminate against Blacks and women. Society evolved and is still evolving.</comment>

<comment>Well, for quite similar reasons they tried to carve out their own country from the US about 150 years ago.</comment>

<comment>They think they had one, which is why they're still so pissy today. I love it when the Dutch Rudder each other while dreaming of moving to Norway or Sweden, where there aren't any ebil darkies.</comment>

<comment>s.</comment>

<comment>In my hometown, my cautious estimate is that 1/3 of the Backpage escorts say "no blacks" in their ads.</comment>

<comment>"They should have special signs saying "Christian customers only - all others need not enter"."____And to get around the problem of folks falsely claiming to be Christians just to get served, they should get one of them new-fangled heart-judgin' devices.</comment>

<comment>They're called private clubs. We have them all over the south. </comment>

<comment>Sure, but with regards to taxation, advertising, and a whole host of others issues they are missing out on many non-trivial benefits that 'real' businesses get.</comment>

<comment>Business owners granted business licences by their communities take advantage of many things supplied to them by their community: a market, roads, infrastructure, currency, the rule of law etc. and in return businesses need to observe the standards of that community, including contracting to serve the general public, not just those they approve of.If a store owner wants to discriminate against a class of person  - and let's face it, it seems that quite a lot of Christian businesses do - they need to set up a club, which is permitted to practice selective discrimination.</comment>

<comment>Your faith may prohibit serving black people in your diner, but put up a "Whites only" sign and see what happens! Your right to practice your religion exists, but it is by no means absolute.</comment>

<comment>I have friends who are photographers and they really don't want to photograph a gay wedding because of their beliefs. They don't hate gay people they just don't agree with gay marriage. Them being honest with a gay couple that they would really not be the best to photograph their wedding because they don't support gay marriage, is this acceptable or do you try to run them out of business?</comment>

<comment>The photographers might have a better case, since they are more directly participating in the festivities than just dropping the cake off at the hall.</comment>

<comment>I am a part time photographer. I fail to see how the couple being same sex would make much difference in my approach. Nor, is doing a wedding an art form.Photographing a mayor cutting a ribbon, the local Congressman shaking hands, massive storm damage, or a traffic accident are all the same. I record the event; I don't become part of it.</comment>

<comment>What if, for personal or religious reasons, you don't want to support storm damage, handshaking, or traffic accidents?</comment>

<comment>They can suggest there are other Photographers that will do a better job given how uncomfortable with the subject but if the wedding organiser insists (whether it's because they have limited choices or are simply pr!cks) then the photographer would have to provide the service. Of course they can always subcontract it to someone else.</comment>

<comment>The photographer may decline if they are booked or on vacation that weekend. You may not force someone to do something they are incapable of doing or do not do as part of their normal business*. Most reputable photographers, though, would recommend someone else if they were unable to book the wedding. That is one reason why you should book your wedding photographer well in advance.Often photographers offer discounts either by themselves or in conjunction with a hall or other bridal function. If that is the case, it becomes harder for the photographer to decline the service.In the New Mexico case though, the photographer outright refused due to her religious disapproval. It was because she blatantly discriminated, she was sued.* As an example of not forcing someone to do something they don't ordinarily do, you couldn't force a Jewish butcher to sell pork. But if the butcher sold chicken, he must sell to a Muslim customer wanting chicken.If the photographer didn't normally take pictures from a hot air balloon, you could not force one to shoot a wedding in a balloon.</comment>

<comment>However, religions that choose to operate in modern secular states DO have to accept all behavior, if they choose to operate in the public sector. You can always move to Uganda.</comment>

<comment>"You can always move to Uganda."____Well, that's just not true. Have you even bothered to look into how to get a work visa for Uganda before you say such a thing?</comment>

<comment>Now THAT'S infringing on religious freedom.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they'd get a little help through divine intervention.</comment>

<comment>Frown all you like.  That's religious freedom.</comment>

<comment>And religion can continue to frown all they want.  No one - that's no one at all anywhere is denying churches the right to frown on anything or requiring them to perform ceremonies that are against their beliefs.</comment>

<comment>No, religion does not have to accept all behavior. BUT, we aren't discussing religious practices. This is about what a business must accept. And those are fairly narrow to where a business may discriminate.If you are worried about what a religion accepts, then close the door to your church. What you don't get to do is force your religion on the public. Forcing your religion on others violates THEIR religious rights and is wrong.</comment>

<comment>So Freedom of Association is no longer a thing, prog?I notice those who hand out these orders always seem to live in gated communities themselves. Why is that?</comment>

<comment>Well, there is Nadine to demonstrate her hate.Freedom of association has nothing to do with opening a public business. If you want to gather in your KKK circles and hate, you are still free to do so. But, you may not put your hate into your business.</comment>

<comment>Do you check to see if people have tattoos or wear clothes of mixed fabrics or men with shaved beards? Nobody believes you when you hide your bigotry under religion's skirt.</comment>

<comment>Yes. The bible is bigoted and hateful.</comment>

<comment>Spouting old lies. The bible is anything but clear on the definition of marriage. If people were so strictly following the bible then they would also be rallying for all interracial marriages to end. And what did Jesus ever, EVER say about homosexuality?</comment>

<comment>They did.  Loving v Virginia.</comment>

<comment>Not much. But he talked about divorce a lot. The Christians nowadays seem to have scrapped that bit.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Read ahead a bit to Matthew 19:21-23 and then tell us if you support the Republican economic agenda.</comment>

<comment>the term homosexual did not even exist before the 1870s so not sure how it got in your bible allegedly written thousand of years ago.</comment>

<comment>DOH !What a stupid and ignorant question"homosexual" is an English language construct.The English language did not Exist 2000+ years ago either.Are you sure you want to ask such an obviously stupid question ?</comment>

<comment>Actually, they'd be picketing Red Lobster.</comment>

<comment>In response to your question: yes, the bible is bigoted and hateful.I'm sure your question was intended to be rhetorical. You thought you were scoring some kind of Socratic point with the question "so is the bible bigoted and hateful?"But you're not Socrates, and the Socratic method isn't for you. Don't ask questions unless you know what the answers are.</comment>

<comment>Anyone is free to say to a church that the church's views are wrong. I don't have a problem with that.Any church is free to hold their own views and practice them in their own church.The problem is when the church attempts to control things outside the church. Don't want female leaders in church? Fine. It's your church. Don't want female executives in your business? Nope. That's wrong; it's unfair and discriminatory, and it needs to be regulated so that males and females have equal access to the executive positions.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the Bible is bigoted and hateful.For example, it calls for genocide against religious minorities:	Psalms 79:6: "Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name."</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Wasn't God the author of this psalm, at least to the extent that he inspired the human author? Was God in a fit of despair, and later found these words untrue? That doesn't sound very omniscient/omnibenevolent to me. What else can I disregard because God (or his ghostwriter) was in a "fit of pique"?Or are you saying that the Bible was written by humans and that we shouldn't take it literally?How can I tell when it's what "one man said" and when it's really god's word? Isn't everything by Paul just what "one man said"? He never even met Jesus.</comment>

<comment>"However, gays want to deny that their behavior does not go against god's word..."___If, as you imply, you think that such gays are wrong, then that means that you think gays are incorrect when they deny that their behavior does not go against God's word; in which case, they should *admit* that their behavior does not go against God's word; and if you think *they* should admit that their behavior does not go against God's word, then obviously you personally think their behavior does not go against God's word.I've got your back on this one: gays should hereby stop denying that their behavior does not go against God's word, and-- like you-- *proclaim* that their behavior does not go against God's word.Well said; stick to your guns on this one.</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>If the Bible objects to homosexuality and you can derive a moral rule that says we should discriminate against gay people then yes, it is bigoted and hateful.</comment>

<comment>Based on the wide and diverse number of faiths that trace their genesis to the Bible, each with significantly divergent beliefs based on the same writings, the Bible must be the least-understood and most mis-interpreted book in all of human history.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  It is.</comment>

<comment>You mean that book that says women are less than men and gives guidance to stone non believers is bigoted and hateful?Why I never...</comment>

<comment>Also, yes, the bible is bigoted and hateful at parts: Just ask the Canaanites, you philistine.</comment>

<comment>That maybe so, but, the laws of the US are not based on Biblical law. We (last time I checked) use the Constitution as the basis - which is based on the Magna Carta, not the Bible as some people like to believe.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the Bible is bigoted and hateful. Very much so.</comment>

<comment>Yes it is. It also calls for killing all male practitioners of having sex with same sex. Would you like a quote?</comment>

<comment>Not to mention taking a disobedient child to the elders of the village to be stoned to death.</comment>

<comment>> So is the bible bigoted and hateful?Yes.</comment>

<comment>Wait, where does it say this? If I recall correctly, Jacob had twelve sons from not one but two wives, Rachel and Leah, and two handmaidens, Bilhah and Zilpah. The Twelve Tribes of Israel are quite literally founded on the relations of one man with four women, two of whom he didn't marry, and one of whom he explicitly married only because he wanted to marry the other, and he had to marry the older daughter before he could also marry the younger.Nor is this some kind of weird exception. Abraham passed around Sarah like a party platter, and had an out-of-wedlock child with his serving girl Hagar at Sarah's request. Lott had sex with his daughters. None of these acts were ever condemned in the Bible. None of these acts prevented the actors from being considered prophets or holy men. And that's just the first book of the Bible. So I'm struggling to see where you get this idea that the Bible is somehow unequivocal on the notion that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.</comment>

<comment>'Lott had sex with his daughters.' - More like the story of Hott.(If you think 50 upvotes is a lot for a comment, wait until people read this one)</comment>

<comment>Ya but, ...</comment>

<comment>the bible is kind of bioted and hateful, yeah.</comment>

<comment>The bible defines marriage as between one man and multiple women. Secondly "gay activists" dont want to change the definition of sin away from sodomy, divorse, adultry, pornography, having a shower on the sabbath, swearing or even mixing wool and yarn. They just want the same civil rights as everybody else in civil society.</comment>

<comment>Betty Bowers, America's Best Christian, explained Biblical marriage quite clearly a few years ago:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Classical. Thank you.</comment>

<comment>"...having a shower on the sabbath..."____Actually, that's a sin in the Old Testament only. Jesus specifically said that since the Sabbath is made for man and not man for the Sabbath, it's permitted to have a shower on the Sabbath.And then the Apostle Peter said "What the hell is a shower?"</comment>

<comment>The biblical definition of marriage is irrelevant in a secular, constitutional republic.</comment>

<comment>The bible also says that marriage is sacred yet you dumb ass christians get divorced more than anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Yes it is full of bigotry and hatred. Have you ever read it cover to cover?</comment>

<comment>Putting yourself and your "righteous" form of sinning and saying that somehow this makes you better than an entire class of people seems to me like a perpetual and unrecognized sin of "pride". Sounds to me like you're guilty of exactly the same thing you're accusing gay people of. Time for some introspection maybe? Pride is a one of the seven deadly sins, after all. Have you asked forgiveness for thinking you're somehow better than a gay person lately?</comment>

<comment>Actually, if you take away all of the veneration and indoctrination, the Bible would be see as being bigoted and hateful more often than not. In fact, one must be blind or willfully ignorant to not notice just how bad the Bible actually is. </comment>

<comment>The Bible "clearly defines" a lot of things that you people tend to hypocritically overlook in your rush to discriminate against gay people.</comment>

<comment>Tom Rogers; a bible is kind of like a gun, put into a closet under lock and key, no one gets hurts. Bring them out and depending on the user, all hell breaks loose. We all need to take a deep breath and remind ourselves that in order to live in a society, there are limits to those constitutional rights. None of these rights are absolute.Were they absolutes they would contradict each other and make the whole thing unworkable.</comment>

<comment>Uh, the Bible even gives instructions to a husband of two wives as to how to devise an inheritance.  Deuteronomy 21:15-17.Read your Bible, Mr. Rogers.</comment>

<comment>The bible is one of the most bigoted and hateful tracts ever foisted off on humanity</comment>

<comment>Actually the Bible doesn't clearly define marriage as between a man and a women. You are skipping over the parts involving a man and many wives, between a man and his wives and his concubines, between a man a women and any widows of deceased brothers.I will admit the Bible is clear about it been all about the "Man" but that might have something to do with it been a throughly patriarchal document.</comment>

<comment>Neither the Bible nor the Qur'an guide our laws.  Try to keep your religious beliefs apart from legal considerations.</comment>

<comment>This is not a theocracy. It was never meant to be a theocracy because there's no way a diverse group of people could ever live in harmony under a theocracy. The Bible is not a point from which to argue ANYTHING to someone who isn't a fellow Christian. It simply makes no difference and doesn't prove anything</comment>

<comment>Yes, horribly soIt promotes racism, hatred, rape, slavery, murder, genocide.Have you actually read the bible?</comment>

<comment>Amusing.  You've clearly never actually opened a Bible.  How many wives did Solomon have?  How many did David have?  How many did Moses have?But that's all moot anyway.  I find it quite amusing that you have no idea that US law has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the Bible, specifically the OT, in any way.  You see, US law isn't based on the OT or the NT.  US law is based on the US Constitution, not on tribal Jewish law.  Not on anything said by Jesus or not said by him.You come to this forum and pretend you know who has sinned.  We don't care who has sinned.  Sin isn't mentioned in the Constitution.  The US isn't your church.  Jesus didn't write the Constitution.You, sir, are completely confused as to whether you live in a secular country or reside in a church. I suggest you haven't figured it out yet.  In the meantime, I'll tell you: we don't live in your fantasy church.  We live in a secular nation in the 21st century.</comment>

<comment>Bibilical morality? I really like how the Bible promotes father daughter sex in the Sodom and Gomorrah story. These two cities are destroyed because God could find only one set of righteous people... Lot and his family. After all the unrighteous people and Lot's wife are killed, Lot's daughters have sex with humanoid have babies with their father. So using your own Biblical logic having sex with your daughters, Tom if you have any, is not just ok, but righteous. Also keeping slaves is ok according to your Bible. I guess if this is the Biblical morality you want to follow, go ahead... and of course hate the gays.</comment>

<comment>actually, the bible is bigoted and can be hateful. After all, it was written by primitives, living in a primitive culture, thousands of years ago. It would be foolish to think that the human race hasn't learned anything in thousands of years and must abide by social rules that were meant to deal with small tribal communities, surrounded by cultures that threatened to engulf them unless the tribe adhered to rules designed to keep them separate.</comment>

<comment>So tell us about how much has actually changed in the universe since then.We still have tribal communities surrounded by cultures that threaten to engulf them.Some of them may be bigger and more threatening, but basically the game is the same.</comment>

<comment>perhaps, but we now have the experience to recognize it and knowing you have a problem is the first step to resolving it.</comment>

<comment>LOLAnd you imagine that the people a few centuries if not millenia ago, didn't know they had a problem and what the problem was ?2 posts ago, you clearly stated that they knew they had a problem and even had a solution for it.</comment>

<comment>what?</comment>

<comment>Simple logic too difficult for you ?</comment>

<comment>"So is the bible bigoted and hateful?"Uh, YES.</comment>

<comment>Solomon had 700 wives. The Bible does not 'define' marriage as between "a" man and "a" woman.</comment>

<comment>God's word isn't worth a tenpenny fart to non-believers. Hence it cannot be used as an argument in a secular democracy.</comment>

<comment>Old HIV queen.</comment>

<comment>Clever boy, how did you come up with such an imaginative insult all on your own?!</comment>

<comment>The Bible may say that, but God does not.  Some of the writers of the Bible were hostile to gay and lesbian people, but God is not.  No genuine Christian objects to marriage equality, because genuine Christians believe in doing as Jesus taught - living by the Golden Rule.  God's word is love.  There are many parts of the Bible which are loving and compassionate, and are therefore consistent with God's word.  There are also many parts of the Bible which are unloving and uncompassionate, and are therefore incompatible with God's word.</comment>

<comment>"Troll" I gather is prog-speak for anyone who disagrees with you. Nice to see that you are abandoning even the pretense of reasoned argument.</comment>

<comment>I made an argument and insulted him. Bite me.</comment>

<comment>You made no argument, just a baseless assertion that did not address his point. Then you insulted him.</comment>

<comment>It did, waste someone else's time.</comment>

<comment>Is there any place for the government to step in and say "if you provide a service to any, you provide it to every"?That is, if you have a restaurant and you are open for business--can you deny service to someone based upon your own dislike or bias?If you cannot deny service because the federal government has stepped in to say so in reference to one kind of party, is the federal government outside its authority when it steps in to say you must provide the same services to others of a different kind of party?</comment>

<comment>if a restaurant wants to exclude certain kinds of customers all they have to do is make it a private club.  even that probably wouldn't work.this is a case where i think the free market could solve the problem as those who would be denied service would probably rather not do business with those who would not serve them.  those businesses lose customers to other businesses who gladly grab them up.  but then it gets tricky when a corporation can express religious beliefs in the name of the corporation but really only the beliefs of owners and top management.</comment>

<comment>We've tried it that way already in America, and it took a set of federal laws to intervene. There are too many people who were then excluded from all kinds of businesses and places of residency. There were "sundown towns" for many Americans.The government exists to govern and to ensure free and fair access.</comment>

<comment>You can't have a free and fair market without rules. I wish the people tossing the word freedom around so much understood that.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, commercial market? The government has the power to regulate commerce. Church? No power to regulate. No one has to worry about what goes on in their church. And the speech issue matters - if someone makes a cake, it is just a cake. If a baker makes a birthday cake, he is not actually wishing someone happy birthday, he is making a cake for money. The baker can refuse to write a slogan on the cake that he finds offensive, but pasty making itself is...content neutral.</comment>

<comment>The "free market" (tm) dosnt exist to solve problems. It's simply the current situation, warts and roses and all. If you want to solve problems, that takes actual effort.</comment>

<comment>I'd sure hate to work for a company like that.</comment>

<comment>let's see - if you have a restaurant and someone who hasn't taken a shower in a year walks in ...   go figure it out.</comment>

<comment>This is not what's being asked here, is it?This is a religious objection to certain kinds of people. Not a religious objection to people who don't shower.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Of course a restaurant "reserves the right to refuse service" to smelly individuals or drunk individuals, or shirtless individuals. But systemic discrimination based not on the individual, but on the class/classification they belong to: Jewish, or gay, or Black, or female, is something that has been rightfully prohibited by law in many areas of public life.</comment>

<comment>It is odd that white Christian males in America have a hard time understanding how others might be excluded. It is as if they have been somehow privileged to ignore anyone else but themselves...</comment>

<comment>Discrimination based on sexual orientation is not an entirely (or even mostly) white male activity. In fact, minority groups tend to be vastly more religious and less in favor of things like same-sex marriage than whites were. But thanks for playing "Lets generalize huge groups of people into a single box" today.</comment>

<comment>"let's see - if you have a restaurant and someone who hasn't taken a shower in a year walks in ...   go figure it out."____Try to keep the analogies pertinent. You can certainly keep people out of your restaurant for violating appropriate behavior while *in* your restaurant.Telling Christians they can't go into your restaurant is not permissible; kicking out a Christian who is trying to perform an exorcism while inside your restaurant is, though, perfectly legal. Refusing to serve someone because he's gay is unacceptable; kicking out a gay man because his erect penis is currently inside another gay man's mouth is, though, perfectly legal.</comment>

<comment>Ah but you see, there are very few categories of people who we aren't allowed to discriminate against. Being a stinky is not one of them.</comment>

<comment>Listen up, and you listen good.  My people have been discriminated against for too long, and we're not going to take it any more.  Just because we don't do as well in the warmer climates as some of our less odoriferous colleagues, we are made the subject of ridicule.  Would Peanuts dare have a character named "Jewy" that walks around with a giant Star of David for a head?  Of course not.  But "Pigpen" is laugh riot huh?  For shame!</comment>

<comment>What are you going to do? Stink up the place?(sorry, couldn't help it)</comment>

<comment>Is there any place for the government to step in and say "if you provide a service to any, you provide it to every"?My short answer would be yes, but for reasons rather different than the one Harvey Marx gives.That is, if you have a restaurant and you are open for business--can you deny service to someone based upon your own dislike or bias?Again, legally, yes, as long as I'm not denying service based on certain protected categories.  Have you never seen "No shirt, no shoes, no service" signs?</comment>

<comment>"No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service" is based upon health standards and is equally applicable.</comment>

<comment>"No Shirt, No Shoes, No Service" is based upon health standards and is equally applicable.I wasn't aware that eating a hamburger shirtless was so dangerous.  Perhaps the requirements of some restaurants that I wear a coat and tie are similarly based on health?</comment>

<comment>Wearing appropriate clothing is considered as applying equally to all patrons. That policy doesn't consider a person's religion, age, sex, color, etc.But, your stretching is noted.</comment>

<comment>Not explicitly, but you don't think that clothing is often a proxy for race and/or social class?I suppose you also think that employers who discriminate in hiring based on a name are just biased against certain combinations of sounds, not their ethnic or racial correlates?Don't be naive.  I think it's pretty clear how a restaurant that requires a suit and tie is using this rule to shape its clientele, just as it's pretty clear how a club that bans drooped pants is using the rule in a similar way.</comment>

<comment>Yes, we get it, you play Devil's advocate, yawn. Go waste someone else's time with your pseudo-intellectualism.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't think that "no shirt/shoes/service" is personal bias as much as the bias towards lack of attire. This isn't directed at a group, as there are all kinds of people wearing beach clothes.But if there are exemptions to anyone/anywhere, they are limited, right?</comment>

<comment>I'm not so sure.  There are plenty of clubs in the United States that also enforce dress codes against things like basketball caps and drooped pants.  You don't think there's a social/racial component to that?I tend to think that we're actually more exceptional in the discrimination that we prohibit than in the discrimination we mandate or tolerate.</comment>

<comment>Yes, there's probably a racial aspect if it's enforced only against a certain kind of person. There have been instances where well-dressed people can't get into clubs but behind them equally well-dressed people get in, and the distinguishing marks have to do with ethnic appearance.</comment>

<comment>Depending on the reason. But sexual orientation is not a protected class by the federal government </comment>

<comment>That's kind of what's up for debate now.  In some places it essentially is, while in others, not, depending on local laws.</comment>

<comment>That depends. If the denial of service is because it violates your religious beliefs, then you are denying service based upon the customer's religion.</comment>

<comment>Not really. It's based on their sexual orientation or their behavior.  Say the gay couple are Lutherans.  The denial isn't because they're Lutherans.  It's because they're gay.</comment>

<comment>And if their religious practices do allow same sex relationships?</comment>

<comment>My religion allows me to be shirtless and barefoot, but when a restaurant won't serve me, it's not religious discrimination.</comment>

<comment>Actually it isn't. It is a universal policy.Conduct is not protected under Civil Rights Act - 1964. Characteristics are. But you knew that, you just wanted to show you're really a dick.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure if that's still true, if I understand the EEOC's recent rulings.</comment>

<comment>Not every business is a "public accommodation", but clearly, some people would like them all to be.</comment>

<comment>Actually, all businesses are public accommodations. Private groups, such as private golf courses or clubs, are not public and are not allowed to serve the general public.</comment>

<comment>True. Some (a very limited number) are not public accommodations.Bakeries and florists and photography studios don't seem to be exempt, though.</comment>

<comment>NO SOUP FOR YOU!</comment>

<comment>A business that's open to the public under blind conditions should serve everyone who has the standard asking price and doesn't impose any onerous conditions or additional expenses to the business provider.So yes, if I walk into a business that says "We have/do X" and lay my money on the counter I expect to get X even if I'm ugly or talk funny or vote the wrong way.</comment>

<comment>A business that's open to the public under blind conditions should serve everyone who has the standard asking price and doesn't impose any onerous conditions or additional expenses to the business provider.I think that this is one of those situations where you need to back away from abstract ideals and look at the particulars.  Many times discrimination is even legally mandated - think background checks for gun purchasers, or age limits to gain access to bars and clubs.I doubt you were thinking of either of those things when you wrote your comment, but that's kind of my point.  This is not, in spite of what some people may say, an easy issue, and very real competing (public and private) interests and rights have to be balanced here.</comment>

<comment>I know you to be smarter than this.  Those laws are based on an obvious public or "government interest" (which is a term you're probably familiar with).I think this is where you make the wrong turn.  The government only balances public interests, not private interests.  Interstate commerce, for example, public accommodations and licensing of businesses are public interests.  An individual's personal aversion ("religious" or otherwise) to LBGT people, black people, Mormons, etc. is not only a private interest that the state  has no interest in balancing, but runs counter to the public interest.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  We actually mandate discrimination in a number of cases where we believe it to be in the public interest - common examples, as I have pointed out, including things like who we sell guns and liquor to, who we give college scholarships to, and where we allow sex offenders to live.But we hardly stop there.  Have you ever seen a restaurant or movie theatre that posts discounts for white people, or a neighborhood whose bylaws restrict residents by race?  Of course not.  But there are plenty of places that give senior citizen discounts, and a lot of neighborhoods (in Florida) where you can't buy homes in unless you're over fifty.There's no public interest in giving 65 year-olds 20 cents off on a cup of coffee, but as a society, we have no problem with it.  Society is full of these kinds of discriminations that are legal and accepted, but have no broader social utility.An individual's personal aversion ("religious" or otherwise) to LBGT people, black people, Mormons, etc. is not only a private interest that the state  has no interest in balancing, but runs counter to the public interest.In some cases it's a private interest, in others, it's not.  You're doing a lot of lumping there.Contemporary leftist policy too often attempts to treat religious practice as simply something you do inside your own head or home, rather that the public act it has been for pretty much all of recorded history.If you're religious, it's not just a hobby, but a life-shaping force that determines public as well as private actions, and these public actions are protected by the first amendment.</comment>

<comment>You are asking for an exception to the rules for conducting business that every other similarly situated business has to live by. People of faith who want such exceptions are always free to close up shop. Their business isn't their religion.</comment>

<comment>Since when?</comment>

<comment>since when what?</comment>

<comment>Right, their business is not their religion - it's the other way around.</comment>

<comment>That's like saying "well, if you want an abortion, you're always free to get the transvaginal ultrasound, listen to the mandatory lecture, wait 72 hours, and then drive 500 miles".Most people, both pro-choice and pro-life, recognize that there's little difference between banning something, and throwing up significant barriers to accessing it.  That's why one side tries to set up these barriers, and the other tries to tear them down.Likewise, forcing someone to choose between their religious beliefs and the job that puts food in their children's mouths is pretty easily recognizable as a form of coercion.There may be reasons to pursue such a route, coercive though it is - breaking the spine of Jim Crow, for example.  But there are two considerations here:  firstly, that gay American do not actually live in anything approaching a Jim Crow regime, and secondly, that while there are no good first amendment arguments for discriminating based on race, there is a great deal of first amendment precedent that allows people and groups to discriminate based on their religious beliefs.This means that there is not much benefit to be gained from coercing reluctant bakers, and a much stronger legal argument against doing so.</comment>

<comment>forcing someone to choose between their religious beliefs and the job that puts food in their children's mouths is pretty easily recognizable as a form of coercion.Nope. A religious belief is voluntary. Putting food on the table isn't. BUT, the issue is when a business may force others to follow their religious beliefs. Forcing someone to give up their religion and follow yours is religious discrimination.gay American do not actually live in anything approaching a Jim Crow regimeNumbers don't matter. The Constitution applies to everyone, not just large groups.there is a great deal of first amendment precedent that allows people and groups to discriminate based on their religious beliefs.Not in the public sphere. You may do pretty well whatever you want inside your own religion. It is what you do outside the door of your church that matters. It is pretty well accepted law that a religion may not intervene into public life.This means that there is not much benefit to be gained from coercing reluctant bakers, and a much stronger legal argument against doing so.Well, so far the reluctant bakers and photographers haven't fared too well.If this is to be the next big fight in gaining acceptance, then it doesn't look good for the bigots so far.</comment>

<comment>No, it's not the same thing. That is an unreasonable barrier to a legally protected right. No one is throwing up any barriers to the free practice of faith when it comes to views on homosexuals/transsexuals. A devout whatever is completely, 100% free in their belief, and can go to whatever choice agrees with them, and say and do and exclude basically whatever and whoever they want. That is a constitutional right protected by the 1st amendment.The right to run a business however you want, and with whomever you want, is not a constitutionally protected right. The state may, and often does, interfere. Want to employ children? You can't. Want to pay below minimum wage? You can't. Want to only hire hispanics because you believe they are harder workers? You can't.I agree with you, however, that there may not be much benefit in coercing reluctant bakers, and I agree that discrimination based on orientation is not as clear cut as discrimination based on race.</comment>

<comment>I think we're mostly in agreement here, but I do believe there is a religious component to business that you're overlooking.  Take another example:  suppose there were a law that said all butcher shops must sell pork, or they have to cease operation.Do you think that kosher or halal butcher shops might have a legitimate religious reason to oppose such a law?  It seems to me that there are places where public business and faith legitimately intersect.And this is not surprising - for people of faith (I'm not one, but I have friends and family who are), religion is not just something you do on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  It touches on all major aspects of your life, and work is a major aspect of most people's lives.There is also a genuine question of personal autonomy here.  Take a photographer who does event photography, and declines to photograph a gay wedding because she does not believe in the legitimacy of homosexual marriages.  Many people on this thread might not support such a decision, and say that the photographer should be forced to photograph the wedding.  But should that same photographer also be forced to photograph a wedding featuring an orgy?  Or an animal sacrifice?Why is it okay in the first case to neglect the photographer's conscience, but not in the other examples?  I suspect it's because some people don't see the photographers values as important or sympathetic in the first case, but can sympathize with and understand the photographer in the other examples.But it is part of the definition of tolerance that we accept values that we don't understand and sympathize with, not just the ones that we do.There may be a legitimate social benefit from refusing to tolerate certain values, but this is something that needs to be worked out with careful and balanced consideration.  We should not simply cry "bigot!" and act as if other values systems besides our own (and the people who hold them) should be trampled into the dirt.</comment>

<comment>This is my personal opinion, not what the law says, just by way of caveat. The butcher shop is a great example. If the government had a legitimate reason for mandating the sale of pork (I can't think of one), then I think that would be a legitimate regulation, but for the problem that it hinders people from exercising their religion. The jewish butcher isn't hindered from practicing their religion, as the butcher can just close up shop. But the kosher Jewish community may be unable to purchase any meat consistent with their religious code. That, in my mind, WOULD be a burden on the free exercise of religion.In regards to the photography example you mentioned, this is a little more complicated I think, because a photographer does more than offer a service, but also offers an art. That being said,, it is a business, and if the government mandated orgyiests or animal sacrificers a protected class, then yes, I think all businesses should treat them nondiscriminatorily.I do see the photographer's values as important, however, and if, for example the government protected animal sacrificers as a protected class I would probably find another country to live in, but if I were forced to photograph that ceremony or face a lawsuit I would, in this order: 1) take the lawsuit and pay the damages, or 2) find a new profession, or 3) take the photos but provide photos that showed the sacrificers for the monsters they are. You can't sue a photographer for their art so long as they do not misrepresent what they plan to provide.As far as crying bigot goes, well, technically the ones crying bigot are the bigots. I don't like that kind of monotone conversation. I would much rather have the discussion about how much respect we are supposed to afford (or not afford) to personal beliefs that are clearly disprovable, or if not disprovable, incompatible with other elements of a western secular society</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your excellent points; I have enjoyed this discussion.I am less comfortable in relying on a line between a "service" and "art" to make my decisions. This is not a sharp line; European culture, for example, perceived painters as skilled craftsmen, not artists, until almost the 1600's, and after watching a cake-making show on the Food Network, can you really say that there's no art involved in baking?I don't like that kind of monotone conversation. I would much rather have the discussion about how much respect we are supposed to afford (or not afford) to personal beliefs that are clearly disprovable, or if not disprovable, incompatible with other elements of a western secular societyAgreed.  Unfortunately, for various reasons, this can be a rather difficult conversation to have.</comment>

<comment>"Do you think you're entitled to the services of others?"Man, I am so over people misusing the word "entitled".  If I go into a shop and there's a sign that says "Cakes $20" then I AM entitled to a cake for $20. This doesn't mean I am making a slave of a cake-seller or demanding their labor for free.  I am being a customer.  That's how it works.</comment>

<comment>Probably the clearest summation of the issue. Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Thanks!  I guess people realize they can't say- "eyew, some gays walked into my store I'm not selling them a cake!" so they have to get theoretical about it and start talking about freedoms and whatnot.I mean, if these people walked into someone else's store and said "here's $6, I'd like a dozen donuts" and the owner was like "get out, you're not entitled to my labor!" they'd think it was the craziest thing that ever happened to them.</comment>

<comment>Do you also think that if you walk into a gun shop that you're entitled to any gun you can pay for?  Do you think that anyone who slaps five dollars on a bar is entitled to a shot of tequila, even if they're 12 years old?I mean, you may be a hardcore libertarian who doesn't believe in background checks or drinking ages, but then, you'd likely also believe in the seller's inviolate right to select customers.The reality is that our society mandates a good deal of discrimination, from the distribution of college scholarships to where sex offenders are allowed to live.  And you're probably onboard with most of it.We also tolerate, without really thinking about it, a lot of other discrimination.  If I started a housing complex and tried to mandate that only white people could live there, I'd run into legal trouble pretty quickly.  But if the bylaws said that no one under 55 could live there?  Places like that are all over Florida, and no one thinks twice about it, anymore than they think about senior citizen discounts at restaurants or museums [1].The real world is a lot more complex than your hypothetical, and includes a lot of discriminatory behavior, much of which you either fail to notice or tacitly support.[1]  And if discounts don't seem like discrimination to you, then imagine a bakery that discounts wedding cakes for straight couples, but not for gay ones.</comment>

<comment>Do you also think that if you walk into a gun shop...Both of those examples are restricted by Constitutional regulations. Guns are part of the "well regulated militia" and alcohol is part of the XXIII Amendment. If I started a housing complex and tried to mandate that only white people could live there, ...I am unaware of any city denying residents the right to live there. Private clubs though, do have the right to discriminate on who joins them. Where HOAs have had problems is in denying a home owner the right to sell their home to some people.Senior citizen discounts are perfectly legal provided that they apply equally. We can see the same discounts apply to children under a certain age, frequent users, dates, etc. No one is denied the service. Anyone may purchase the service at the advertised price. A discount only applies to those who meet certain conditions and must be applied in an equal manner.if discounts don't seem like discrimination to you, then imagine a bakery that discounts wedding cakes for straight couples, but not for gay ones.Only that would be an illegal discrimination. You are now denying an equal opportunity to same sex couples. How you would justify that is incomprehensible.A senior discount can be justified as seniors may not have as much money in retirement, as respect for their contributions to society, etc. Children discounts can be justified as children don't eat much, the parents buy more, it attracts more families, etc. Multiple purchase discounts are easily seen as encouraging repeat business. So please explain how charging straight people less would do anything other than foster bigotry?</comment>

<comment>Those are terrible analogies.  Can you shoot someone with a cake?  Are you required to be 21 to buy a cake?Do you need me to explain to you the difference between a gay person and a sex offender?Is there a group of people that no one expects won't live to get senior discounts some day?</comment>

<comment>These are not "terrible examples".  They're counterfactuals to your simplistic assertion that stores should sell to anyone tall enough to slap money on the counter.  There are plenty of examples of beneficial discrimination that you are happy to endorse.You need to get beyond "all discrimination is wrong, m'kay" because that's not what you actually believe.Like everyone else, myself included, you believe that some discrimination is wrong, some is okay, and some is commendable, and if you're like everyone else, myself included, the belief comes first and the rationalizing later.  And this is fine for personal beliefs.  But when you're talking about laws that bind whole societies of people with diverse beliefs, you need to be a little bit less glib.</comment>

<comment>"You need to get beyond "all discrimination is wrong, m'kay"Where did I argue that?  That's why I'm saying your analogies are terrible. the point is that if you're offering cakes for sale, you had better have a very good reason not to sell it to me beyond "well, I don't like your type of person, even though you aren't causing me any tangible harm".  Because if you don't have a good reason not to sell to me, I AM entitled to that cake at that price.</comment>

<comment> you had better have a very good reason not to sell it to me beyond "well, I don't like your type of person, even though you aren't causing me any tangible harm".No one in these situations is saying that they're not going to sell cakes to gay people because they don't like gay people; that's your bias showing through.  They're saying that they're not going to make cakes for gay weddings - I haven't heard of anyone saying they're not going make a cake for a gay person's birthday.This is a qualitatively different thing.  If I own a restaurant, and Jewish people eat there every day and I serve them just the same as anyone else, but I refuse to cater the Seudat Mitzvah following a child's Brit Milah because I have a moral problem with circumcision and I don't want to me associated with a ceremony that offends my beliefs, that doesn't (necessarily) make me anti-Semitic.Likewise, if you make gay people birthday cakes every day, but refuse to make a cake for a gay wedding because you believe that matrimony has been ordained by God from the dawn of time to be between one man and one woman and you don't want to be associated with a ceremony that contradicts that belief, that doesn't make you (necessarily) anti-gay.  It does make you anti-gay marriage, but a lot of gay people have historically been anti-gay marriage.  Andrew Sullivan got a lot of flack from the from fellow gay people for his groundbreaking 1989 essay arguing for the legalization of gay marriage, because it was - at the time - often seen as an attempt to impose heterosexual norms on the gay community.My analogies are extreme because they have to be; the nature of the act isn't important.  It's that the act is offensive, and most requests that would be offensive to you are likewise going to appear ridiculous.Let's take another ridiculous, offensive example then.Suppose I walk into a bakery and insist on buying a cake shaped like a penis with the words "Happy Birthday Dickhead" written on it.  Can we agree that someone who finds that kind of cake offensive shouldn't be required to make it?What about any other kind of cake that they find offensive?    Cakes with nude models, cakes shaped like breasts......cakes with depictions of the prophet Muhammad.I think you can imagine, if you actually think about it, why some cakes would be offensive to some people.  And that some of those reasons might even be religious.But here's the rub - you don't get to determine what's offensive to someone.  You don't get to determine what violates someone else's principles.  And you don't get to determine if their reason is a good one.  That's for them to determine.The burden of proof is not on the person who is reluctant to bake the cake or cater the bris.  It is up to society to establish that there is more good to be had by forcing a person to violate their conscience than to tolerate their petty discriminations.</comment>

<comment>Well, according to our laws, declining to provide goods or labor can, in fact, be illegal. Look up anti-discrimination laws.</comment>

<comment>This is true, but the basis of such laws has nothing to do with your negative liberty - i.e. your right not to have others impose onto you.</comment>

<comment>But they have everything to do with our Constitution. Art. 1, Sec. 8, Cl 3; the Commerce Clause allows the government to regulate businesses. The XIVth Amendment allows the government to enforce equality in our lives.There is no right to open a business. There is no right to hate.  There is no right to run a business that denies others their basic equality.</comment>

<comment>If your business is "open to the public" it has to conform to certain laws, some of which involve non-discrimination. Sexual orientation doesn't count as something you can't discriminate against yet, at the federal level, but it eventually will, for the same reasons that marriage equality became law, and for the same reasons that your public business can't discriminate based on gender or race.One could imagine, for example, a religion that says being a particular gender or a particular race is a sin, but it would still be illegal at the federal level to discriminate based on gender or race, even at your privately owned business, because there's a certain baseline decency toward your fellow human beings that we require in order to allow you to operate your privately owned business. There's nothing in the constitution that guarantees you a right to operate a business however you see fit. You can have your religion yes, that's guaranteed, but owning a business that discriminates is not guaranteed: there's plenty of other ways to make a living if you can't handle it.</comment>

<comment>Everyone is entitled to the services of a business on an equal basis.  You cannot discriminate on the basis of color, religion or sex.  If you do, you should not be in business.</comment>

<comment>Clearly, you are not paying attention to this issue at all.  I suggest you keep up.</comment>

<comment>You are arguing that your religious liberty means effectively that you get to choose who is equal before and under the laws.That is not compatible with living in a free and democratic society where all are, at least ideally, equal before and under the law.Either you want to live in a free and democratic society, and act to protect it, or you want to live in one where the law and the courts and every individual gets to treat different people unequally.If you want the latter, you stand against the very principles of human liberty upon which the United States constructed itself as a nation.That means you are for a sectarian state: not a secular one.</comment>

<comment>All freedoms have limits. Your freedoms carry obligations to preserve and protect those of others. The exercise of religious beliefs has always been limited in law, which is why Satanists cannot practice child sacrifice.Your view essentially is that your exercise of religious freedoms is impaired if you are required, by law, to recognize that you are bound to stay within the boundaries of civil and criminal law in that exercise.I am far more in tune with the thoughts and writings of the founding fathers than you believe you are. Those who most firmly argued for civil society were, in fact, the most 'religious' of their day who were frightened that, without a clear separation between church and state, they would be subject to the whims of religious majorities at whose hands they had never been permitted freedom to exercise their religion. That is what many had fled from.And those who persecuted them felt that they were exercising their freedom of religion.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm arguing that negative liberty is not an appropriate justification.  It is possible to justify anti-discrimination laws, certainly, but not on these grounds.  That's all I'm attempting to say in the post you're replying to.Either you want to live in a free and democratic society, and act to protect it, or you want to live in one where the law and the courts and every individual gets to treat different people unequally.I prefer to live in a society where people aren't presenting me with false dichotomies all the time.The law does not treat everyone equally, never has, and never will.  This is actually necessary for the dispensation of justice, as laws that are nominally universal are, in practice, frequently anything but [1].  A just system is one that recognizes individual circumstances, not presents a false façade of universalism.A Baptist cannot legally use peyote under federal law.  A member of the specifically-exempted Native American Church can.  Is this unjust?  In a sense; but it's more just than a universal law prohibiting peyote use for anyone, which would impact NAC ceremonies dramatically, but have no impact at all for Baptists on Sunday morning.[1]  To quote Anatole France: In its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.  Also see Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah.  Universal and equal application of the law is no guaranteed protector of minority rights, and can often be a cloak for suppression.</comment>

<comment>You know very well that I am talking about the principle of equality before and under the law as a principle of fundamental justice.And, I have just used that principle to show why so called religious freedom to discriminate does not exist.Now have I ever said nor implied that equality implies that the laws be applied universally without regard to the unique or special circumstances attached to a particular situation. Such universalism leads, as I have said elsewhere, to people in wheelchairs having just as universal a right to climb stairs as anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Employers pick the benefits they give to employees all of the time. It is up to the employee to decide if they will accept them or not. It's part of the calculus of taking a job.</comment>

<comment>That's true, but it's also true that government significantly limits what working conditions an employer can offer.  For example, they can't say "I'll pay you 25% more to work in my factory that doesn't obey any OSHA rules"  and they can't legally offer pay below the minimum wage.</comment>

<comment>"For example, they can't say "I'll pay you 25% more to work in my factory that doesn't obey any OSHA rules"..."____Luckily, this one is unlikely to come up: the typical factory whose managers would like to violate OSHA rules would prefer to pay you 25% *less*, not 25% more.</comment>

<comment>Name one time in US history where the free market alone ended common cultural discriminatory practices.</comment>

<comment>Whether or not an employer provides certain benefits is not a discriminatory practice.</comment>

<comment>So in other words your comment had nothing to do with employment discrimination.</comment>

<comment>Besides, the free market wasn't responsible for that. Most of those benefits were hard-won by unions.</comment>

<comment>I generally agree, but must point out that the college mentioned here, and religious-affiliated colleges generally, are not for-profit institutions.</comment>

<comment>Russia adopted a law on prohibition of propaganda of homosexuality among minors.If you decided to save children from homosexual propaganda, for example, in Germany, you will have problems with the law and perhaps you land in prison.Many children's father Eugen M. came in prison for his daughter, a school child of grade 4 missed 2 lessons of the so-called sexuality education. Themselves outraged parents called these lessons outright pornography, which is spread for very young children. As it turned out, this is not the only case in Germany.

<comment>Save children from gay propaganda? Wtf does that even mean?</comment>

<comment>on June 5, 2015 turned 34 years from the day that the United States was the first case of the disease of homosexuals with AIDS. Since then, the disease has claimed the lives of more 30 million people. Approximately the same number is a carrier of the infection.If you're a homosexual and came to Russia with your boyfriend, you should know. In Russia, homosexuality is not prohibited.  Has only banned the propaganda of homosexuality among children. You must resist the temptation to tell our kids in Russia  what dangerous stunts you have mastered with my boyfriend under a blanket.Children are the future.During Obama's presidency the USA has not expanded its international legal obligations in the humanitarian field and still participates only in three out of nine core human rights treaties. The Americans have not so far ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (only Somalia has not also acceded to it).</comment>

<comment>So basically telling kids being gay is bad or evil. Somehow I don't think you have much a case to cry over. Maybe I'll just warn kids against Christians and being Christian. Then I can act all surprised when  people call me a bigot!</comment>

<comment>Who is going to protect gay children from anti-gay propaganda?  Religious hostility toward lgbt people can be emotionally devastating to a gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender child growing up in a religiously conservative environment.</comment>

<comment>Bakery refuses to bake cake for same-sex wedding--not fist swinging.Same-sex couple sues bakery--that's fist swinging.</comment>

<comment>It is when it breaks the law. In Oregon, it is illegal for any public business to discriminate against their clientele on the basis of sexual orientation.Discriminating against someone because they do not follow your religion, is religious discrimination.</comment>

<comment>Lol you are basically saying that a church discriminates against anyone  that do not follow that religion rules.  If that's the case, then, everybody discriminates. Because eveybody have rules that members must follow and if they do not follow those rules those people do not get to be a part of that group. So your statement about religious discrimination is  nonsense!!!</comment>

<comment>A church is not a public business.The rest of your argument just went down the drain with that little fact.</comment>

<comment>When I buy a cake, I am not asking to be a part of your religion. And no, I did not say that a church discriminates against anyone that doesn't follow their religion.Under the civil rights laws, it is about the protection of the customer / employee, not the business. The Oregon baker discriminated against the same sex couple because they did not belong to or follow the owner's religion.</comment>

<comment>There must be a way to compromise here. E.g.: bakery can't legally refuse to bake and sell the cake, but they can legally say "all of our plastic 'getting married at the altar' stick figure couples to put on top of the cake are one man and one woman".</comment>

<comment>Yes, "sorry, we don't sell the cake topper you want" is perfectly legal.Of course, if the customer says, "fine, sell me two cake toppers and we'll modify them ourselves to suit our cake" then there must be a sale.</comment>

<comment>Posting the names and addresses of the same-sex couple on social media and inciting a harrassment campaign against them?No, that's totally fine, what could possibly be wrong with that?</comment>

<comment>The same-sex couple initiated the conflict.The baker family also experienced quite a harassment campaign that included death threats and having their house picketed.All of the pain experienced by the baker family and the same-sex couple could have been avoided if the couple had respected the bakers' religious beliefs and gone somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it was so horrible of them to go to a business and try to buy something that the business sells. What next - are they going to want to send their children to the same schools? Sit on the same buses?</comment>

<comment>Or, the baker could have just followed the law and not discriminated.</comment>

<comment>Who is it that's "demanding something of someone else"? The person insisting that someone else be forced to do business with him/her? Or the person who declines to do business with him/her?</comment>

<comment>Freedom of conscience is bedrock on which all other individual liberties are founded. Deny it at your peril.It is the militant secularists who are getting into the faces of other people, not the other way around, or did I miss the part where the courts are supporting the right of traditional Christians to make gay bakers make cakes that declare homosexuality an abomination?</comment>

<comment>Nobody infringes on your right to believe whatever you want. It's the public displays of your convictions we have trouble with - especially when the others get hit by them.</comment>

<comment>The right to believe things in your own home if you STFU is not worth very much. Even tyrants grant that right.But the first amendment does not protect only private beliefs, but the "free exercise of religion".</comment>

<comment>That sounds good too. Your freedom to exercise your religion ends where my freedom to exercise my religion begins, am I right?</comment>

<comment>A gay baker and a straight baker and a Christian baker don't have to "declare" anything.  They should just have to provide the same services to gay people, and straight people, and Christian people that they provide to anyone else.  Is that really so terrible?</comment>

<comment>How about if they sell baked goods to anybody who enters the store, but are free to accept or decline custom orders? That way they don't have their speech coerced by their customers.Before the ruling class instituted the American oligarchy, this would have been an acceptable democratic compromise, protecting rights on both sides.</comment>

<comment>No one's "speech" is being coerced by anyone else.  If you sell cakes with "Happy Birthday" on them, you should have to sell them to Christians or Muslims or gays or straights.  But a baker doesn't have to sell you a cake with a swastika on it if that's not normally what they sell, nor do they have to write "I love gay marriage" if that's not what they do either.</comment>

<comment>Ah, but now they do have to write "I love gay marriage" because gays are a new protected class.</comment>

<comment>Um, no, they really don't.  Unless, of course, they sell "I love gay marriage" cakes to everyone else, they don't have to do it.Isn't there enough in the world for you to be upset at without having to make up things?</comment>

<comment>The article says that under court rulings, based on principles of freedom of speech the baker did not have to write "I love gay marriage." Plain cakes yes, speech that the person disagrees with, no.</comment>

<comment>Wasn't it the militant religious zealots that tried to institute marital inequality to begin with? Oh wait that fact wouldn't support your opinion's conclusion, no wonder you didn't bring it up.</comment>

<comment>Your right to swing your fist ends at my faceI understand your position, but c'mon man, that schnoz gives you an unfair advantage.</comment>

<comment>If you're referring, implicitly so, to the "freedom" of religion that the US Constitution purportedly enshrines then I must complain about the quality of your understanding of the actually legalities that are based in he Constitution.Remember, the Constitution binds the government to people - not people to people.</comment>

<comment>Dr. Clayton Forrester! It has been too long ...</comment>

<comment>Forcing people to provide secular services is not the same thing as denying those services. The individuals can still go out and buy them themselves. The is a significant difference from denying someone something and not supplying that thing.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. What they want is not religious freedom. They want to impose their religion on other people.</comment>

<comment>"Religious liberty wants to refuse gay people secular services."what secular services are they being denied?</comment>

<comment>That is a very thorough "how to" for coercion. Using the threat of lawsuit, blackmail, intimidation, public shaming, incarceration to win the intellectual capitulation of another is thought control through duress. Coercion done properly is a duress crime. I'd like to see these Thought Reform techniques challenged in a court...</comment>
