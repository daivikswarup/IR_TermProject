<comment>"...56 percent of all voters—said they considered the values of Islam “at odds with American values and way of life.”OK - now we are talking real, past the lies and the distorted, manipulated fake quotes.Finally, let's focus on the question of why so many progressives support bringing in the kinds of immigrants who oppose basic American values.The majority of Americans oppose this strange, artificial, anti-American, progressive ideal.</comment>

<comment>Most Americans know little about "the values of Islam." The question presupposes knowledge about these values, and what is seen in the news is negative, with jihadists killing people, not ordinary everyday Muslims going about their lives.</comment>

<comment>If only someone in the SB shooters' family, say, like their brother, had denounced their horrific acts right away.. wait..</comment>

<comment>Yeah, how many denouncements and how fast does it take?</comment>

<comment>I think what some people are looking for is someone of considerable repute within the religion (ie a widely respected, powerful cleric) to launch an official denouncement campaign against radicalization trends. For instance when the Roman Catholic Church's sex abuse scandal exploded, individual clergymen denounced it, but the absence of the Vatican in tackling the matter in a high-profile way made people angrier and anti-Catholic with each mounting case against individual priests. That is, until Pope Francis publicly upended the drowsily-slow defrocking process and pushed for acts toward reconciling the Church's mass corruption.The snag for the anti-Radical-Islam case being, of course, that powerful Muslim clerics are usually sectarian and therefore very divisive, and often very very conservative leading to at least a handful of beliefs or agendas that stand at odds with the West.So my question being: does someone exist who is Muslim, powerful, widely respected in his(/her) community, non-sectarian (or barely), willing to go to bat on the world's stage, cogent, charismatic, and unafraid of radicals attempting to assassinate him(/her)? Or, alternatively, does Islam not need any such figurehead and is fine the way it is? Because I'm under the impression that most causes need a leader, else it's just a sea of random people shouting their support or opposition, and you rarely seem to get too far that way.</comment>

<comment>Grand Mufti is the highest rank among Muslim clergy.  And Grand Muftis have vigorously denounced terrorism and ISIS.  http://www.abc.net.au/news/201... http://english.alarabiya.net/e...</comment>

<comment>Too much wiggle room. It's easy to denounce "terrorism" in the abstract. But the same people won't denounce suicide bombing in Jerusalem, saying that's "resistance" not "terrorism".</comment>

<comment>Easily refuted ignorant nonsense of course.Most potential religious based terrorist attacks in this country since 9/11, especially in New York, have been stopped by Muslim Americans informing authorities.These informants are key and work quite closely with the FBI and local police - they always have.  Under cover Muslim American agents are also well known in places that actually have to face these concerns daily like people who live in NYC and DC for successfully disrupting plots.Islamic terrorism is foiled by appropriate enforcement working with informants and under cover agents, not hysteria. The same cannot be said for the vast majority of terrorism in this country, which is committed by white male Christians.Facts are your friends against being manipulated in to fearful sheeple bleating.http://www.beliefnet.com/colum...http://www.wsj.com/articles/in...https://americansecurityprojec...</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you do not understand what is resistance and what is terrorism.</comment>

<comment>I think those are the two most subjective, and oft-interchanged terms in existence. Have you never heard of the saying, "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter?</comment>

<comment>It's usually a sign of lazy thinking. Most people who turn to terrorism don't care about human rights or liberty, so if they are fighting for freedom, it is only their own freedom to conquer and enslave.</comment>

<comment>man just stop already. the fact that you don't understand this concept just proves how closed-minded and dim-witted you are.</comment>

<comment>"Resistance" is where you kill Jews, which most Muslims support.</comment>

<comment>There are no Jews in the zionist state. They are all zionists forcibly squatting in Palestine.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you're an apologist caught in the helicopter spotlight. </comment>

<comment>A sturdy intro point -- but where to then? A large percent of the Western world is fearful of individuals of the 'other' culture-religion, and extrapolate that fear onto the whole. When, as your one article reads, the Australian Grand Mufti "blamed foreign radicals on social media for fuelling the extremism problem," the obvious followup inquiry is how to cork that flow. How to un-harden the radicalized communities, or influence the leaders of those communities. Because I don't think it's a continuous stream of press release condemnations people really want, but rather tangible action and results that lead to a mere handful -- say, several hundred -- people pledging their allegiance to violent extremism, as opposed to the current situation of tens of thousands swarming to a quasi-nationstate / pledging allegiance.</comment>

<comment>And half of them pledging allegiance with the wrong hand on their hearts.  </comment>

<comment>And, grand Mufti's can say one thing in public and another thing in private as the Koran tells them they have the "right" to lie.</comment>

<comment>Who?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Islam is a religion and a political system. Both at once. It has been so from the beginning; its founding prophet was a warlord and a conqueror. That is not true of Christianity, which arose without political power.Even in the Middle Ages, when the Church became a political power, it was usually opposed to the secular power; it didn't get to rule a theocracy.</comment>

<comment>Oh sure, the Spanish Inquisition wasn't political OR Christianity based!  Give me a break!  The religious leaders of the time were up to their knees in the blood of pagans, Jews, and Muslims.</comment>

<comment>The Spanish inquisition was called the Spanish Inquisition because it was done by order of the King of Spain, not the Pope.</comment>

<comment>And ISIS is slicing off heads upon the order of what religious leader?</comment>

<comment>ISIS is slicing off heads at the order of its self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Baghdadi. "Caliph" is a religious title, in case you didn't know.</comment>

<comment>But Pope Urban II ordered the Crusades in order to retake the territory of and around Jerusalem. That was totally political.</comment>

<comment>Pope Urbain II appealed to the Christian princes at the Council of Clermont to retake the Holy Land from the Saracen. He didn't have the authority to order them to do it.As pope he had temporal as well as spiritual power. But he didn't rule over the princes of Christendom. They were not his vassals.</comment>

<comment>The history of the Catholic church makes the present day Islamic radicals look like amateurs. You are truly embarrassing yourself here. Nice self serving, utterly meaningless hair splitting.  </comment>

<comment>hahahaha you really believe that? bruh, you need to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how truly powerful the Pope was in those times. It's an historically accepted fact that is supported by the vast majority of actual scholars on the subject. but again, good luck with your narrow world view supported by information you find on websites that end with .net</comment>

<comment>So what? Are you really saying there was some sort of separation between Kings and popes? That the Catholic church did not revolve around political power? What an absurd statement, I'm embarrassed for you.</comment>

<comment>And, these people want to be up to their knees in your blood so what you going to do about it?</comment>

<comment>Thats entirely inaccurate. Christianity had Constantine and Charlamagne, each of which were blood-soaked warlords who made Europe 'Christian' through their wars and violence. Fast-forward to the 1500's and Spain brought 'Christianity' to the Americans - through genocide, the eradication of native culture and the enslavement of those not killed by European diseases and atrocities. Thanks to those efforts, Christianity dominates the Americas.Fast forward another two centuries and warlords and freebooters seized the land of Africa and told its inhabitants they were now part of the colonies of Britain, France, Belgium etc and better get started working in the mines for pennies or nothing at all while Cecil Rhodes and King Leopold II lived in guilder estates paid for with slave labor and stolen land. Along the way, Christianity spread by way of the Sharps Rifle.These are facts. Not opinion open to interpretation. They're there for everyone who bothers to look. Claiming Islam carried its religion by sword 1400 years ago while ignoring Christianity's violent evangelism is hypocritical and a perversion of knowledge and history.</comment>

<comment>Thank you! Someone around here with some ACTUAL knowledge of history.</comment>

<comment>Not him and not you, plainly.</comment>

<comment>Constantine was a Roman Emperor. Charlemagne was King of the Franks. Neither king was Pope. Just because they were Christian kings, that doesn't mean the Church ruled through them. They accepted the blessing of the pope, which increased their own authority, but they sure as heck had no intention of handing power to the pope.You are demanding some ahistorical wall of separation between religion and politics. That didn't happen. But what did happen is when the king conquered, whether in the name of Christianity or personal loyalty, he ruled, not the pope. Emperor and Pope were rival power centers. That's a very important feature in the development of the European nation-state.</comment>

<comment>Prior to Constantine, Christianity was a small religion practiced by a minority of Romans. Charlamage made Christianity mainstream and allowed it to become the dominant religion of the empire. 50 years later, Theodosius outlawed pagan religions that had been dominant state religion for the entirety of Rome's existence. There's no way of separating the Roman Empire from Christianity at that point. Why do you think they call it 'The Roman Catholic Church'? Why do you think they call him the Pontiff? The Catholic Church IS Rome. Rome was never secular - it just went from being a Pagan state to a Christian one.Charlamagne was crowned "emperor" in Rome in 800 by the  pope. This was not two power groups competing with one another as would later be the case in Europe. This was two upstart institutions using each other to extend their influence and make something out of nothing. There was no such thing as secularism in those days and the Catholic Church was the ghost of the Roman Empire - it was the facade of religious power but the foundation was the killing and conquering done by guys like Charlamagne (an illiterate Germanic warlord) keeping Europe in the Christian sphere. You can't honestly separate the two, Pope and king, because each depended on the other for validation of their authority. Secularism and mature states were centuries away.</comment>

<comment>"There's no way of separating the Roman Empire from Christianity at that point."Nobody is trying to make this separation but you and other liberals who share the your confusion. We are not discussing a religious church vs a completely secular ruler.We are discussing whether religion and political rule are combined into one in a theocracy, where the same man is head of the church and political ruler, or whether the head of the church is separate from the king, with separate, rival legal and power centers attached to each.Theocracy is the system in the Islamic worldSeparate power centers is the system in the Medieval Christian world.</comment>

<comment>First we're talking 1400 years ago, now we're talking today. Okay.Other than Iran and to a certain extent Saudi Arabia - what Muslim theocracies are there? Bangladesh and Indonesia are massive-population, Muslim majority nations. They're democracies without even a whiff of theocracy. The Arab Middle East has traditionally been ruled by hyper-secular military dictatorships who replaced more theocratic kings appointed by the British. Pakistan is a hobbled, near failed state but its not a theocracy now and not likely to ever be one. What theocracies are you talking about? Even Iran elects its president and legislature. So how are Muslims predisposed to theocracy when the facts say the exact opposite?And what is the deal with equating this to "liberals"? I'm not even that liberal. What vast agenda do liberals have that has anything whatsoever to do with this circular logic nonsense?</comment>

<comment>I was talking about the medieval period. First you jumped back in time to Constantine and Charlemagne, then suddenly you jumped forward and are talking about today.What is common to liberals is a persistent confusion about religion. You assume the opposite of theocratic must be secular.But when I'm talking about the Middle Ages, everybody is religious and does things in the name of religion. But that doesn't tell you whether a country is a theocracy or not. In a theocracy political rule is combined with church rule; the same man rules both church and state. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the Papal States were a theocracy. Other countries were not, even though their kings could act at the behest of the Church. In those countries Church and State were separate power centers.How this relates to today is that the West learned to confine the Church to mostly non-political spheres, chiefly via the Peace of Westphalia after the catastrophe of the 30 Years War. But the Muslim world never learned this. Some Muslim rulers have done it by force, like Attaturk.</comment>

<comment>Your goal seems to be to claim Islam is inherently more theocratic than Christianity? In the process you ignore that most Muslims live and have lived under secular governments, and feel compelled to attempt to deny that Charlemagne and Constantine were involved in theocracy? The idea that the ruler of the state and the ruler of the religion must be one and the same for a theocracy to exist is simply farcical; I don't know if you've invented it for this occasion or if this is one of those bits of rot your political friends love to stuff in your brain, but if you are confused on the point you can and should consult a dictionary.You seem to be unaware that the official line was that these gentlemen were serving at the pleasure of God himself, as expressed through the Pope - that they derived their legitimacy through the Divine right bestowed by the Pope, and were expected to obey the Pope?  If you deny that, I have to wonder what you think of the founding of the Anglican Church - what was the purpose of that, if not to proclaim the King of England a theocrat in his own right, not dependent on the Pope?Indeed, how can a belief that Church and State were separated in medieval Europe be squared with the later historical development of religious freedom amid bloody war? In your reading, why would the Founders have ever worried about the issue at all?Anyway, if you want to pretend that all the members of any ethnic group are not only all alike, but should be treated as if they are all guilty as the worst examples among them, you're just a plain ol' bigot.  I'm grateful most Muslims understand that humans beings are individuals, and won't assume I'm just like you.</comment>

<comment>Calling the Prophet a warlord is like calling Jesus an anarchistic terrorist.</comment>

<comment>Not at all. Just look at what the Prophet did, the wars he waged, the treaties he made (and broke), the conquests he made, with pillage and slaughter of the losers. He was a warlord by the plainest meaning of the term.</comment>

<comment>nah not really. but keep adding your opinion and interpretation to information that supports your narrow world view that you found on random internet websites that was written by non-peer reviewed authors in the past 10 years. Because that's the most reliable information out there.</comment>

<comment>Christianity rose without political power? lol. What a ridiculous conceit. LOL.The history of the Catholic church is among the most bloody and violent in human history - for eons.http://amazingdiscoveries.org/...</comment>

<comment>I believe that when you have a powerful prominent figure monolithically fear-mongering against a religion/cause/system, as Trump is, what may best assist the situation is an equal and opposite force: a powerful prominent figure that is a leader within that system being attacked. It's not 'necessary'; however, I think it would help an Islamically-unread, knee-jerk-panicked American public turn the rather faceless counter-anti-Muslim movement into a proper clash of ideological titans.</comment>

<comment>how many Christians yell "God is great" while mowing people down and then blow themselves up taking out tons of people?</comment>

<comment>Simplistic. Of course they quote J, it's a derivative religion (as is Christianity, but Islam is the dregs).  </comment>

<comment>That is what al Sisi demanded of al Azhar in his New Year's Day speech, that a respected voice in Islam should fight the radical Islamists. Al Azlar is modifying their curriculum, according to this articlehttp://www.al-monitor.com/puls...But the Wahhabis have been proselytizing for 30 years, funded by Saudi petro-dollars.</comment>

<comment>In the time it took you to write this you could have found dozens of condemnations of the attacks in Paris, of Charlie Hebdo, in San Bernardo, and of ISIS in general by leaders of major Muslim organizations including entire countries, with a simple Google search or two.http://www.timesofisrael.com/j...</comment>

<comment>The OTHER snag is they do not have a Vatican or anything like it.</comment>

<comment>If anything, these incidents take place in order to make a political point. Nothing to do with religion. Unless, that is, you are talking about the Planned Parenthood type of Shootings.</comment>

<comment>And I reject that. Politics and religion are endlessly entwined. Islamic terrorism's political point stems from hardline supremacist religious convictions; just as a person with a hardline Christian view of fetal terminations as an absolute equivalent of developed-persons' terminations might murder people in Planned Parenthood. If politics is powerplay and religion is belief, all you have to do is convince yourself that that belief is worth killing for. Politics & religion entwined.</comment>

<comment>Won't happen. </comment>

<comment>How about 70,000 of their religious leaders declaring a fatwa against terrorism?http://timesofindia.indiatimes...</comment>

<comment>The father knew his son supported ISIS. Maybe if he had called someone BEFORE his son decided to commit mass murder in the name of Allah...but he didn't, did he?</comment>

<comment>Sort of like how everyone who knew Dylann Roof should have called "someone" BEFORE he decided to commit mass murder in the name of whiteness? Or maybe if one of Steven Kazmierczak's friends or family had alerted the authorities about his mental illness, love of guns, and obsession with murder, every thing would have been ok!Who will handle all the self-policing you expect Americans to do over one another? What will they do-- arrest people who have thoughts and aspirations to harm Americans, but have not acted? Prevent them from legally purchasing weapons, despite not having committed a crime? Keep them under expensive and questionably legal surveillance?</comment>

<comment>Who knew Dylann Roof? By all accounts he was a loner without any close connections.That's different from Syed Farook.</comment>

<comment>The same Syed Farook that colleagues described as "quiet"?"He's a little bit shy, a little bit withdrawn. He doesn't mix with people easily," said Mustafa Kuko, director of the Islamic Center of Riverside where Farook was a regular.Doyle Miller, Farook's landlord, said he had "no cause for concern" when he rented out a townhouse to him in Redlands."He had no red flags whatsoever; everything checked out," Miller said. "He had good credit reports ... everything."We screen our people pretty good. It's unbelievable what's going on."Farook's family knew him as someone who "always kept to himself," as did his wife, according to Abuershaid.http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/03/...</comment>

<comment>His family knew what he believed. His father has already admitted as much. And he didn't build those pipe bombs by himself. This was not a lone wolf attack.</comment>

<comment>You mean you "don't think" he built those pipe bombs himself, because it is totally possible people can build bombs without bomb makers.Just check out the bombing at the Boston marathon. </comment>

<comment>I know that a neighbor of his says he saw some very suspicious activity involving half a dozen Muslim men, but he didn't say anything to anybody because he didn't want to be called an Islamophobe.</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying your wrong - I'm saying you don't know and are making assumptions. My other point is that people don't need a group to make a bomb. Especially a pipe bomb (which I know from experience as I made a few when I was a kid).I probably would have called the cops - I am that cranky neighbor - but I would also understand if someone didn't call the police on those guys. What are they gonna say? "Hello, um... There multiple middl easterners congregating next door."And the police would respond, "what are they doing?" And then the guy can reapond, "I don't know, there's just several middle eastern men next door"And the police would have told him to call back when they actually do something they can be in trouble for. Because being a male who looks like he came from the Middle East isn't a crime. </comment>

<comment>Well we know he had one friend because that one friend is currently awaiting trial for not alerting authorities to the Dylan threat.http://m.live5news.com/live5ne...</comment>

<comment>Dylan Roof's Parents knew he was a violent racist that was "radicalized" by the internet, yet they didn't say anything either.  That is an unfair standard.</comment>

<comment>The difference is that Roof acted against religious teaching, but Syed Farook acted in accordance with it.</comment>

<comment>Utter bullsh!t.   See Brother Donny Reagan.  There are some muslims who preach terrorism.  There are some Christians who preach racism.  And no, I am not engaging in false equivalence.  No religion is monolithic, there are aweful strains of all of them.  There is a buddhist calling for the genocide of muslims.  Just about any ideology can be (and has been) used to justify killing others.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't the father live in Pakistan? That was a rhetorical question - I know he lives in Pakistan. You expect foreign nationals to "call" our security services when they think their kid may be into radical Muslim theology? </comment>

<comment>Why not?</comment>

<comment>I don't like to be the guy to break this to people but the Pakistani people by and large aren't big fans of the United States. They seem to take it personally that we use drones to attack Pakistanis in Pakistan and the. There was the whole raid to kill bin laden.But their governement kinda likes us. </comment>

<comment>True. Thanks for this info. Very enlightening. I was thinking of the larger ethical issue of ratting on one's child for the greater good when I asked "why not".</comment>

<comment>My kids are so young, I have yet to be put in a situation where I may have to call the police on them, or the FBI or any agency for that matter.Maybe his dad just didn't want to be the one to put him in jail. Maybe we all see the good in our children, so it makes it so hard to accept when they take a dark turn.It's also possible that he just thought it was a phase. Maybe he thought like a lot of people that all he needed was an education and a good job and he would be happy, and thus not dangerous.I really don't know why he didn't. I do know though that we are not very popular in Pakistan. </comment>

<comment>What was wrong with the denouncement they DID make?</comment>

<comment>It wasn't on Fox News, there were no fighter jets flying overhead, and the denouncement did not end with a fireworks display.Disclaimer: I actually watch Fox everyday, so I am not exactly attacking the network. But it is fair to say that most of the people who would ask that question about denouncements only get their news from Fox. Thus, if it's not on Fox, it didn't really happen. </comment>

<comment>We do know about the values of Islam. We know that fatwas were issued against anybody associated with Rushdie for writing a book.We know about Charlie Hebdo.We know about Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris still in hiding after five years. We know about Islamic anti-semitism and Islamic honor killings in the USA.We know about the many opinion polls showing support for Shariah and terrorism and the Islamic death penalty for apostasy.</comment>

<comment>Meh. 8 million American Muslims. They are well assimilated and basically middle class and higher.http://www.pewresearch.org/200...If you focus on the worst aspects of Islam, notably violent Jihadis, of course you have a negative view.</comment>

<comment>Since you are dishonest, you will never acknowledge the polls which disprove your propaganda.</comment>

<comment>There are a lot of polls. There are also 8 million American Muslims and (fortunately) damn few problems with them.I'm irrilegious and don't understand the appeal of Islam, orthodox Judaism, Christianity, or much of anything this side of Bhuddism, which is at least interesting and useful to the individual practitioner. But I don't fear religions per se. Just some of their followers who act out violently.You on the other hand seem obsessed with this Muslim thing. Get some perspective.</comment>

<comment>I think he's mainly referring to that well-debunked poll from The Star: http://www.theguardian.com/com...</comment>

<comment>Most American Muslims are Indonesians and Indians. Not really the source of the problem. But it's not as if we don't have radicals and haven't suffered attacks. Wanting to defend ourselves from more San Bernardinos is legitimate.</comment>

<comment>Spudsie, you are off your rocker.</comment>

<comment>Sort of like those "Christians" in Africa.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>I've consistently seen the total as 2.7 million American Muslims. So, less than 1% of the population and, prior to becoming the Republicans chief object of hate, they voted Republican about 70% of the time.</comment>

<comment>Makes sense right? They are conservative so they tend to vote conservative. That is, of course, unless you publicly attack them as a problem. </comment>

<comment>We also I know what you said isn't indicative of the values of ALL Muslims.  Therein lies the problem.</comment>

<comment>We know that there are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world.  If even the barest majority of them were militant and intent upon destroying our "freedoms," do you even think we'd be having this conversation?  Seriously - that would pit 800 million Muslims against 326 million Americans.  Two+ Muslims to fight every man, woman, and child in the US.  Do you honestly believe that nonsense?</comment>

<comment>Your post is very stupid.  Your number counting is silly and irrelevant.In fact Islam is targeting our freedoms, regardless of your pointless and meaningless number twiddling.</comment>

<comment>Translation: "I don't like dealing with the reality of the situation, because people who are different from me are scary!"  Go hide under your bed.</comment>

<comment>Bullshit. It is NOT a fact, and you saying "in fact" does NOT make it so. That's such utter and complete poop of a statement. </comment>

<comment>Although this website is an attempt at humor - a parody site - in fact, Dearborn's police HAVE in a sense implemented  a Shariah-inspired policy of arresting Christians who distributed Bible tracts OUTSIDE but within a few blocks of an Islamic festival on a PUBLIC street.A blatant violation of the 1st Amendment in order to cater to Muslim power in Dearborn.</comment>

<comment>So no Dearborn Michigan Shariah at all. Really </comment>

<comment>Nope - except for what I posted. THAT was real - and can reasonably be viewed as the enforcement of informal Shariah by the Dearborn police, even though it was not actually in the law books.</comment>

<comment>Ok good it's not as bad as I thought. So did Trump mess himself up on this temporary ban? It makes total sense to me, but the media act like he's suggesting something super radical. </comment>

<comment>We do know about the values of Christianity.We know that for many centuries Christian leaders conducted torture and grizzly murder of alleged heretics.We know that slavery and anti-Semitism were justified by references to their sacred book.We know that millions have been massacred on behalf of Christianity.We know that despite their claims to peace, love, and tolerance, many Christians support the death penalty as well as violent and intolerant attitudes toward those of other faiths.There FTFY. No charge.</comment>

<comment>We do know that you have NOTHING- so you are laughably forced to go deep into history to find a valid way to b*tch about Christianity.This discussion is about current events. If you want to complain about the Middle Ages and the Crusades - you and Obama can join your buddies in Al Qaeda. They do that every day.Finally, you have a lot of chutzpah to bring up the topic of anti-semitism, since your  Islamic allies are responsible for 98% of the anti-semitism in the world today - and YOU progressives are responsible for the other 2 percent.</comment>

<comment>Slavery, anti-Semitism, and Christian inter-sectarian war were hardly out of fashion by the end of the Middle Ages, but it's fair to say that most (not all) of those observations are historical in nature. So what?I am not actually bitching about Christianity, merely pointing out that cherry-picking one set of facts to generalize about a religious faith practiced by a billion+ adherents is a ridiculous enterprise. Your point, if I understood it, is that your selective facts tell us something inherent and immutable about Islamic values. Why is the genuine history of Christian violence and torture not equally dispositive? I suppose because there is contrary evidence as well. Christianity is not, in fact, one immutable thing with a fixed set of values embraced by all of its practitioners. Neither is Islam.</comment>

<comment>Talking to Spudsie is like banging your head against a wall of stupid.</comment>

<comment>AGAIN - you ignore the elephant in the room; that your complaints about Christianity are historical, whereas the Islamic problem is RIGHT HERE AND NOW.Why is this simple concept so hard for you to grok?  You are a smart guy. You use big words like "dispositive". What is the problem here?</comment>

<comment>Thanks, but the problem is the tendency to ascribe to "Islam" values that reflect the actions of a tiny, violent minority of Muslims. I certainly wouldn't deny that those actions derive from a certain Salafist/Wahabbist manifestation of Islam, nor do I think that we should disregard or discount the dangers that such radical Jihadis pose. My disagreement with your position is both philosophical and pragmatic. You commit a category error by using the actions of those Jihadis to defame the values of more than a billion people. That is wrong on principle, but foolish as a tactical matter in any case. We will not and cannot effectively protect ourselves without the support and participation of the world's non-Jihadist Muslims, which is to say most of them. Your rhetoric (and more importantly, that of Trump and his ilk) make that effort more difficult. That will not end well for anyone.</comment>

<comment>"...Thanks, but the problem is the tendency to ascribe to "Islam" values that reflect the actions of a tiny, violent minority of Muslims...".That statement is false on so many different levels it make the head spin.This is mainstream Islam- you have gotten wrong information. It's in the Koran- not only Wahhabi Islam.This is NOT a tiny, violent minority. You need to do more research. I have been looking at this for decades.  There is no category error."...Polling suggests between a quarter and a third are not attached to the principles of the Constitution, supporting things such as sharia law over U.S. law and the use of violence against those who insult Islam. Nor is this merely hypothetical; Muslims account for only about 1 percent of the U.S. population but account for about half of terrorist attacks since 9/11. That means Muslims in the United States are about 5,000 percent more likely to commit terrorist attacks than non-Muslims...". http://www.nationalreview.com/...</comment>

<comment>If you've been researching this for decades, your political sources ARE LYING TO YOU and you are their tool.  I dare you, I double dog dare you to consult nonpartisan sources. The National Review, to pick just one recent example, is lying to you about who's committed the most terrorist attacks in America since 9/11. You don't have to be a tool: when you hear some really juicy bit like that (that somehow most people seem to just not be responding to) spare a little bit of your furious typing time on Google. "terrorist attackers in us statistics" got me pretty quickly to this FBI report covering 2002 - 2005, eat some nutritious facts here:https://www.fbi.gov/stats-serv..."In keeping with a longstanding trend, domestic extremists carried out the majority of terrorist incidents during this period. Twenty three of the 24 recorded terrorist incidents were perpetrated by domestic terrorists. With the exception of a white supremacist’s firebombing of a synagogue in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, all of the domestic terrorist incidents were committed by special interest extremists active in the animal rights and environmental movements. The acts committed by these extremists typically targeted materials and facilities rather than persons. The sole international terrorist incident in the United States recorded for this period involved an attack at the El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles International Airport, which claimed the lives of two victims.The terrorism preventions for 2002 through 2005 present a more diverse threat picture. Eight of the 14 recorded terrorism preventions stemmed from right-wing extremism, and included disruptions to plotting by individuals involved with the militia, white supremacist, constitutionalist and tax protestor, and anti-abortion movements. The remaining preventions included disruptions to plotting by an anarchist in Bellingham, Washington, who sought to bomb a U.S. Coast Guard station; a plot to attack an Islamic center in Pinellis Park, Florida; and a plot by prison-originated, Muslim convert group to attack U.S. military, Jewish, and Israeli targets in the greater Los Angeles area. In addition, three preventions involved individuals who sought to provide material support to foreign terrorist organizations, including al-Qa’ida, for attacks within the United States."Similarly - if you really do care about your country and don't want to be stampeded into hurting it by the lies of your manipulators - you can readily inform yourself about the period 2006 -2014 without going to politically manipulative sources. And once you know you're being lied to...</comment>

<comment>Your "proof" of "animal rights terrorism" being more significant than Islamic terrorism is so silly - it makes me think you might just be trolling here for fun - but I'll bite anyway.1.  Animal rights "terrorists" aren't killing anybody, they are just trying to save some foxes from being turned into fur coats.   They occasionally throw red paint on somebody's coat.2. Here is a list of 75 successful Islamic attacks since 9/11 in the USAhttp://www.thereligionofpeace....3. In addition are many times that number of foiled plots - I won't bother to google that, but you can do it yourself.</comment>

<comment>What was proven, specifically, was that in the years 2002-2005 both animal rights activists and right-wingers were more active in terrorism in America than Muslims. It was proof, not "proof".  You're right that the animal rights "terrorism", aimed at property, hardly seems as serious as the violent attacks from the right-wingers.  They both beat the Muslims, though.The website you cite is a perfect example of what I warned you against; a propaganda effort intended to manipulate you, for those who paid for it. Why don't you see if you can find a credible source? I'm sure the FBI has continued to produce regular reports on the subject.</comment>

<comment>You are making claims about the inherent nature of a religion.  Such claims, if true, would apply to more than today's news.  Those claims, about the inherent nature of Islam and Christianity, can be proven wrong with historical counterexamples. I hope either your misunderstanding or your deflection is alleviated by this explanation.</comment>

<comment>It isn't about the one billion plus Muslims who just want to be left alone to practice their faith and live decent lives. The issue is with the 100 million and change or so who do want to see global Shari'a and everything that entails.It isn't about what happened in history. Both Islam and Christianity have left trails of blood and mayhem. It's about what is going on in the world today. As Spudwhisperer says, the bulk of anti-Semitism stems from Islam. As for the chants of "Democracy is cancer; Sharia is the answer" why don't you check on the activities going on in London's Tower Hamlets, or the ramblings of Anjem Choudary, who influenced the jihadist who cut off Lee Rigby's head on an English street?Closer to home, since I assume you are American, check out the ties between CAIR (the Council on American Islamic Relations) and the Muslim Brotherhood, which has a long-game plan to bring Sharia to bear across the world.There are some well-regarded public intellectuals like Sam Harris and Douglas Murray who have sounded warning bells about Islamic accommodation. Have you listened to what Bill Maher has to say about Islamism? What about Pat Condell?There are some very thoughtful Muslims who are speaking out about Islamism. For example, Maajid Nawaz and Tarek Fatah. There are also apostates like Aayan Hirsi Ali (friend and collaborator of filmmaker Theo Van Gogh, who was killed on the streets of Amsterdam by an Islamist) who has put her life on the line by publicly renouncing her former religion.I can remember clearly the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie's head for simply writing a book about a few verses the Mohammed decided were dictated by "Shaytan" and should be removed from his ramblings that eventually became the Quran.Free speech is an oxymoron in the practice of "pure" Islam.</comment>

<comment>Take San Bernardino. We know that the couple involved were Muslims in the same way that the people involved in the war of aggression in Iraq were Jewish or Christian. But what makes you connect it with Islam?</comment>

<comment>Tell me, where its "values" are the leading belief system, in practice where are these places of reason? Progress? Womens rights? Human rights in general? Turkey? Nope....</comment>

<comment>Most progressives know even less about the values of Islam, since they refuse to look. Might I suggest the Pew polls? 72% of Pakistanis won't say they are against ISIS, who are practicing genocide, slavery and crucifixion in the name of Allah.</comment>

<comment>Does Pakistan represent all the Muslims in the world?</comment>

<comment>ISIS is not as popular in closer areas, but check out the answers to "should death be the punishment for apostasy?" majorities most places</comment>

<comment>What percent of Pakistanis said they didn't know anything about ISIS, azt24?  I've read the poll you're misrepresenting, have you?</comment>

<comment>Read the Koran 112 verses say its alrightbto kill non belivers. Nothing confusing whatsoever about that.</comment>

<comment>That's right.  We're so confused.On the one hand, Obama tells us it's the religion of peace and love.  And so do "moderate" Muslims.But then we see their acts, long past and present.  NOT NICE.And we hear "moderate" Muslims express their seething hatred of Israel, with some green pea soup spraying from their lips and their heads spinning, which I assume is the reason why all 1.8 BILLION Muslims are blaming their failures and all the atrocities they have committed on tiny Israel.It's all SO confusing!!!  ::mopping brow::</comment>

<comment>Simple obfuscation. Lies. </comment>

<comment>The majority of Americans also didn't want Jews to enter the country during WW2 and agreed with Japanese internment camps.  Those weren't genius ideas, now, were they?</comment>

<comment>Spud thinks they were.</comment>

<comment>http://www.dailywire.com/news/...The false analogy is incredibly offensive, not only to the victims of the Holocaust but history itself. Here are 5 reasons why Muslim refugees are not Jewish WWII refugees:1. There was no threat of Jewish terrorists infiltrating the United States. The same cannot be said about Muslim terrorists.2. Jewish victims of the Holocaust had nowhere else to go. Muslim refugees do.3. The proliferation of Muslim refugees is a result of an intra-religious, Islamic civil war dating back to the founding of Islam in the 7th century. Judaism’s theological disputes are solved with the pen, not the sword.4. Muslim refugees are far more religious (with many submitting to Qur'anic literalism) than Jewish refugees during WWII, an ethno-religious block that was predominately secular, assimilated into Western society, and already integrated into the mainstream European social fabric.5. Muslim immigrants have disproportionately contributed to racist attacks  against other minority groups, notably Jews. European Jews are still victims, rather than perpetrators, of anti-Semitic, white and Islamo-Supremacist, acts of harassment, bullying and intimidation.</comment>

<comment>Copy/paste, copy/paste</comment>

<comment>Your false analogy between Muslim refugees and Jewish WWII refugees is itself copy-pasted from progressive outlets like HuffPo.</comment>

<comment>1. I don't read "progressive" websites.  I think for myself.2.  I don't need someone else to tell me how to think.  clearly, you do.</comment>

<comment>You speak from ignorance. Most Jews could go nowhere in the 1930s. The US had immigration quotas so tight that from most countries they accepted almost nobody. The British blockaded Palestine. Most other countries either restricted immigration, or turned out to be not such safe havens, like France.My family was trying to flee Europe in the late 1930s. My grandfather made it to the USA because he had a Latvian passport and the quotas allowed him in. But his brother had married a wife with a Polish passport so she could go nowhere. They stayed in Europe and died in Auschwitz.Other members of my family wound up in Argentina and Shanghai, just because they were the only places they could get in. And my family was better off than most, because they had money. One great-great-uncle managed to get into Palestine by bribing the Hebrew University with a Gutenberg Bible. But he couldn't get the rest of his family through the blockade.Go read about the refugee ship the St. Louis.Progressives are simply commandeering other people's history for their own convenience, just like they commandeered the Civil Rights struggle for gay marriage.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>So the Baptist preachers who led the Civil Rights struggle were really for gay marriage? Who knew? Link please?</comment>

<comment>So you're a Jew who hates Muslims? That's not a new concept.</comment>

<comment>In the 1930s some Jews went to live with Muslims as in Turkey,say. A lot of them went to Palestine.Those who were already living with Muslims saw no need to go anywhere else. For Jewish immigrants USA had  advantages - of space and wealth over other countries but not necessarily lack of anti-Semitism. Ever heard of Peekskill riots NY state?</comment>

<comment>Muslim anti-Semitism was ratcheting up in the 1930s due to successful Nazi courting of the Arabs. Many Iraqi Jews wanted to leave after the Great Farhood of 1941, but it they weren't allowed at that time.</comment>

<comment>zionistory. Truth of the matter is that people became more pro-actiive in order to try to foil the zionist project. Now the zionist media machine has packaged it in terms of anti-Semitism. (I have no idea how that helps them though I have a couple of ideas). You should not fall for it if you have any sense.</comment>

<comment>WRONG.  There are more refugees now.  Millions are displaced now and it will only get worse.  Refugees need to come to the west where there are resources available.  The current situation is destabilising the middle east.  The rest of your spiel is just nativist bigoted garbage.</comment>

<comment>It is the destabilized middle east which has created the refugee crisis, not the other way around. The Syrian refugees don't want to go Europe; they want to go home.</comment>

<comment>Jewish people were stereotyped as possible Nazi spies. https://twitter.com/HistOpinio...</comment>

<comment>Well that would be an apt comparison if Jews andJapanese were killing each other and many others by the thousands now wouldn’t it? A better comparison would be to say, would we have imported the average German citizen who we deemed as a peaceful Nazi?</comment>

<comment>thirty-five percent of americans can't name one branch of government. what's your point?http://www.annenbergpublicpoli...</comment>

<comment>If you are not smart enough to be in the 56 percent - than you are probably in the 35 percent.</comment>

<comment>i'm sure 100 percent of that 35 percent is in that 56 percent. such a stupid poll</comment>

<comment>Hey, since we're talking percentages?30 percent of Americans identify as Republicans. 30 percent of that 30 percent support Trump. That comes out to about 5-6 percent of voting-age Americans, or about the same % of people that think the moon landing was faked. So says Nate Silver, and he has yet to be wrong.When the election is still a year away, people are still thinking about who they want to date versus who they want to marry. Let's keep some perspective on this despite the fact that Trump sucks all the O2 out of the room every time he shoots his mouth off.</comment>

<comment>I hope your right because Trump is making me question why I keep aligning myself with these whack birds. I don't hear trump, or any of his trumpsters, talking about small government, fiscal conservatism, or any issue I actually care about. </comment>

<comment>I'm going with Dogwood.  Final answer.</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot propping up straw men. The majority of U.S. muslims--American citizens--are educated people who are here for religious and economic freedom. They support basic American values, which include diversity, tolerance, and the freedom to practice their religion. That's real, Spud.</comment>

<comment>Which makes it all the more concerning that only 81% of them say suicide bombings are never justified and scary that "A significant minority (21%) of Muslim Americans say there is a great deal (6%) or a fair amount (15%) of support for extremism in the Muslim American community. "  It is also disconcerning that only 56% of them want to adopt American customs and ways of life.  But the most telling thing in all of this as it's the only thing the explains why progressives are so keen to invite masses with such un-progressive views on women and homosexuals, is that 70% identify as Democrats.http://www.people-press.org/20...</comment>

<comment>The fact that most Americans don't know anything about Islamic values is fully illustrated here: http://anonhq.com/watch-people...And that the majority think things that are incorrect doesn't make them correct.</comment>

<comment>So what's YOUR problem, carolannie?  Are YOU ignorant of the Koran - or are you not smart enough to understand that the Koran seriously conflicts with American values?</comment>

<comment>Obviously, Spud, you didn't watch the vidoe, and didn't see that most people are totally ignorant of the Quran, as are you. No, I am not ignorant of the Quran. And I know a lot of the Biblical values are against American values too. SO what. You live in the US, you follow US laws, even though Christianists are trying to impose Biblical law in  arbitration venues.  And they seem to think that the USA was founded as a Christian nation (it wasn't).</comment>

<comment>You must be quite an idiot to state that I am ignorant of the Koran on the basis of...nothing. No point in further pseudo-discussion.</comment>

<comment>So they don't support killing apostates, don't hang homosexuals, don't behead Christians, and don't repress women?  I know everything I need to about Islamic "values".</comment>

<comment>So you've never read the Old Testament? Just substitute Caananites with Christians and all of that stuff is in the bible as well. </comment>

<comment>That's nice, but for Christians Jesus represents a new covenant and teaches to love thy neighbor, which is why you don't see any reputable Christian religious preaching anything like that, unlike Islam which is full of nutters spouting off all kinds of non-sense and even more nutter acting on it.</comment>

<comment>A person who wants to ban a religion in this country is NOT compatible with the values of this country.  So get out.</comment>

<comment>No? You do realize that for the vast majority of this country's history the immigration laws were explicitly racist, right? You do realize the first one in 1790, drafted by the same people who wrote the constitution, limited citizenship and immigration to white people, right?You do realize that "freedom of religion" in their minds didn't apply to anything beyond different types of Christianity, right? And that one of the early supreme court justices affirmed that?</comment>

<comment>He has said it is a temporary measure. </comment>

<comment>So did Hitler, about every "special" power he was given.  Didn't turn out that way did it?  It was temporary in that it lasted until the end of the war.  Problem is the "war on terror" can't ever end because there is no defined end-goal.</comment>

<comment>Granting such powers to the government to deal with the 'problem' of Islam is like introducing cobras into your yard to deal with your field mouse problem.It'll work, and that problem is solved, but now your very effective solution has become a new and bigger problem.</comment>

<comment>Except that the impetus is not that religion is bad, it is that one particular religion is bad. The Spanish Inquisition didn't lead to a ban on catholicism (that took the French Revolution, at least for a brief time).</comment>

<comment>All of that seems agreeable - I just need to use that Poli Sci degree once in awhile. =P</comment>

<comment>In my experience, anger and fear makes a person stupid, even if only temporarily and in a compartmentalized fashion. Anger demands simplicity, a clearly defined object of hate and a solution that is swift and ruthless. Fear allows you to believe bull$#!T and follow charlatans. Nazi Germany took the most educated society in Europe and turned it into a racist killing machine. The Nazis used the irrational desire for simplicity to snooker a people who wanted to be snookered because they were angry and afraid. Its the seduction of the pimp.Its not that Trump supporters are stupid - they merely are giving into the stupidity that lives inside each of us.</comment>

<comment>Well said. </comment>

<comment>up-voted for humility</comment>

<comment>Trump is going to both lose and win.  He's almost certainly not going to become president, but the reactionary nativism is going to be more accepted in political culture, especially among Republicans, because they need those votes and there is no putting the ugliness back in a bottle.</comment>

<comment>Reactionary Nativism has always been there (Japanese internment, know-nothing party); it just sprouts up from time to time. But his campaign to make america white again turns off a lot of whites and almost all the minorities. This ignorant belligerence will get certain votes (those of the "they took meh jerbs" persuasion) and all the people who felt lost since Wallace stopped running for President. But Wallace never managed to get close to the presidency either.</comment>

<comment>This is pretty pathetic. The BNP is an actually pro-white movement. Trump and his fans aren't pro-white (they're more so than Teaparty and the GOP, but they still aren't pro-white). All statements like yours do is help Trump by further stressing how much today's supposed-liberals are anti-white.The way to undercut Trump is to show his base that he's lying to them about what he proposes. For instance, he won't be able to deport all illegal aliens:24ahead.com/n/12100Stop helping Trump, start showing his base how he's lying to them.</comment>

<comment>If Trump is lying, he's certainly staging an awful lot of worldwide Muslim terrorist groups attacking innocents!  That's a lot of theater, eh?</comment>

<comment>Thank you for demonstrating what I've been saying about Trump fans for months now. It should be obvious that the "lying" I'm referring to is about "what he proposes" such as his plan to "deport all illegal aliens". He won't be able to do that and he knows it. Yet, he says he will. IOW, he's lying to people like you and you're incapable of understanding it.</comment>

<comment>fyi - I was a liberal all my life, till this year.  2nd fyi - I wasn't in favor of Trump, till today. Obama and his administration's intense reactions to Trump's comment, and mediamatters, Huffington Post, and Salon's immediate reactions got me thinking that perhaps Trump is on the right track.  These people - Muslims, liberals, Obama, the Democratic Party, and liberals, are too interested in Islam populating this country asap.As for what Trump actually said needs to be done, it was that a COMPLETE MORATORIUM on entrance to Muslims needs to be undertaken until such time when Muslims can be properly investigated and checked out.  I agree with that.  We don't need jihadists coming into our country, and giving a fake address here no less.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I understand. You're having an unthinking, emotional reaction.Now, here's a new post explaining why Trump's plan is unrealistic and dangerous:24ahead.com/trump-muslimsObviously, Trump fans aren't going to understand that. Instead, they're going to in effect help those who want mass immigration.</comment>

<comment>Not unthinking entirely, though I am angry that liberals, who once were respectable and stood for something, now stand for perpetrators who have been killing for 1400+ years.</comment>

<comment>Right, but Wallace and others were successful in undermining integration and stoking racial animus, even if they were never able to fully get what they want.The same will likely hold for Trump and his supporters.</comment>

<comment>None of this information is new to anyone on the left. We've always known what the Dixiecrat Conservatives stood for, it's the rest of the Republican party and intellectual elites that has been in denial this whole time.</comment>

<comment>8 U.S. Code § 1182 - Inadmissible aliens(f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by PresidentWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.</comment>

<comment>Time to Dump Trump, Republicans.If the rest of the Republican presidential candidates won't speak out, what are they going to do if a foreign leader does something wrong?Fish or cut bait. You're either with Trump, or you're against him. Staying silent because you don't want to roil the "conservative" populists is not a profile in courage.</comment>

<comment>Carson already said that he wouldn't vote for a Muslim for President because Islam is contrary to American values. He said that months ago.</comment>

<comment>Carson is done, toast.  Yesterday's news.  He has proven he is a zero politician without the ability to grasp even the most basic facts.Next.</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Paul have BOTH called for a shutdown on immigration from Islamic countries.How ya like me now?  Keep hoping for Bush.</comment>

<comment>Yeah this is the problem for Republcians. They built the bed Trump is now forcing them to lie down in. Their game was to dance up to the edge of jingoism without going full monty, and Trump has forced the issue.I recall when Bush said something about needing to lose the primary to win the election. Well, that time has now come. The only way out is for the Republican party to split itself into a Trump half and an establishment half and throw the election to save the nation.</comment>

<comment>Why bother? Trump won't win the general.</comment>

<comment>Does the Republican establishment want Trump representing their party in the general? I mean if it comes to pass that he has the primary votes....what do they do? Hold their nose and back him?</comment>

<comment>To be honest we need a general realignment.  Moderates like Bush and Clinton have far more in common with each other than Clinton does with Sanders, or Bush does with Trump.  Let the radicals have their party, and let the moderates have theirs.  I know, it's a fantasy, but we can only dream...</comment>

<comment>That's not how it would go down. If trumps our candidate, I won't vote. I will continue to abstain until the party gets back to small government, and fiscal responsibility mode. I don't know what you call this s**t show, but it's not what I signed up for. I'm sure I'm not the only one. </comment>

<comment>None who have called for banning immigration from Muslim countries have a shot in hell of being President.  That should tell you something.</comment>

<comment>One can only hope Bush has a chance. I prefer Christie right now but I'd take Bush over trump. </comment>

<comment>Christie?!  Even Kim Jong Un wouldn't effectively close down a major bridge for a whole week and make life miserable for thousands just to get revenge on a mayor for not endorsing him.</comment>

<comment>The problem with Trump is that he says a lot of things that disagree with other things he has said, so you never know what he's actually going to do.</comment>

<comment>For Trump, that's an asset not a problem.</comment>

<comment>For voters who like his current soundbites it is setting up for the same regret that Obama voters have been living with when "Hope and Change" became "double down on Bush's bad policies".</comment>

<comment>The mainstream Republicans (Ryan, Cruz, Rubio, Bush) have stood idly by while this jackass has given meaning to the lives of bigots, racists, xenophobes and white supremacists.  Now, they are trying to claw back.  Well it's too late.You reap what you sow.</comment>

<comment>You are the bigot who hates American values.</comment>

<comment>You are a lost soul who thinks American values stop at White & Anglo.  Stay in your rat's nest.</comment>

<comment>Free speech, which you oppose, is an American value.</comment>

<comment>No one is saying that the government should stop Trump from saying what he wants.  What people are saying is that Trump shouldnt be saying what he is saying and that we shouldn't be listening to him. That is the difference between free speech and ignoring a nativist idiot.</comment>

<comment>If you support Muslim immigration, that implies that you do not value free speech, since Muslims do not value free speech.</comment>

<comment>Muslims do not value speech? WTF?</comment>

<comment>Polled every single Muslim on the planet did you? I don't think it is going out on a limb to suggest that the people that want to move here value the freedoms America has, otherwise why not move to some place easier to get into with more of a social safety net.</comment>

<comment>https://www.centerforsecurityp...According to the just-released survey of Muslims, a majority (51%) agreed that “Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to shariah.”  When that question was put to the broader U.S. population, the overwhelming majority held that shariah should not displace the U.S. Constitution (86% to 2%).More than half (51%) of U.S. Muslims polled also believe either that they should have the choice of American or shariah courts, or that they should have their own tribunals to apply shariah. Only 39% of those polled said that Muslims in the U.S. should be subject to American courts.</comment>

<comment>The great thing about a democratic republic is that 51% of .9% of the population doesn't get to decide jack. Also we have this little thing called the first amendment that means that government ahs to keep out of religion and religion has to keep out of government. So we can stop with the parinoia about Sharia, because it ain't going to happen.</comment>

<comment>It's already happening - but just keep your head in the sand. You don't want to know anyway.</comment>

<comment>Muslims do not have much difficulty emigrating to the US compared to other countries.  Also, non-Muslims do not give them problems.OTOH, a Sunni Muslim emigrating to a Sh'iite Muslim area or vice versa can risk death.</comment>

<comment>So you can distinguish between Sunni and Shii'a, excellent.  If you work at is you'll soon be able to differentiate those groups from Sufis, Wahabists, and Cultural Muslims, and then maybe you move on to the difference between ethnic groups like Pashtus and Arabs and Tajiks and Persians and Egyptians, and then you will understand how completely bonkers the idea that "Muslims are against freespeech is."</comment>

<comment>You think you know something because you can parrot a few terms? Yet you are too ignorant to find out what is in the Koran.</comment>

<comment>I haven't picked up a Koran since college, its true, but absent cultural and social analysis, just reading it wouldn't be enough, and frankly I don't have time, I'm up to four nonfiction books right now.  Although, I did read a facinating book about Sufis a couple of years ago. Now if only someone would pay me to do nothing be study, I promise you I would get right on that.</comment>

<comment>I am sure that there are  Saudi-financed madrassas somewhere not too far that will handle your room and board if you want to study the Koran.</comment>

<comment>Thanks but I'll pass.  Something tells me they wouldn't be interested in critical approaches and cultural and historical analysis.</comment>

<comment>You have no idea what American values are so you should probably stop talking and proving how dumb you are.  You are better off sitting there just looking stupid.</comment>

<comment>Then why did Trump recently basically say free speech shouldn't exist, and that the government should be able to shut down parts of the internet it doesn't like?  Seems he doesn't like american values either.</comment>

<comment>You distort Trump's point, as usual. He only wants the Internet to stop reaching recruits for jihad in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan.</comment>

<comment>Which is exactly what I said."the government should be able to shut down parts of the internet it doesn't like"You ignoring the point does not mean I'm wrong.</comment>

<comment>Preventing criminals from conspiring to commit murder is not abrogating freedom of speech, Spanky.</comment>

<comment>ANOTHER ONEBAMMYER ON FIREATROLL GIVE UP</comment>

<comment>20 years ago Ryan and Cruz for sure, and arguably Rubio and Bush, would have been radical right-wingers.Cruz constantly dog-whistles to Christian dominionists, and very likely is one himself, and has wild-eyed ideas about the role of government (essentially, everything since 1912 has been a mistake).Paul Ryan praises fringe wing-nut Ayn Rand and isn't embarrassed to generate budgets and policies that aren't even internally coherent, let alone realistic.They would have been laughed out of town 20 years ago.Now they are mainstream and expected to be the bulkwark against an even worse segment of the part.</comment>

<comment>20 years ago Rubio and Bush would have been mainstream candidates.  Now they are labeled "Republicans in name only".</comment>

<comment>Twenty years ago Bush was regarded as right wing, like Gingrich.</comment>

<comment>George W Bush was never regarded as right wing by any informed experts.  He expanded federal education funding, enacted national education standards, established Medicare Part D to subsidize prescription drug costs for the elderly, advocated funding stem cell research using pre-existing embryos, launched the largest foreign aid program to Africa in American history, increased funding for alternative energy research, and he supported immigration reform and a path to citizenship.  Bush was a moderate then, and is definitely a moderate now.</comment>

<comment>Let's see if these conservative 'intellectuals' understand the meaning of loyalty or go off the reservation and vote for Hillary.</comment>

<comment>If the "conservative intellectuals" are loyal to their country, it would make sense for them to vote for a candidate who doesn't propose to violate the Constitution.  If, on the other hand, their loyalty to a political party exceeds their loyalty to the United States, then they might be expected to vote for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  I am Republican, have voted GOP in the last three national elections.  And I would vote for Clinton over Trump.</comment>

<comment>Since the Constitution doesn't actually say anything about immigration (only naturalization) and since Trump's policies won't impact the rights of any American citizens I'd much rather have a guy implementing religious tests to weed out hostile cultures and ideologies than vote for Hillary who will violate Constitutional right's Americans have with gun control</comment>

<comment>I am loyal to my country, not the Republican party.  If the Republican party no longer represents American values and flatly rejects our founding document, then they don't deserve to be supported.</comment>

<comment>I expect little from Ball, but this is a bad analysis of the GOP on her standards. It's not between the intellectuals and the nativists, it's between the billionaires/their flunkies and the nativists. Considering that the plutocrats have people among them who have suggested preemptively nuking Iran for Israel and refuse to admit (to the *extreme* chagrin of the white working class Trumpistas)  that Dubya sucked, I'd question the idea that Trump is the sole unambiguous bad guy. Nothing is as insulting to a voter as a clear dismissal of their intelligence.And that's precisely why the fighting is so bitter, and why people who otherwise would hate Trump are giving him a chance-2012 is fresh in the minds of the base. They want to see the Establishment squirm enough that they are willing to support Trump to do it. Non-neocon/Norquist style conservative intellectuals haven't had much sway in the GOP since the days of Bush Senior, if that.</comment>

<comment>I don't think anyone has suggested nuking Iran...</comment>

<comment>Adelson.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, although no serious, elected politician has suggested that.</comment>

<comment>Ever since Nixon and his cronies created the Southern Strategy, Republicans have been mastering the art of appealing to the base bigotry of large segments of the American people.  But they have done so in a careful, plausibly deniable manner.  You know, hide behind vague appeals against "federal government overreach" or other legalistic dog whistles.  Well, here comes Trump, who has completely ignored these carefully constructed euphemisms and gotten right to the point.  Mexicans are rapists. Blacks are criminals.  Muslims are terrorists.  This is precisely what the Republicans have been selling to their voters under the table for two generations, so why are they surprised/upset that someone who just comes out and says what they have been implying for decades gets a strong positive response?</comment>
