<comment>You never really discuss the underlying precedent in Wickard v. Filburn, which underlies the precedent in Gonzales</comment>

<comment>I guess bad Commerce Clause decisions like Gonzalez v. Raich keep reaping their benefits.  Someday the states themselves are going to start thinking like England re the EU.</comment>

<comment>Unusual seeing a Liberal partyhouse organ condemn “senseless centralized regulation and ferociousfederal outreach”.  The average Liberal party follower goon can'tsee enough government.     But this can indicate a change ofpattern.     Note the emphasis on noncentralized non federal control.  Control solely at the state level. A nation which is a hodge podge of fifty independent fiefdoms,answering solely to autocratic, and easily bribed, local governments. The “states' rights” goal of the original Democratic Party, theparty that was favored in the Old South, that promoted slavery.  The“states' rights” that was the actual motive behind the Civil War.     So reminiscent of the back andforth in the New York “school” system swindle.  The Democratcrooks would push for individual local school boards, since thosecould be easily bribed by local forces.  The lie they promoted,though, was, “Individual school boards can tailor curricula to thespecific needs of students in those areas.”  Then, when everythingwas “decentralized”, and both Republican and Democrat forcesstarting effectively looting funds, the Democrats would “argue”,now for a “centralized” system.  Having all the power in one setof hands meant you only had one place to go to to bribe and get yourway.  The lie they used to promote that, though, was, now, “All thestudents are going to have to know the same things, to make it in theworld, so they all have to have one curriculum.”     The Democrats are political crooksfrom way back.</comment>

<comment>The guy got 20 years in the federal pen for stein some cell phones and a few joints?  That may not be an unconstitutional extension of federal authority but it's still excessive. </comment>
