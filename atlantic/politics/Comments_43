<comment>Trump and Cruz's support is coming mostly from the less bright end of the spectrum. Trump has grabbed the secular while Cruz has the parochial. Yes, they do have some supporters that have over 100 IQs, but they are more the opportunists.The unfortunate part is I don't see any clear leader for those with any intelligence.Those that could have appealed have gone after their own crazies; Rubio, Fiorina, Bush, or quickly dies as they were identified as bought and paid for; Kasich and Walker.</comment>

<comment>Democrats flush all thought down the toilet.  It is all patronage politics now.  They are buying bloc voters.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats may be buying voters, but the Republicans are Bought Candidates, which is much much worse.</comment>

<comment>I can think of one candidate who has not taken any money.</comment>

<comment>But Trump is a blithering idiot.</comment>

<comment>This is just thoughtless caricature. Trump is highly adept at reading the poles, a skill he developed over many years laser focused on viewer share for his 'reality' TV program. Plus he is cynically, slyly smart, and amoral about saying anything controversial that will garner free media and win news cycles.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Trump has a lust for the Poles.  Good point.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Pollacks.</comment>

<comment>Lie down in a fire, scum.</comment>

<comment>Pollacks the fish or Polacks like Lech Walesa?</comment>

<comment>Melania is Slovenian.  But he probably does lust for Poles too.</comment>

<comment>And his own daughter.  Don't forget he is in lust with his daughter.</comment>

<comment>She's half Czech, not Polish.  But he does seem to like the Slavic women, aside from Marla Maples.</comment>

<comment>Trump is highly adept at reading the poles,Did you realize that Alexander Graham Bellinski was the first telephone pole?</comment>

<comment>Trump is not "adept" at anything worthwhile to the Human species.</comment>

<comment>@riley:says the misguided progressive far-left liberal</comment>

<comment>Wrong, I'm a Republican.  A Slave Freeing Lincoln Republican, a Trust Busting Theodore Roosevelt Republican, and a Dwight Eisenhower Infrastructure building, NASA starting Republican.You Tea Party Terrorists need to leave the country.</comment>

<comment>Would you vote for Hillary over trump in the General election?</comment>

<comment>Lots of Republicans will be leaving the GOP before this election is over, the misguided demagoguery is making the Democrats the de facto moderate party, and that is where most voters are.</comment>

<comment>LOL...uh actually no.  Trump is drawing Democrats faced with the choice of a Socialist or a soon-to-be-indicted felon, if the FBI have their say. The Republicans may have an ideological rift, but the Democrats have socialist or socialist-lite...not much of a choice. If any Republicans leave, it will be RINOS coming out of the closet...not much of a loss.</comment>

<comment>Another republican who can't tell the difference between East and West Germany. The programs Bernie is proposing are somewhere to the right ow what exists today in Germany. The "Socialism" you are trying to scare people with, that was East Germany.</comment>

<comment>So funny. Sanders is not proposing socialism, but even his mention makes you piss</comment>

<comment>i want to thank you, Ridonkulous101, for your hard work in making the republican party an inhospitable place for so many republicans.  your goal seems to be to make the republicans a minor party along with the greens and the libertarians.a noble goal.  keep chasing more folks out who don't measure up to your political purity standards.then the rest of us can get back to the business of building an america that works, with parties that function.</comment>

<comment>Thank-you for the reply, but I'm afraid I can't take the credit for the distaste, even disgust, many Republicans feel.  While it is true we feel disgust for Obama, that is NOTHING compared to the betrayal we feel from Republican politicians who say one thing to us to get elected, and then do whatever they need to do to keep their power and paycheck...actions, especially dishonorable ones, have consequences.After reflecting upon your odd choice of phrasing,  I have concluded that only someone with a GIGANTIC EGO could even begin to imagine that one person is capable of "making the republicans a minor party", or "chasing more folks out who don't measure up to my political purity standards".While your parting statement literally screams 'JEB",  I'm going with the most impure...is that you, Ted?    ;-)</comment>

<comment>yes, trump does have a "GIGANTIC EGO".  but it is not just him who will make the republicans a minor party.  he is simply doing what you note.  he is pointing out how the republicans do nod, wink and nudge the voters to think that they have their interests in mind as they do all they can for wall street and banks and defense industry.this would include jeb, cruz, (in spite of his outsider shoutouts), rubio, christie, and kasich.  the more things change, the more they are the same.  one can say that about all of them.so in that regard trump is good for the political process.  but trump is all over the place in what he says.  the bottom line is "you can trust me" and "what choice do you have".  an interesting point.  but he only shows that he has had well handled focus groups done in the last 4 years to show him what the public is worrying about.  he gives no clue that he has real ideas for practical and workable plans for the future.trust him, vote for him, and buy that pig in the poke.    .</comment>

<comment>I would agree on most points...Trump is definitely the devil we don't know. He has managed a multi-million dollar enterprise through severe turbulence over the last few decades, so there is the implied ability to navigate shark-infested waters with some success, which is no small thing. This requires the ability to see beyond the obvious, think three moves ahead, and emerge with your goals accomplished.  If he can do this for our country on the international stage, many current ills will be resolved. The impetus his enviable position of outsider brings him cannot be overestimated. There is a reason they call it "towing" the party line...it can get really, really heavy.</comment>

<comment>I agree even more Republicans will leave the GOP if Trump or Cruz win the nomination.  But this isn't exactly new.  Moderates have been leaving for 20 years, and the GOP already has the smallest membership, with just 23% of voters, compared to 32% for Democrats and 39% Independents.</comment>

<comment>No but i would vote for Bernie over both of them , and i voted for Ron Paul the last 2 times.</comment>

<comment>@era:do not question my authority -there is a penalty to pay for such bad behavior</comment>

<comment>You sound like a bigot.</comment>

<comment>Then you don't know what the word Bigot means.</comment>

<comment>Winning elections requires that you get more votes than your competitors.Figuring out how to get more votes isn't just appealing to "voters," you need to figure out which segments of the voting population you can appeal to _and_ which 'voting segments' are your competition chasing.If you see a 'hole' or an untapped segment of voters that no one is chasing -- well that's what we'd call in business an "untapped market opportunity."Trump, much like Obama in 2008, is going after the untapped segment that has historically not been courted by the party grandees.I don't think this is idiotic.</comment>

<comment>Obama went after the disenchanted and frustrated Democrat wing in 2008. Trump has gone after the wing nut, the bigots, the misogynists, the right wing nut haters, and those desperate to win a piece of the pie. Two totally different demographics.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the anointed ones followers were all Mensa members who never voted, while Trump's are the Clampetts. Elitist.</comment>

<comment>My point isn't that Trump and Obama are appealing to the same demographic/psychographic, my point was that Trump is using the Obama strategy.In the US, it doesn't matter what you believe, if you're a citizen--kooky or upstanding--you get a vote.  Trump is representing a segment of the market that most mainstream politicians haven't bothered to court because they (for the most part) did not vote.</comment>

<comment>Ahh no. That demo is always courted and they vote about as often as any other.</comment>

<comment>I'm not so sure. On both the Democratic and Republican sides the working class white vote has been taken for granted ... for years.</comment>

<comment>Yes indeed, your objectivity shines though yet again.</comment>

<comment>Trump doesn't "see" anything.  He's a moron.</comment>

<comment>Except that's all he's going after. In business that works fine: "Frank Bates" can make money by appealing to suckers. Non-suckers won't buy his products, but there are enough suckers that it won't matter.The problem Trump has is he's going to run out of suckers if he makes it to the general. Not even most Republicans are buying his shtick, he's going to have trouble selling it to most Americans (or at least majorities in battleground states).Trump is duping people rather than helping them. Opposing free trade and mass immigration are very legitimate concerns, but all Trump has to offer are plans that will not work. He's a charlatan.Trump can't even win a debate with lightweights like Megyn Kelly. If anyone wants to stop Trump, here's how:stumptrump.usTrump is obviously afraid of tough questions. Let's go ask him some.</comment>

<comment>Be honest.  If Trump becomes the nominee the majority of the party will vote for him.  They'll have to.Here's why.The base of the party already think that the party grandees thwart their wishes.  If Trump wins and the elites declare that they won't be supporting him the base will interpret that move as a yet another example of the totalitarianism of the elites against the little guy.  It's hard to say ... but that kind of move could be the straw that breaks the camels back and schisms the party.</comment>

<comment>It take a lot more than a majority of Republicans to elect a President.</comment>

<comment>Trump seems to be focused on winning the GOP nomination, his thought processes do not extend to the general election.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for the insight from Trump's campaign strategy meetings.From all outward appearances, it would seem as if Trump realizes that he has to win a hotly contested primary round before he can compete in the general. But since you know his thought processes and have been reading the campaign's internal memos -- I defer to your greater wisdom.</comment>

<comment>So that's how to turned a few million from his father into billions? Sure -- if you want to believe that's how dumb people operate, go ahead.I think if Trump were dumb he would have blown his inheritance on hookers, booze, and coke in his 20s.</comment>

<comment>I don't believe Trump is a billionaire to begin with.</comment>

<comment>You must think the Earth is flat, and that the Sun is a lightbulb. And Hillary is your idol.</comment>

<comment>You are wrong about all of those things.</comment>

<comment>OK, I'm sorry.     :)</comment>

<comment>Millions used to be worth a lot more.</comment>

<comment>Apparently, that is where some went. But that doesn't matter to his followers.</comment>

<comment>Bankrupt 4 times and divorced twice. Used family influence to get into Wharton. His assets are dangerously leveraged, no bank today will loan him a penny. Not good if you are a Real Estate Developer. Hardy a screaming success in life or business. How incompetent do you have to be to lose money in the casino business? Mostly he's a reality TV huckster who sells his brand to other developers. And his hateful campaign is damaging that.</comment>

<comment>Valid point about over-leverage. However, the entire casino industry in places like Vegas and Atlantic City is hurting due to the rapid proliferation of American Indian Casinos over the past decade.</comment>

<comment>He is not. Consciously or not, he is a master salesman, manipulator, and dare I say hypnotisist . . . .</comment>

<comment>Being a Master Salesman is about as useful to society as being a Master Window Licker.</comment>

<comment>I'll bet there are millions of people stuck in the democrat controlled big cities with their third world schools, violent gangs, lack of grocery stores etc. who wish they were "Master Salesmen." Perhaps if they were successful, they could move to the suburbs.</comment>

<comment>@riley:but hillary is a pathological liar</comment>

<comment>yeah, guess we wouldn't want a successful person in the White House. The current inexperienced moron has done such a great job.</comment>

<comment>Trump is privileged not successful.</comment>

<comment>privileged? Why? Because he had a mom and dad that didn't tell him that "education was for white people?" And a man who is worth 10 billion dollars is very, very SUCCESSFUL.</comment>

<comment>Oooo ... a "Business School" ... who the hell cares about Business Schools.No one that's worthwhile does, that's for damn sure.</comment>

<comment>I bet Trump learned more about succeeding in life than all the boys and girls sitting in their safe spaces at mommy-daddy U.</comment>

<comment>His definition of success is warped and useless.</comment>

<comment>We will see. But more likely a "blithering idiot" like a fox. He neutralized the heir apparent in JEB with simply a phrase; "JEB's Low Energy". It was masterful. He took out the biggest opponent first. And, completely disrupted the establishment game plan which was to put massive money behind the biggest name and conduct business as usual. JEB has not recovered and the establishment is in absolute disarray. He has sewed confusion and discord among his opponents. And, really only directs his fire at real threats. The man has obviously read Sun Tzu's Art of War. As obnoxious as he is, he may actually make a good president. He definitely has a strategic and tactical sense.</comment>

<comment>The Establishment was going to fail anyway ... Trump was just there when it happened.</comment>

<comment>Ant Sun Tzu is a waste of everyone's goddamn time.</comment>

<comment>Not so much...read my post above for clarification.</comment>

<comment>Easy to say that, but he is a masterful reader of people's desires, expressed or not, and a great showman. I grew up just outside New York and he is what we used to call a great BS-er. He can sling it non-stop, and he mostly talks about how great he is ... without providing evidence. Him as president would be embarrassing and scary. He is all about himself, period.</comment>

<comment>He's not a "Master" at anything.  He's got the money to hire people to make him look good.   And he's probably having to spend more on that than your average person would have to.He is a complete and utter prat.</comment>

<comment>trump takes money from anyone who carries a wallet close to him.  trump university, anyone?</comment>

<comment>Trump has spent hardly any money on his campaign.  The media hates him, but they give him all the free publicity that he needs.  Jeb! spent 100 million of donor money, mostly attacking Trump, and he has nothing to show for it.</comment>

<comment>serves Jebbey right after throwing Florida for his brother, saddling us for 8 years with that bumbling fool.</comment>

<comment>"The media hates him...."fox news and the national review, and such, hate him because he is destroying the g.o.p. that they so laboriously created and nurtured as a vehicle of "respectable" right-wing governance.the left-wing media is cautiously hoping that he succeeds in doing so.the mainstream media is making a ton of money covering him.  to them, what's not to like?agree about "Jeb!"  what can be said about a candidate who runs by running away from the family name and business, yet would do more of the same?</comment>

<comment>Investors in Trump projects?</comment>

<comment>there is a certain poetry in that, but the poor souls have likely already lost their shirts.</comment>

<comment>Trump has made donations and received favours in return. He boasts of this fact. </comment>

<comment>Donald Trump is the only candidate in either party who is not owned by the special interests of the left and of the right. He represents America's silent majority of decent men and women. One Man Can! Trump 2016! </comment>

<comment>By that standard, you are limiting high federal offices to only the rich.. Is that the president you'd like to see??</comment>

<comment>It's a start, anyways. If people in government don't start out rich they usually end up that way. </comment>

<comment>In the form of Hillary Clinton, it is one that over half of the Democrats are voting for anyway, and thus couple both corruption, as well as fabulous wealth. Say what one will about Trump, he is not packing that kind of baggage.http://www.chicagotribune.com/...</comment>

<comment>True, but is that the new benchmark for politicians we require now though??</comment>

<comment>It is less that we ''require'' it , than it is a reaction to the lie that was the 2008 era of ''Hope and Change''.The entire world is off it's axis. It comes as absolutely no surprise that not only the Trumps, but the Sanders, rise at such a moment. Obama, with all of his oratorical gifts, failed to deliver. Americans still seek the ''Change'' candidate.</comment>

<comment>Ok, hope for.. Is that now going to become a desired trait that we look in a candidate that he/she be wealthy enough to fund their own campaigns??Obama failed to deliver?!?! What politics have you been watching?? This nation is in an uproar over liberalism running amuk.. There has been a fundamental change in this county like no other, for the worse, and many are outraged by it.. Voter turn out will probably set records this time around.. What's unfortunate is that the masses that are angry, don't exactly know who to throw stones at.. They've been asleep to long and can't catch up.. The waters are too polluted.. Even for those that ARE keeping up, we disagree..</comment>

<comment>It shouldn't really be surprising to see Republicans long for the Gilded Age, the ideal conservative economy.</comment>

<comment>Did you reply to the right person?? Or did you mean to start a new conversation and just missed the top of the page??</comment>

<comment>NB seemed to suggest that a massively wealthy person who inherited their wealth is a preferable candidate. The politics of the Gilded Age were dominated by wealthy titans of industry. Conservative economic policy seeks to remove all regulation enacted since that period. A period where wealthy, powerful men controlled things and people "knew their place".</comment>

<comment>No one wants to see those days return.. Not in any real volume anyways (everyone has their nutcases running around amung them)..</comment>

<comment>Not in those words exactly, but if one party continually advocates returning to the regulatory climate (No EPA, no "red tape getting in the way of job creators" etc) and tax policy without any new controls to prevent the same conditions from arising it's a fair inference to draw.</comment>

<comment>No one want to eat 3 eyed fish and drink nuclear water either..</comment>

<comment>If you advocate removing all the rules that prevent that from happening what's the real difference?</comment>

<comment>Who is advocating removing all the rules?! No one.. Sure we got a few anarchists in our end that say it, but they're nowhere close to anything beyond a small fraction and none of them are anyone of any real importance..Thats liberalism for you though: Anything perceived as a wrong step gets taken to the very farthest end.. Like with guns.. I hear it all the time.. We want to arm drunks in bars and children in schools.. No one says that..</comment>

<comment>FDR was very wealthy and used his presidency to help the working class.</comment>

<comment>He meant well. FDR also prolonged the Great Depression with his misguided do-gooder economics.  He also handed Eastern Europe to Stalin, something the working class of Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia did not find altogether helpful.</comment>

<comment>You don't know the difference yet between Republicans and Conservatives?</comment>

<comment>Well duh, it's not the president, its the system. Why expect one man to change that. That is frankly stupid.</comment>

<comment>They're both worse in their own.And not only in America: Europe's having this same conversation about their conservatives and progressive left/right politicians.Who are also challenged by newcomers and unconventional non-pc parties, in the same way Trump is challenging the established elites in the States.</comment>

<comment>So billionaire Trump is not an elite? Chances are you couldn't afford one night in one of his hotels, and you certainly couldn't buy a condo in Chicago's Trump Tower. He is an elite who caters to other elites. Don't be so naive. </comment>

<comment>He's non political elite.He's just a filthy rich tycoon like there are so many of in the USA.</comment>

<comment>You don't get to maintain that type of wealth without being political. He may not have run for office this long in the past, but to say he is non political is naive. </comment>

<comment>There are enough rich tycoons who are a lot friendlier with the current established elites than Trump, who is considered as a total threat.Not really a politically 'ol boys networking going on here in the methods of Trump.</comment>

<comment>The only thing I like about Trump is that he is not a religious nut bag. Today he called out self righteous Iowa Evangelical Bob Vanderplass as the hypocrite and phony that he is. At least Trump speaks his mind, and doesn't kiss the butts of the religious right.  Still don't want him as president. </comment>

<comment>There's a lot to say against Trump.I think it's a very simple choice who you Americans want as a president, or any other sort of leader we Europeans want: the one's who embrace the islam as their new voting cattle and our replacement at the same time, or the ones who acknowledge the true nature of the islam.</comment>

<comment>Just to reiterate. I find all religious fanatics to be dangerous, that includes Islamic fanatics.</comment>

<comment>Trump is doing nothing but satisfying his massive ego.</comment>

<comment>He wouldn't have run for president to do just that, wouldn't he?No, it seems Trump is doing much more than just satisfying his massive ego.</comment>

<comment>Trump doesn't know how to do anything BUT satisfy his ego.</comment>

<comment>You're not the only one sounding very jealous of a billionaire.</comment>

<comment>Elon Musk is a better billionaire than Donald Trump ever could hope to be.</comment>

<comment>"A better billionaire"..:)Well I really don't think Trump is hoping to be Elon Musk, or has a minority complex over any other billionaire.You just said yourself he has too much ego for any of that, didn't you?Your jealously vindictiveness of Trump only says more about you than about him.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you know what the word "Jealousy" even means.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you can even explain your 'observings'.</comment>

<comment>Right - both parties are inefficient and spend too much money, but Dems spread money around the country (to most all US citizens), and Repubs spread money to the top 3% (and connected defense contractors).</comment>

<comment>I guess you could say that Trump has bought himself. Cruz and Paul and Carson are bought by no one. That is why the establishment hates them.</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Paul and Carson are bought by the Koch Brothers.</comment>

<comment>The topic was Trump. And he is the choice of the proles - which is enough to wreck the GOP, but not to win him anything.</comment>

<comment>Whoa there. Not all of us Democrats have let the safe-space crowd cram their authoritarian ideas down our throats. There are still moderates out there. I give to environmental causes, animals rights causes, support raising the cap on social security, etc. But I absolutely hate the authoritarian manner in which the political correctness agenda is being crammed down our throats.</comment>

<comment>I agree. I object to the methods deployed in the name of liberalism mainly.  I support a lot of moderate liberal goals.</comment>

<comment>As someone who almost thought they were the last moderate Dem walking the face of the planet, thank you for posting!</comment>

<comment>In other words, you're one of those going your own way betas?</comment>

<comment>...which is why folk don't understand, that's what trump is doing -- telling whites and working class he'll be 'their' guy. lawyers, bankers, lobbyists, tech CEO's, movie stars all think they have their 'guy' in government...Trump is winking at the camera saying "Hey if you get your hands dirty I'll get you your share of the goodies." -- any real conservative dream of small government died with George W. Bush....now its just a competition for goodies.</comment>

<comment>"Its all patronage politics now."both parties do what must be done to get voters to vote for their candidates.  you seem surprised that american democracy does this.  you know, for 225 years now."Democrats flush...."  like cruz, trump, and the lot of republican candidates are not trying to out flush other republicans right now.</comment>

<comment>Trump's "We'll make everyone in America pay higher prices to pay my base extra wages" is buying votes every bit as much as saying "We'll make everyone in America pay higher taxes to pay my base extra welfare."</comment>

<comment>Republicans rely on gerrymandering to bloc their voters.</comment>

<comment>We want America to remain America not become a colony of Mexico</comment>

<comment>Well done exemplifying the kind of stupid jingoism the Trump campaign thrives on.</comment>

<comment>If all the illegals became citizens do u really think English would remain the primary languge you really think the wetbacks would drop their language?</comment>

<comment>By all means, keep making my point for me.  Toss in more ethnic slurs while you're at it.</comment>

<comment>How will English remain the primary language if we succumb to the wetback invasion? How will people who try to impose Mexican language and culture on America ever respect American culture?</comment>

<comment>80% of Americans speak English within their homes.  That's about 240 million people, and that's not including the millions of Americans who still know English, but speak other languages in their homes.The current population of Mexico is roughly 125 million.If literally EVERY Mexican moved to the US tomorrow, and if literally NONE of them spoke English, English-speakers would still outnumber non-English-speakers in America, almost 2-to-1.Only a paranoid dimwit could seriously worry about Spanish replacing English as America's official language.</comment>

<comment>it's a problem to press 1?  you have a very easy life if that is a concern.</comment>

<comment>Why is Spanish all over the place why do schools teach Spanish why do wetbacks refuse to celebrate our holidays?</comment>

<comment>"Why is Spanish all over the place...."because more people in the world speak spanish than any other language, but chinese.  in this country most of the spanish speakers become quite fluent in english.  the way it works is that first generation americans tend to learn a little, many speak broken english.  the second generation are bi-lingual and speak excellent english.  often the third generation speak only english.  when people become fully connected to the american economy this happens.since many spanish have been here since before your grandparents or mine got to american, they have more right to call me or you, any but the american indians, wetbacks."...why do schools teach Spanish...."you rather chinese?  schools teach many languages.  you rather french?  what's your point?  you want latin?</comment>

<comment>@more:you're being overly sensitive (typical liberal behavior). sometimes a "slur" can be a word of endearment.iow you need to get over yourself. peace out </comment>

<comment>in a public comment section slurs are slurs.  in private between good friends perhaps they can be "a word of endearment."  but that only happens with context and history.  here the public meaning is the context.being "overly sensitive" or being dismissive of others is typical human behavior--neither particularly liberal or conservative.what tyyt was doing was dismissing any spanish speaking person in this country unless (my words) they become copies of us european americans, and claiming to know them enough to do that.i simply pointed out how unlikely that was because his language and blanket condemnation miss way more hispanics than they include.  thus i doubt he has any first hand knowledge.</comment>

<comment>@more:but what tyyt is mostly true; many mexicans are not loyal to america. the fact that most choose to speak spanish (espanol mezclado) in public is proof positive. as long as they refuse to assimilate then they deserve to be called derogatory names</comment>

<comment>quick give me a derogatory name for those amish.  i walk into a public restaurant in a state i am visiting and i am surrounded by speakers of old german.  they don't attempt to hide it.  those brazen folks.  hundreds of years here now and still not assimilated.  proof positive they are not loyal to america.</comment>

<comment>@more:oh please stop with the drama. i've never heard of any reports of the amish speaking german in public. and besides, their population is so tiny and inconsequential (not a threat) compared to the millions of illegal compesino mexicans living in southwest usa. have you been to socal lately? entire neighborhoods wiped out by millions of illiterate peasants. i moved away long ago (as well as thousands more like me) to another state where they do not tolerate ethnic diversity i.e. nevada, utah, arizona, texas etc. never been happier</comment>

<comment>drama?  no.  a satire of your position.   we have had neighborhoods, towns, and whole regions of the nation, for all of our 225  years, where the first language has not been english.louisiana and northern new england have their french acadians and cajuns since before our revolution.  brighton beach in new york their russian neighorhoods for the last 30-40 years. every major u.s. city their china town.  where i live the city owns a public market house for some 147 years (175 if one counts the open air market that preceeded).  each few years, the language one hears between the merchants change.  and yet the city here endures, and the nation stands strong.the drama among these comments methinks can be traced to one who suggested "entire neighorhoods wiped out",  "millions of illiterate peasants"  and that one thinks that in a country created by people fleeing oppression and poverty and lack of opportunity has states that "do not tolerate ethnic diversity."i am glad that you have never been happier, and i am not asking you to leave your comfort zone, but your perception of the diversity of this nation, its history and its future don't fit the actual story of who we are as americans </comment>

<comment>@more:again, have you visited socal lately? have you even traveled south of the border? answer: no. if you had you would have discovered two worlds almost identical; millions of illiterate short, fat dark skin compesinos being ruled by a white minority elite. these peasants -who have zero level of intellect- are encouraged to overpopulate (barefoot and pregnant) and add nothing to society except a cheap source of labor -fact!!!  is this what is best for our country? i think not.    "...people fleeing oppression and poverty and lack of opportunity". translation: opportunists seeking to make more money north of the border in america's flourishing cash-only underground economy i.e. gardeners, house cleaners, plumbers, carpenters etc. walk into any hospital in socal and you'll find the check-in rooms packed with these peasants waiting for free medical treatment. it's illegal to turn them away."methinks" you and other misguided progressives live in a bubble and suffer from delusional thinking aka political correctness. if we're not careful our country will transform itself from a developed nation to the bloody third world.finally, you may not like trump's bombastic behavior (i certainly do not) but he is our last hope in keeping our country from slipping into darkness (becoming a turd-world county)</comment>

<comment>i think you miss the american story.my irish great great grand parents were met by attitudes as you express.a guy wrote in the early 1900s of the irish, they are "quick to take offense and quarrelsome, they wait for no oncomer.  they are their own worst enemies.  born to toil, their bones are found along the pathway of every railroad and trench.  improvident, they rarely achieve wealth....they do not have great concentration of mind and are generally incapable of sustained and continuous mental effort.  their minds are as a flash but not deep, impressionable but not creative, fitfully energetic but naturally indolent....abstract great principles are beyond his ken....he hardly adds to the safety of the republic."italians?  from the north: "...are more sordid, cynical, socialistic, intemperate, and dictatorial...."from the south: "...with the vices as well as virtues of a rude, uncivilized people....they are very ignorant...."russians?  "...there can be no substantial mingling of the two races.  the differences are too great.  the russian does not and never will be a part of the composite american...."he goes on to insult most everyone.  (1929 printing of "american institutions and their preservation" by william cook)some americans in each generation saw new people in this country as a problem, often an intolerable threat to this country.my ancestors had to face that.  the new immigrants today have to face it.  it is ludicrous.  the new people, the "opportunists" as you put it are the future of this country.  they add energy, vitality and new ideas to the plenty we already have.your comments like "millions of illiterate short fat dark skin compesinos" are nonsense.  would tall thin white skin people please you?  "peasants...encouraged to overpopulate"   peasants everywhere and at all times "overpopulate."  they know most infants die and those that survive need care for their elderly.  when they move into a developed country that tendency disappears as they get education and jobs.we have faced these situations, problems as you see it, and not only have we survived, we have flourished.p.s. up until the economy of ireland took off a couple of decades ago, the second largest group of illegal immigrants were irish.  a moat of thousand miles of water did not keep them out of this country.  trumps wall won't keep those from the south looking for american success out either, but no matter because it won't add many miles to what is there already.  no one in the u.s. or mexico want to pay for it.</comment>

<comment>@more:"i think you miss the american story"i think you missed (avoided) answering my question(s) too many times. until you begin to cooperate this discussion is over</comment>

<comment>Hombre, you need a cerveza.</comment>

<comment>Being that you and millions like you are surely too stupid to pick up a 'foreign' language, I doubt English will ever be dropped as a primary language for the US while you cling to your bitter existence. So you can drop the anxiety and vote for a real candidate now.</comment>

<comment>"...do u really think English would remain the primary...."the primary language is the language of business, jobs, trade and commerce.  for any foreseeable future that will be english in this country, no matter how many speak a second language at home or at the corner store.</comment>

<comment>I have never seen an idiot so thoroughly destroyed on Disqus before. I'm putting this on my Tumblr.</comment>

<comment>Apologize please</comment>

<comment>lolurdum</comment>

<comment>Well, if the people you consider to be on the 'good' side of the 'bright end of the spectrum' are challenged so easily by those dumb people, as you put it eloquently,  it seems the established elite's ways of fooling their audiences isn't so bright as you thought it was.That explaines this 'übermensch theory' coming out of the departments from the likes of you.</comment>

<comment>Whats so dumb about your imperialist contention, is the fact that until only recently in American history [ the Clinton Era ], you Democrats had the vote of the working-class locked up. Back then, Democrats carried the banner, as they did since the days of FDR, of the ''blue collar worker'' with pride.Now they are dismissed by you elitist pimps as throwaway dimbulbs, idiots, and morons, which more deftly explains your parties support of patent liars and crooks like Hillary, or tax 'em all socialists like Sanders. And as the author of this article himself [ Ron Brownstein ] admitted in the liberal NATIONAL JOURNAL back in 2013, Democrats appeared willing to sacrifice these voters and would thus ''pay a price'' for doing so as they graft themselves to billionaires, race hustlers, illegal aliens, and arrogant priques who think that after 8 years of this crap, they can run this nation better than a Republican.....http://www.nationaljournal.com...</comment>

<comment>Times have changed, as has the political landscape. The Republican party has attracted all the nut jobs. Or, the nut jobs have taken over the Republican Party.Any fact checker will clearly point to the Republicans as the party of liars. BUT, keep trying to say it is Hillary. Seriously there dude, Trump, Cruz, Fiorina, Carson, and others lie their faces off and you morons lap it up as if they can do no wrong. Enjoy the Republican Party's demise.</comment>

<comment>Or the nut jobs have all become Democrats.After all, you have produced nothing of any worth since , say, Johnsons CRA in '64.''Any fact checker'' will have already pointed out that you are a damned liar and I have the recent archives to prove it. Furthermore, when we witness things like this..http://www.factcheck.org/2016/...then it is plain that you are again lying to your audience again. It is what you do.</comment>

<comment>So you didn't read your link. Again. Differences of opinions do not amount to lies.And, again, this is NOT about the Democratic Party. Yet, we do understand that when the Republicans are as bad as this Clown Car Crew, you do have to divert attention to something else. If I was in your shoes, I would be embarrassed too.</comment>

<comment>Yeah and in 1860 Republicans nominated a liberal from Illinois and Dems were calling for respect for States' rights.</comment>

<comment>Kanye/Kardashian 2020!</comment>

<comment>While it may satisfy your bigotry to sneer at Trump and Cruz supporters, they appeal to the same feelings as Sanders supporters: people are sick and tired of status quo candidates. But you go ahead and vote for Hillary in the primary. You can be chairman of those loser bracket.</comment>

<comment>You are correct in that Trump and Sanders are striking similar veins within the American electorate. The key difference is that Trump supporters are much more likely to react to fear-based messages. Research has shown that Trump supporters are also much more likely to be favorable towards authoritarianism too: http://www.redstate.com/leon_h.... Sanders appeals towards people's optimism and hope. Maybe it's a fool's hope, but it's much more positive than the vitriol and anger from Trump's supporters.</comment>

<comment>The same old tired elitism from the left. I can think of no better way to create division than to insult your political opponents by claiming they are all stupid.I would venture to guess that you don't personally know but perhaps one or two supporters of Trump or Cruz and on that basis and your wild, predudiced imagination you draw such general conclusions about millions of people. What sir does that say about your intelligence and your inductive reasoning?</comment>

<comment>No other candidate, on either side, has been throwing around the divisive and insulting adjective "stupid" like Donald Trump has.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps. But the writer of the comment didn't criticize Trump did he? No. Instead, he chose to call virtually every supporter of Trump and Cruz - millions of people -  stupid. So in one fell swoop, he managed to call stupid more people than Trump has in six months of campaigning.And you, Kit, just made the decision to insert yourself into the this to defend his actions. </comment>

<comment>Pointing out that the biggest offender in the race comes from the right doesn't mean I defend Mr. Fusion's original post. I responded to your comment, not his.</comment>

<comment>Sorry dudette, but Trump supporters are stupid.http://thedailybanter.com/2015...What does that say about your denial?</comment>

<comment>Well if the Daily Banter says it, it must be true! Right? Is the Daily Banter your idea of sound epistemology? Seriously?By the way, did you actually read anything after the headlines? The poll did not conclude that Trump voters are idiots. That is Bob Cesca and The Daily Banter's interpretation of the poll.The only way you can get from that poll to that conclusion by way of one of these two logical paths: I disagree with what Trump supporters believe therefore Trump supporters are stupid, or Trump supports have drawn incorrect conclusions regarding Obama, therefore they are stupid. The first logical path suggests the author is a closed minded, egomaniac since he is making himself the yardstick of intelligence and the second is clearly fallacious since intelligent people can, obviously, hold incorrect beliefs.Finally, the poll was conducted by an organization called Public Policy Polling.  According to this NYT's story the PPP results tend to lean Democrat, so I would be inclined to look at these results with suspicion.</comment>

<comment>Way to dismiss working and middle class Americans! Just because someone doesn't have a college degree doesn't make them stupid, unless you're an elitist.</comment>

<comment>but if I were to point out the millions of minorities with their worthless big city public education's who voted for obama, I would be called a racist.And should I, with two college degrees (before the great dumbing down), vote for..... the same big government morons who've landed our country in such debt that one day it will take all the federal budget to pay the interest>?</comment>

<comment>What a pompous, didactic twit you are. You're the guy we all avoid at the office parties.</comment>

<comment>You have office parties at your trailer park?</comment>

<comment>Spoken as a member of a political party that doesn't even bother with issues and just gets votes from giving away free stuff to freeloaders.</comment>

<comment>I love how you attack him for not bothering with issues... and then immediately sweep aside the issues IN THE SAME SENTENCE</comment>

<comment>Cruz is a horror show to the empathetic, but he is a delight to the unemotional rational mind. Most of his followers are on the more intelligent, less emotional side, with the exception of some of the Evangelicals.</comment>

<comment>He's a young-Earth creationist who thinks Noah's Ark was real.</comment>

<comment>As someone with a higher level of education and IQ, I'm not an opportunist.  I have a lot of friends in the same boat as me who see him as the answer because we have a corporate government that needs a corporate leader. That's the most intelligent position out there.What's the smarter position?More endless war?More DC gridlock?More money in politics?A dynasty?We'd all prefer Rand, but Rand can't seem to get any movement, so we'll take Trump over Cruz because we aren't socially conservative on issues like gay marriage (the Republicans caused it by fighting civil unions on the state level) and abortion (most of us are pro-choice in the first trimester and then after feel it should be banned).  We're so worried about 'the war on Christmas' we forgot to pay attention to the people running up $19 trillion on us.  So, sorry I'm not worried about if gay dudes wanna hold hands in public.So, thinking it's the less than bright end of the spectrum, if the people I deal with are any indication, may be a vast oversimplification that will bite everyone in the butt.I guess we'll find out tonight at the caucuses.</comment>

<comment>I'm voting for trump and my iq is around 140, but I am from the rust belt and have seen what the establishment politicians have done to this country in terms of shipping out all of the jobs. That is where trump is getting his traction. The reason why people smarter than average vote otherwise is because they still have decent career options. You have to be even smarter though to see that in the future the establishment politicians will sell out all of those jobs too. For evidence just check out the technology industry and all the h1b visas, jobs being sent to Asia, and graduate student position being taken by foreigners.</comment>

<comment>If you had an IQ of 140, I would expect you to know how to write.</comment>

<comment>Well I can see that you can't debate my point so you have to try to ridicule me for not having "perfect" grammer.</comment>

<comment>If you had an IQ above room temperature, I would expect you to use a spellchecker. It is called "grammar".For someone claiming to be in the top 0.5 percentile you sure sound stupid. Your comment didn't make a point. It babbled as if you wanted to say something that a Grade 8 dropout would complain about.It is evident, however, why you support Trump. Please keep flipping those burgers. Hopefully, if you work hard and don't keep forgetting to put the pickles on, they might promote you to the milk shake machine.</comment>

<comment>here's #3</comment>

<comment>yo pops,word up; this is not your fight so butt-out</comment>

<comment>This election is a referendum on political correctness.   I believe the voters are sick of it.</comment>

<comment>Political correctness is calling a snowman a 'snow person'. What Trump is doing isn't politically incorrect - it's just incorrect period. Also vulgar and mean.</comment>

<comment>Political Correctness is a disparaging term for what humans used to call civility, decency and/or respect.  Civility, decency and respect are prerequisites to actual problem solving in a secular and pluralistic democracy.</comment>

<comment>Right.......but some people need to grow some skin.. We've all become marshmallows where everything around us offends some one, some how and the nation is tired of pandering to everyone and their dainty emotional needs..Something offend you?? Thats a you problem brother..</comment>

<comment>My post did not go through, I used the "K-word".  I dared Bill to call a Jew a K!ke.  The Atlantic will not allow that word... does that bother you, Bill... I mean the political correctness of that.</comment>

<comment>We have no way of coming to a consensus on what is offensive.. We do not vote on it every year.. Since no consensus can be made, people run around every day trying to avoid making someone feel offended or uncomfortable even.. It has gotten out of hand because we have traveled so far down this path that anyone can be offended by just about anything..</comment>

<comment>All of these online comment boards have their own list of banned words, terms, phrases... even banned acronyms.Of course, these lists are never published, for posters, it's a minefield out there.The government could collect all those lists, I suppose and publish the Official US List of politically incorrect items.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, now we've jump into the ridiculous..</comment>

<comment>Reducto ad absurdum, I believe.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention that it is the individual websites that choose their level of censorship.. Some sites are no-hold-barred..On a side note, I've discovered that you can type vagina on most, but the word pe nis gets you sent into moderation.. What's up with that?? Sexist much?? Lol</comment>

<comment>Is it so hard for you not to blurt out offensive comments about groups who are less privileged than you? I don't get the hulabaloo about being pc. What's wrong with not offending people? You have a right to be a jerk, yes, but at least admit you're a jerk and that's not what we should aspire to be.Being politically correct as a nation is progress towards peacefully standing as one people. </comment>

<comment>The caveat is that even "less privileged" is even a subjective term too..</comment>

<comment>No its not you dummy. Certain groups are proven to be less privileged. Stop making things up to confirm your own biases and admit youre a fool.</comment>

<comment>Proven by opinion..</comment>

<comment>Wait, you don't believe in science right? Absolute idiot </comment>

<comment>Science is proving who is deemed to be disadvantaged?? Ok..</comment>

<comment>Garbage.When General Tsos Chicken is wailed over as ''racist'', when skinny little hag profs at Mizzou can scream for ''more muscle'' while they assault kid journalists armed only with a camera, when BLM protersters can yell for police to be ''fried like pigs in a blanket'' [ and then that very language used verbatim in the last FACEBOOK entry by the assassin killer of two NYPD officers ], when college students with too much time on their hands can freak out over ''white privilege'' while daddy re-boots their VISA and DISCOVER cards for another month,when drunken female doctors on Florida vacation can kick the hell out of an UBER driver and his ride who is just trying to get away, when female teachers account for the biggest rise in student rapes ever seen in this nations history [ as opposed to making them up at the ROLLING STONE where male frats are concerned ], when nearly 2000 teenagers and young adults, mostly black, can engage in a hours long brawl at a Kentucky mall so huge, that police and sheriffs from three counties are brought in to restore order,when an proven anti-Semitic Al Sharpton can spend time at this nations White House in order to ''advise'' Obama, when screaming revisionists can summarily order the total removal of Woodrow Wilson, when Occupy Oakland is allowed to get their point across by throwing Molotov cocktails and chunks of concrete at police, when ''Hands Up, Don't Shoot'', a totally invented lie, is utilized in such a manner that bullets start flying [ at cops. Not BLM protesters ], when arrogant IRS director priques can simply defy court orders and continue destroying more evidence that would have you, me, and everyone you ever knew locked up in prison,when a piece of cloth bearing a St. Andrews Cross sends you liberals into apoplexy, [ but not one bearing an ISIS device ], when boys are kicked out of school for chewing a POP-TART into the likeness of a gun, [ or a clock is mistaken for a bomb ], or a Falwell can be freaked out over because of something he said, but the killers of San Bernardino , Ft. Hood, and a half-dozen other US locales still represent a ''religion of peace'', when Barry laments the tone of discourse in a SOTU only a handful of months after his own officials referred to Republicans in Congress as ''suicide bombers'', and '' extremists'' with ''bombs strapped to their vests'', when we are supposed to give a damn about  the Oscars. We cannot forget about the Oscars.........and when we are lectured by errant hypocrite liberals who act as though this crap only started with a Trump............http://nypost.com/2016/01/29/t...</comment>

<comment>Is that all you got? 8)</comment>

<comment>You let  'em have it, Captain, sir.</comment>

<comment>Many people have TV shows.  Many people get rich in real estate.  It takes rare talent to do what Trump has done.  His crime is not being a member of the DC elite.  His sin is he is winning.</comment>

<comment>no.  trump has a few more crimes than being an outsider.  he rips off others by joining business deals, walking away with cash as others do down the tubes as the deals crash.  when he wins, check your wallet.</comment>

<comment>Trump builds great buildings.  I have seen them.</comment>

<comment>You mean the mob run construction companies and their undocumented workers build them, right?https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>He built a mediocre building for rich people in Chicago, slapped his name on it in the ugliest and most garish way possible, and wants his recognition for building the 8 Wonder. Classic Trump.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Chicago's Trump Tower is a beautiful building. The architect deserves credit for that. But, aside from that, what does an attractive building have to do with running for president? </comment>

<comment>Cruz and Rubio are first term senators.  As senators they have thin records.</comment>

<comment>True enough, but I'm listening to what they are saying. Cruz is a religious fanatic and Rubio panders to whatever group he is addressing at the time. Neither is to be trusted. </comment>

<comment>"I have seen them."have you seen the great buildings that are built by others and owned by others, but have trumps name plastered on them for a payment to trump?or have you seen a building that he built and then took into bankruptcy a time or two because of what?  bad management?or have you seen a building that he built, and owns with a mortgage?with trump it is hard to know what you have seen.  with trump it is all smoke and mirrors: that only thing he knows that will help him in washington.</comment>

<comment>But he's operating within the law, is what Deus is saying I believe..</comment>

<comment>He has business associates that do not.</comment>

<comment>I'm not delving into each of his associates.. If a law was broken, consequences should have been levied..</comment>

<comment>He does have a talent for self-promotion. Statesmanship and leadership, not so much.</comment>

<comment>" No serious presidential candidate has ever had Trump’s depth of documented business relationships with mob-controlled entities. The companies included S&A Concrete ,which supplied building material to the Trump Plaza on Manhattan’s East Side, court records show. S&A was owned by Anthony “Fat Tony” Salerno, boss of the Genovese crime family, and Paul Castellano, boss ofthe Gambino family. The men required that major multimillion-dollar construction projects obtain concrete through S&A at inflated prices, according to a federal indictment of Salerno and others."</comment>

<comment>"do what trump has done?"  he came into life very, very wealthy.  those people have an enormous leg up over everyone else, then he went into the family business, using all dad's connections. It's not like he was a peanut farmer who became president.</comment>

<comment>Regarding Trump's statements, I don't like the way he often expresses himself. However, if you listen to him directly, his statements aren't as bad as when they're filtered through third parties. For instance, he said a portion of illegal immigrants coming from Mexico might be criminals (that's undoubtedly true of any population crossing over a porous border). He didn't say all Mexicans are criminals. He also said we need to limit Muslim immigration from the Middle East (where we're fighting illegal proxy wars) until we figure out what is going on regarding ISIS and our vetting process (kind of like how we restricted travel to the US by young ethnic German men during WWII). He didn't say ban all Muslim immigration for eternity or ban American Muslims returning home.  Yet, that's how it was spun.Look, I'm a Democrat, so I'll admit the guy isn't perfect. But there's some truth in the things he says. Of course, he's over the top.</comment>

<comment>Democrat here. I agree.</comment>

<comment>They've always known the white, blue-collar demographic was a key part of the base, but could only dog whistle to its fears out of concern for appearing overtly bigoted.  What Trump's done is pick up a megaphone and shout to it directly while surviving criticisms from the party elite to tone it down.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps peole are just sick of the elite political class in this country that continually defies the will of the electorate?</comment>

<comment>And therefore, Trump? BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</comment>

<comment>So they throw their support behind....someone who is intimately in bed with the elite political class?  Sure.  Makes sense.</comment>

<comment>I get that Trump supporters like what he says. But he has offered no specific policies other than keeping immigrants out. He just brags about how great he'll be. He's shown real ignorance on important areas of policies. Yet his supporters say "oh he'll get things done." Like what?</comment>

<comment>He'll do what he's told; they all do... or else.</comment>

<comment>Borders work everywhere else in the world where they want them to work..</comment>

<comment>Trouble is, US forces are protecting the borders of lots of nations on the globe.. we are stretched very  thin... thus, our borders are very porous.</comment>

<comment>None of our border guards are on anyone else's borders that I know of..</comment>

<comment>Bill, the US has armed forces stationed in Germany, to protect the borders of Germany and the NATO countries.  The US has armed forces stationed in Japan, to protect and defend Japan's borders.  The US has armed forces stationed in South Korea, to defend the S. Korean border.We have armed forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia and lots of other places.</comment>

<comment>We don't use military forces to guard our borders.. That job is delegated to the USBP..</comment>

<comment>Ike used the US Army to secure the Mexican border: Operation Wetback... Google it.Seems to me that US armed forces should be charged with border security, not some bloated and corrupt bureaucracy.</comment>

<comment>A fence with technology assist would suffice.. If you can secure 10 miles, you 10,000.. It all depends on how dedicated you were to getting it done.. Borders have been secured for eons..</comment>

<comment>Yeah, The Great Wall of China, Hadrian's Wall... Israel's Security Barriers.  The US could sub-contract  erecting the wall to the Israelis?</comment>

<comment>See what they do and then do what they do.. Fairly straightforward.. We've got 2 thousand years to look back on as to what worked and what didn't..</comment>

<comment>I agree, Bill.  But common sense is not all that common in Congress or the WH.  Powerful special interests dictate US policy; what makes sense to those folks may not make sense to the rest of us.</comment>

<comment>Which is why our borders are swiss cheese currently..</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>"Which is why our borders are swiss cheese currently.."We've got a lot of miles of coastline. Even with a mile high wall on the boarder with Mexico, people can still get here.</comment>

<comment>(repostS) If you can secure 10 miles, you 10,000.. It all depends on how dedicated you were to getting it done.. We put a man on the moon with a Casio watch 50 years ago almost.. This is not rocket science here..</comment>

<comment>In history which walls have worked? Even the Iron Curtain was a boondoggle.</comment>

<comment>Israel has a good thing going..We put a man on the moon with a Casio watch 50 years ago almost.. This is not rocket science here..</comment>

<comment>That's a land grab, also Israel maintains a military occupation on both sides. We're not going to invade Mexico.</comment>

<comment>I'm speaking specifically to the effectiveness of their border security......but also besides the point.. This is not an insurmountable task, given that we can pretty much do whatever we want when we put our minds to it.. We are the greatest nation on the face of the planet, EVER.. There isn't much we can't accomplish.. This is no different.. Whatever someone else can do, we can do 3 times as well.. All it takes is the commitment to do it..</comment>

<comment>We don't have to waste money and live in a seige like mentality in America. I'd rather we aim to push new boundaries in space exploration and technology than something that is a waste.</comment>

<comment>Sorry.. A country without borders isn't a country.. This we will just hafta agree to disagree with..</comment>

<comment>I just caught that.. Live like a siege nation?? We're not keeping you in.. You can leave whenever to wherever you want........as long as the other country will let you in (most actually have borders)..</comment>

<comment>Mexicans aren't trying to murder us with suicide bombers. Let's not mistake the differences in reasons for a border fence. Israel lets Palestinians in every single day to work in Israel.</comment>

<comment>Berlin Wall...</comment>

<comment>but in the end we have only one total u.s. budget to pay for military and u.s.b.p.  where are you going to get the money to do more than is now being done?the supporters of trump already feel that they pay too much.  mexico paying is a pipe dream.  where is the trump tree that the money is growing on?</comment>

<comment>I know where we can get 500 million tomorrow!!</comment>

<comment>probably in the line item you least care for.  probably not in a careful consideration of what is needed or not needed in the budget.</comment>

<comment>Tariffs.</comment>

<comment>at least you are not, lotus position, on a pinstriped carpet chanting "mmmm no new taxes ommmmm"  that is a really worn out mantra.</comment>

<comment>We simply return to our previous method of removals. When people get sent back home, others realize that paying $6000 to a smuggler is foolish. The UNHCR unilaterally redefined its definition of "refugee", but not only did they not bother to get the whole body of the UN to vote on it, they also didn't get it ratified by the various signatory countries. We are under NO obligation to evaluate claims for refugee status for people who do not face persecution FROM THEIR GOVERNMENT. Poverty, crime, even natural disaster sufferers are not entitled to a claim of legal status. If that were true, people in Flint and Detroit could make the 30 mile trek to Canada and demand refugee status. Obviously, Canada wouldn't grant it to them. They would be summarily returned to the US. Canada also returns people from Latin America who come to their country illegally. Needless to say, they haven't developed a problem with 12-20 million illegal immigrants as a result. And that's in spite of the fact the the wage for unskilled labor is significantly higher in Canada than in the US!</comment>

<comment>Ummm, the primary goal of the military is to defend our borders.Oh, unless you think immigration is an invasion? This is when hyperbole hits reality.</comment>

<comment>I'm not against it, but that hasn't been the role of the military..</comment>

<comment>That is the entire role of the military.</comment>

<comment>Posse Comitatus Act,18 U.S.C. § 1385, means the Military aren't used for Border Control like you would think.Military can't do Law Enforcement, and USA has had non militarized Borders since before the Civil War, after agreements with the UK over Canada.States even had full control over immigration from other countries till 1889</comment>

<comment>The borders between states are not to be controlled by federal forces is how I interpreted that statute; but I'm not a legal scholar.</comment>

<comment>That's why we have ICE and Border Patrol: they are LEOs, but also Federal Officers.Military members are not</comment>

<comment>Wow. So true. Good way to put it. Makes you think.</comment>

<comment>No, they don't.</comment>

<comment>We will just have to agree to disagree on that one..</comment>

<comment>You miss the point. Trump "has offered no specific policies" for anything. His followers just make a huuuuuuge leap of faith to believe he would "do things" great.</comment>

<comment>Like make him  much wealthier, he has no capability or desire to do anything that will actually help the "common man."</comment>

<comment>I don't believe that.. He's got the right drive and reason for running, I just don't agree with the path he wants..</comment>

<comment>True. Trump might not make decisions based on getting wealthier, but he's got a well-established history of doing things because of his ego. The tough guy was scared away from the debates by little ol Megan.</comment>

<comment>i don't think they are supporting him for his grand policy proposals, because he has none, they are supporting him b/c he is an outsider and a richy rich and they think he will make them rich too.</comment>

<comment>He's mentioned tariffs! Some poor black and white people in Flint could probably use some of the jobs they result in.</comment>

<comment>Tariffs would 1) raise prices on goods that we buy 2) lead to retaliation from trading partners 3) doubtful tariffs could be raised high enough to compete with developing economies 4) even if they did compete, still wouldn't bring jobs back - not for a long time.Tariffs are the only thing he has mentioned that even partly resembles a solution. He's great about talking about the problems though!Flint has a different problem that would not be helped one whit by tariffs.</comment>

<comment>Tariffs=More higher-paying manufacturing jobs; higher prices.Status quo: Child slaves in China make gadgets for Americans; lower prices; higher unemployment; continued decay of the Rust Belt and beyond.</comment>

<comment>Tariffs don't produce higher wages, unions do. Tariffs simply protect domestic corporations.</comment>

<comment>Manufacturing jobs are higher wage versus most service jobs. Tariffs would make US manufactured goods competitive with countries like China, which have unfair advantages, including no environmental regulations, slave wages, no unions, currency manipulation, and government support. Tariffs=more manufacturing jobs.</comment>

<comment>Protecting domestic corporations products the jobs they offer and thus protects the people working at those jobs.</comment>

<comment>As mentioned in arrib65's point 3), you'd never get tariffs high enough to manufacture a lot of the stuff you see in the stores in the US, if you put a 50% tariff on them, you just pay 50% more. Do you want to pay twice as much, or more? Then maybe. Twice as much, lower your purchasing power by half, this is what you're proposing to do to yourself?</comment>

<comment>Perhaps, if it leads to more jobs in Detroit and Baltimore. It's a social justice issue, I suppose.</comment>

<comment>keeping immigrants outhe probably realizes the measures would be too extreme for the mainstream media so he doesn't say it upfrontthats the difference between a businessman and some college prof</comment>

<comment>He's the avatar of white working class anxiety, particularly in the South. Globalization is wrecking them, and the slow motion dismantling of economic white supremacy is dissolving their unofficial safety net. Policies don't really matter to them because theirs is not a policy concern. Except, of course, how to keep the immigrants out; the one policy (ridiculous as it is) Trump has deigned to outline.</comment>

<comment>Here's the thing, if you're white, working class, and you really want someone to stick it to "those people" and shut down abortion clinics and put prayer back in the classroom and all that, you've been disappointed by every President since Nixon.  In in the 41 years and change since Tricky Dick slithered out of the Oval Office, Republicans have held the white house for a little over 22 years, to Democrats' 19.  In addition, Republicans have several times held both chambers of Congress, and had a majority of appointees on the Supreme Court for decades.In spite of all that, none of your pet projects have been addressed, not really.  Women, somewhere out there, are still getting abortions and taking birth control.  The country is ever more urban, integrated and multi-racial.  Homosexuality is now so accepted that the Supreme Court has said you have to let them marry.  Needless to say, it's been a bad few decades for you, member of the Silent Majority.But wait, there's more!  Now that W.'s gone, your only champions in the Republican establishment are sad sacks like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum--men so debased they let themselves get pushed around by a milquetoast like Romney.  You've kicked the bums out by voting for Tea Party candidates, but somehow all they seem to want to do is cut your benefits and rail about fiat currency which, you don't know, sounds dishonest, but it's not putting food on your table or keeping the bank off your back.  Sure, benefits need to be cut for inner-city moochers, but you have a mortgage like a good American, and you need help!  But no, all the Republican Party seems to care about is abstract economic bullshit that you're finally admitting doesn't seem to make a bit of difference.Then along comes Trump.  He knows what the problem is: Mexicans.  They're why our jobs aren't as good anymore.  And there's more, he's ready to stick it to China.  You're not too sure how the trade balance works, but those Chinese have got to be cheating, and you know that a lot of factories are closing because they're making shit over there.  You see it stamped on the cheap plastic crap you buy at Wal*Mart all the time.  Whatever else you can say about Trump, he's not one of those other guys.  He's a businessman.  He's got clear ideas and he's not going to get bogged down in the details.  He calls 'em like he sees 'em: problems with terror? Kick out the Muslims.  Sure he's abrasive, but he's on your side.  And hey, he made a bunch of money, how dumb can he be?That's what people see in Trump.  It's what people always see in fascists.</comment>

<comment>Except I don't want to see the abortion clinics shut down.  They represent a demographic good.  Blacks and even the "culturally conservative" (if you believe National Review) mestizo population both get more abortions than Whites.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for that clarification. To be clear, I didn't mean to downplay the importance of vicious, idiotic, revolting racism in the rise of Trump.</comment>

<comment>Even if they do whitey's days are still numbered.</comment>

<comment>Go shout that from the rooftops.  Go to all the normies and cucked Whites you know and tell them about how their days are numbered.   Do my work for me.</comment>

<comment>Normies? Cucks? American Psycho persona? American Renaissance fan—lel private Disqus profile? "Do my work for me"; LOL sharpen your keyboard for that race war edgelord.</comment>

<comment>I'm a veteran.  When the time comes, I'll have more than a sharp keyboard, gramps.</comment>

<comment>The minuscule heat you'll be packing won't save you from ending up on WORLDSTAR, beaten to death by a black schlong.</comment>

<comment>LOL that sounded pretty faggoty.</comment>
