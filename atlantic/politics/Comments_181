<comment>Most people in France, Spain and Italy fall into the same category.</comment>

<comment>I was going to leave a comment to say exactly that.</comment>

<comment>"Evangelicalism, by contrast, has long embraced the notion that everyone must choose their own religion."In my experience, evangelicals are the worst for indoctrinating and brainwashing their children into the evangelical faith. That they tell their children that they must choose, doesn't in any way abrogate the fact that the culture of American evangelicals leaves these children with no conscious choice not to choose.</comment>

<comment>Eh, not so sure about the significance of childhood indoctrination into a faith that explicitly states it is a conscious and deliberate act (adult baptisms, anyone?) contra one in which the child's earliest memories are of being a "card-carrying" member.  (I was raised in the Roman church, since adopted Anglicanism and now parent a child in it.)  My best friends left Lutheranism for a nonspecific evangelical faith, and we compare notes on religious upbringing of our kids.  I have already sat down with my 8-year-old to tell her our Anglicanism is what I and her late mom believed (in), and we are showing it to her (persistently but not exclusively, because she attends Roman services when necessary to join extended family members' special events), but someday it will be her decision to persist with it, or not.</comment>

<comment>Sorry to hear about the loss of your wife.  My father is 85 and still deeply mourns and misses his mother who died when he was in 6th grade.</comment>

<comment>I have experienced miracles and read about apparitions and miracles of Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary. After many years of research and experiences, I have come to the conclusion that the Roman Catholic Christian Church is the true Church of Jesus Christ. Salvation is through the Catholic Church. The grace of salvation flows to other denominations through the prayers and petitions of the Catholic Church. Many children born with Catholic parents are converted to other faiths or religion due to poor upbringing, poor teaching, association with bad elements, and false indoctrination from other faiths. I taught catechism at a fairly large Catholic Church, and I was appalled on the subjects that the administrator was enforcing to teach the young students. I refused to teach their methods which was basically protestant teaching. Instead I taught the Church's Catechism. At graduation, my students became strongly Catholics and some parents came to thank me. The message is that the children must be taught with the truth, and the truth is in the Catholic Church. With this statement I made, I would expect rebuttles.</comment>

<comment>That "adult" baptism may not be all that adult.  I was raised in the Baptist church and was baptized at about 16. It wasn't really a personal choice, it was just expected and I wasn't old enough to go against expectations.  It wasn't until I was in my 20s that I realized that I wasn't religious and had never been.  I now call myself agnostic but it could just as easily be atheistic.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I hear this over and over, sometimes in the political context of "We're outbreeding the liberals!" The most extreme cases homeschool their children, don't allow even secondary access to the outside world via TV and Internet and have virtually arranged marriages within their community. Come on, even the Amish let their kids have rumspringa.They do, however, switch between Evangelical churches pretty often.</comment>

<comment>Given the amount of conservative evangelicals and Catholics leaving the faith of their youth its clear "outbreeding" is not a successful end strategy.</comment>

<comment>It's only when you get outliberaled by the Amish that you realize you are a true conservative. JC.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that at some age their children will want to have sex and move away from any religion that says they can't have it. Conservative religious parents can screw like rabbits to out breed the liberals, but they'll need something more than religious indoctrination to keep their children in the fold.</comment>

<comment>As a survivor of an Evangelical household, I find your comment pretty dead on.  The indoctrination is so damaging and invasive that the "choice" is there in name only.  The fear of making the "wrong" choice is so intense, that it takes a great deal to decide to leave the church without residual worry.</comment>

<comment>And many heavily-indoctrinated children grown up to eventually leave the faith, often seeking opportunities to act out their rebellion by adopting views that are very different from those they were raised with.</comment>

<comment>Adults must make choices, and parents raise children to eventually make important adult choices. That said, evangelicals disdain the implicit ethos that "what you believe doesn't matter as long as you think you're a good person" -- everyone believes they're a good person (or at least believes they're so much better than Hitler [you may insert villain of choice] that it doesn't matter. There was only one good person, and "the heart is deceitful above all things" so evangelicals encourage regular and careful contemplation of one's motives.The article simply states that there's a huge gap between credo-Catholics and cradle-Catholics. No surprise, the same gap exists between credo-Jews (e.g. Hasidics) and cradle-Jews (atheists), credo-Americans (Craig Ferguson) and cradle-Americans, etc.</comment>

<comment>As someone who grew up Catholic in Ireland and have not attended a mass other than for funerals in the last 5 years, I would definitely consider myself a cultural Catholic rather than a practicing one. I am not at all surprised by this article, and you can certainly find it happening in many predominantly Catholic countries in Europe. Catholicism is something very connected with Irish identity and despite the fact that I am no longer practicing I would always consider myself one.</comment>

<comment>Catholicism, as a back up plan??.</comment>

<comment>Or, more like the healthy food you should eat, the exercise you should do etc?</comment>

<comment>Same here only with Polish roots.  I don't practice but I would still consider myself Catholic primarily for ancestral and traditional reasons.  Then again if they specifically asked me what my religion was I'd probably still say Catholicism.  So maybe I'm not part of the 9%.Also, Catholicism has specific entry ceremonies (baptism, confirmation) and if you've done all that stuff (like I have) then you're in for life - unless you totally disavow the religion (something I'm unlikely to ever do).</comment>

<comment>I am a cultural Polish Catholic as well.  I think Irish, Polish and Italians are very similar in having large populations that are cultural catholic.</comment>

<comment>James 2:10 “And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.”Luke 11:23 "He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth."</comment>

<comment>Well, youre not.</comment>

<comment>Even the Pope would hesitate to be so arrogant as to make that judgement.</comment>

<comment>It should be noted that the Catholic Church, as a matter of its own canon law, still considers inactive Catholics or even Catholics who practice a different faith to still be Catholics.</comment>

<comment>Is this the new canon law?</comment>

<comment>no, it is the same as in the code of 1917.</comment>

<comment>History plays a role. Anglicans, Old Catholics, Eastern Catholics, as examples, are all Catholics but they are not Roman Catholics - their churches are not in communion with Rome.  Even though they don't recognize the Pope as their leader, they are 100% Catholic.</comment>

<comment>The Eastern Catholics are in communion with the pope. The Catholic religion is made up of the Roman church and the 23 or so Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with the pope. For example, the Syro-Malabar and Armenian Catholic Churches are not Roman Catholic but are still in communion with the pope. Catholics of any church may attend mass at any other Catholic church.This is in contrast to the Anglicans and the Old Catholics who are in schism with the pope, so they are not Catholic in the capital 'c' sense.Most Christian groups claim to be catholic with a little c because catholic means universal and the church on earth is described as catholic by the Nicene creed, which is the standard doctrine of faith for most Christian churches.</comment>

<comment>SOME Eastern churches are in Union with Rome- the Maronites and the Melchites for example.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that what I claimed? I said the Eastern Catholics are in communion with the pope. The Orthodox, Nestorians, etc. are not. For a full list, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Kind of like this group of 'feeneyite catholics ' who are unrecognized by the NH Roman Catholic Diocese. "Deliver Us. . . a religious cult vs Richmond, NH. " and " Lead us not. . . the true story of the first religious discrimination lawsuit in NH. " Amazon. </comment>

<comment>Proof-texting is not very Catholic.  It has crept in as part of American Catholicism's cultural exposure to Protestantism and fundamentalism, though.</comment>

<comment>My man the Dane Train fits into this box nicely, and then spazzes right out of it.</comment>

<comment>Ah, you never really leave the Mother Church. Everything's so standardized and ritualized. I've been to some Protestant churches - mainline are like Catholic but some of the other are really out there - and the latter sound like they're hawking snake oil with New Age language. God is magic! He'll make you a new man, He'll forgive your sins with no atonement and not even any remorse if you don't feel like it, He'll get you a nice new house and all you have to do is write a check towards the pastor's.Now the Catholic universe is nice and ordered and operates mainly on guilt and shame. The priests have taken a vow of poverty and aren't transparently bloodsuckers (they're frequently another kind of predator, but nevermind that), God isn't going to come off His cloud to make you rich or strike your enemies down, you can be forgiven for your sins but you also have to be sorry and do penance. It's more of a real-world worldview that's not really worth rebelling against even if you stop believing it.I know quite a few people who have eased out of Catholicism into *gasp* Presbyterianism or Episcopalianism, who'd like a happy medium between our crazy authoritarian rituals and evangelical Protestantism's crazy self-serving antics. It seems nice enough. Ugh, but they don't know how to cook!</comment>

<comment>heh...Catholicism is the means that allow us to strive to be the best people God intended us to be. The shame and guilt are human emotions we feel when we have sinned or have not lived up to God's Grace for us.And yes, that Shame and Guilt miraculously disappear when the sins go away.</comment>

<comment>"The priests have taken a vow of poverty and aren't transparently bloodsuckers (they're frequently another kind of predator, but nevermind that)"http://www.themediareport.com/...http://www.americancatholic.or...Although, of course even 1 case is inexcusable, bearing false witness (they're frequently another kind of predator) is not acceptable.</comment>

<comment>Vow of poverty? Who are you talking about? Catholic bishops and cardinals live like princes. Have you ever been to the Vatican? Even the priest in the little village I grew up in, had a nice house with a housekeeper and a well assorted wine cellar.</comment>

<comment>Do a little research and you will find that not all priests take a vow of poverty.  It is all dependent upon the order they belong to or if they are a diocesan priest.</comment>

<comment>This is no surprise at all. I converted to Catholicism in college while my wife was raised in it. While my heritage is Catholic, neither of my parents sought to pass it on to me or my siblings. My wife on the other hand is a cradle Catholic. We lament how so many call themselves Catholic, yet do not follow the faith. It is a dilution of the brand when the news reports: "9/10 Catholics support gay marriage/divorce/birth control/women priests." The cultural Catholics do not know or practice the faith, yet claim it as their own and espouse beliefs that directly contradict Catholic teaching. This leads to confusion among non-Catholics, allowing many to believe that ALL Catholics are intellectually lazy, ignorant, and hypocritical.</comment>

<comment>The word is 'beliefs.' Maybe it is something other than heterodoxy that makes Catholics look 'intellectually lazy.'</comment>

<comment>Typo corrected. Don't worry, I won't judge your pedantry if you won't judge my inability to type using a teeny tiny touchscreen keyboard or use auto complete.</comment>

<comment>I sincerely hope that your neck doesn't snap when you suddenly stop judging, you presumptuous arbiter of faith. And I don't think that it's your keyboard that's teeny tiny.</comment>

<comment>You sound angry. hear let me allou u to correkt mai speeling. Feel better now?</comment>

<comment>But, instead, your soul, your heart, your understanding. Your oxymoronic claim of a church both Catholic and pharisaically juridical. 'Teeny tiny,' indeed. 'Pedantic,' indeed.And, no, I don't feel better. You upset me. You drive people away from the Spirit and it upsets me.</comment>

<comment>Give me a break; conservative Catholics cherry-pick just as much. See the reactions to the Pope's encyclical on climate change.</comment>

<comment>Nah, I will question anyone who thinks he or she is more Catholic than the Pope. The right action, though, is not to throw stones, but to bring sinners to truth. Engaging without hostility seems to be a lost art.</comment>

<comment>Calling Catholics with whom you disagree "intellectually lazy, ignorant and hypocritical" is hardly "engaging without hostility."  There are disagreements within Catholicism about many of the issues you mentioned, even though JP2 and Benedict refused to allow official discussion of them.  </comment>

<comment>Anyone claiming to be Catholic who does not embrace the Church's teachings is not Catholic and should cease claiming so. The positions are well reasoned, codified in the catechism, papal encyclicals, and the code of canon law. Failure to accept the teachings is disobedience to the authority of Jesus and his apostolic successors.  Ergo, to hold contrary views is to NOT be Catholic. </comment>

<comment>what happens when the church changes its doctrine like eating meat on Fridays? What happens when the church required all priests to be celibate? What about the split between East and West? Just because the language is the same does not mean the result is the same. Natural Family Planning is something I would argue is basically the same as contraception.</comment>

<comment>Not eating meat on Fridays was a discipline, not a doctrine.  A spiritual discipline is a recommended practice to deepen one's faith.  A doctrine is a Catholic teaching, like Transubstantiation.  You can't conflate the two.</comment>

<comment>I remember when  it was made  okay to eat meat on Friday.My parents still served fish every Friday. I also remember confirmation classes. One day the priest got talking and called the Virgin Mary the Holy Comforter.Well momma asked what father talked about. when I got home.,When I told her what he said, She looked at me like she was mad, and spit out "The Holy Spirit is the Holy Comforter." What momma said  was indeed correct.Boy it's a good thing  the priest didn't say it in front or her,she would have chewed him out.All I said was Oh. I thought well is he right or her?,and then  I decided momma must be right.If my dad had heard that, I'd have gotten a lesson in apologetics,since he studied it under the Jesuits at Marquette University.And while my parents didn't go to mass very often,both had dated people of different faith, momma a jew and daddy a presbytarian.Neither would  give up their Catholic faith for anyone,not even someone they may have loved before they got married.</comment>

<comment>Why didn't they go to mass very often?  The Eucharist is the nourishment of faith, so it seems strange that their faith would be important to them, but they would skip the weekly mass.</comment>

<comment>These guys cherry -pick, too, they don't like for people to know divorce happens even in their compound. "Deliver Us. . . a religious cult vs Richmond, NH. " and " Lead us not. . . the true story of the first religious discrimination lawsuit in NH. " Amazon. </comment>

<comment>@Hot_Lunch, Your describing Phony Want To Be Hypocrite Christians,,,,,, NOT Catholics!</comment>

<comment>And Jesus told us to judge the sin, not the sinner.  He specifically told us not to judge, lest we be judged.  It is not our place to declare who is or is not a "real Catholic".  For crying out loud, you have people arguing about whether Pope Francis is a "real Catholic".</comment>

<comment>I don't see why anybody would be confused.  I mean what group out there has such a monolithic belief system?  The Catholic church has their official position just like the Democratic party has its official platform, and the company I work for has their official business strategy.  I disagree with the leadership of those organizations on many things and others do as well.  Catholics aren't just doing the bidding of the pope.  They can think for themselves.  And its not just the cultural Catholics taking these opposing views.  Plenty of weekly churchgoers favor things like birth control and gay rights too.</comment>

<comment>eh don't forgot the Eastern Church. I don't really see how the Catholics are any more monolithic than Democrats or corporations. We all argue with each other and come together for appearances. Also...on birth control, the Catholic Church effectively approves it through Natural Family Planning (having sex when you cannot conceive). Gay rights may just get their day sometime in the future.</comment>

<comment>Romans 14:13Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.I don't think playing "more Catholic than thou" does anyone any favors.  If Christ, himself, chose to associate with tax collectors and prostitutes, who are we to judge more harshly?</comment>

<comment>The only judgment I have passed is that people shouldn't call themselves something that they are not. Calling a sin a sin is not judgment. Failing to treat a person with dignity because of his sins is.</comment>

<comment>How is calling yourself a Catholic while being an imperfect human being a sin?  By telling others to leave the church, that they do not deserve to call themselves Catholic, you are not responding to them with love.  It is different to talk with someone and try to show them that are misunderstanding church teaching, but to tell them they are "intellectually lazy, ignorant, and hypocritical" and making you look bad, only drives people away.  Faith is a journey.  If you feel you are further in your journey than others, you should encourage them, not disparage them.You should expect the world to misunderstand and condemn you.  Jesus told us specifically in the Beatitudes to expect this.</comment>

<comment>The people I am discussing are not IN the church, have no intention of being in the church, and in many cases never were in the church. I would be gladdened if more people took an interest to learn the teachings of the Church, observe the sacraments, and attempt to live holy lives. But one cannot claim membership in a group with which he or she has no affiliation. Why should I let a large group of people, who have no interest or stake in my Church, define to the outside world what my religion believes. This level of confusion contributes to the perception, which is often true, that Catholics are intellectually lazy and hypocritical in their faith. Witness the comments section of any article regarding Catholic organizations seeking exemption from ACA birth control mandates. "Why are they fighting this when 9/10 Catholics use BC." Those 9/10 are non-adherents to the faith and their opinions should not reflect upon Catholicism.</comment>

<comment>Your frustration that government officials are attempting to make legal arguments based on poll numbers, rather than doctrine, still doesn't mean that you should discourage these people from remaining Catholics.  "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" - it is far better to encourage people to remain Catholic and work with them where they are than to reject them wholesale.  There is a reason Christ told the crowd that "He who is without sin should cast the first stone."  Since we are all sinners, we are not in a position to judge each other - we can teach what is right and wrong and then we should lead by example, not but condemning others.</comment>

<comment>I think we are talking past one another. I don't get what you are saying and you don't get what I am trying to say. Maybe we should just conclude this thread. I don't want to push anyone away from the Church, but to claim membership requires certain obligations: attend regular mass, reconciliation, and the Eucharist. Abide by the teachings of the Church. While we all falter, the value is in the effort. Thanks for a lively discussion - Hot_Lunch out.</comment>

<comment>As a lapsed Catholic, I've always taken  "9/10 Catholics support gay marriage/divorce/birth control/women priests" to mean that Catholics are reasonable people who put faith in the right perspective, i.e., subservient to reason.</comment>

<comment>The faith is informed by reason. Read the documents. They were written by Doctors of Philosophy and Theology and peer reviewed among the magisterium. The logic is sound, if dense and difficult to read. I was drawn to the Church because the Church teaches faith AND reason. The teachings have withstood the test of time. That many Catholics hold contrary opinions to Church teaching is evidence of poor catechesis.</comment>

<comment>No, what I'm saying is that faith in light of obvious facts and logic is stupid, and thankfully most Catholics smile and nod at the priest when he condemns abortions or gay people or masturbation and go about their lives relatively sanely.</comment>

<comment>And all built on interpretations of imperfect translations of texts written long after Jesus Christ died.  The amount of certainty ascribed to this tenuous string of "sound logic" is astonishing.</comment>

<comment>Hey I was born into the One True Faith (TM) and went to Catholic school in the 1960-70s. That means I had to grapple daily with IHM nuns. Which means I am nothing short of a badazz. </comment>

<comment>I don't think this is a particularly new phenomenon.  We called them (i.e., we called ourselves) "Cafeteria Catholics" back in the day -- picking and choosing what you liked about the religion and leaving the rest.  It seems natural that out of this approach there'd be a broadening openness toward leaving the formal tenets of faith behind, while still retaining a sense of connection/rootedness with other aspects.  I haven't practiced as a Catholic for over 20 years (I'm an agnostic/atheist with Buddhist leanings, if anything), but I still have a deep attachment to certain rituals and memories associated with being Catholic, and my political views were profoundly shaped by the Catholic Worker movement.</comment>

<comment>Me too. While I never could believe in the supernatural, it's very clear that my beliefs about social justice come from the Catholic church. </comment>

<comment>Conservatives are cafeteria Catholics too. They're just sitting at different tables.</comment>

<comment>Of course.  Nothing about my post suggests otherwise (at least I hope not).  And occasionally we even sit at the same tables.</comment>

<comment>They're likely people who were baptized as infants but don't practice anything except hedonism.</comment>

<comment>Like other commenters I often considered myself a textbook Cultural Catholic. Being of Irish Catholic extraction......religion was often just seen as an identifier, a part of my ethnic identity....part and parcel of what it meant to be an Irish Immigrant in the United States. A loose and perhaps crude analogy being how elements of being Jewish can mesh ethnicity and religion.Having now gone to the non-believer side I still identify greatly with certain aspects of Catholic moral teachings and Catholic education. I would just characterize being culturally Catholic as leaving the Church, but never really joining another one. </comment>

<comment>"Catholics Who Aren’t Catholic"??? I'm afraid that comes from the very top.</comment>

<comment>I did not know that you were in charge of deciding who was a True Catholic (tm) and who wasn't. Normal people just take another's word for it.</comment>

<comment>Good luck with that,</comment>

<comment>Maybe they read the BIBLE and realized that 98% of what is taught in the Catholic Church is either DIRECTLY CONTRADICTED IN SCRIPTURE OR WAS PROHIBITED BY SCRIPTURE and allowed in their church in direct DEFIANCE of the BIBLE.  To wit....WARNING*** THIS POST IS FOR BIBLE BELIEVERS ONLY***** If you do not believe that the BIBLE is the word of God, keep it moving.The pope is a lying false prophet and almost EVERY TENET of his false doctrine is either PROHIBITED IN THE BIBLE, DOESN'T EXIST IN THE BIBLE, OR IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT JESUS AND HIS APOSTLES TAUGHT ON THE GIVEN SUBJECT. Behold......2 Timothy 3:16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:The pope thinks that commenting on homosexuals is him judging them. God ALREADY JUDGED HOMOSEXUALITY IN THE BIBLE !! He even had MEN under HIS INSPIRATION WRITE DOWN THOSE JUDGEMENTS SO THAT MANKIND WOULD KNOW WHAT GOD'S WILL ON ANY GIVEN SUBJECT WAS.   Why doesn’t the pope know that the bible is God’s judgement against the behavior of man? Thou shalt not seems abundantly clear.Jesus said to call no man on earth “Father” for we have one “Father” and He is in heaven.Matthew 23:9New International Version (NIV)9 And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.The pope’s church calls priests “Father” and the pope “Holy Father”.  Jesus specifically said that the glory of being called “Father” BELONGS TO GOD AND GOD ALONE. Why does the pope think that he can usurp the glory of God for himself. Wouldn't that be called BLASPHEMY???The pope tells YOU that the mission of Jesus Christ on Earth was to “BRING PEACE ON EARTH’, his church tells you this every Christmas. Yet JESUS CHRIST warned us not to think certain things about him or his purpose in coming. One of the things that Jesus WARNED US NOT TO THINK was…..oh, let’s just read it shall we?Matthew 10:34-39New International Version (NIV)34 “Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did notcome to bring peace, but a sword. 35 For I have come to turn“‘a man against his father,    a daughter against her mother,a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—36    a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’37 “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 38 Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.So JESUS CHRIST WARNS YOU NOT TO THINK that he came to "Bring Peace" but the Catholic Church LIES about this EVERY CHRISTMAS?The pope and his church tell you that he is the MEDIATOR BETWEEN MAN AND GOD. The bible says that there was indeed a “mediator” but has a different take on who that might be.1 Timothy 2:5New International Version (NIV)5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,Oh, so the pope is USURPING THE GLORY OF JESUS CHRIST by calling and allowing himself to be called “the Mediator between man and God”, since the BIBLE tells us that the mediator is JESUS CHRIST.  So if the CATHOLIC CHURCH tells you that THE POPE is the MEDIATOR between God and mankind and yet the BIBLE tells you that the MEDIATOR IS JESUS CHRIST wouldn't you be going to HELL for believing the C.C's LIES?The pope tells you to pray to Mary, Peter and a thousand other saints. Exodus 20:1-5 tells you not to have other God’s before the Lord Almighty and not to bow down to them nor serve them.AND JESUS SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU TO PRAY NOT TO MARY BUT TO THE FATHER.Matthew 6:6But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.Add to that the fact that we were told also that whatever we do in WORD OR DEED to DO IT IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST! And now you know why we say “Father in the name of Jesus”,Colossians 3:17And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.Why does the pope tell you to pray to someone OTHER than GOD?  Isn't that the DEFINITION OF BLASPHEMY???THE POPE and most FALSE CHRISTIANS support CHRISTMAS TREES! But DIDN'T GOD FORBID THE PRACTICE OF CUTTING DOWN, DRAGGING TREES INTO YOUR HOUSE AND DECORATING THEM?  WASN'T THAT FORBIDDEN BECAUSE IT WAS A PAGAN PRACTICE?Jeremiah 10:1-5King James Version (KJV)10 Hear ye the word which the Lord speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:2 Thus saith the Lord, LEARN NOT THE WAY OF THE HEATHEN,  and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.3 FOR THE CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE ARE VAIN: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.4. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.5. They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.NO, you don't get a "pass" because you call it a "Christmas Tree", GOD FORBADE THE PRACTICE OF PUTTING TREES IN YOUR HOUSE AND DECORATING THEM PRECISELY BECAUSE IT WAS A STUPID "HEATHEN" PRACTICE!!! Funny how it was the FALSE CHURCH that introduced this practice to "christianity" isn't it? I mean, read the new testament, any decorated trees in there? Nope.JESUS LINKED BAPTISM TO SALVATION IN JOHN 3:1-8 AND MARK 16:15-20. Romans 6:3-5The WORD “baptism” in the greek, which the N.T. is written in,  is the word “Bautizo”, Bautizo MEANS TO BE COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN WATER. When JESUS was baptized in MATTHEW 3 HE WAS COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN WATER. The false church of COURSE had to change even this! SPRINKLING is not BAPTISM.   The APOSTLES told you that there is ONLY ONE BAPTISM, inEphesians 4:5King James Version (KJV)5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism,BUT IT ISN’T THE BAPTISM THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH PERFORMS!!! Peter, whom they lyingly claim as their “First Pope” SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU HOW TO BE BAPTIZED!!  When the Apostles received the Holy Ghost in ACTS 2:1-4, they came down onto the street still speaking in tongues, people mocked them Acts 2: 13, leading to PETER giving the FIRST SERMON WITH THE INDWELLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. At the conclusion of this sermon which goes from ACTS 2:14- ACTS 2:36 the PEOPLE TO WHOM HE PREACHED asked PETER what they needed to do to be saved like the Apostles and disciples.. THEY WERE TOLD TO BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. The false church does NOT baptize you in the name JESUS CHRIST but rather in three empty titles, none of which are NAMES..Acts 2:37-41King James Version (KJV)37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.The BIBLE declares that any church which prohibits people from MARRYING ( priests and nuns) AND also asks it's congregants to ABSTAIN FROM MEATS ( no meat on Friday) IS A CHURCH OF SATAN. Paul told Timothy that this church would get it's "DOCTRINE" from DEMONS.1 Timothy 4:1-4King James Version (KJV)4 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:He prophesied this to Timothy so that the Bishop could IDENTIFY the false church that arose. And you know what ELSE a "False church" that received it's doctrines from DEMONS would do? It would LIE about the nature of CHRIST'S MISSON HERE ON EARTH.  I printed this at the top but it is worthy of in depth examination! WHY DO THEY LIE ABOUT WHAT CHRIST CAME TO EARTH TO DO ????Every year the Catholic Church tells you that Jesus came to "BRING PEACE ON EARTH", all of you without question have been VICTIMS of this HEINOUS LIE. Is it just a "mis-interpretation"? An INNOCENT MISTAKE perchance? Nope. It's the EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT JESUS CHRIST STATED HIS MISSION TO BE!!!!Not only did Jesus never say He came to "bring peace to the Earth", but it's something that JESUS CHRIST WARNED YOU SPECIFICALLY NOT TO THINK!!!!!  WHY WOULD THEY LIE?Matthew 10:34-39King James Version (KJV)34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.Since these verses exist in EVERY BIBLE in the WORLD we can conclude that it isn't an innocent mistake which has the POPE telling you the EXACT OPPOSITE of what Jesus said that HIS mission was!!WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS? There are two choices and neither of them good. Either they are spiritually prevented from UNDERSTANDING THE SCRIPTURES like PAUL said the JEWS were, Romans 11:25, OR THEY ARE ACTIVELY DECEIVING YOU. There are no other choices, JESUS SAID DO NOT THINK THAT HE CAME TO BRING PEACE ON EARTH, they tell you that this is the reason that He came, only one of these two statements can be true and it ISN'T the Catholic one.They teach you a baptism that is FALSE both in form and method, which is dangerous since JESUS linked your BAPTISM to your SALVATION, Mark 16:15-20, John 3:1-8, Romans 6:3-6 and it's DOUBLY DANGEROUS SINCE JESUS HAD HIS APOSTLES TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY that there is ONLY ONE BAPTISM which HE respects, Ephesians 4:5They DON'T do "all in word or deed in the name of Jesus", much preferring that of Mary, they LIE about his very purpose in coming, and they force their congregants to COMMIT BLASPHEMY EACH AND EVERY TIME THEY ADDRESS A PRIEST AS "FATHER" OR THE IGNORAMUS POPE AS "HOLY FATHER".     A Christian Church would not do ANY of this.  Google the pope ( not this one the former) sitting in front of AN UPSIDE DOWN CROSS, and you'll see pictures of the prior pope sitting in a thrown like chair with a satanic upside down cross on it.  Catholics will say that they are honoring "Peter" their alleged first pope ( ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE REJECTED EVERY SINGLE THING THAT PETER SAID THEY MUST DO IN ORDER TO BE SAVED, SEE ACTS 2:38), because legend has it that Peter asked to be crucified upside down because he was not worthy to die as Christ die.  ONLY A COMPLETE MORON would believe the latter explanation.  THE CROSS UPON WHICH PETER DIED HAD NO POWER WHATSOVER so only a BLASPHEMOUS FOOL would elevate that which has NO POWER to the equal of the CROSS OF CHRIST, WHICH HAS ALL POWER!!!Galatians 6:14But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.THE CROSS OF JESUS CHRIST is the only thing that can RECONCILE US TO GOD!! Not PETER'S cross!!!Ephesians 2:15-17King James Version (KJV)15 Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;16 And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:17 And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.Peter's death couldn't save ANYONE so why would the manner of his death warrant a token? A token that "coincidentally" is the SAME AS THE ONE THE SATANISTS USE TO MOCK CHRIST!  A CHRISTIAN church would not do this.CONCLUSION: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH which obeys the TWO TENETS by which PAUL SAID WE WILL KNOW THE FALSE CHURCH,  1 Timothy 4:1-4, i.e they would FORBID MARRIAGE ( priests and nuns cannot marry) and COMMAND THE ABSTENTION OF MEATS ( no meat on Friday), IS THE CHURCH OF SATAN.</comment>

<comment>A: You've got way too much time on your handsB: You're cherry-picking from both Testaments, while is only the New that counts (in Catholicism)C: you don't take into account the primacy of the Magisterium and of the Tradition.D: I'm clearly a non-believer, I don't even know why I am here</comment>

<comment>What else are you going to tell a pollster when you attend mass over the holidays to appease grandma and more or less know when to kneel, when to sit, when to stand and when to shake hands? An atheist? Can't take the risk he'll hang up and call grandma.</comment>

<comment>It still boggles my mind when I here that some Catholics left the faith over the priest-homosexual-pedophile scandal.  Every institution in the world, every organization, every corporation, every social group, every university, every college, everylaw enforcement group, every American government and, yes, every religion has had its' bad apples. Because some individuals fall it does not mean that the group is all bad. Most religious groups have had much worse sexual deviates than the Roman Catholic Church but the Roman Catholic Church is criticized more because it is the world's chief bulwark against immorality and the liberal media wants to pile on because so many of them are the guilty of immorality.  To be truly Catholic is to accept all the precepts of the Catholic Church, to live a moral life, to go to confession regularly so as to receive the Holy Eucharist.  Cafeteria Catholics are abominable.  They are not Catholic in any sense of the word no matter their protestations.</comment>

<comment>I think it's more a loss of faith in the church as an institution.  Other organizations didn't conceal the predators in their midst and shuffle them among parishes like jokers in a deck of cards.  (Insular Jewish and Evangelical communities suffer the same problem, for much the same reasons as the Catholic Church did -- protecting the organization at the expense of its victims.)</comment>

<comment>The shifting around was the major sin.  It has stopped and the guilty are being prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  But don't say other organizations don't shift miscreants around to divert blame on serious issues.  One only has to look at the Obama administration or the Hillary Clinton campaign or Bill Clinton's multi deviancies while in office.  What about the recent Tom Brady debacle or the Planned Parenthood scandals?  Buck passing thrives all around us.</comment>

<comment>"Everyone else was doing it" didn't cut the mustard in grade school and certainly doesn't justify the church's shocking institutional failure to protect its most innocent and vulnerable members.</comment>

<comment>Citation showing that other organizations didn't or don't do this?  I don't know of any organization (Penn State, public schools) that hasn't been guilty of this.I can tell you that now, in the Church any adult who has any interaction with children (even as minor as coming to the cafeteria to eat lunch with their child on their birthday) must undergo training about sexual abuse - the damage it does to children, the warning signs of pre-abuse behavior, and your duty as a Catholic: if abuse is imminent dial 911, if you suspect abuse, inform the police and then church officials.  I just took the class last Saturday, so that I can volunteer.  We also have to pay for a background check, which will be re-run every other year.  No system will ever be perfect, but the church seems to have done all that can be done.</comment>

<comment>I would argue many Christians live out a faith based on community than theology. The moral failings of the community strike nearer to the heart than any discourse on obscure passages in Esther. For Catholics, the church not only claims to be THE authority on Scriptural interpretation but also the living channel to God (papal infallibility). Of course moral failings here will be much more stigmatized and examined than in other institutions. Doesn't a widespread tragedy such as this challenge the doctrine of papal infallibility in most people's eyes? After all, aren't teachers punished more than the flock (Jeremiah 23:1, Matthew 18:6 or around there)?</comment>

<comment>OK but every time one of those organizations goes through a major scandal like that people also leave it.  So the Catholic church got the exact same treatment any other organization would have gotten.  How many people aren't eating at Subway anymore because of that goofy looking pedophile they had in their ads for 15 years?</comment>

<comment>If so called Catholics leave the Church because of weak sexual abusers then they were never truly Catholic.  The sins of the few must be separated from the truths of the Christ's true Church. There is no connection between the two.  The overwhelming number of bishops and priests are faithful God loving servants.  In God's eyes it doesn't matter how many follow or don't follow him.  It is there free will and choice for salvation or not.</comment>

<comment>Yes but not every institution in the world, every organization, every corporation, every social group, every university, every college, everylaw enforcement group, every American government and, yes, every religion claim to be able to bestow incredible supernatural powers like forgiving sins and turning bread and wine into body and blood and have a pope can infallibly know that Mary was immaculately conceived and had from body physically assumed into Heaven.Believing that God cares more about the Church teaching on the Immaculate Conception or Assumption, than He does about it weeding out predator priests would cause most reasonable people to question the whole idea.</comment>

<comment>You miss the whole point.  Christ had sinners among his own apostles namely Thomas, who doubted his divinity, Judas, who betrayed him and Peter, who denied him three times   The Church, its' mission ordained by Christ himself, its' teachings as preached by Christ and its' destiny to last forever despite its' Nazi, Communist and Muslim enemies, has nothing to do with immoral errant members of the clergy who have totally ignored their vows.  The Church has and is dealing with these homosexual perverts certainly more than other organizations who allow them to plead the fifth and stay in their jobs.</comment>

<comment>"Christ had sinners among his own apostles namely Thomas, who doubted his divinity, Judas, who betrayed him and Peter, who denied him three times."Not after they were "ordained" on Pentecost. Jesus also pointed out the bad apple at the last supper."The Church, its' mission ordained by Christ himself, its' teachings as preached by Christ..."If you were honest, you wouldn't claim the Catholic Church was ordained by Christ himself and its teachings were preached by Christ. The Catholic church didn't even become the Catholic Church until Constantine made it the official religion of the Roman empire. There were many diverse teachings and scriptures.Until Nicaea they was no definite agreement even on who Jesus was. Arianism, the idea that Jesus was similar to God, but not God himself, was quite popular. Some contend the vote was even rigged because Constantine himself offered the word "homoousios", which affirmed they were of the same "substance".Marcion of Sinope was the first Christian leader in recorded history (though later, considered heretical) to propose and delineate a uniquely Christian canon during the 2nd century. It  included 10 epistles from St. Paul, as well as a version of the Gospel of Luke, which today is known as the Gospel of Marcion.It wasn't until the the early 3rd century, Christian theologians like Origen of Alexandria were using—or at least were familiar with—the same 27 books found in modern New Testament editions, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of some of the writings.Origen's canon included all of the books in the current Catholic canon except for four books: James, 2nd Peter, and the 2nd and 3rd epistles of John. He also included the Shepherd of Hermas which was later rejected.The matter wasn't firmly decided until the Council of Trent decreed what biblical books were to be considered canonical. This decree, the De Canonicis Scripturis, was from the Council's fourth session, of 4 April 1546."...and its' destiny to last forever despite its' Nazi, Communist and Muslim enemies"Its teachings have, in fact evolved and changed over time, despite efforts in claim otherwise, and are likely to continue to do so. Its biggest threat in this country is not its Nazi, Communist, and Muslim enemies. Its inability to appeal to upcoming generations is what could destroy it.A new survey from Catholics for Choice on the opinions of Catholic millennials as regards to doctrinal issues indicates  birth control and abortion, arguably the Catholic church’s most contentious issues, are not always perceived in a negative light by young Catholics.Among those polled, more than half say abortion should be legal in “almost all” or “most” cases, and 31 percent say it should be legal in “just a few” cases. Only 17 percent say it should be illegal. 78 percent say birth control should be included in insurance coverage, no matter where a woman works. Marriage equality is also embraced by Catholic millennials. 69% “strongly” or “somewhat” support legal same-sex marriage."has nothing to do with immoral errant members of the clergy who have totally ignored their vows.  The Church has and is dealing with these homosexual perverts certainly more than other organizations who allow them to plead the fifth and stay in their jobs."Yes, the Catholic church seems to now be dealing with dealing with its problem, which was really mostly pedophile perverts, not the merely "homosexual pervert" priests who chose not to act on their urges and those who engage in consensual same sex activities.But how long did it take them to do so and why did they wait until they were forced to? In many cases bishops, like Bernard Francis Law, Cardinal and Archbishop of Boston, covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in their archdioceses. They ignored complaints and moved priests around instead of dealing with them. This went on so long that In many cases the statute of limitations had run out by time they came to light.I think you are the one missing the whole point.</comment>

<comment>You are obviously a disgruntled fallen away Catholic.  I can tell by your detailed answers to very simple questions.  I accept "Christ's Church, the Catholic Church"  when he said to Peter "Thous art Peter (Rock) and upon this rock I will build my Church!"   Also, no real Catholic pays any heed tothe Catholics For Choice group.  They are all disgruntled ex Catholics who think the Church will and must change.  You, and they are all dreamers.  Pope Francis, for all his ambiguous non statements on homosexuals and abortion tows the strict teaching of the Church.  You fallen aways just don't get it.  The Church is not a democracy and Christ made that very clear time and time again.  Since you are a historian of sorts you should not forget Christ's own admonition, "He who denys me on earth I will deny before my father!"</comment>

<comment>I accept "Christ's Church, the Catholic Church"  when he said to Peter "Thous art Peter (Rock) and upon this rock I will build my Church!"Jesus said that to Peter somewhere around 30 AD. But, the Catholic Church's beliefs weren't clearly delineated until the Nicene council in the fourth century, where the Emperor Constantine, not Peter's successor the pope, ordered and presided over a group of church bishops and other leaders. Constantine called for a meeting of bishops to be held in Nicea to resolve some escalating controversies among the church leadership. The failing Roman Empire, now under Constantine’s rule, could not withstand the division caused by the years of hard-fought, “out of hand” arguing over doctrinal differences.If you have any real understanding of actual church history Christianity has always been divided in its beliefs. The only time it isn't is when temporal authority is exercised to prevent it. Constantine forced a definition of orthodox belief which was imposed on his subjects.The Church managed to maintain that control by discouraging diversity of opinion by calling it heresy and suppressing the works of Meister Eckhart and burning people like Giordano Bruno. It has continued that tradition in modern times with people like Charles Curran, Hans Kung, and Matthew Fox.The Church only lost this stranglehold when temporal authorities no longer supported them and protestant "reformers" could defy them and live to tell about it."no real Catholic pays any heed to the Catholics For Choice group."That is likely true if you are the definer of "real Catholic", but you aren't. " Pope Francis, for all his ambiguous non statements on homosexuals and abortion tows the strict teaching of the Church.and abortion tows the strict teaching of the Church."I actually agree with you. The pope is a something of a bind. The vast majority of Catholics have used contraception at some point in their lives. The majority support SSM. The pope really can't change church teaching on these things without throwing the whole "ex cathedra" idea out the window. It probably should have been long ago, but suggesting it brings consequences. Kung lost his authority to teach Catholic theology when he did."The Church is not a democracy and Christ made that very clear time and time again."I agree, the question is not if it is a dictatorship, the question is, who is the dictator? You say it is Christ. History does little to prove that. "He who denys me on earth I will deny before my father!"That sword cuts both ways, many evangelicals would issue the same warning to you, as they do to me all the time. I have little use for anyone who needs to reduce their arguments to threats of Hell. Since I get them all the time, I'm not really too phased by it.</comment>

<comment>The point was we have been asked not to pass judgement on one another "relatively few regular mass attendees are really practicing Catholics".  How does passing judgements on those who do come to mass help anyone?  Were supposed to reach out, encourage and help one another, not sit in judgement.  Posting things like your post just makes people feel unwelcome in God's house.  The Catholic church's mission is to follow Christ and to serve the least among us.  We were specifically told NOT to pass judgement on others - to judge actions, to help others with their faults IN LOVE, but to leave the judgement of others to God.I don't want your words to discourage anyone or make them think that they are unwelcome in God's house.</comment>

<comment>Allowing others to exist in a state of perpetual mortal sin is what you propose. If you do not confront people with their unfaithfulness and provide the support to restore them, then you are doing them no favors. You display the understanding of a child. A grown up recognizes when someone is hurting themselves and steps in to stop it. Would you allow your child to drink, do drugs, and participate in self-destructive behaviors? Would you be comforted by telling yourself that it is wrong to judge your child's actions?</comment>

<comment>The poster stated that he is judging other based on comparing the number of people he sees in line for confession, versus those he sees in line at Communion.  He has no knowledge of the state of their soul, when they last went to confession or anything else about them.  You are somehow assuming they are in a state or mortal sin, based on???I'm not sure what it is you think I should be doing - grilling those in line for Communion as to the date of their last confession and the current state of their soul?  The poster is not talking about someone he knows to be in a state of sin - even then, Jesus cautioned us to remove the plank from our own eye before attempting to remove the speck from our brother's eye.The only time I have been in a situation where I spoke to someone, was a friend who said that he didn't believe in Transubstantiation (or God), but was going to go to Communion to be part of the group.  I explained that by saying "Amen" and then receiving Communion, he was publicly declaring that he did believe and that if he didn't he could still attend mass but just receive a blessing instead of Communion.  That is a far cry from sitting in a pew, idly speculating on whether others deserve to go to Communion.  I prayed for years that I had done the right thing and not been a stumbling block to him.  Years after college, he met a married a woman from the Philippines and is now a practicing Catholic.Being a fallible human, I am sure that I fall short of the mark daily, but if you are going to post comments speculating on whether other deserve to attend mass, go to Communion or call themselves Catholic, you are not creating a welcoming community through which others can draw closer to God.  The point is that we should welcome others and journey with them in faith.  Christ was adamant about the judgement of the Pharisees upon the lowly being wrong.</comment>

<comment>I don't pretend to know what is in another's heart, but if I see something I know to be wrong, I address it. I cannot stop anyone from calling himself Catholic who does not practice the faith, or illicitly receiving the sacraments, but it is important to speak on it so that those who are doing so may know that they are doing harm. This gives them occasion to correct themselves. They may not correct themselves, but at least I have done my due diligence. I cannot say that I love a person while sitting idle when he injures himself or others. Love sometimes means making the difficult and uncomfortable choices. Love is sacrifice.</comment>

<comment>So long as you've removed the plank from your own eye first...</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Catholics are obliged to celebrate Confession or Reconciliation before Communion for serious (mortal sins), not venial sins.  While it is good to go more frequently, I'm not sure why you are elevating weekly Confession to a requirement.  My parents attend daily mass - are you thinking that they must also attend daily confession?I don't see Catholicism as hard work, more a privilege to try and follow in Christ's footsteps.  Your attitude reminds me of people who bemoan the hard work of parenthood and then wonder why people seem less interested in having children.  There are difficult parts to anything worth doing, but I would hope the joy of knowing, receiving and following Jesus would outweigh the burdens and hard work of being a Catholic.</comment>

<comment>Et cum spiritu tuo :)</comment>

<comment>It's what's in your heart that makes you Catholic...and only God knows what's in a man's heart.</comment>

<comment>This is false. Keeping the commandments and participating in the sacraments is what makes one Catholic. Worship how you choose, but do not claim to be Catholic if you do not obey the Church.</comment>

<comment>God judges a man's heart...not his participation or his obedience. I may not be a "good" or a "devout" Catholic(after all I am a sinner) but I am a believing Catholic and I'll take them over the "devout" ones any day.</comment>

<comment>I have decided that I never was a Catholic. They baptized me without my consent and  indoctrinated me at an impressionable age when I was too young to know anything.  My first communion at age 8 opened my eyes to the methods they used to instill fear and obedience in me. I left the church in my mind at that age, officially I could only as an adult.</comment>

<comment>I was raised Catholic, since 90% of the small town I grew up was Catholic. (the other 10% were mainly Mormon).  I was an altar boy from second grade to second year in college.  I reach the rank of Grand Knight of the Altar (which would be the equivalent of Eagle Scout in BSA).  I married a Catholic girl (still married after 43 years) in a Catholic ceremony.  But after years of living away from "home", we are both CINOs (Catholic in Name Only).  Nothing will change the fact we are Catholic, but we don't practice regularly.  About the only time we enter a church is for weddings or funerals.</comment>

<comment>The example of non-practicing Jews identifying as Jewish is within the realm of Orthodox Jewish law. Anyone born of a Jewish mother is considered to be Jewish, period.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that because Jews see Jewishness in terms of race, rather than religion?</comment>

<comment>Yes Jim,good point! It is an ethnicity with its own religion, but not a race -- there are actually black Jews from Africa and Asian Jews in India and China who are not racially from Semitic middle-eastern tribes -- and of course most European and North American Jews are white. Some writers call it a religious civilization or a cultural group based upon a particular religious philosophy. Thank you for your comment.</comment>

<comment>You are welcome.</comment>

<comment>This is ridiculous.  Try this one on in the Moose Lodge or any other organization.  One can not call themselves something just because they have been near or raised a certain way.  Catholicism like most mainstream religions require baptism with either the parent(s) choosing it for them or they themselves request the baptism.  Without Baptism and the other 2 Initiating Sacraments you can call yourself that all day long but it don't make you a Catholic.  If a person has taken part in these and   believes that they can't follow the rules of the Catholic Church then they are not Catholic. They can call themselves a Christian but they cannot call themselves Catholic if they are not practicing the faith.  A true Catholic must attend Communion and confession at the minimum of once a year and that is by Church standards from about 625 AD.  Prior to that anyone not living like and remaining within the confines of the Faith would have excommunicated THEMSELVES because all followers of Jesus would see them operating outside of the faith that Jesus Himself taught.  A person can call themselves anything but their actions don't show that they are Catholic.  To be Catholic is not to make choices against God's laws and the Church Dogma.  I can call myself a door but as a human that won't work.  I would be delusional to think that is what I am. Many  Protestants come across less serious in their faith because they act like if I don't like what is going on in the church I am at I can choose to leave and go elsewhere and still remain a Protestant.  This is not true about the Catholic Church.  I am not trying to slam them for that but rather trying to point out a different type of philosophy that exists.  Being Catholic is not being part of a denomination.  It is the original church and Protestantism is a branch of Catholicism and not the other way around.   people can say what they feel should happen but in doing so one cannot change TRUTH so that it fits their belief.  I am not saying you have to be Catholic unless you want to and then you must do and think like a Catholic as governed by God.  The church still preaches  what Jesus taught and much even goes back to our Jewish roots since Jesus was born a Jew, lived as a Jew and died as a Jew but rose as a Christian. Which back then was referred to the WAY.  Later about 50-75 years later the Way became known as the Catholic Church which had a Schism and formed the East and the West Byzantine and Roman.  Then in the mid 1500'[s the Protestant Faith was formed with Martin Luther a priest who broke away. .</comment>

<comment>Try telling that to the Catholic Church, which counts as members everyone who has ever been baptized unless they were actually excommunicated, even if they themselves say they're not Catholic.  The church is trying desperately to keep its numbers inflated (the Mormons do this as well).</comment>

<comment>If these people do NOT practice their Catholic faith,, then they CANNOT CALL THEMSELVES CATHOLIC!! PERIOD!! THEY ARE NOT TRULY CATHOLIC!!</comment>

<comment>As a recovering Catholic one thing i have to say is thanks i am now a very happy ATHEIST</comment>

<comment>So there is some hope for the world after 1,000 years of not. Now, if only Islam's acolytes can follow suit.</comment>

<comment>People didn't start choosing their religions because the State stopped doing it for them.  If that were the case, history wouldn't be littered with religious martyrs.You know, someday one of these "intellectuals" is going to finally get a very basic truth about Christianity - it's not a religion, it's a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  Without that, you can get baptized, christened, whatever, and you're still not a Christian.  I've seen Catholics become Baptists because they finally learned that truth outside "Holy Mother Church".</comment>

<comment>Another stinky study from Pew trying to prove the Catholic Faith is dying.</comment>

<comment>This whole concept of Catholic or not Catholic is a non-issue, really.  The thing they ought to be concerned with is whether practicing Catholics are what they think they are - Christians - or if they are fooling themselves, in which case the Bible says they're going to Hell.  Hey, I didn't say it, it's in the Bible, look it up.  Look, you've got a religion that preaches certain human beings are holy; that if you perform three miracles then when you die the holiest human can elevate you to being able to answer prayers and you can have statues and shrines in your name; that you have to have other human beings intercede for you with God instead of just going right to God in the name of Jesus Christ;  that God won't forgive your sins unless you go through one of these holy human beings; that Mary is on a par with Jesus; and that the bread and wine in Communion are not symbols but Jesus' actual blood and body.  All of which are not only non-scriptual but border on blasphemy.  I really think the "Christian" ship has sailed, folks.</comment>

<comment>It troubles me when Christians seem to relish the thought of others in hell.  If you believe others are in error, shouldn't you be praying for them and wanting eternal life for them, not waiting in glee for the Judgement Day?</comment>

<comment>John 6:48 I am the bread of life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die.I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world. Whoever eats* my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him.Matthew 26:26  While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and giving it to his disciples said, “Take and eat; this is my body.” Then he took a cup, gave thanks,* and gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins.Here Jesus institutes the Eucharist. It is not a symbol. It IS his body and blood because he says so! To have eternal life we must eat his flesh and drink his blood in the Eucharist.</comment>

<comment>Whether you (or I) like it or not, between the 4th and 16th centuries the Catholic Church was Christianity. To say otherwise is revisionist history.</comment>

<comment>Sounds about right. I was raised Roman Catholic but turned from that path over 30 years ago. However, I have come to the conclusion that, no matter what, I will always be a Recovering Catholic.</comment>

<comment>Any chance of a relapse :)</comment>

<comment>You cannot say you are a Catholic any longer IF you do not PRACTICE the faith.  Simple as that.</comment>

<comment>Any church with bishops has catholic polity or church government.  This includes Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists, Old Catholic Church members, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Apostolic church members, Nazarenes and, Mormons.  All these churches have a global presence, universal or, catholic membership.  Global presence for Christianity started not only with Paul but also with Apostle Thomas and his disciples in India and China 2,000 years ago.  The "nones" need to be updated and brought back to Christianity, not necessarily Roman Catholicism.  "In My Father's house are many dwellings;  if it were not so, I would have told you. ...."  John 14: 2.</comment>

<comment>You have more people who identify as "Catholic" than just Roman Catholics. You have Orthodox Catholic Christians and Anglican Catholic Christians who also identify as Catholic. The word "Catholic" simply indicates "universal".</comment>

<comment>My understanding is that catholic means universal when spelt with a small c - like in the Nicean Creed:We believe in one God,    the Father, the Almighty,    maker of heaven and earth,    and of all that is, seen and unseen.We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,    the only Son of God,    eternally begotten of the Father,    God from God, Light from Light,    true God from true God,    begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father.    Through him all things were made.    For us men and for our salvation,        he came down from heaven:by the power of the Holy Spirit    he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man.For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;    he suffered, died, and was buried.    On the third day he rose again        in fulfillment of the Scriptures;    he ascended into heaven        and is seated at the right hand of the Father.He will come again in glory to judge         the living and the dead,    and his kingdom will have no end.We believe in the Holy Spirit,    the Lord, the giver of life,    who proceeds from the Father and the Son.    With the Father and the Son he         is worshipped and glorified.    He has spoken through the Prophets.    We believe in one holy catholic         and apostolic Church.    We acknowledge one baptism         for the forgiveness of sins.    We look for the resurrection of the dead,        and the life of the world to come.Amen.</comment>

<comment>As an Anglican Catholic who was formerly an Antiochian Orthodox Catholic, I stand corrected. In the universal sense a small "c" is correct.</comment>

<comment>I remember this from college when a protestant friend argued that Catholics only considered other Catholics to be Christians because of the creed.  That didn't seem right, so I looked into it.</comment>

<comment>If I walked outside my office in five minutes and was struck dead by a runaway bus my family would no doubt arrange for a Catholic funeral irregardless of my current standing with the church.I have a feeling this type of hypothetical how people check off their religion on one of these polls.</comment>

<comment>I've referred to myself as culturally Catholic for over a decade. I was raised Catholic (was born in a Catholic hospital), went to Catholic school, spent a lot of free time at a Catholic Church, most of my friends growing up were Catholic, etc. etc.. And there's definitely something to be said for indoctrinated Catholic guilt and other aspects of the religion that you never really escape. Plus, I don't really see the appeal of any other religion, but am not an atheist. So, it's just easier. Now, if the Catholic Church ever got its act together and stopped being awful to women and LGBT+ people, maybe I'd consider practicing the religious aspects again lol</comment>

<comment>What always kills me is the low % of Christians who do not believe in god.</comment>

<comment>The author of the tale could have been more accurate.  Episcopalians, Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, Anglicans, Finnish and Swedish Lutherans among others are all catholic churches.  What you appear to mean is Roman Catholic.</comment>

<comment>America started the notion that people ought to be free to choose their religion.  Up until then, religion was largely imposed upon people.</comment>

<comment>The title does not make sense.'Catholics Who Aren’t catholic' & 'catholics Who Aren’t Catholic'Will work</comment>

<comment>If you are any sort of cultural Catholic I would like to respectfully suggest that you consider visiting your local parish and getting involved, as an experiment. My family enjoys a wonderful community life at our church. We help with the liturgy and religious education. We help people with major life transitions, such as birth, marriage, and death. We have a homeless shelter in our former school building. We've made many friends, and all the priests and sisters we've known have been remarkable people. We really don't talk much about religion, but we do experience a joyfulness in serving others. I don't see anything quite like this in the secular world, but I'm sure these things would be found in other denominations as well.</comment>

<comment>Another look at churches in America."Churches ad hoc: a divine comedy",http://members.efn.org/~hkrieg...</comment>

<comment>The only group I know that is ethnically Catholic is Irish Catholics.  It's bound up in history and politics for them, not just religious practice.  So I can see that someone of that background who has converted to another religion might still use Catholic as an ethnic marker.  That doesn't seem to happen with any other group, but then there are a lot of Americans who are descended from Irish Catholics.</comment>

<comment>David Schneider anticipated the underlying issue in his classic article "Kinship, Religion and Nationality" in the collection Forms of Symbolic Action in 1969.</comment>

<comment>Jews haven't had this problem. Your great-grandparents might have converted when they were children, but when the long knives came out, Jews knew that they were the target. It happened in the 16th century; it happened in the 20th century; it could happen again.</comment>
