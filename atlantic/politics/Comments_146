<comment>I suspect he will stop somewhere short of liberal heroes FDR and Lincoln.</comment>

<comment>Oh he's planning on bringing back the NEA?  Where did you hear that?</comment>

<comment>NRA, though I recognize those initials have been usurped.</comment>

<comment>As long as he doesn't go full conservative hero Andrew Jackson where he genocides the Cherokee/Muslims because he didn't like them, I'm not too worried.</comment>

<comment>Andrew Jackson was a Democrat.</comment>

<comment>And would win all 2,472 Republican delegates if he ran this year. Old Hickory's blend of populism, personal violence and full-spectrum racism would be unbeatable.Edit: I agree, Mitbert, but Q was a proto-Republican who died before the party's founding.</comment>

<comment>And John Q. Adams would win zero delegates.    In 1828 Democrats won every red state in addition to Illinois and NY, while Republicans dominated New England.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/....  But some people still can't fathom that the parties have reversed.</comment>

<comment>He was the last male President.  He beat the crap out of a guy who tried to assassinate him.  Something shocking to today's effeminate society, right?</comment>

<comment>Teddy Roosevelt, who gave an hour-long speech after being shot, rivals him for toughness, but Jackson was ferocious. He was nearly 68 when he beat down his 35 year old would-be assassin. https://upload.wikimedia.org/w...You may owe a fine to your ideological soul mates for implying that St. Reagan was a sissy.</comment>

<comment>Reagan,compared to Jackson, yes, compared to Obama, he was the man of the Century.</comment>

<comment>He also adopted an Indian (native American for you sissies).  He liked Indians who sided with the USA, if they supported the British well....................</comment>

<comment>Doesn't make him not conservative.</comment>

<comment>When did Honest Abe become a RINO? Our toxic modern politics shouldn't destroy the consensus on Lincoln's greatness. </comment>

<comment>John always changes the subject when somebody in the GOP is being criticized.</comment>

<comment>Sure – he was one of the greatest – but he also suspended habeas corpus.He also could've played the long game with the south instead of ooting for a war that killed over 600,000 people and left the south mired in poverty for the next 80 years. </comment>

<comment>"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it." - U.S. Constitution Article I, Section 9, Clause 2And Lincoln tried to prevent the war up through his Inauguration.Edit: west_coast_ange is right about me falling for the deflection, but defending Lincoln's honor is more fun than contemplating the depravity of much of the current GOP electorate.</comment>

<comment>Getting deeper into changed subject.See? It works.</comment>

<comment>Next he'll bring up Baltimore, Chicago, and Detroit, because, Democrats. And black people.</comment>

<comment>... and sumptin', sumptin, and Obama.</comment>

<comment>Plus the man hunted vampires.  His honor deserves defending.</comment>

<comment>"left the south mired in poverty for the next 80 years."Well, you can blame that at least as much on the Radical Republicans' idea of what Reconstruction should mean.</comment>

<comment>Ummm, yup. Johnny has to continue lying in order to deflect. The South started shooting at Americans first. The South rose in rebellion, not the North.So John, when are you going to address the topic of Trump's overt hatred of the First Amendment?</comment>

<comment>Unlike most of you on the left, I don't reflexively support everything Republicans say.I have already said that I'm not a Trump fan.When are you going to call Obama out for denying US citizens their constitutional rights without due process?</comment>

<comment>"I have already said that I'm not a Trump fan."Then you shouldn't have a problem sticking to the subject.</comment>

<comment>So you do support Trump's ignoring the First Amendment. I'm not sure why though. But I'm sure you have your reasons for deflecting.Ya, embarrassing, isn't he. C'mon, how can a real Republican hold their head up when someone like Trump holds the lead in the polling. If I were a Republican, I'd hang my head in shame too.</comment>

<comment>"So you do support Trump's ignoring the First Amendment. "Evidence please.</comment>

<comment>Uummm, your posts on an article pointing out that Trump wants to discriminate and enact laws against a religion.</comment>

<comment>The First Amendment does NOT apply to foreigners trying to get into the country.</comment>

<comment>What part of "The government shall make no laws ... impeding the free exercise of religion" do you not understand? While the government may restrict nationalities, there is no allowance for restricting a religion.</comment>

<comment>Lincoln incited the war, which he wanted, by preemptively ramping up Union troops at Fort Sumpter and blockading the Charleston shipping lanes of commerce. Once that occurred, the south really had no choice but to militarily engage to reclaim the ports and protect its commercial enterprise trade economy.</comment>

<comment>Uummm, Lincoln wasn't even the President when South Carolina started shooting. But go ahead, I'm sure in the fantasy world you live in you have your own revisionist history.</comment>

<comment>Revisionist history. None of that is true. If Lincoln did anything it was not pull the troops from The fort, but then again, it was a federal fort. Why would he pull them?</comment>

<comment>South Carolina militia started shooting at a Federal supply ship on January 9, 1861, Lincoln wasn't sworn in as President until over two months later.</comment>

<comment>I stand corrected. Buchanan could have removed the troops but chose not to. I believe that was the correct and responsible decision.It's no secret that the South Carolina militia was pumped to shell the fort. Charleston was the epicenter for the rebellion. It blows my mind that there is alternative history floating around.</comment>

<comment>Lincoln was about preserving the Union at all costs. Every move he ever made as POTUS was for this sole reason. He came around to emancipating the slaves because he needed to make a political decision that would eliminate the South's petitions for legitimacy and the chance of a diplomatic solution through the eyes of Great Britain. Once Lincoln made the war officially about slavery 'and' secession, it became very unpopular for the once pro-South House of Lords to continue supporting Confederate states that were outwardly warring to preserve slavery. Lincoln did several things that historians question as executive overreach, but he always maintained that he was justified because his main goal was preserving the Union. He did not even run for reelection in 1864 as a Republican nor did he condemn the Confederacy in his reelection speech. Remember, he ran with Andrew Johnson, a Tennessee Democrat sympathetic to the South. He wanted to show unity because he was always about uniting the states.</comment>

<comment>Since when did Republican and conservative automatically mean the same thing? The whole 'RINO' thing is laughable, but more importantly, it shows the hijacking of the Republican name and it's principles by the conservative movement.</comment>

<comment>Somewhere short of civil war would indeed be a good place to stop.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that supposed to come out next May?</comment>

<comment>Liberals hate Lincoln, he freed the slaves.</comment>

<comment>Wait, wait -- Lincoln is only a hero of the Liberals? I'll grant you FDR (while noting that the entire country voted him into four terms), but are you sure Conservatives want to wash their hands clean of Lincoln?</comment>

<comment>Southern conservatives for sure!</comment>

<comment>It still holds true.  Trump is basically what would happen if the conservative disqus commentators ran for president</comment>

<comment>I'm not entirely sure spud ISN'T Trump.</comment>

<comment>No way.  Trump is the charismatic patent medicine salesman, and Spudsie is the troglodytic customer.It is like the difference between Cardinal Richelieu and Quasimodo.  One is evil, but it is possible to feel affection for the other as misguided as he is.</comment>

<comment>Nah.  I doubt that Trump believes 95% of what comes out of his mouth.  The rabid base, on the other hand, has fully bought into the con.There are true believers in Congress: Mick Mulvaney, Rob Woodall, Sean Duffy, Tim Griffin, etc.  But none of them could make a name for themselves in national politics.  The good news -- I suppose -- is that you can't be dumb enough to be a true believer and smart enough to manipulate the top echelons of the system.  The top is occupied by hucksters and charlatans -- not morons.</comment>

<comment>I also doubt that half these trolls believe their points.</comment>

<comment>I wish I agreed! My faith in their trollish self-awareness has eroded (Russia and climate hacks excluded, as many of them are probably paid trolls who know exactly what they're doing).</comment>

<comment>Mitbert's right. Trump going from centrist Democrat/RINO, to far, far-right demagogue in less than a few months (his campaign hasn't even lasted a full year) pretty much reeks of the flip-floppy dishonesty and attention seeking he's been known for in the past.Especially since he still hasn't openly cut ties with the Clintons, and frequently backtracks and peddles from his original comments like he will with this one.</comment>

<comment>Fair.</comment>

<comment>I'm certainly no liberal and Real Conservatives call me a commie pinko, but this is what it'd be like if I ran for president:github.com/24AheadDotCom/polit...If/when Trump decides to stop appealing to yahoos in order to win the nomination he might decide to have a platform similar to that. He certainly has enough money to buy smart proxies who could handle the process-related planks (like Debate, etc.)Trump is certainly smart enough to realize that he can't win the general by continuing his yahoo outreach, but continue thinking Trump is always going to be like he's been so you'll get a nice surprise.</comment>

<comment>Trump is winning by saying things that are true, but politically incorrect. This offends you, and because it offends you, you're claiming that he is clearly appealing to crazy people by saying these things.The "conservative" establishment today are in fact cuckservatives who only serve corporate masters. That's why Trump is winning the regular people over, too, as well as people who otherwise wouldn't have voted at all since they have no representation.</comment>

<comment>You lack the smarts, sanity, and integrity to understand my issues with Trump and thus you demonstrate for us what I've been saying about Trump fans for months:24ahead.com/n/12097Please reply and further demonstrate for us that Trump fans are dumb and deranged.</comment>

<comment>Atlantic progressive demagoguery and lies against Trump and against supporters of America has reached new lows."...“I would certainly implement that [national Muslim database]...".So we see that Trump DID NOT SAY the words that Atlantic's writer wished he had said, to make an easier target. So the nonexistent words are merely fabricated and inserted in brackets - in the hope that a non-discerning reader will not think about what was done.In fact Trump was referring in that interview to something else. Anybody who wants to see the whole interview in context will see that.  ( I have previously debunked this lie- but Atlantic keeps using it anyway, of course )."...Trump has also publicly suggested that Muslims be required to carry special ID cards...".Another lie. This krappe article does not even try to supply the fictional Trump quote, since it does not exist.The technique here is transparent. Don't take on Trumps' actual policies head on.Find the most extreme person or persons who have been labeled as Trump supporters and try to strawman those.As if Obama should have to account for somebody like Vester Flanagan, the TV station mass-killing Black gay, who wore his Obama button on the air</comment>

<comment>It's so funny that Trump's suppoerters are doing something he would never do, go back and try to tone the Donald down. It's like you know he's saying is bad for all people and that this hatred is poisonous to our democracy, social cohesion and American way of life.</comment>

<comment>B*llsh*t. You people are lying. It's that simple.  I support Trumps' policies 100%.</comment>

<comment>>Fingers jammed tightly in ears<"You people are lying!!!  I can't hear you!!!!</comment>

<comment>You just outed yourself as an idiot. Maybe you can explain the logistics of his proposals, because he sure as hell cant. He appeals to your bigotry, and you foam at the mouth.</comment>

<comment>Actually, he did that a long time ago.  He's a fairly entertaining idiot though.</comment>

<comment>WOOO CONSTITUTION BE DAMNED!</comment>

<comment>Who needs a constitution when we have men like Trump, or Trump. And don't forget Trump, he can lead America out of the wilderness. Then there is Trump.</comment>

<comment>It's funny that a guy who complains about losers so much can't see what's in front of him.See you losers in january 2017 when you're trying to explain to yourselves why you lost again.  And again.  And again.Maybe bring back the flag burning amendment nonsense?  That worked well back in the day.</comment>

<comment>"Don't take on Trumps' actual policies head on."He doesn't really have any.  He's running on hyperbole and generalities.  All fueled by the fears of the ignorant.</comment>

<comment>You are ignorant of Islam and you fear being labeled as not PC.Ironically, an Indian guy whose family and ancestors have lived next door to Muslims for 1000 years posted in agreement with me. I would think he knows more about the topic  than you do.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who isn't a practicing Muslim retains some ignorance of Islam.  That's quite different from the general ignorance I referred to above.As for "PC", I'd have to believe in such a boogeyman to fear it.  You do realize such an entity doesn't actually exist right?  At best, you're just railing against the aligned opinions of independent - and well-educated - thinkers.</comment>

<comment>Wow, now you are in denial about the existence of PC. Even Obama has spoke out against PC on college campuses.You are wading in deep Kool-Aid.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's all a big, coordinated conspiracy - like global warming.Funny, though, how you paraphrase Obama's words after challenging the Atlantic authors for editing Trump's.</comment>

<comment>I did not dishonestly f*ck with an Obama quote the way Atlantic did with Trump.If I choose to present the Obama quote - I do it verbatim.YOU are the guy being dishonest now.</comment>

<comment>Most Muslims retain some ignorance of Islam, as most Christians are ignorant of broad swaths of what the Bible says.</comment>

<comment>Yes, one Indian dude speaks for all Muslims.  Exactly.</comment>

<comment>A non-Muslim Indian dude.</comment>

<comment>Dude, most major religions embrace violence against others, usually with the caveat that is if they are attacked. And yes the Christian Bible Old Testament is rife with tales of attacking and killing others in the name of their god. No different from the Muslims using their book to justify themselves.</comment>

<comment>So true.</comment>

<comment>So...how many Christian suicide bombers have we seen lately, committing mass murder for Christ?</comment>

<comment>So now you are a Trump revisionist.  Trump would cast you out.  He stands behind his statements, and does not try to dishonestly explain them away.Spudsie, you are going to crash and burn soon.  Your demigod is committing suicide and all you can do is watch.</comment>

<comment>Too late, buddy.</comment>

<comment>You've tried your lies before- but Trump's poll numbers have gone up.</comment>

<comment>Bring up polls when you can't explain anything. You are just like trump.</comment>

<comment>Nah, not so much like Trump.  Trump would not try to explain away stupid things he said, he would double-down on them.  Trump inherited his daddy's billions;  Spudsie lives in his mother's basement.  Similarities, but not identity.</comment>

<comment>This will hurt him.  I think he will pull it back after this, but it may be too late.</comment>

<comment>Trump won't do a thing. The more his minions try to reinvent what he said, the more they will love him. For whatever reason, Trump is attracting the most stupid and bigoted of the right wing nut crowd. And he loves the attention.</comment>

<comment>He will stop when people stop supporting him.</comment>

<comment>It's crazy but not more than crazy than giving the government the power to arbitrarily put your name on a list and then deny you your constitutional rights without due process...</comment>

<comment>Thanks to W's patriot act.</comment>

<comment>Wasn't that. It was a seperate presidential directive from 2003. Congress never had a vot on the terror list </comment>

<comment>Ah, executive order... thanks!</comment>

<comment>Which Hillary and Biden voted for and on which Obama doubled down.Both parties are pro government power over the individual.</comment>

<comment>Still deflecting?</comment>

<comment>What about if during a divorce a spouse claims the other is violent? That usually results in the accused spouse being ordered to turn in all their guns. Not a criminal act, not a charge, no evidence even required. Just an accusation.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I agree that is ALSO wrong.</comment>

<comment>Yet, far more women have been killed or seriously injured by their spouses after a breakup every year than have all the terrorist attacks in the past 25 years in America.How about we draw the line at no guns unless you join the organized militia.</comment>

<comment>How about the line is ALREADY drawn at "shall not be infringed", and if you want to change that, you muster the votes for a new constitutional amendment to repeal the 2nd, or else STFU?Sorry, that was uncalled for...but if I just said "SU", you might think I was issuing an elevated Linux command.The reason for my rapid increase in hostility is simple:  you have taken a reasonable enough horse (that of the laudable desire to reduce domestic violence) and hitched it to a wagon full of crazy.  (taking away everyone's guns unless they form ranks underneath some Federally approved banner)How about simply initiating an INVESTIGATION into allegations of dangerous behavior or temperament, rather than simply accepting such at face value?  Such investigations to include penalties for demonstrable incidents of FALSE accusation?  It seems to me that measures such as these would mitigate your concern, without the need for your unconstitutional insanity.</comment>

<comment>Infringement is a matter of degree rather than a binary. Your right to bear arms has been heavily infringed for a long time. There is nothing in the 2A that limits the definition of "arms" to guns. Do you object to not allowing people on a terrorist watch list to own surface to air missiles or sarin gas? Those are both infringements on the right to bear arms. The real question is how much infringement/regulation is appropriate.  I think most people would draw that line somewhere between RPG and hunting rifle so I doubt you're that far apart on this.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, you are also mixing and combining elements, which occludes your argument.  "Unconstitutional" IS a binary.  By corollary, "infringement" as applies to the 2nd amendment is ALSO a binary:  that is, under our system of government, if Congress passes a law which attempts to place restrictions on that right, which the Supreme Court subsequently deems unconstitutional, then that has been identified as an "infringement".  This should be understood to be separate and distinct from the perceptions of individuals, who might indeed FEEL that their right has been infringed when they are asked, say, to refrain from publicly brandishing a weapon which Hollywood has trained the populace to associate with terrorists:  for example, an AK-47.If "We The People" have, by due process, created a 'terrorist watch list', consisting of people whose actions have been tantamount to SURRENDERING their God-given rights by virtue of dangerous or threatening BEHAVIOR, then to prohibit such people from owning SAMs or sarin does indeed seem reasonable to me:  but until such time as a case is brought before the SCOTUS, it is NOT an "infringement" in a legal sense, irregardless of my views or yours.That said, I am NOT opposed to allowing the people, collectively, to possess SAMs, or sarin, or NUKES:  the simple exigencies of existence rendering the necessity of the keeping of such large scale weaponry being entrusted to collectives, rather than individuals.  Anything which the government may ITSELF possess, should not be beyond the reach of, for example, a regular state militia.  I would go so far as to state that when our military first began to create such weapons, the citizenry should have IMMEDIATELY insisted that organized arms of the public retain equal control.  The need for such civilian oversight is made abundantly clear any time the subject of wresting control FROM this government is discussed, where proponents of the current regime are all too eager to point out the massive disparity between the force a civilian militia may be able to muster, as compared to that which is at the disposal of Federal troops.  How may a people keep their government in line, when said government may so easily cow its citizens by virtue of of such irresistible force?Furthermore, in the context of the current argument, I am opposed to the imposition of a "terrorist watch list", or "no-fly list", in which there IS NO DUE PROCESS, whose contents are sealed from being reviewed by the public, whose conditions for inclusion are not revealed, and for which there is no framework of APPEAL.  The idea that any administration "official" may decide to arbitrarily include a citizen on such a list, and in so doing, DENY that citizen their rights; borders upon the TREASONOUS.If a man threatens his neighbor, stating "If you don't turn that music down, I'm gonna blow your F#@%ING head off", then the case can be made that he has proven himself unfit to wield his rights as a free man.  If, however, he has done nothing more than post online his opinion that the First Lady is secretly a sasquatch, the same case can hardly be made:  and yet there is no documentation made available to the public to assure us that this is NOT in fact the current situation.Any time a government REFUSES to detail its actions to the people who purportedly form its motive authority, SUSPICION is warranted.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Fusion, do you have examples of this and evidence that this is the standard response?  I would think that this would vary widely by state and would generally run afoul of due process guarantees.</comment>

<comment>http://articles.chicagotribune...https://www.courts.wa.gov/dv/?...http://chfs.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyre...</comment>

<comment>thanks</comment>

<comment>Trump is indeed going too far (and has been for a long time).But the fact that the far left is calling him fascist, implying that they're not, is just rich.</comment>

<comment>So, instead you chose to imply that trump is not and the left is.  Got it.</comment>

<comment>The far left cannot, by their nature, be fascist. I usually disagree with you but you're not usually ridiculous. Calling the far left fascist is ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>I like what you did with your avatar.BTW, most of us were ignoring her.</comment>

<comment>Thanks! Someone else had the same one as me so i had to change. You must be glad to be rid of the Boehner</comment>

<comment>Ya, but in a way, I miss the old rectum.</comment>

<comment>Fascism has a specific meaning that is not the same as authoritarian or despotic. If you go far enough left you can get some authoritarian forms of government (USSR, Cuba etc.) but that is not what fascism means.If you get far enough out that you're getting into that territory the differences between the extreme left and right start to be less relevant than the similarities. While the ideologies of Nazi Germany and the USSR were quite different, at the most important level they were getting to a pretty similar place from two different directions.</comment>

<comment>Here's Merriam Webster's definition of fascism:"A way of organizing a society in which a government ruled by a dictator controls the lives of the people and in which people are not allowed to disagree with the government."Some on the left feel threatened when they get called fascist because their echo chamber has taught them fascism is "right wing."But according to Mussolini's three precepts of fascism...well, read them and see what you think:1. Everything in the state.2. Nothing outside the state.3. Nothing against the state.Does that sound like Donald Trump?Yeah, maybe a little.Does that sound like Naomi Klein, #BLM activists on America's college campuses, radical feminists, environmentalists who would jail climate change skeptics, and other large factions of the Democratic base?Definitely.</comment>

<comment>The White House?</comment>

<comment>GOOD!  In the 1930s and 40s the US gladly accepted Germans. We did not advocate for the acceptance of NAZIs. The Germans who came here did so with every intention of adopting the culture and values of america vs. their fascist homeland. When muslims come here they do NOT come with the intention of assimilation but with the ideological mandate to conquer the world, institute Sharia law and breed so fast (on welfare..your money) so as to overwhelm us and our culture. They preach this! Their book orders them to do so! Their psychotic religion mandates it. Are you not listening? Islam is NOT compatible with the civilized world. Low IQ 7th century hordes are NOT welcome.</comment>

<comment>Note that we didn't accept Jewish refugees.</comment>

<comment>thousands of Jews had been admitted into the United States under the combined German-Austrian quota from 1938–1941, the US did not pursue an organized and specific rescue policy for Jewish victims of Nazi Germany until early 1944.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that's my point.  We didn't accept Jewish refugees until well after genocide occurred.</comment>

<comment>"Thousands were admitted" can you not read?</comment>

<comment>Yes, and six million perished.Do you not understand context?</comment>

<comment>You implied that jews were excluded and I proved that they were not. Then we were at war. Then we accepted more. You have no point.</comment>

<comment>Given the low proportion and the policy at the time the statement holds.</comment>

<comment>It was a wee bit tough to allow immigrants from Nazi occupied Europe..duh. This has no bearing anyway on my argument against letting stupid religious muslims into the civilized world. I would exclude all religious zealots if that makes you any happier</comment>

<comment> This has no bearing anyway on my argument against letting stupid religious muslims into the civilized world. Annnd, the penny drops.</comment>

<comment>US embassies and consulates were still open as the US didn't sever diplomatic relationships during WWII which doesn't change the visa process or somehow make it more difficult.It was policy. https://www.yivo.org/cimages/r...</comment>

<comment>Germany was trying to expel the Jews during the last part of the 1930s. If you wanted to leave, the German Government would not stop you. They would, however, only allow you to leave with a very minimal amount of property.</comment>

<comment>No. You SAID they were but did not prove a thing. If you want to PROVE it, then put some citations in. Otherwise, it is just BS.This is so typical of the Right Wing Nut Job crowd. They claim whatever garbage comes out of their mouths is true. If you show them they are wrong, they will still lie and then claim you didn't refute them.</comment>

<comment>Come on.  He did not say "every Jew" was excluded.  The fact that some were admitted does not change the fact that we turned away ocean liners full of Jews who went to their deaths. You're being silly now.</comment>

<comment>Not exactly. Some German Jews were accepted into the US before WWII. Most were denied though.A major factor was that the NAZIs had taken so much of the Jews property that most could not afford to buy tickets or pay for the process.Then, there was still a large amount of anti-Jewish bigotry in the US at that time.The US could have accepted more but really didn't want to. There were still millions unemployed from the Great Depression. The last thing America wanted was more refugees looking for jobs. This is another easy to criticize today, but much more complicated in 1939.</comment>

<comment>The State Department turned away even more Jews than they accepted. Look up the MS St. Louis.</comment>

<comment>Good. We should't allow any religious group into secular america. If a delusional demented superstition is your primary world view stay where you are among your own tribe. Civilization is incompatible with bronze age nonsense, invisible celestial dictators and stupid doctrine.</comment>

<comment>They were refugees from Germany. You just claimed that America admitted thousands of Jews and then turn around and say they shouldn't have been allowed in?Civilization is incompatible when we start telling people what they may not think. Jew is and was a race.http://newobserveronline.com/r...</comment>

<comment>Judaism is NOT a race it is a religious cult. One of the 3 religious apocalyptic cults of Abraham. You can "think" anything you want but when you bring your religious ideology to a secular nation I have a problem. Superstitious death cults are NOT compatible with civilization.</comment>

<comment>Do you have any citations that Jews aren't a race?http://www.jewfaq.org/judaism....</comment>

<comment>There is one race from a common origin..Homo Sapien.  Some have suggested that there might be 4 "races"  namely white/Caucasian, Mongoloid/Asian, Negroid/Black, and Australoid....but we can all interbreed so there really is only 1 "race" and Jewish is no more a "race" than Mormon is</comment>

<comment>So you didn't go too far in school, did ya.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...BTW, I would suspect 16 sources would belay your impending denial of Wikipedia as a valid source. But then you haven't sourced anything.</comment>

<comment>Race is a biological term the same as "species" Even Darwin used the terms interchangeably.  "Race" is genetic not a choice. You would not change your "race" if you converted to Judaism  Judaism is a "belief" system and has no genetic component.</comment>

<comment>I don't see where you sourced your work. FAIL</comment>

<comment>Notice...Jew isn't on the listThe word “race,” denoting lineage, comes from a French translation of haras (silent “h”) into the Italian razza — which in Italian of that time applied to animals, not people. This points to current English and Italian usage being derived and adapted, respectively, from the French.A human race is defined as a group of people with certain common inherited features that distinguish them from other groups of people. All men of whatever race are currently classified by the anthropologist or biologist as belonging to the one species, Homo sapiens.This is another way of saying that the differences between human races are not great, even though they may appear so, i.e. black vs white skin. All races of mankind in the world can interbreed because they have so much in common. All races share 99.99+% of the same genetic materials which means that division of race is largely subjective, and that the original 3-5 races were also probably just subjective descriptions as well.The Major Divisions of the Human RaceMost anthropologists recognize 3 or 4 basic races of man in existence today.These races can be further subdivided into as many as 30 subgroups.Ethnographic division into races from Meyers Konversationslexikon of 1885-90 is listing:Caucasian races (Aryans, Hamites, Semites)Mongolian races (northern Mongolian, Chinese and Indo-Chinese, Japanese and Korean, Tibetan, Malayan, Polynesian, Maori, Micronesian, Eskimo, American Indian),Negroid races (African, Hottentots, Melanesians/Papua, “Negrito”, Australian Aborigine, Dravidians, Sinhalese)Do your own homework</comment>

<comment>So you still can't source your claims. LOSER.Exclusion of one from a generic list does not exclude that party from meeting the general requirements.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure the Native Americans of the 1500s and 1600s wish they had implemented that policy with respect to genocidal Christians.</comment>

<comment>Good point. It proves my point about invasion by ideological tribes who are bent on imposing their superstitious nonsense on everyone else</comment>

<comment>Really? I notice you still haven't sourced your claims on race.Once a liar, always a liar.</comment>

<comment>Have your mom help you with your homework. I don't debate children.</comment>

<comment>Still can't source your BS.</comment>

<comment>Vote republican if you want:Another WarAnother 9/11Another patriot actAnother financial collapse</comment>

<comment>Trump is doing this country an incredible service.</comment>

<comment>Vapid nonsense </comment>

<comment>He is giving people a real choice. A third way.</comment>

<comment>Explain how he'd implement his proposals, and maybe I'll believe you.</comment>

<comment>Economic protectionism through tariffs. Immigration restriction. Socially moderate on cultural issue except gun ownership. It's a platform even if you don't agree with it</comment>

<comment>Empty words. You think Mexico will really pay for that yuge wall? Lol</comment>

<comment>So, you support Multinational corporations in the US going out of business for due to sanctions?  Interesting -- how communist.</comment>

<comment>It was easy to sanction South Africa. Trying that with the USA would crash China, which would bring the whole house of cards down that is the western economy. South Africa was the 28th largesteconomy by GDP. Try that with #1?And no one wants to chance wrecking the world economy</comment>

<comment>Strictly speaking, wouldn't that be nationalist?</comment>

<comment>Note that economic protectionism + immigration restriction is recipe for eventual smaller, less powerful country.</comment>

<comment>It made us back to back world war champs.</comment>

<comment>There is no doubt in my mind that TRADE WARS and PROTECTIONISM is the only way to stop these trade deals that have been destroying our economy, our futures, our children' futures, our very lives.   Trump, again, is right.</comment>

<comment>Uh, so want to base this new economy on war machine?</comment>

<comment>like what happened to the USA from 1923-1965?</comment>

<comment>Again, essentially a war economy. Which works, but I don't think that's exactly a long term solution to our economic woes.</comment>

<comment>War for USA was 1941 to 1945. Korea and Vietnam were blips on the economy.</comment>

<comment>Tying off arteries on the stump of a sudden and unexpected amputation recipient WILL INDEED result in a smaller, less powerful human being.  However, FAILING to stop the hemorrhaging will result in a DEAD human being.</comment>

<comment>"A lot of people are asking for that. A lot of people. And when they see the details of my proposals they're going to love them. Love them. They are such terrific proposals you won't believe. How does that song go - 'Anything you want, I got it, baby.' I hear a lot of people complaining about cancer. We spend all this money and ... there's still cancer! I am going to be so tough on cancer ... it's a management question, how to manage these researchers so they're not just wasting time growing things in petrie dishes and saying 'Look! Something is growing!' and then they find out someone else grew it 20 years ago. I'm going to stop all that. I'm going to set strict goals - cure cancer by the end of the year or you're fired! They will cure cancer so fast, believe me. We need to stop talking about how hard life is for losers - America doesn't have time for that. We need to cure cancer, right now. So that's how I'd implement that. And then the jails. The jails right now are full! It's crazy. So we need to look at ways to solve that. Maybe have all the prisoners 'deloused'. Zyklon-B. That's not PC to say it, I know but if you're a louse maybe you need to be de-loused. Some people are saying that. They're saying it. I don't know if it's right. We gotta look at all our options."</comment>

<comment>"A third way."Heh.</comment>

<comment>The roof of the house is leaking:1 - Democrats:  Lets spend some extra money when we fix it, make it better2 - Republicans:  That's too expensive, just patch it.3 - Trumpians:  Burn down the house. Burn it now.</comment>

<comment>By exposing its bigoted underbelly?  By showing the depravity and xenophobia in the Republican party?  I suppose you could  make a pretty good argument for that.</comment>

<comment>Or making sure that the rest of the world knows that a lot of us ain't multiculturalists.</comment>

<comment>Yes, bigots, that's what I said.</comment>

<comment>Do you think Trumps rhetoric will help radicalize a new generation of terrorists?</comment>

<comment>No, but I do think you are an idiot in search of a point.</comment>

<comment>AGREE completely !   By challenging political "correctness", Trump is brining up for discussion things that the "news" media and certain political factions are either afraid to discuss or else don't want to discuss it because it is part of their magic money machine while the rest of us get screwed.EITHER WAY, FOR ONCE, WE WIN.</comment>

<comment>Even if he loses yes we win</comment>

<comment>I guess turning over the rock and exposing the 30% of the GOP base as naked bigots *is* a service of a kind, but man, it's coming at a cost.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he is reminding us what the 1930s in Germany looked like.</comment>

<comment>Or 2015 Hungary?  And how many seats has Ms. Le Pen's group won?</comment>

<comment>WHERE WILL TRUMP STOP ??   At the Presidency of the United States, that's where.Because, in the end, simple common sense will triumph over subversion, distortion and innuendo against him.</comment>

<comment>There aren't enough of you.</comment>

<comment>Then someone else will win.  That's what "elections" are all about !I like Sanders too.  I DO NOT like Hillary.</comment>

<comment>How can people support both Sanders and Trump? Their policies are literally polar opposites.I've seen this more than a few times and it's very confusing.</comment>

<comment>Can I get odds on that bet?</comment>

<comment>Where was Cheney during Darfur? What about H W during Rwanda?What about Clinton during Rwanda?Obama during Kony2012?Oh wait, they don't care.So please, calm the heck down, you pedantic whining sniveling children</comment>

<comment>"Mexico will pay to build a wall"- TrumpI wonder if the kingdom will pay to ban all muslims.</comment>

<comment>Having followed the Donald for many years (I grew up in New York) I basically realize that he has no soul. The only thing that will derail his campaign is when someone is killed at a rally by some of his frenzied followers. They will mistake a generic brown skinned person as a Muslim and will kill him. Maybe then his luster will fade. Sad to say this but I really do think it will happen soon.</comment>

<comment>He may have a soul - or not.What he does have is a MASSIVE - HUGE - SUPERSIZED  - - - -  no, no, no, (sorry about that)   !!!!  Trump Sized  !!!!! (damn I wish I could figure out how to enbiggen the font size here)ego.</comment>

<comment>Trump is an entertainer. He loves the roar of the crowd. </comment>

<comment>indeed,BTW, thanks for the heads up on the font adjustment, unfortunately it didn't seem to take with the comment.</comment>

<comment>He's finally jumped the shark with his very own Herman Cain moment.  What is there to say?Proverbs 26:4</comment>

<comment>I like verse 11 better. As a dog returns to its vomit, so fools repeat their folly.</comment>

<comment>I thought you just made that up.  But it's really in there!</comment>

<comment>Yuh. Lots if cool stuff in there, even if it's all a big fairy tail. Look for: "he bites the dust."But far and away, the book with the most satisfying surprises is Ecclesiastes. This book, which was never religious until some later scribe added a religious preamble and postscript, is full of the most beautiful and musical poetry. King James only, of course...</comment>

<comment>I love how Trump passes himself off as a expert, but when pressed for details, his standard response is, " i have that information, i will get it to you." </comment>

<comment>What details do you want? He said: When we figure out radical Islam, we'll unfreeze it.</comment>

<comment>And he also said it will end when he has a good feeling about it. That's something to hang your hat on.</comment>

<comment>Yep. I think so. Problem?</comment>

<comment>Please get all your friends to get out in the primaries and nominate this fool.</comment>

<comment>He will be. Don't you worry. He's suggesting wildly popular policies.</comment>

<comment>And he will get his ass handed to him in the general.  "Wildly popular" lolololol</comment>

<comment>Turns out that Ben is a parody account.</comment>

<comment>You like empty talk that appeals to your bigotry. I am not surprised.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump wasn't the first Republican Presidential candidate to play the anti-Muslim card this election season. That honor went to Ben Carson. But the Paris attacks were like a gift for Trump. He could seize the Muslim issue and wrestle it away from Carson. As for the other Republicans, they can condemn him all they want. But it just shows how out of touch they are with the Republican base. People like Jeb Bush either can't see or don't want to admit it. The base of their party consists of a bunch of angry white men who hate Muslims, minorities, women, gays, and the poor. Trump did what none of the other candidates were willing to do. Appeal to the hatemongers who make up the core of the Republican party. Rand Paul can be the libertarian candidate, Mike Huckleberry can be the evangelical candidate, Marco Rubio can be the neocon candidate, but what was missing up until Trump came along was the "I hate anyone who isn't white and Christian" candidate. Trump saw an opening and took it. His slogan should be "Make America Hate Again".</comment>

<comment>Where was Cheney during Darfur? What about H W during Rwanda?What about Clinton during Rwanda?Obama during Kony2012?Oh wait, they don't care.But please tell me more about how much the Establishment cares about brown people!</comment>

<comment>I just watched a CNN interviewer go nearly hysterical in attacking Trump during the interview.  The CNN interviewer is supposed to be objective but instead was argumentative, at one point stating "Banning the Moslem religion" ??   except that is NOT what Trump was proposing.Also, the balance was something like 10 or 12 people attacking Trump and 1 brief interview of a woman who supports them.I ask you,  agree or disagree with Trump, IS THIS THE WAY WE WANT OUR "NEWS" ??</comment>

<comment>Except that kind of is what he is proposing. </comment>

<comment>He's only getting stronger.</comment>

<comment>Nope, not at all.</comment>

<comment>Yep. Even stronger.</comment>

<comment>More bigoted for sure, i am not surprised an Andrew Anglin acolyte considers that strength.</comment>

<comment>You're literally the only person who knows who that is.</comment>

<comment>You repeated what he said verbatim </comment>

<comment>Again, no one knows who that is.</comment>

<comment>Apparently you do</comment>

<comment>Well I don't, and I don't want to know !</comment>

<comment>Agree.</comment>

<comment>"He's only getting stronger..."...inside the bubble.</comment>

<comment>Americans simply need to adjust Trump's unvarnished, un-PC remark to make it more PC.Turn off the spigot from problem countries like Pakistan. There. Simple.</comment>

<comment>"un-PC" apparently means preaching fascism now</comment>

<comment>IOW we will have to hold his hand while he tries to be president. Pass.</comment>

<comment>We know you pass. You are a Hillary/Goldman Sachs-bot.</comment>

<comment>Where's Rience Priebus??? Why hasn't the Republican Party already condemned Trump and/or kicked him out of the party?  Are they that desperate to have a Republican candidate be ANY Republican - even one who is a bigot & a racist???</comment>

<comment>Yep.</comment>

<comment>Rience? You mean that faggoott that is trying to make Donald Pledge loyalty? Probably sucking up to Mexifornians.</comment>

<comment>Are you a homophobe Ben?</comment>

<comment>Nah, I just think that Rience is a faggott</comment>

<comment>The dems were desperate enough to draft a community organizer 8 years ago. And look what a mess he has created.</comment>

<comment>The question is not where will Trump stop it is when will the GOP stop following him?What is the bottom of that deep well of hatred? This isn't a Trump problem, it's a problem with a large portion of the Republican base. Trump is just the figurehead.</comment>

<comment>You are pointing in the right direction.  It was during the Clinton administration when the GOP adopted a policy of attracting fringe lunatics.  The idea was that their agenda was closer to the lunatics than the Democratic agenda, and that the new recruits, as mere lunatics after all, could be kept in line.But the GOP seriously underestimated the power of the lunatics.  Sure, the policy worked, and coopting the lunatic vote allowed the GOP to seize first the House, then the Senate.  But now it can't govern.  The loonies keep doing things like shutting down the government, and now all the GOP can do is engage "symbolic" legislation that it knows full well will be vetoed.And now Trump.Lasting damage to the GOP brand.  And ultimately that's bad for the country, whether you are conservative or liberal.</comment>

<comment>Trump, Bachmann, Palin -- it appears to be a widespread gene pool....It scares me that he isn't being taken seriously.</comment>

<comment>McCain giving Palin the nod was certainly a key event in the rise of the Loonocracy.  I think even John would express regret over that decision in an unguarded moment among confidantes.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is. I hate what it's doing to the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Except it's just a slice of the likely republican voters, the rest are split between the dozen less fringe candidates, they'll eventually coalesce around a single respectable candidate once the rest start dropping out. The far-left Democrat voters are crazy about a self-described socialist, a very extreme position, that also confirms to moderates their fears about what their side is "really all about."</comment>

<comment>Trump and Carson together hold about 45% of the GOP vote. If that was a slice of pizza you wouldn't be able to fold it.That's no slice.</comment>

<comment>I keep hearing this and it keeps not happening. It still might, but I'd be less certain at this point if I were you </comment>

<comment>The cellar-dweller candidates usually don't start dropping like flies until after the first primary or two.</comment>

<comment>Please tell me one thing Bernie Sanders has proposed thats as extreme as Trump</comment>

<comment>He hasn't really checked out what Bernie says.It's hard for some to get past the label.(That's what labels are for, to stop critical thought and jump directly to a judgement.)</comment>

<comment>He's a literal communist and communism is probably the worst non-religious ideology in existence.</comment>

<comment>That's not a thing he said but a broad overview of what you perceive his views to be</comment>

<comment>Bernie is not anywhere close to the same league as Trump, and this really isn't a policy proposal, but it is Trump-level hyperbole:"With all due respect to the secretary, Wall Street play by the rules? Who are we kidding? The business model of Wall Street is fraud. That's what it is,".  --Bernie Sanders.  And he's said it many many times.  I respect Bernie, but he loses me with ridiculous statements like that.</comment>

<comment>He is supposedly self funding his campaign. His plan is to file BK and not pay any of his creditors, after he loses. If i were providing him any services for his campaign, I would demand cash upfront.</comment>

<comment>He's getting free media, if you look at what the Rs are spending, Trump is at the bottom of the list</comment>

<comment>Go ahead Trump supporters, do you best to elect him and if you are successful, only one question will remain in your mind...WHEN will they come for me and my family?</comment>

<comment>Yea, I'm not a terrorist, bro. So I'm safe. That you're worried is telling though</comment>

<comment>Bet you're not a minority, either, bro...</comment>

<comment>The GOP is a complete farce.</comment>

<comment>Except for Trump.THAT'S WHY HE'S WINNING.</comment>

<comment>Actually, he's "winning" because he's the most farcical of all. I mean, this is kind of obvious.I really hope he drags the rest of the party off the cliff with him. Also, it's good to know that the most vile and prejudiced members of the electorate are willing to stand up and readily identify themselves as such - it'll make sending them to those FEMA camps a whole lot easier!</comment>

<comment>Just in your mind</comment>

<comment>He's not winning.  Do the math:  He has 30% of the Republican vote. This will not increase. 10% are undecided and the remaining 60% want other candidates.  As the other candidates, which are alike in that they all oppose Trump, dwindle to one, that remaining candidate will take 50% or more of the Republican vote, and Trump will still be stuck with his fixed base of 30%.  He'll be done and his base will go home and watch the election while getting drunk on a case of Coors Lite.</comment>

<comment>So he's going to grab Charlie Sheen for his VP?T&C, the WINNING team?</comment>

<comment>No the media is for getting suckers like you to watch their programs and comment on sites like this one.</comment>

<comment>A sure sign that Trump is on the right track in the Republican party:Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, famed math "wizard" who supported "trickle down" and "austerity" as economic essentials, spoke out against him.</comment>

<comment>Donald is the Saviour. So proud. Big beautiful wall.</comment>

<comment>Andrew Anglin's words</comment>

<comment>Beautiful wall? No, Those are trump's. Cuck</comment>

<comment>"Donald the savior" Anglin's words</comment>

<comment>Who?</comment>

<comment>Dont be coy, be proud.</comment>

<comment>Ben, you're a parody account who doesn't believe what he's saying.  My question to you:  why?  Why are you spending your time saying these idiotic things that you don't even believe?Do you just like pretending to disagree with people in this character?  Or do you just think that what the internet was lacking was this kind of over-the-top caricature of a right-wing bigot?Because I'm here to tell you--you don't need to do it.  Plenty of real Trump supporters are carrying that water for you, and you can power down.</comment>

<comment>I absolutely believe it. He's going to make America great again. I'm sorry you hate this country.</comment>

<comment>Nope, you tipped your hand, and you can't take it back.  But please answer my question:  why are you pretending?  What do you get out of this act?</comment>

<comment>Not pretending at all. He's absolutely the right choice for this country</comment>

<comment>The media needs to stop covering him, that would shut him up pretty darn fast.</comment>

<comment>Why would they? He means viewers for their stations , readers and clicks  to their websites and for the atlantic it puts money in their pockets for increaded ad revenue rates. Did you really think The Atlantic was doing this for anything except money??</comment>

<comment>I'd like Trump to move into full-blown performance art for a few weeks. Or at least get out from behind the podium: a stool, a white spot, dressed in a white three-piece suit and straw hat, taking pulls on a bottle of Jack Daniels, home-spun epithets, a balding vested piano man stage left, tinkling Stephen Foster. Then the piano man cuts into his version of Lennon's "Imagine," and Trump pulls out a Glock and blasts the guy. Realistic use of fake blood. Boffo!Suddenly a dozen fictional characters form a chorus line behind the candidate: Travis Bickle, Beetlejuice, Oscar the Grouch et al. Watch them kick to Queen's "Another One Bites The Dust."Trump on the stump needs a mosh pit, definitely.</comment>

<comment>Awesome</comment>

<comment>Oh man.....that is amazing! And it would make the cable news talking heads explode.</comment>

<comment>If the media would stop slathering over him, maybe he'd go away. Americans are known as being more of a forward-thinking folk, without the strongest memories, but if you'll go back just a few years, you'll recall Bachman and Cain were the two unelectables getting the most coverage and polling the highest at first. Voters in both parties like to flirt with the more extreme candidates before the actual primaries where they vote more sanely. Dems are doing the same thing with Sanders right now; he's also an older New York who pronounces "huge" as "yuge", has lots of ambitious promises with next to no command of specifics on how to achieve them. Their parties eat it up as first, perhaps as a way to "send a message" to the establishment, but then they vote with their heads, not their hard-ons.So you can spare us the sideshow, its going to be Clinton vs. a respectable Republican (smart money's on Rubio,) Trump's just playing to media to sell more books after the campaign, just like Cain.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>Trump doesn't need the money. He's seriously trying to win, and he's got the best shot.</comment>

<comment>No. He's seriously helping Hillary win and his dumb GOP followers are helping her too.</comment>

<comment>Not at all. He's trying to and winning</comment>

<comment>Keep on thinking that. He's laughing at people like you every day.</comment>

<comment>He'll file BK, once he loses.</comment>

<comment>Guys... he's hardly spent anything (mainly living off the free press he gets).  It's just another one of the ways he's broken all the "rules" this campaign and gotten away with it.  After the election he'll go on the speaking tour and end up making money on this fiasco. I suspect that was the original plan and he's as surprised as anyone that he's done this well.</comment>

<comment>Why should Trump waste money on media when he knows how to get it for free?Anybody who thinks his supporters won't vote for him is indulging in some serious wishful thinking.</comment>

<comment>Rubio's a nutjob who makes Cheney look like a pacifist. It'll be WW3 if he gets elected.</comment>

<comment>I may well regret asking but what's the basis for your conclusion?</comment>

<comment>He pretty clearly is willing to start a war with Russia. He wants to admit Georgia and Ukraine into NATO. http://hotair.com/archives/201...http://www.politico.com/magazi...He advocates no-fly zones over Syria and supported Turkey shooting down the Russian plane.Then he wants to attack Iran and send ground troops into Syria. The dude is a super-hawk.</comment>

<comment>Citizen Soldier, by Stephen Ambrose, documents the difference between those TALKING UP THE FIGHT, and how those same individuals fought (or froze) on the battlefield.Trump is not a "man of his word".But you knew that.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the clarification and solid links. It's a lot more enlightening then "he's a nutjob who'll start WWIII". Not sure I completely agree but they are valid concerns.  Thanks again for the additional info and taking the time to post.</comment>

<comment>But-but - - - RATINGS.You think this is BIG?  Wait until the next season of The Apprentice.</comment>

<comment>Here's some help for our "intelligence" agencies wasting BILLIONS on mass surveillance.   Go to the gun ranges and INVESTIGATE foreigners practicing there or people who have been recently to Saudi Arabia.   Not arrest, not harass.... just investigate, YOU MORONS.</comment>

<comment>As if gun ranges would welcome the feds. We'd see a Bundy ranch style standoff.</comment>

<comment>your opinion and bigoted statement is obviously incorrect or these "nuts" as you try to describe them would have burned up the phone lines the minute a burqa wearing women started target practice.</comment>

<comment>Here, oversimplified, will be our options in 2016:Option 1: endless wars in the Middle East that are bankrupting the US, fewer and fewer civil liberties for all Americans, open borders that disproportionately hurt low-income Americans and don't screen terrorists. That's our current trajectory thanks to the Clinton-Bush-Obama-Rubio policy consensusOption 2: reducing our interventions in the Middle East, halting all immigration for a period of time, and preserving more civil liberties, at the cost of singling out Muslims. That's your Trump-Cruz alternative.Neither one's ideal, but Option 2 merely makes me uncomfortable, while Option 1 is completely disastrous.</comment>

<comment>preserving more civil liberties, at the cost of singling out MuslimsCan't make an omelette without doing away with some folk's liberties, right?</comment>

<comment>Tyler, I'm not saying either of these are the only conceivable options, just that they're the ones we will get presented with this election cycle.</comment>

<comment>It's nonsense.  "Open borders?"  C'mon...no serious person with a brain in their head says things like that.  It's a stupid buzzword devoid of reality.And to pretend that Trump is *not* in favor of war in the Middle East is quite rich.</comment>

<comment>Trump opposed the Iraq invasion and currently wants to leave Syria to Putin and Assad. He's not Ron Paul, but it's definitely less interventionist than Hillary/Bush/Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Trump "opposed" the Iraq invasion after the fact, and he thinks he'll be able to force other nations to cede by force of his will and the threat of military force.  Look at his rhetoric on ISIS and tell me that he's not in favor of war in the Middle East.  He wants to murder people's families, for god's sake.</comment>

<comment>His first recorded comments on the war were in 2004, when it was still fairly popular. Hillary was still defending her vote at the time.We already kill terrorist families all the time with drone strikes. Trump's just saying it more crassly than DC bureaucrats do. Heck, we even attack suspected terrorists' FUNERALS in the belief that it will kill more terrorists. I'm against all those practices, personally, but on that front he's no different from Hillary or Obama.</comment>

<comment>His first recorded comments on the war were in 2004, when it was still fairly popular.This article breaks down pretty clearly how full of baloney he is on this rewriting of history:  https://www.washingtonpost.com...We already kill terrorist families all the time with drone strikes.Which is a bad thing.  And Trump wants to make that the *goal*, not just a byproduct.  He's not talking about accepting collateral damage, he's talking about intentionally killing family members.</comment>

<comment>Agreed that it's a bad thing, but we do it intentionally now too. If you know there are children in the building with a terrorist and blow it up anyway, you intended to kill them. There aren't any politicians who stand against it, except for types like Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul.The article you posted about Trump just says he was exaggerating with claims that he called the White House. His opposition to the war is confirmed by that article.</comment>

<comment>http://deadline.com/2015/06/do...Read what Trump said on O'ReillyHe directly says he'd bomb ISIS' oil then "go in" and encircle them.  Sounds a heck of alot like a new MidEast war to me!</comment>

<comment>Peter, I get what you're saying, but I'd argue that he's basically proposing a shift in tactics. I have no idea how it would work to only occupy oil fields though, so it's not clear to me if he's just blowing hot air on that.</comment>

<comment>All his policy is hot air.  He's so vague you can read whatever you want into his statements because they shift wildly from one extreme to the otherPainting his as some extreme isolationist simply doesn't fit what about half the stuff he's said.</comment>

<comment>No, his "opposition" to the war is fabricated post-hoc.  He started to criticize the way the war was being handled a hear and a half after the invasion, and now tells people he was against it from the beginning.  And people like you carry his water.And you continue to misrepresent what Trump is saying.  He's not just willing to accept the deaths of innocent family members, he wants to seek them out and kill them.  If you're going to advocate for Trump, just have the courage of your convictions and do so directly without soft peddling what he's actually saying.</comment>

<comment>Maybe he was against it from the beginning. He was against it soon after, and we have no evidence he was for it from the beginning. The more reasonable conclusion is that he WAS against it at the beginning.I acknowledge that he said he'd like to kill terrorists' family members. My point is that while RHETORICALLY this may differ from the CIA's position, that distinction has no practical difference. Complete apathy to the death of the innocent is little better from intention to kill them.</comment>

<comment>The more reasonable conclusion is that he WAS against it at the beginning.No, the more reasonable conclusion is that he's lying about it, given that he's claiming things that are demonstrably untrue.Complete apathy to the death of the innocent is little better from intention to kill them.Trump wants to seek out and kill innocent family members because their relative is a terrorist.  That's a difference in kind.</comment>

<comment>The article says that there's no proof of some of his specific claims about being visited by White House staffers. It doesn't provide proof that it is "demonstrably untrue." All we do know for sure is that soon after the war, he publicly opposed it when most Republicans and many Democrats were still in favor of it.</comment>

<comment>still waiting on that video of Thousands of Muslims in Jersey cheering too</comment>

<comment>Me too. I ate all my popcorn waiting too. Oh well, I'll get more.</comment>

<comment>Trump claims he was vocally opposed to the Iraq war in 2003 and it was "reported by everybody."  This is demonstrably untrue.He's a serial fabricator, and apologists like you who carry his water should really ask for a spot on the payroll.</comment>

<comment>He claimed the Bush WH silenced himWhy would they do such a thing?  There were millions of people publicly against the Iraq war.  Trump simply isn't important enough in 2003 to intimidate.  And as a known blowhard why would he do as they asked?</comment>

<comment> All we do know for sure is that soon after the war, he publicly opposed  it when most Republicans and many Democrats were still in favor of it.Actually we don't. I haven't seen any evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq invasion. Can you show us some?</comment>
