<comment>Outlaw assault weapons. Period. Americans dont need assault weapons, only killers need assault wespons. When is the last time you saw or read that a guy defended his family from multiple intruders with an assault weapon? Never.Interpret/ratify the 2nd Amendment with 21st century eyes and understanding. There are no redcoats on our streets. We are no longer a young nation of breakaway rebels breaking away from a Monarchy. Militias are not required.Everytime a mass murder is committed, the price of guns should rise substantially. It does now anyway. A mass murder occurs and the already fear filled gun clingers rush out to buy as many guns as they can get their hands on; fearful that the government will over ride their stupidity and lame excuses. Double, Triple the cost of guns. Make them much more difficult to obtain. Enough is enough.</comment>

<comment>Never mind that the mythical "assault weapon" is used in far less than 1% of gun crimes.All that matters is demagoguery and your precious "feelings."</comment>

<comment>Yes, never mind that the all-too-real "assault weapon" is used in half of all public mass shootings, and tends to kill more people per incident, including cops.Never mind that the popular AR-15 .223 round can penetrate police body armor and go through walls. Never mind reality if it contradicts your extremist ideology or gun fetishism.</comment>

<comment>Never mind that no matter how much data we put before you Left-wing fools you refuse to address the underlying problems of gun violence, which aren't the guns themselves...As stated on previous threads, MOST GUN VIOLENCE is in one or two communities, NOT MASS SHOOTINGS, get it fool?Further more, NOBODY but you idiots is falling for the dodge tactic anymore...This has nothing to do with gun violence and EVERYTHING to do with Radical Islam...Which is why our president is talking about it, while trying NOT to talk about it...</comment>

<comment>Of course the problem is not "guns themselves", since if all the 300 million guns were in a museum or locked safely in public armories, they would not likely cause harm.The problem is the gun fetishism and selfish narcissism of most on the far right who think that God gave them the right to be armed and deadly.And when only two public mass shootings in the last ten years had any connection at all to Islamic extremism, and almost all were perpetrated by right-wing Christians, your ignorance, idiocy and bigotry are duly noted.</comment>

<comment>Robert, is it just me, or are you a little obsessed with fetishism?If 100 million guns were in a museum, do you really think there wouldn't be a black market to supply 100 million more? Prohibition and the War on Drugs were so successful at stopping alcohol and narcotics, right?I can tell you're a little overwrought about guns, but do you have any solution that actually would keep them away from bad guys without inflicting your feverish do-gooderism on the rest of us?</comment>

<comment>You're clearly projecting your own obsessions, as I approach this issue, as all issues, with clear-headed objectivity.Every black market gun began as a legal sale. If we merely closed the loopholes in every existing gun-control law (loopholes deliberately placed by those who fear or receive money from the NRA), ended the NRA-influenced ban on CDC research into gun violence, properly funded the ATF and give them the tools to track crime guns and shut down illicit gun dealers - then most of the problem will be solved.All the "fever" is on the side of the gun fetishists who have no facts or reason to hang their ideological extremism on.</comment>

<comment>You may actually approach the issue with clear-headed objectivity, but what you write is not demonstrating that view.</comment>

<comment>You're only ringing true with your small circle of vehement, fascistic gun grabbers who think your Dear Leader, Comrade Obama, will repeal the 2nd amendment.</comment>

<comment>Who is your Dear Handler? Rush? Beck?</comment>

<comment>Who  is yours? Obama? Jeh? Loretta Lynch?</comment>

<comment>I dunno, I don't parrot phrases like you do. In a way it doesn't matter because you people sound about the same.</comment>

<comment>You're the conformist sack of shit here, buddy. You toe the party line and chant the progressive rituals all day long. If anyone is a "rebel" and a badass here it's people who don't conform, be they true believers like you or just sheepish fools who fear being called "racists" (these days you almost have to be called that to have any self-worth), and don't agree with the left-liberal hegemony that has been created by the '68ers and their children and now grand-children. The Overton Window shifted far left. You sorry sods created the situation where it'll shift to the right. Now you idiots get to see how people felt in the '60s when the counter-culture types, the student Marxists, and rabble-rousers were raising hell back then. You reap what you sow.</comment>

<comment>> You're the conformist sack of shit here,No, that'd be you."Dear Leader, Comrade Obama," Yeah keep typing those things just like all your authoritarian ilk do. Your projection is astounding.> and chant the progressive rituals all day longI now holding something in my left hand. If you can guess what it is, then I'll know that you somehow know what I'm doing "all day long." You people don't deal much in reality anyways, so it's kind of expected you tell me what I do when I'm not posting. protip: hyperbole makes you look like a childish moron and doesn't help in arguments.I'm curious, how many times do you type things like "Dear Leader, Comrade Obama," in a day?> "racists" (these days you almost have to be called that to have any self-worth)Sounds like a racist apology to me. Weird how you people bring that up even when it wasn't being discussed. You spend a paragraph on it; lady Heinz doth protest too much.</comment>

<comment>All I got from that is that you claim to be masturbating all day long. Sounds about on par for a swipple dildo, basic b!tch catlady.</comment>

<comment>> All I got from that is that you claim to be masturbating all dayI said what's in my hand, not your hand, well maybe a finger or two. Jackoffs like you aren't that good at predicting ... or insulting, unless you're like a nine year old, then I guess you're okay, just don't hog the school computer too much.</comment>

<comment>So you're telling me you've been masturbating since yesterday? Okay... don't see why you need to share that with us, catlady.</comment>

<comment>No, you been telling yourself, obviously. It's rather sad you blame your woes on internet strangers. Anyways, maybe a magnifying glass might help.</comment>

<comment>I see, you're going to continue to masturbate all of today too because your mangina isn't raw and bleeding enough? Put some sand in it, it'll help.</comment>

<comment>> I see, you'reAs proven, you're not seeing me at all. So whatever you type about me, it just refers to you because you can see yourself. Enjoy your sand filled mangina, and tell me more of what you're doing.</comment>

<comment>You are reusing my insults I used on you? Low IQ much?</comment>

<comment>LOL, old insults like "yours" were around for centuries. Moron, when you bring things up about people you can't even see, it's a reflection on you because you thought it up. Will you finally get that this post?</comment>

<comment>I would love to know who these "right wing Christians" are that are doing all this killing? Let's see.San Bernardino, CA 14 dead - Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, Islamic ExtremistsChattanooga, TN 5 dead - Mohammod Youssef Abdulazeez Islamic ExtremistCharleston, NC 9 dead - Dylann Roof white supremacist, no evidence of ChristianityFt Hood, TX 4 dead - Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, Islamic ExtremistNewtown, CT 27 dead - Adam Lanza, no evidence of Christianity, ample evidence of lunacy.So......where are they?</comment>

<comment>Here's a small sampling:After 1981, members the Army of God and similar groups with ties to the Christian Identity and Christian Patriot movements began attacking abortion clinics and doctors across the United StatesThe Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA), Defensive Action, and the Montana Freemen are all Christian Militia groups engaged in terrorismIn 1996, three men – Charles Barbee, Robert Berry and Jay Merelle – were charged with two bank robberies and bombings at a Planned Parenthood office in Washington State. The men were anti-Semitic Christian Identity theorists who believed that God wanted them to carry out violent attacks and that such attacks will hasten the ascendancy of the Aryan race.July 27, 1996: Centennial Olympic Park bombing, 2 dead, 111 injuries, as well as two more bombings at an abortion clinic and a lesbian nightclub in the Atlanta area, and another at an abortion clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, Eric Robert Rudolph, Christian terrorist associated with the Christian Identity movementSept. 15, 1999: Wedgwood Baptist Church shooting, 7 dead, 7 injured, Larry Gene Ashbrook had ties to the Phineas Priesthood and Christian Identity movementsJan. 8, 2011: Tuscon Gifford shooting, 6 dead, 11 injured, Jared Lee Loughner associated with Christian anti-abortion groupsAug. 5, 2012: Sikh Temple shooting, Wisconsin, 6 dead, 3 injured, Wade Michael Page, white supremacistJune 17, 2015: Charlestown AME Church, 9 dead, 1 injured, Dylan Roof identified with Nazis and KKK – both white supremacist Christian movementsNov. 29, 2015: Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood, 3 dead, 9 injured, Robert Lewis Dear, Jr., fundamentalist ChristianIn 2011, analyst Daryl Johnson of the US Department of Homeland Security said that the Hutaree Christian militia movement possessed more weapons than the combined weapons holdings of all Islamic terror defendants charged in the US since the September 11 attacks.According to a study released in June 2015 by the New America Foundation, almost twice as many people have died in attacks by right-wing groups in America as have died in attacks by Muslim extremists.</comment>

<comment>"loopholes" is a term used by those who don't even want to understand the complexities of serious social problems.  The criminal actions that "open loopholes" supposedly facitate are actually caused by the evil in men's minds.  Any access these evil minds have to weapons cannot be prevented even with "total" prohibition of gun, knives, swords or whateve scares you.</comment>

<comment>In fact, everyone except willful idiots understands what a legal loophole is and why our nation's gun laws are riddled with them - like the gun show loophole and "private" sellers who sell hundreds of guns per year.</comment>

<comment>And since you are so knowledgeable what is this gun show "loophole"? Tell me in your own words what it is exactly.</comment>

<comment>More BS based on wishful thinking.  Can you identify those private sellers?  They are a figment of your fevered imagination.</comment>

<comment>What legal loophole ?There is NO "gun show loophole"All the laws that apply elsewhere apply at gun shows.That's just another stupid propaganda lie to gull useful idiots like you.And your so-called "private sellers who sell hundreds of guns a year" are actually criminals breaking federal laws, because they are in fact dealers selling without a Federal license..You are playing word games, to push your lies.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, there is NO such thing as a "gun show loophole" that's a red herring that the left loves to vomit up.  If I sell a gun to my neighbor across the street, which I've actually done, that's a private sale that does not require any background check.  The fact is, I don't know how you would ever enforce background checks on that type of sale.  Everyone would just ignore it.</comment>

<comment>Loophole?The federal gov't has no authority over the sale of private property. Go back to civics class.As for the gun show, every dealer at the gun shows follow all laws. Private sellers can sell anywhere.Educate yourself and get back to us.</comment>

<comment>So if a mentally ill person obtains a car or any other vehicle and drives it into a crowd of people in a public setting and kills them by the 10's and 100's then we should all not be able to purchase a vehicle?  Also because we have so many overweight people in this country we should outlaw spoons and forks?  Robert that is your line of thinking; where does it end Robert?  Or do we all have to subject ourselves to what your beliefs are only?  That doesn't sound like a very "free" country to me.  It would seem from your comments that you are the ONLY person who can have an opinion and that the rest of us must live by ONLY what your opinions are; sounds a little communist to me.</comment>

<comment>You demonstrate not only an abysmal ignorance of the facts, but a complete dearth of logic and rational thought.YOU have opinions (ignorant as they are). I stand by scientific research, rationality, common sense and the good of society.</comment>

<comment>Robert calling the shit you cite as fact is almost laughable; calling your train of thought as logic and rational thought is about at ridiculous as it gets.  Calling your rants scientific research is just plain delusional.  The only ignorance I can see here belongs to you.</comment>

<comment>Then give us the facts, smartass.  So far all I've read from you is nonsense.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't have anyThat's why he spends so much time making ad homs.</comment>

<comment>Give me a list of any killings committed with a gun that came from these so called "loopholes"</comment>

<comment>Clear headed objectivity hahaha, yeah that's you alright. /sarc</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately you are are short with facts.1.  By all estimates there are in excess of 300,000,000 guns in the United States.2.  On average the dreaded "assault rifle" is used in less than 35 murders per year.   More people are killed by tools from Home Depot every year.3.  Every Black Market gun began as a legal sale.  Kinda like saying every days begins with a morning.   When prohibition was put into effect, who profited?  Criminals who simply distilled their own or smuggled in alcohol.  Ban guns you drive up value - don't you think guns would be moved in from south of the border to meet that need?  We can't stop the flow of drugs, what makes you believe you can stop guns?4.  It's not really research if you have predetermined the focus and outcome.  Notice it "gun violence" not violence? Why?  Even you have predetermined violence is the result of guns.5. Look at violence in the US.  10 cities comprise 20% of the murders but barely 6% of the population.  20 cities comprise 30% and 10% of the people.  Those rates are 5x the rest of the nation.  Take Chicago - many areas of Chicago are very safe.  Murders are generally isolated to 5 distinct neighborhoods - West Garfield for example (110 murders/100,000).6.  Research by Yale Professor Dr. Papachristos has show even in those neighborhoods you can trace murders to a small social circle not guns.7.  By many accounts several more infamous shooters had a history of mental problems but nobody took the necessary steps to complete the due process to find them mentally unfit - Holmes and the Navy Yard Shooter.  Cho (Virginia Tech) was found mentally unfit in a court -but his records were never sent correctly to NICS.  Cho used handguns and the Navy Shipyard shooter used a shotgun.</comment>

<comment>Drugs like heroin and coke are both illegal and mostly manufactured/grown in other countries.</comment>

<comment>And gun violence is very much fuelled by the drug war which is something people on neither side tend to acknowledge.</comment>

<comment>Pro-gun cites it a lot in my experience. Problem is you get too many SoCons seeing the problem but denying the solution of legalization because they find drugs "icky."</comment>

<comment>You toss around words  as if you know what they mean. You make arguments based on  wishful thinking.  How many AKs are there in the world, smuggled across borders? The NRA   had not much to do with the CDC being defunded from its' antigun studies. It was because of their antigun academic dishonesty.</comment>

<comment>The Clinton Assault Weapons ban according to the FBI Crime Statistics Department stated that after the ban was lifted didn't reduce gun crime one little bit.  Gun violence in this nation even with recent so called "mass killings" is down over previous years; at the same time gun ownership has gone up.  An armed society is a polite society...the saying is proving true as more Americans are purchasing more guns.  Those are the facts Robert.  You don't like guns...then simply don't buy them...no one is forcing you to buy them.  Stop telling the rest of us that we don't have a right to our Constitutional Rights.</comment>

<comment>You are determined to demonstrate the typical ignorance of gun apologists, as nothing you claim is true, and you parrot NRA talking points like any of its idiot acolytes.The 1994 federal assault weapons ban, in spite of being riddled with loopholes, resulted in a marked decrease in the use of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines in crime."Following implementation of the ban, the share of gun crimes involving AWs declined by 17% to 72% across the localities examined for this study (Baltimore, Miami, Milwaukee, Boston, St. Louis, and Anchorage), based on data covering all or portions of the 1995-2003 post-ban period. This is consistent with patterns found in national data on guns recovered by police and reported to ATF." – Christopher S. Koper, “An Updated Assessment of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban: Impacts on Gun Markets and Gun Violence, 1994-2003”, Report to the National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice."During the federal assault weapons ban, the Virginia State Police saw a clear decline in the percentage of crime guns with large capacity magazines, reaching a low of 10% in 2004. After Congress failed to renew the ban, that percentage steadily climbed; by 2010, nearly 22% of crime guns in Virginia had large capacity magazines." - US Dept. of Justice and the Washington Post"When Maryland imposed a more stringent ban on assault pistols and high-capacity magazines in 1994, it led to a 55% drop in assault pistols recovered by the Baltimore Police Department." – The Maryland Ban on the Sale of Assault Pistols and High-Capacity Magazines: Estimating the Impact in Baltimore, American Journal of Public Health, Feb. 2, 1997A Justice Department study of the assault weapons ban found that it was responsible for a 6.7% decrease in total gun murders, holding all other factors equal. The same study also found that “Assault weapons are disproportionately involved in murders with multiple victims, multiple wounds per victim, and police officers as victims.” – Jeffrey A. Roth & Christopher S. Koper, “Impact Evaluation of the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994”"37% of police departments reported seeing a noticeable increase in criminals’ use of assault weapons since the 1994 federal ban expired." – Police Executive Research Forum, Guns and Crime: Breaking New Ground by Focusing on the Local Impact, May 2010A  May 2010 survey by the Police Executive Research Forum of 164 police departments serving 100,000 or more people finds that 37% have seen an increase in the use of assault weapons in street crime, and 38% report seeing an increase in the use semiautomatic firearms that accept high-capacity ammunition magazines in street crime.</comment>

<comment>LOLThe AWB was the creature of the Democrats who wanted to start a new category of firearms to banSo the came up with the definition of "assault weapon" which was a mish-mash definition based on appearance and not performance.So naturally, it was a piece of garbage legislation.And most of the research you cite has been shown to have their own "loopholes", and are primarily opinion pieces not supported by data, and diminished by the fact that the so-called" assault weapon" term is so loose and broad that even a pistol-gripped hose spray nozzle can qualify as an assault weapon.Hell in some places, even an "L"-shaped Pop-tart qualifies</comment>

<comment>Blah, blah, blah.  Dude you post all kinds of crap that you claim as statistics that are so blatantly untrue it's not funny.  You claim to be some kind of self educated "gun" expert and it's obvious you either don't know shit or you blatantly ignore the facts that don't fit your ideology.  The Law of the Land is that the 2nd Amendment guarantees the citizens of this country are able to own a gun or guns in order to defend themselves.  Regardless of your incorrect interpretation of the 2nd Amendment.  The Supreme Court disagrees with your opinion by the way and that makes my opinion the LAW OF THE LAND.  Live with it or leave the country either way no one gives a shit about your opinion or your ideology.  Maybe go publish another one of your papers full of lies to help you through the frustration you must feel with the rest of the country not giving a simple shit what you think.</comment>

<comment>Yes, you do live in a right-wing fairy tale world.</comment>

<comment>Oh dear Lord. You don't even understand that Islamic fundamentalism is conservative do you?</comment>

<comment>Oh dear lord, you don't even realize that "conservative" means something entirely different depending on where you are at.</comment>

<comment>Conservatism always means adhering to strict religious and traditional fundamentalism.  That has always been conservatism and always will be.  It's the very definition of conservatism.</comment>

<comment>So in your mind the "conservatives" in America believe the same thing as "conservatives" in the middle east hahahaha, you are either very ignorant or trolling to suggest that terrorists are "conservative" in the same way American conservatives are.</comment>

<comment>Religious fundamentalism is conservatism no matter who does it.  The Planned Parenthood gunman is a religious fundamentalist just like the San Bernadino shooters are religious fundamentalists.  Don't pretend that's too confusing for you to understand.</comment>

<comment>It's not "too confusing," it is just ignorant rhetoric. You are completely ignoring the political and social implications of words. But hey, I guess it is now progressive to rape little kids to death if you are secular. Your logic, not mine.</comment>

<comment>Okay find whatever excuses  you want to try and justify extremists you like and tell me that other extremists are the problem.</comment>

<comment>I'll leave the excuses to you.</comment>

<comment>Evidence?</comment>

<comment>The idiot who shot Gabby Giffords was a confirmed Leftist; The Colorado shooter was also a confirmed Leftist.  Most of the "mass killing" killers were confirmed leftists.  The only "conservative" killer was the guy from Sweden who shot all those people on that island.  That is the ONLY confirmed "conservative" killer that I know of.  So I would say your rhetoric is highly inaccurate.</comment>

<comment>The interesting is that the so-called Planned Parenthood gunman, did not make ANY effort to shoot anyone in PP..Yet he was there for more than 30 minutes with easy access to the people inside the PP offices..People have been way too quick to throw ignorant labels around because it fits their prejudices.</comment>

<comment>That's merely one strain.</comment>

<comment>No, conservatism at it's core is the resistance to change and tradition.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you. But the term is used so expansively today as to include people like Milton Friedman who were very much dynamists and embraced change. I too, though, would be happy to see the term being used with greater care and precision.</comment>

<comment>Resistance to change   AND  tradition? please clarify that for me.</comment>

<comment>Sorry should have reversed those to make more sense. Conservatism at its core is tradition and resistance to change. </comment>

<comment>Real conservatives are not against change..They recognize that change is a normal process over timeWhat they resist is change for the sake of change, where no clear benefit comes from change..On other words:"You want to change things..No problem..Convince that the changes you propose will be better, and not worse than what we have now.."The problem is that far too many people, enamored with their "change" forget to look at the downside and the "unintended consequences"Some of the "changers" are in actual fact, suffering from a bad case of denial, when it comes to their favorite "change"..Gun controllers are a case in point..They CONSISTENTLY try to sell ALL the imagined benefits of more gun control, but completely ignore the failures and bad outcomes of previous attempts at gun control.</comment>

<comment>Which previous attempts at gun control.  The number of gun owners in this country is at an all time low and violent crime is lower than it as been in forty years.  States with stricter gun laws have lower gun violence rates.  In what ways have gun safety laws been a failure?  Don't give me an anecdote. Don't single out one specific city.  Tell me what strategy has actually been a broad failure.</comment>

<comment>1a) The claim of gun owners at an all time low is a false one.The PERCENTAGE was an an all time low a few years back But with the increase of population, that still puts the NUMBER of gun owners higher than before.Also over the last 10 years, there has been a sea change in gun ownership1b) Over the last 10 years, people have been buying over 1M guns a month.And contrary to gun controller myth, it's NOT the same people who are buying all the guns, so that they can have more guns.That has got to be the most idiotic argument pushed by gun controllers.. I don't need 60 guns to defend myself. Even if I have a few stashed around the house.1c) There also has been a massive of people who are - taking basic intro shooting classes. So much so, that the NRA is unable to keep up with the training of new instructors.- applying for carry permits.- a reported increase of women who are arming up2)  So-called "gun safety laws" have absolutely NOTHING to do with safety.They are all about reducing access or availablity of guns for personal safety.Since you want me to demonstrate failure, I suggest that you first demonstrate success3) As to failed "safe" cities. Take your pick.Chicago, Washington DC, Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, etc..They actually INCREASED their crime and homicide rates following increased restrictions on guns.Just go back to before the 60s and then watch are their crime rates exploded. far more than the rest of the country.</comment>

<comment>1a) You are correct, I meant to say the percentage of gun owners in the American population is low, not the total number of gun owners. I don't know what that historical number is.1b) You are incorrect.  Indeed, the number of guns sold has risen while the number of gun owners is an ever shrinking part of the American public.  It is just a narrow number of households buying the vast majority of guns in this country.1c) What is the nationwide number of people applying for carry permits? You claim to know that it has increased.   I would appreciate a link to that database.2). All evidence counters your claim.  From Factcheck.org http://bit.ly/1VxHI8v"For 2013, the 10 states with the highest firearm age-adjusted death rates were: Alaska (19.8), Louisiana (19.3), Mississippi (17.8), Alabama (17.6), Arkansas (16.8), Wyoming (16.7), Montana (16.7), Oklahoma (16.5), New Mexico (15.5) and Tennessee (15.4)."Are you saying that these states have the STRICTEST or the LOOSEST gun safety laws?</comment>

<comment>Don't buy your #1b claim..The NSSF says otherwise.So does the NRA's data of the demand for instructors and what classes are being taught.The claim that the gun-owner population is shrinking is nothing but projection of a past trend with no current data to support it.http://bearingarms.com/despera...And just spend a few seconds thinking about it..What's the point of going out to buy brand new guns, just to own 10 instead of 5 ?Even a collector has no interest in buying new guns, particularly not models that are completely interchangeable with the one next to it ?If I have 2 good rifles for self-defense. One for use, one for backup. I don't need 10 more..1cThere is NO "national number for carry permits" since it's a State issue.Also, with many States going to Constitutional carry and unlicensed open carry, those numbers drop toward zero, except for people wanting reciprocity with other States2) Firearm age-adjusted death is meaningless is you throw everything into the same pot..There are MAJOR differences between - suicide- criminal homicide- justifiable homicide- accidentsYour data makes NO separation.And when suicides represent 60% of the aggragate nationally, there are major diffeences of suicide rates among States.Again sloppy data for sloppy conclusions.And, I will point out that such aggregation is a common practice from gun controllers to inflate numbers.</comment>

<comment>You are certainly correct that there's no logical or justifiable reason to own a lot of guns but the numbers and rhetoric indicate that this is exactly what many gun owners want and want to safeguard.I'm not "claiming" gun owner households are shrinking. It's the data supported by the Census. It's not an opinion, its not an interpretation. Sometimes a fact is just a fact. http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/31/...You are exactly right that there's no national number if permits, which is why it was ridiculous for you to claim that number has increased. And I'm not sure why such a fact, if it were true, would matter.You again are correct. The numbers I gave were for all firearm deaths. But you are incorrect that there's a difference. Gun safety law is aimed at curbing ALL firearm deaths, not just homicides and the gun lobby fights just as hard against things like gun trigger locks and biometric safety devices as it does to make sure people on the terror watch list can get shotguns. Its all firearm related death. Nothing is exempt.</comment>

<comment>Go ahead and provide that data,AND I DO MEAN DATA,to support your claim that it's the same people who have been buying up over a million guns a month for the last 10 years..And naturally, demonstrate as well, that it's the same people who have been taking beginner's classes of basic gun handling, and inttro classe (as opposed to refresher classes) for carry permits.This says otherwisehttp://bearingarms.com/despera...Then we have carry permit holdershttp://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/pa...The problem with the silly notion that gun control will stop suicides is simpleSuicides are means independent.IN other words, take away the gun, and TOTAL suicides will remain the same as other methods are used.The silly notion that gun control will stop criminal homicides is simple:Criminals do NOT get their guns legally.And gun control has little noticeable effect on the black market (gee what a surprise)Just look at how Prohibition and the "war on drugs" worked to reduce aclohol and drug use respectively.In fact both created the opposite effectBootlegging and bathtub gin for Prohibition, and increased potency of Marijuana, and a whole slew of other drugs, not to mention the evolution of meth production..Both Prohibition and the "war on drugs" proved total DISASTERS and FAILURES. And the after-effects of both was the creating of a very wealthy and powerful criminal class.And look at both the UK and Australia, and any other country like Mexico, Jamaica and Bermuda, to see how gun control fails and empowers the criminals.Then you also completely fail to look at the other side of the coin.The current benefits of armed citizenry.Funny how those arguing gun control keep ignorant that 800 pound gorilla.</comment>

<comment>Actually that's NOT factual. Suicide is extremely means specific. Ask anyone (besides myself) who have worked with suicidal people. Suicide plans are alnost never generalized. The means is extremely specific and if the means is unavailable they don't easily switch to another. </comment>

<comment>So that's why total suicide did NOT change meaningully  in the UK following their handgun ban-confiscation  in 1997Because all those people who would have used handguns just did not commit suicide by other means ?And then there's Australiahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu...</comment>

<comment>There sure are a lot of studies out there.  I can find one from Canada that supports the position that restricting access to guns leads to fewer suicides: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu... Of course none of these actually are meaningful.  The gun safety laws discussed didn't reduce the amount of firearms already in existence.  That would only happen after forty-fifty years at the earliest.Is Australia, the country that saw a huge drop in the homicide rate after it enforced a successful government program of gun safety measures, the country you want to make the comparison for America? We can go down that road if you want because once again, it really just helps me when we stick to the facts.</comment>

<comment>You might want to chart that alleged "huge drop in homicide rate" across 10+ years backwardsThe trend was already there before 1997And the change post 1997, was not statistically meaningul, because it didn't change much from the downward trend already happening before 1997..First you need to realize that what you are spouting are only partial facts.Which is why you are induced in error.</comment>

<comment>Typical "low information" leftist bullshit.  You're an obvious troll.  You misquote and misrepresent every fact put before you in order to bend it to your ridiculous radical ideology.  Not a very effective way to influence people your line of thinking is the "correct" one.</comment>

<comment>Collection of nonsense1) It's no one's business how many guns are owned.Just like it's no one's business if any one has a collection of pen-knives, pressure cookers, cars or any other widgets.2) Data coming in from the FBI, the NSSF and the NRA are showing that there is a major sea change in gun ownership happening.The NSSF is reporting booming business, and it's not the same people buying the guns. Apparently there's an 50% increase in female buyers.The NRA is unable to keep up with the demand for new instructorsGun ranges, are also doing booming business, and are reporting a whole new generation of shooters3) The Pew study has a major shortcomingIt depends on telephone surveys. Such surveys are restricted to land-lines. No cell phones are allowed.And that is a major restriction of who is part of the sample group..There is also growing mistrust of making personal data available. Particularly data that could be used by the government. Thus people are less apt to tell a stranger whether they have guns or not.4) States are reporting an huge increase in carry permitsAnd this in the face of many States removing the need for in-state carry, and 6 States joinning Vermont in Constitutional Carry.5) The very notion that: "Gun safety law is aimed at curbing ALL firearm deaths"is total nonsense. Propaganda for useful idiots.Anyone who expects a criminal who is in illegal possession of a gun to follow "gun safety mandates" is suffering some serious delusionsThey are criminals because they ignore the law.So "gun safety laws" will have NO EFECT on criminals who ignore the law.</comment>

<comment>One other common denominator with regard to the "violent" cities like Chicago, D.C., Baltimore, New Orleans, and Detroit....they've all been run by ONLY Leftist leaders for over 20 years.</comment>

<comment>Came across thishttp://www.businessinsider.com...And yes, the US cities on the list are ALL Demoncrat strongholds with strict gun control..</comment>

<comment>Obviously what they're doing isn't working on the city level so why should it work on the national level?  Repeating the same screwed up ideology on a larger scale would just be an example of idiocy!</comment>

<comment>Wrong!  Gun ownership is way up; gun ownership is up over 200% since Obama took Office.  Since that time crime rates have gone down to the inverse increase in gun ownership.  Those are based on FBI statistics.  Look it up instead of puking out made up and inaccurate statements.</comment>

<comment>I disagree with that, anyway.</comment>

<comment>You realize you just declared free market capitalists, supporters of small government and all other conservatives in the US outside a small fraction of the extreme religious right not "conservative?"</comment>

<comment>Which representative would you like to point to that represents those conservative ideas? Is there one single member if Congress that has been elected by the people you are talking about?  Of course not. We don't see it represented because its a phantom constituency. </comment>

<comment>So the Paul's, Cruz, Paul Ryan and Scott Walker don't exist?</comment>

<comment>Is this who you are citing as an example of Republicans who are NOT a part of the religious right?</comment>

<comment>With the definition you have absolutely not.</comment>

<comment>So why do you fellate them so hard and try to get them into the US?</comment>

<comment>I never heard that before.</comment>

<comment>Hmm go figure a leftist that is violent and thinks the rules don't apply to them and if you disagree with them they attack you personally because they can't support their own point of view with REAL facts....just like Robert Uni Bomber Birdsong.</comment>

<comment>How did your gun banning laws work in Paris during that massacre, clown?The only thing stopping a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun regardless if they have a badge or not.</comment>

<comment>The clown here is the one whose mental gymnastics don't rise beyond parroting of moronic NRA bumper sticker slogans.In the three mass shootings in which a legally armed bystander tried to intervene (2005 shopping mall shooting in Tacoma, Washington, 2005 courthouse shooting in Tyler, Texas, and 2014 WalMart shooting in Las Vegas) all the interveners were shot. In the courthouse case, the attempted hero was a firearms instructor. He and the WalMart defender died, while the other man survived after a long coma.But in seven mass shootings, unarmed bystanders as old as 74 successfully stopped the rampage (1985 Springfield PA shopping mall shootings, 1993 Long Island Railroad shootings, 1995 City of Industry CA postal shootings, 1998 Springfield OR Thurston High School shootings, 2011 Tucson AZ Giffords shootings, 2012 Washington DC Family Research Council shootings, and 2014 Seattle Pacific University shooting).Ironically, in the Tucson incident, licensed-to-carry gun owner Joe Zamudio almost shot one of the unarmed heroes, mistaking him for the shooter. “I was really lucky,” Zamudio said later in an interview with Fox and Friends. “I could have easily done the wrong thing and hurt a lot of people.”In at least four mass shootings, unarmed civilians were able to subdue the perpetrator when they were trying to change magazines: the 1998 Springfield OR Thurston High School shooting, the 1993 Long Island Railroad shooting, the 2011 Tucson AZ Gabriel Giffords shooting, and the 2014 Seattle Pacific University shooting.There is also evidence that potential victims were able to hide or escape when rampaging shooters were changing magazines, including at Columbine High School (1999), Northern Illinois University (2008), and Sandy Hook Elementary School (2012).On August 21, 2015, five unarmed men disarmed, subdued and tied up an Islamic terrorist on a crowded train en route from Paris to Amsterdam. The shirtless gunman carried an AK47, a pistol, a boxcutter and 300 rounds of ammunition. Before he could get a round fired, a 51-year-old Virginian wrestled the long gun from the man only to be shot in the back by the pistol and have the AK taken back by the shooter. In the next car, three young men – an off-duty US Airman, a National Guardsman on vacation after his deployment in Afghanistan, and a college buddy – tackled the gunman as he was trying to cock his weapon (which may have jammed). A French national and a Briton then joined in restraining the gunman. The Airman was cut in the neck and had his thumb nearly severed but stopped the arterial bleeding of another passenger who was cut in the neck. The five heroes were knighted by the French President.</comment>

<comment>The only mental gymnastics is by a lying lib loon like you.Stopped the mass shooters after how many were killed?  And AFTER clips were emptied you dumb loon.And on the Paris train, the men who subdued the Muslim were unarmed because they were prohibited from carrying and were able to do it when his gun jammed.So your solution is to sit there like sitting ducks until the killers empty their clip or hope their gun jams.You're a pathetic m0r0n.</comment>

<comment>Thank you yet again for demonstrating that you have nothing to contribute to the world but hateful idiocy.</comment>

<comment>A left wing loon can't peddle his cut-and-paste propaganda and claims he contributed something?Get lost, loon.</comment>

<comment>Coming from the local Bigot Bittersong , your hypocricy is just too thick haha.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha, says you, you hate-filled fascistic bigot.</comment>

<comment>The only idiot I can see here is you Robert.  Stop doing drugs and just stop your bullshit lies and statements because you aren't convincing anyone on here that your point of view is valid.  You're a seriously mentally impaired individual.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for continuing to prove that gun apologists are incapable of rational argument.</comment>

<comment>I could make a thousand rational arguments, but you're incapable of understanding them with your willful blindness to reality and fact.  Like I said quit doing shrooms and dope and maybe some of the things people are saying here might start to sink into that thick head of yours.</comment>

<comment>Still looking for your definition of the gun show loophole</comment>

<comment>Washington Post gave VP Biden the Pinochio award for saying that criminals get their guns from Gun Shows.Duke University and the University of Chicago found that Chicago criminals obtained their firearms almost exclusively from friends and family.The survey, funded by the Joyce Foundation and set to be published in the October edition of Preventive Medicine, consisted of interviews with 99 inmates at Chicago’s Cook County Jail who had illegally possessed a gun within six months of their incarceration. It found that most criminals only acquired guns from people they knew and trusted.More succinctly criminals get their guns from "Baby Mammas", Aunties and Cousins who have clean criminal records. When Mr Gangbanger needs a pistol he just sends his own personal straw buyer to the pawn shop to get him a "gat".</comment>

<comment>OMG Robert you are simply delusional.  I knew a kid at Columbine and that is nothing like what happened.  I would also challenge your bullshit line of thinking by taking you back to Sandy Hook.  Just drop the idea of forcing your delusional opinions on the rest of the country and move to a country that has stricter gun laws.Also seek some mental therapy while you're at it; your an obvious LOON!</comment>

<comment>Now you degenerate yet further into the kind of mindless imbecile that is typical of gun apologists.I have read every book on US school shootings, studied every report on them, and published tens of thousands of words on the subject.The only thing that is obvious is that you prefer willful ignorance and wanton idiocy to reality.</comment>

<comment>Robert I don't care how many pamphlets or books you read published by gun control advocates it doesn't make your opinion valid.  For starters I've dealt with school security for almost 15 years and I can tell you that you don't know shit about the topic.  I also have first hand knowledge of what happened at Columbine and there's not one damn law you or your gun control freak cabal could pass that would stop a single mass shooting incident in this country.  I also am not a gun apologist, I'm a gun owner.  I have been using guns for more than 30 years safely and responsibly without any unsafe or unintentional incidents.  Your obviously someone who is in desperate need of therapy....please seek it out.</comment>

<comment>Or we could take the guns away from everyone and not have to worry about it.  Worked extremely well everywhere else that'sdone it.</comment>

<comment>That is a myth using fuzzy math.</comment>

<comment>Or all the gun control freaks can back off before we beat your ass in a civil war.</comment>

<comment>A personal threat (possibly lethal) as well as open sedition?  You might want to tone it down.</comment>

<comment>Art the only one abdicating sedition are you gun control freaks.  The 2nd Amendment IS the LAW OF THE LAND!  Get used to it or simply GET OUT of the country...it's a pretty simple choice for you leftist people.</comment>

<comment>You people are the ones threatening our freedoms and God given rights. You are no better then the terrorists trying to destroy America.</comment>

<comment>So you want a complete universal gun ban? Aren't gun control proponents telling us that people who fear that are right-wing lunatics? Yet you're calling for just that?</comment>

<comment>Yes?  I'm not sure I see your point.  No one said it wouldn't be messy at first, but it will be good to finally root out the people who are the problem (like the otherwise completely normal couple who shot 30+ people last week).  Are you opposed to climate change initiatives as well?  You'd do well as an elected politician: if it doesn't benefit you directly in the next 2-4 years, forget it!</comment>

<comment>There a lot of issues here. A lot of gun control proponents say 'Oh my god you crazies think we want to take all your guns. We're just talking about semi-automatics and background checks and things like that' and then other gun control proponents speak of a universal ban more or less. So you advocate a universal ban? Of all guns? It's just difficult to respond to your argument without knowing what exactly you have in mind.And I despise politicians and their short-term thinking. Climate change is a complex question but I would say that I am sympathetic to a carbon tax.</comment>

<comment>The "oh, how can you think we want to get rid of all guns" crowd has always sounded duplicitous.  What sort of dolts would act to take away paper bags and soda pop but leave guns on the street?</comment>

<comment>Wrong.  Crime rates in Australia and Britain went way up after gun control laws were put in place.  I'd also direct you to crime statistics collected by the FBI which show that crime rates in Detroit, Chicago, D.C., Baltimore, etc. have gone up and are higher than other cities that do not adopt illegal gun control laws upon its citizens.</comment>

<comment>Then you had better go look at the real data from those places..Following the 1997 handgun ban confiscation in the UK, the Home Office has now admitted that there are more handguns now in the UK than they confiscated.Following the 1997 firearm ban confiscation in Australia, the government has since conceded that there are more firearms in private hands now, than they confiscated.Prohibitions don't workAlcohol prohibition did not work in the USThe War on Drugs did not work in the USAny and all Prohibitions on Guns did not work anywhere in the world. See places like Jamaica, Bermuda, the UK, Australian, Mexico, for abject failures.</comment>

<comment>Well, France has about three gun related deaths per 100k citizens and the US has about ten per 100k. I'd say their laws are a little more than three times better than ours. </comment>

<comment>If you're going to make that kind of a causal claim, then you had better be ready to demonstrate causality between gun control laws and homicide rates..Just to clue you in..I KNOW that you can NOT demonstrate causality..</comment>

<comment>Funny, I was replying to a claim that the gun laws didn't make anyone safer. You seemed to have no issue with that claim that can't be causally explained, did you?  </comment>

<comment>You might want to think more before you postI can easily demonstrate the complete failure of gun control to stop something line intentional homicide.All you need to do is do a list of all countries by their intentional homiicde rateAnd then compare where they stand relative to their levels of gun control..It totally destroys the myth that gun control has ANY effect on crime.Oh and by the way, Causality does NOT exist with a negative conditionONLY with a positive one..You might also want to read up on causality BEFORE you walk down that path so ignorantly.</comment>

<comment>Okay, I'll bite. France has 0.21 intentional homicides" per 1000 people and the US has 3.55 intentional homicides per 1000 people.  So I guess France's gun safety laws are 17 times more effective than America's gun safety laws.Let's be clear. There are no facts that support your side here.  Your only argument is a philosophical or emotional one in the face of opposing established facts.  I suggest you stick to that.</comment>

<comment>There you go stupid guessing again.And then you jump into claiming causality.Let me give you a simple fact..+60% of the so-called "gun homicides" are actually suicides, where someone intentionally picked up a gun to end their life.What "gun safety" rules do you think would have stopped them from using a gun they already owned, or stopped them from going out to legally buy one ?Then there are the 35.5% tthat are criminal homicides, most of which are committed using guns that were niether legally obtained, or legally possessedExplain the me  what "gun safety rules" would have stopped those criminals from getting their guns on the black market.Just like, by the way, the shooters at the Paris Massacre and Charlie Hebdo.All you are doing with your stupid correlation, is just thatCorrelation..It's on the same level as claiming that since ice cream sales and drownings increase in the summer, you could decrease drownings by limiting the sale of ice cream..Stupid correlation.So actually, there are NO facts that support your claim of causality.Too bad you don't understand simple statistical analysis and the rules that apply..</comment>

<comment>You continue to pretend that gun suicide is some phantom non-reality.  It's as much a firearm death as a mugger shooting a victim.  When you dismiss it you are dismissing all the people lost to firearm related suicide every year.You've got your stats backwards by the way.  Only about 40% of guns used in crime was illegally purchased or stolen.  http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub...  The vast majority was purchased or gifted under what is considered legal transactions (remember there is no tracking system that would prosecute gun sellers in America thanks to paranoid gun nuts thinking that the government wants to seize their firearms)Again, you have to cherry pick anecdotal evidence to try to support your position instead of actually looking at data.  The Charlie Hebdo attacks took place in a country where gun violence is low due to strict gun safety laws.  You just can't get your head around that big fat fact staring in your face can you?Your ice cream analogy is idiotic.  A better ideology would be to say that as ice cream sales increase in the summer people get fatter and develop diabetes.  Of course gun sales and safety laws are directly connected to gun violence.  You would have to be deliberately ignorant not to acknowledge that.  Or of course, your politics might just trump all logic and reasoning.</comment>

<comment>It's sad to see that you have trouble following simple concepts.1) Suicide is means independentGun control will NOT reduce TOTAL suicide rateThis was recently demonstrated in Australia following their 1997 gun ban/confiscation.TOTAL suicides did NOT decreaseSuicides by gun were replaced primarily by hanging.You want to address the problem of suicideAddress the REASONS for suicide instead of the tool used.You are a classic demonstration of putting the cart before the horse..Take your own advice and apply it to yourself.I'm done here.You don't come across as smart enough to learn.You're too busy trying to shift responsibitily to do that.</comment>

<comment>Eliminate black and hispanic offenders and the crime rate drops 75%.</comment>

<comment>He's not interested in hard facts.He's hung up on false correlations.</comment>

<comment>So let me get this straight; if you found yourself in a room with a terrorist who has the intent of shooting you and your loved ones and there was a gun available to you to defend your family and your loved ones....you wouldn't use the gun to shoot the terrorist?  Am I correct in my analysis of what you are espousing on this site?</comment>

<comment>No and I have re-read my comment above and I can't for the life of me understand how you would have read that scenario into my comment about the gun death statistics of France.</comment>

<comment>I was referring to your comment prior to that post.  But I think you might have already realized that but willfully acted ignorant, because you didn't have a good response.</comment>

<comment>Just because you have a correlation, does NOT mean that there is causationYour claim is only true, if you are ignorant enough to confuse correlation with causation..Apparently you are that ignorant.</comment>

<comment>Thats rich. I was responding to your claim that that directly implied causation:"All you need to do is do a list of all countries by their intentional homiicde rateand then compare where they stand relative to their levels of gun control."</comment>

<comment>Wrong...I was not claiming causation..I was arguing that in fact the data from other countries disproves ANY claim of causation, BECAUSE the data is all over the board, and completely incoherentAnd the line following:"It totally destroys the myth that gun control has ANY effect on crime."Even blows apart any attempt to claim strong correlation.</comment>

<comment>How did it work during the massacre?</comment>

<comment>Oh no I guess it was a failure. Also the laws against murder. Guess that whole experiment with outlawing murder is a big failure by that ridiculous logic, huh?  </comment>

<comment>Actually that is the biggest problem for people like you..You work on the incorrect premise that laws stop things from happening..THE DO NOT !All they do is punish AFTER THE FACT, those who chose to ignore the law,  And ONLY if they are caught.No law has EVER stopped ANYTHING that the law forbade.But hey, that's just one of those niggly details that gun controllers love to ignore.</comment>

<comment>I guess you just want to ignore the fact that states and countries with stricter gun safety laws have lower gun incidence rates.  Hilariously this all started when you claimed that conservatives "resist is change for the sake of change", and tried to make some kind of argument that conservatism is interested in logic and smart decision making.  Even with plenty of evidence you resist this change not based on practicality, not based on evidence but based on ideology.</comment>

<comment>It's a false claim based on the false premise that guns are causal for crime rates.All the countries with much stricter gun control and much higher crime and even "gun crime" rates prove it false/.You are really having problems here with your ideological presumptions and attempts to force answers to fit that ideology.It's not working..Try harder.Better yet.Stop guessing and start thinking.</comment>

<comment>There you go again with your blatantly ridiculous misrepresentation of the facts.  Most other people would simply call it lies.  Just leave the country if you don't like the laws here.  The 2nd Amendment protects the right to own a gun.  It's a pretty simple concept and it's also the LAW OF THE LAND!</comment>

<comment>LOLThe lie is statements like: "countries with stricter gun safety laws have lower gun incidence rates."is simply a lieIt's lie in the same class as claiming that a country without criminals has no crimeBut no country is free of criminals.Just like no country, no matter how strict their gun control, is free of guns.The claim also ignores the fact that criminals without guns are still going to be out there committing crimes without guns..So all that happens when guns are banned are1) the ban is ignored2) crimes are still committed by oither means..If you want to HONESTLY look at the results, you need to look for changes in TOTAL crime.If that does NOT change after a ban, then you have achieved NOTHING., because the criminals just went on committing the crimes using other means.And in the process, by disarming the people, you have made them easier targets for the criminals.</comment>

<comment>Oh really?  How about all those people who were just shot in France?  If their gun control laws stop all gun violence...then how did the terrorists shoot all those people?  Wake up and smell your bullshit!</comment>

<comment>It's all about punishing the people who voted the "wrong" way, isn't it?  It'll be easy to put political opponents on that 'no-fly' list by bureaucratic fiat, won't it?</comment>

<comment>If only we could put willful idiots on the "no-comment" list, the world would be such a better place.</comment>

<comment>Fascist fagg0t.</comment>

<comment>There you go Robert you're against the 2nd Amendment and the 1st Amendment.  You just proved the old adage that the 2nd Amendment protects the 1st Amendment!  How about you do the people of this country a favor and just leave for a Communist country like China or Cuba...they would tend to like your mindset.  You would undoubtedly be more comfortable there.</comment>

<comment>Unlike gun apologists, I am a strong supporter of REAL constitutional rights, not the invented ones such as you wish for.</comment>

<comment>LOLYou mean like the one the unequivocaly states..".. the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" ??Funny..You've spent a lot of time doing everything in your power NOT supporting it.</comment>

<comment>Just ignore, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..."</comment>

<comment>We don't ignore it.We just, unlike ignorati like you, know what it means, and it's proper position in the paragraph.If English is your first language, you have yet to master it.Here.Learn some basic English...http://www.constitution.org/2l...</comment>

<comment>That you are incapable of quoting the FULL 2nd Amendment, as written and ratified by the Founders, and interpreted by the Supreme Court for 150 years as dealing ONLY with the militia, says all anyone needs to know about you.</comment>

<comment>Your ignorance of the English language is just a demonstration of your lack of education..http://www.constitution.org/2l...But hey, go ahead and CITE all those Supreme Court Cases where they allegedly:"and interpreted by the Supreme Court for 150 years as dealing ONLY with the militia"You won't, and you can't because it's a lie..</comment>

<comment>The abysmal ignorance of US constitutional history is evidenced in every one of your imbecilic comments.Professor Robert J. Spitzer discovered in the course of his research for the “2000 Symposium on the Second Amendment” that from the time US law review articles first began to be indexed in 1887 until 1960, all law review articles dealing with the Second Amendment endorsed the collective right model.The first law review article asserting an individual’s right to own firearms for self-defense (or sport) did not even appear until 1960.The United States Supreme Court addressed the Amendment three times in 1876, 1886, and 1939 and on each occasion held that it granted the people a right to bear arms only within the militia (United States v. Cruikshank, 1876; Presser v. Illinois, 1886; United States v. Miller, 1939).Historian Garry Wills wrote: “The recent effort to find a new meaning for the Second Amendment comes from the failure of appeals to other sources as a warrant for the omnipresence of guns of all types in private hands. Easy access to all these guns is hard to justify in pragmatic terms, as a matter of social policy… That is why the gun advocates appeal, above pragmatism and common sense, to a supposed sacred right enshrined in a document Americans revere…We must put up with our world-record rates of homicide, suicide, and accidental shootings because, whether we like it or not, the Constitution tells us to. Well, it doesn’t.”Wills suggests that gun advocates lobbied using shoddy scholarship that included quotations that were “truncated, removed from context, twisted, or applied to a different debate from that over the Second Amendment” in order to find “new meaning for the Second Amendment”"There is not a single word about an individual right to own a gun for self-defense in the notes from the Constitutional Convention. Nor with scattered exceptions in the records of the ratification debates in the states. Nor on the floor of the US House of Representatives as it marked up the Second Amendment. … [In the First Congress,] the debate about the right 'to keep and bear arms' was focused solely on strengthening the militia and thus ward off the specter of an army. Twelve congressmen joined the debate, though none mentioned a private right to bear arms for self-defense, hunting, or for any purpose other than joining a militia." – The Second Amendment: A Biography, Michael Waldman (2014)"The Second Amendment arose out of the conflict between Federalists and Antifederalists over those portions of the Constitution that dealt with the militia and the national army. But it was ultimately tied to the larger Federalist-Antifederalist conflict over the nature of the new government itself. At the end of the Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, the Antifederalists were soundly defeated. After that state convention, they published their Reasons of Dissent. Part of this document contained a list of fourteen proposed amendments to the Constitution. Some of these proposals – those dealing with the protection of individual libertarian rights and legal due process – were later incorporated, almost word-for-word, into the Bill of Rights. The Pennsylvania Antifederalists also proposed amendments concerning the army, the militia, the right to bear arms, and the right to hunt, including the right of self-protection through the ownership of weapons. Madison and his colleagues in the First Congress emphatically rejected the goals and the language of the Pennsylvania Antifederalists on these issues." – The Second Amendment in Historical Perspective, Paul Finkelman, Chapman Distinguished Professor of Law, University of Tulsa College of LawAs investigative reporter Robert Parry writes: “Today’s American Right is drunk on some very bad history, which is as dangerous as it is false.” The Right has been repeating lies about the Second Amendment and US history for several decades, but as Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said, “Repetition does not transform a lie into the truth.”</comment>

<comment>LOL1) Go ahead and cite all those "law review" articles supposedly found by Spitzer.We have 35 cases that the US Supreme Court in which the US Supreme Court referenced the 2nd Amendment directly or indirectly, AND NONE make ANY mention of communal right.That's called a trump card, bubThe US Supreme Court TRUMPS any and ALL law reviews coming up with fancy fabrications..2) Your claims about Cruikshank. Presser and Miller, are ALSO COMPLETELY FALSE.-- Cruikshank:"The Justices stated "The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second Amendments means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the National Government."[4]"NOTHING there about restriction to militias------ PresserThe decision stated:"We think it clear that the sections under consideration, which only forbid bodies of men to associate together as military organizations, or to drill or parade with arms in cities and towns unless authorized by law, do not infringe the right of the people to keep and bear arms. But a conclusive answer to the contention that this amendment prohibits the legislation in question lies in the fact that the amendment is a limitation only upon the power of congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state."Again NOTHING about restrictiions to militias..------- MilllerNothing about Miltiias since the case was about a short shotgun and the 1934 NFA tax.You are COMPLETELY CLUELESS about your references.3) The Federalist Papers are a collection of the writings of the Framers before and during the Constitutional convention.The clearly put to the lie the claim made by Michael WaldmanBut here are some verifiable quotes from the Framers themselves that debunk this lie-------------------------"The best we can hope for concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed..."-- Alexander Hamilton--------------------------"The Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation ... where the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms."-- James Madison--------------------------"To disarm the people — that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them."-- George Mason (Framer of Virginia's Constitution)--------------------------"To preserve liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms, and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them."-- Richard Henry Lee--------------------------"I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery."(Malo periculosam, libertatem quam quietam servitutem.)-- Thomas Jefferson, letter to James Madison, January 30, 1787--------------------------"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms."- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Constitution, Draft 1, 1776--------------------------"What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms."- Thomas Jefferson, letter to James Madison, December 20, 1787-------------------------"Arms in the hands of citizens may be used at individual discretion . . . in private self-defense. " --John Adams--------------------------" . . arms discourage and keep invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. ... Horrid mischief would ensue were [the law-abiding] deprived of the use of them. " -- Thomas Paine--------------------------"The Constitution s hall never be construed to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms. "--Samuel Adams--------------------------"A militia, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves...and include all men capable of bearing arms...To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught alike...how to use them." -- Richard Henry Lee--------------------------I'll stop here..There's not point in beating this dead horse of your ignorance any further</comment>

<comment>You have nothing to offer but the typically deceptive cherry-picking of all those who attempt to deny the historical reality.The facts are plain, but only to the honest.</comment>

<comment>LOLYou don't have an honest bone in your bodyBut that explains why you can't see the plain facts and deny them when they're presented to you..</comment>

<comment>The fact that YOU are immune to facts, science, reason, common sense and reality explains why YOU hide like a sniveling coward in the shadows of anonymity.I stand by every word I post.</comment>

<comment>When you can't argue the issue, you're reduced to stupid ad homs.When you stand next to the manure pile, you end up smelling like manure..I suggest you go stand somewhere more salubrious</comment>

<comment>Your interpretation of the Constitution is the only invention here.  You should read more about the Constitution or maybe just even read the Constitution for yourself so you know what it actually says instead of what some douche bag gun control freak tells you it means.  If you supported the REAL Constitution you obviously would know that your current thought on the 2nd Amendment is incorrect.  By the way when you read the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for yourself...don't add any words to it; read it as is in its literal form...don't reinterpret thought or definition just read it as it is.</comment>

<comment>Mote 350 million guns, actually.</comment>

<comment>Nice dog!</comment>

<comment>We had 320 million guns in 2006 it must be waay higher than 350 by now. Obama sells 20-30 million guns every time he says the words "Gun Control", lol</comment>

<comment>Right-wing Christians? I'm an atheist but Adam Lanza and James Holmes (two of the most recent, high-profile mass shooters) were not right-wing Christians.I don't know what position is 'far right.' I'm skeptical that any of the proposed gun control measures will reduce gun violence one iota. Is that far right?</comment>

<comment>Guns are for cowards.</comment>

<comment>Pure Foolstuffing,There are over 100 millin gun owners and 21 million people packing pistols every single day.Where are these "Rivers of Blood" and "Piles of Bodies" democrats predicted decades ago?Oh, that's right, those are all in Democrat controlled voting districts with less than 8% gun ownership.Meanwhile in Vermont 70-75% of households have a gun and they enjoy the lowest homicide rate in the USA.</comment>

<comment>Yes, more "pure foolstuffing" from a right-wing gun-fetishist NRA acolyte, who can't tell the difference between fact and propaganda.The US has the highest gun murder rate of any advanced industrial nation - by far - and is the only such nation in which mass shootings are the norm (more so far in 2015 than there are days in the year).Cities are always more violent than rural areas, because both people and poverty are far more concentrated.As for Vermont, where I've been living, we are the second most rural state in the nation, yet have the 14th highest rate of crime gun trafficking to other states - which is the norm for lax gun law states.So stick your ignorant BS where the sun don't shine.</comment>

<comment>In 80-90% of all US homicides both killer and victim have criminal arrest records and knew each other through criminal involvement. 68% of all US Homicides are Drug Related according to the FBI.Why do I give a flying flip if these people kill each other? Why would I give up my right to defend myself from these creeps when they decide to make me or my family among the 10% of their victims who aren't jailbirds?For your information the USA has more "diversity" than any other developed nation whose statistics you cite and in areas of the US where US demographics mirror those of Europe and Japan we have homicide rates on par and in some instanced LOWER than many of those countries your so disingenuously try to shoehorn in to this debate REGARDLESS OF ACCESS TO FIREARMS.Vermont has a lower violent crime rate than the UK despite 70-75% of all Vermont households owning guns.</comment>

<comment>You make up statistics to match your ignorant bias.According to FBI homicide data, only 49% of all US homicides from 1980-2008 involved people who were either family members or acquaintances.According to FBI homicide data, less than 3% of all 2012 homicides occurred during a felony drug crime.The US is far less diverse than most EU countries, yet has a gun homicide rate more than 11 times that of the EU average, more than 36 times that of Australia, and more than 82 times that of the UK.I've already addressed the issue of rural vs. urban and noted that Vermont has one of the highest rates of crime gun export because of its lax gun laws.But you will continue to spew invented "facts", misleading and deceptive statistics, and erroneous conclusions - all based on the usual NRA talking points.You are an intellectual fraud and a moral Neanderthal. Sell your BS to those idiots who will buy it.</comment>

<comment>http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub...http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub...Read it and weep, chufferThe vast majority of homicides are committed by people on drugs, trafficking in drugs, arguing about drugs.80-90% of Murder Victims have criminal arrest records(usually for drugs)http://articles.baltimoresun.c...http://city.milwaukee.gov/Imag...http://www.nola.com/crime/inde...http://fox59.com/2015/01/18/in...Please note also in those news articles and government documents that the majority of drug activity is also GANG activity.</comment>

<comment>According to YOUR source, between 36% and 47% of homicides in four selected cities (the most crime-prone areas in the nation) were drug-related, and only 5% of state prison inmates convicted of homicide perpetrated the crime for drugs.And your absurd 80-90% number comes from ONE crime-ridden city, and is NOT a national statistic.So you prove yourself grossly wrong and wantonly deceptive. No surprise there.</comment>

<comment>One city?Baltimore, Milwaukee, New Orleans, Indianapolis are all the same city?I can post 20 more if you wish, lolAhem, 36-47% homicides during a known "Drug Crime" feel free to quote the percentages of inmates who knew their victims via drug gang activity and then feel free to quote the percentages of them who were using those same drugs at the time they committed MURDER(http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub....You want to spin and obfuscate and nitpick your way out of this to the Nth degree but I first saw the 68% figure on an DEA Joint Drug Task Force poster in a police station in 2004 and I would trust it that more than I would the Obama FBI/DOJ/DEA today which has selectively deleted dozens of links I was posting relevant data from starting in January 2013 (for what reason I will leave you to guess) but they are no doubt a more dishonest and nebulous organization than they were in 2004.You are trying to whip up astroturf for a universally unpopular and thoroughly debunked phony cause that is only supported by Bureaucrats and Billionaires. Are you paid to post this rubbish and spew phony outrage non-stop?</comment>

<comment>As not a single statistic you have claimed here is supported even by your own linked sources, you are clearly a fraud, a propagandist, a deceiver and a worthless human being who doesn't even have the courage to put his name by his words.If anyone is paid to post propaganda, it's YOU, but nobody would pay such an ignorant imbecile.</comment>

<comment>Again Robert if you don't like it here...just leave.  The only ignorance I see here comes from you and Art.</comment>

<comment>You repeat the same mindless mantra of those who opposed Vietnam War protesters - "love it or leave it".Except, then as now, the protesters were right.I would recommend finishing your GED before you continue to put your smelly foot in your mouth.</comment>

<comment>For starters I have a Bachelors of Science in Engineering and an I.Q. of 130.  With regard to the Vietnam War maybe you should have left the country back then.  Gun Control advocates aren't protesters they're nothing more than pawns.</comment>

<comment>So you pretend. But your functional IQ is clearly sub-room-temperature, your knowledge of American history at a sixth-grade level, and your character as immature as a petulant adolescent.I have no issue with guns, per se. I'm an excellent target shooter. The problem is that, almost without exception, those who SHOUT the loudest about "gun rights" are narcissistic fetishists who don't have the intelligence, the moral character, or the emotional maturity to handle a gun in a way that is consistent with the public good.You are emblematic of the kind of person who should never be allowed near a gun.</comment>

<comment>Once again you are given provable facts and you turn it and twist it to your own delusional opinion.  Robert you must be responding from a psychiatric ward somewhere.  I would imagine you have some form of sociopathic schizophrenia...please seek help, if you haven't already been committed somewhere, before you become a larger threat to society.  You definitely well represent your fellow gun control nuts.  Maybe you and your ilk would find better psychiatric help in another socialist/communist country.</comment>

<comment>Only a true moron would try as hard as you do to indict himself in the court of public opinion.You are a disease which infects America.</comment>

<comment>Only a complete fucking jerk off like yourself comes on a site like this and shoots his mouth off with nothing to back it up other than the lies that comes to his mind at that very moment.  You have a serious mental issue where you feel superior to everyone else in this country even though in real life your a total loser who no one you know would give you the time of day; you come off as boorish and psychologically unstable; you probably have some kind of sexual dysfunction as well since you are so hung up on fetishes which more than likely leads to further frustration in your life...which then causes you to manifest frustration in other areas of your life.   Your delusions of grandeur cause you to feel like you are some kind of expert that everyone has to listen to and follow ONLY your train of thought, but reality leaves you lonely and pissed off at the world because no one can stand to listen to you for more than two minutes at a time.  Maybe if you invested in purchasing some Viagra you could get rid of your sexual frustration with your boyfriend.  Then you wouldn't feel the necessity to try and tell the rest of us how to live our lives.  Now maybe if you've been let out of your psychiatric ward you can go to your local "Drum Circle" and bore the shit out of the people there instead of the rest of us intelligent enough to read the English Language and understand what is actually written in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.</comment>

<comment>Only a true moron would try as hard as you do to indict himself in the court of public opinion.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you that only a true moron would try as hard as you do to indict himself in the court of public opinion.  I'm assuming the psych ward will probably kick you off the computer soon so we don't have to listen to you much longer.  ;-)</comment>

<comment>You perfectly embody everything that's wrong with America: willful stupidity, wanton ignorance, and vile hatred for anyone or anything that exposes you for what you are.</comment>

<comment>Funny I was thinking the same thing about you.  Aren't you late for your "Drum Circle" gathering?</comment>

<comment>Not funny, but pathetic, as is every one of your desperate attempts to toss the mud back that sticks to you so well.You are a cancer on society.</comment>

<comment>The only cancer on society is you.  It's obvious that you are a one trick pony.  When your lies don't work you throw a tantrum and complain that people who don't subscribe to your bullshit agenda are fetishists and morons.  What are you in junior high yet?  It's obvious that was the peak of your psychological development.  Hopefully they have you back in your rubber room at the psych ward.  I really do believe that shock therapy might have positive benefits for you; maybe you should consult with your psychotherapist.</comment>

<comment>What's truly pathetic is that you are far too stupid to realize that you appear ever more imbecilic, ignorant and immature with each additional comment.</comment>

<comment>And yet, far more people think that your description does you far more justice than anyone else..Funny that..</comment>

<comment>More than ironic, coming from the only other person who rivals Travis Simpson for sheer ignorance and abject idiocy.</comment>

<comment>Your empty affirmations are just that..Empty..Must be very sad to be you..</comment>

<comment>To a congenitally empty mind, everything must seem so.</comment>

<comment>The only thing pathetic is you and your delusions of grandeur.</comment>

<comment>I live with neither delusions nor illusions. But, compared to low-life scum like you, anyone would appear elevated.</comment>

<comment>I would like to continue to take you on in this battle of wits, but I think it's unfair to fight an unarmed douche bag like you any longer.  Better get back to your rubber room now.</comment>

<comment>It's hardly a "battle" when my adversary is witless, and as immature as a sandbox bully.</comment>

<comment>Dude seek help.  Your so pathetic your next argument is probably, "I know you are but what am I?"  Better run along and find your boyfriend at your Drum Circle meeting loser.</comment>

<comment>I see you haven't yet received your certificate in remedial English grammar.</comment>

<comment>That's the best you have?  Wow you're such a loser!</comment>

<comment>You must, at some level, realize that you are acting like an angry child lashing out at the adults in the room who are chastising you for your willful ignorance and gross emotional immaturity.</comment>

<comment>That's laughable that you consider yourself an adult, when it is you that is clearly behaving like the angry child.  You are undoubtedly the one displaying ignorance and emotional immaturity.  The 2nd Amendment is clearly the law of the land and yet you childishly and emotional lash out at others who support the law of the land and try to reinterpret what the framers' intent was regarding the 2nd Amendment even though it is clear to everyone else in this land other than socialist losers like yourself.  You're like those who belong to the "flat earth" society who believe the earth is flat and the sun orbits just you, because you're so special and are such a gift to the universe that everyone must believe what you do.  The only other person I know who demonstrates such arrogance is the current President of the United States.  The Supreme Court has decided that the 2nd Amendment will be interpreted as the Framers intended.  Every citizen will have the right to own guns and that right shall not be infringed.  We the People win and socialist losers like yourself lose yet again.  I hope that fact burns in and continues frustrate you and it's obvious that it does.  That fact will bring me joy in the new year.  Now have fun at your "Drum Circle" loser.</comment>

<comment>You prove my correct with every additional childish response. And yet you are clearly far too stupid to realize that you continue to make an abject fool of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should go back to school to learn English...or maybe you're just impaired from smoking too much dope at your Drum Circle meeting earlier.  You're the fool and it's blatantly evident to everyone on here except the mentally impaired people from your gun control club.</comment>

<comment>The only place those murder rates exceed other nations are in Leftist controlled cities where gun control laws are the most stringent.  Take away those cities and the statistics put us well below the majority of nations.  Once again Robert you cherry pick your statistics which is indicative of people from your Socialist/Communist ideology.  Do us all a favor and go to a country that supports your ideology.</comment>

<comment>You mean the 400 million guns?  Obama has sold over 100 million guns all by himself!</comment>

<comment>We are advised to not judge all Muslims by the actions of a few lunatics. Yet we are encouraged to judge all Gun Owners by the actions of a few lunatics.</comment>

<comment>That's an oversized and very stinky RED HERRING, as nobody does.When we enact driver licensing and vehicle registration and inspection and mandate motor vehicle liability insurance, it is NOT an indictment of all drivers but a socially-responsible method of ensuring that we are all protected from the unreliable or reckless ones.But those gun apologists who ARE narcissistic fetishists are the ones making life harder for all gun owners.</comment>

<comment>And yet all that driver ed, licensing and vehichle registraton nets over 33,000 accidental deaths, and over 2,000,000 injuries, and $Billions in property damageMeanwhile not requiring shooter ed, licensing and gun registration nets about 500 accidental deaths, about 20,000 accidental injuries and peanuts in property damage.That's a real good argument to maybe rethink all that government intervention in driving. And that its a counter-argument to do the same with respect to shooters and guns.</comment>

<comment>Gun fetish?  I don't think that word means what you think it means. Look in the DSM5 , and then for paraphilias. Tell me where you find gun fetish anywhere. I don't know which is more disgusting: trying to sexualize guns, or  trying to sexualize guns, and then wanting to take them away from people. Your assertions about who does the shootings has no bearing on reality. Columbine?  Nope, no right wing Christians there, Sandy Hook? again, no. The Navy yard shooting?  no again. What I see is a leftist trying to    push his agenda by lying and distorting.   You need to, because the truth just does not support you.</comment>

<comment>Robert Riversong - All I can go by is my own personal experience.  15 years ago I had a man trying to break into my house.  He was trying to break in through a bathroom window that was right next to my 6 month old daughter's bedroom; my wife woke me from a dead sleep and was frantic.  I told her to dial 911 and I then proceeded over to my closet to retrieve my 30.06 semi-automatic deer rifle; I proceeded to put a loaded magazine into the rifle and proceeded down the hallway to the bathroom in question.  I looked around the corner of the door way and saw the man trying to remove the screen on the window.  I could have shot the man if I wanted to, but I don't believe in unnecessary violence.  At that point I held the rifle out in front of the door way and cycled the action which makes a pretty loud "cha-ching" sound.  The man trying to break in jumped down away from the window and then fled the scene.  The police were on sight within 3 minutes which is a pretty good response time...however the man would have been inside my house before they could have got there.  Having that gun available and at hand prevented what could only have been a violent incident which could have involved severe possible injury or death to me or any number of my family...so that in summary is a personal "reality" of what I have lived through where a gun not only saved my family from potential violence but also possible death.  I find your comments on this matter very myopic and one sided.  Life is full of grey areas and gun ownership happens to be one of them.  Gun ownership is a 2nd Amendment RIGHT and it shall not be infringed upon.  Our nation's constitution has guided our nation and the live's of its citizenry through over 200 years of history.  Mass shootings have been a fairly recent development with regards to our nation's history.  Most of these mass killing incidents involve two common denominators  1) Mental Illness and 2) Radical Islamic Terrorism   I fail to see how illegal gun control implemented by our Federal Government upon "we the people" would do anything to change the situation one little bit.  The only thing it would accomplish is to make more victims of law abiding citizens in this country.  I also fail to recognize your bullshit claim that all or most of the mass killing attacks were perpetrated by "right wing" Christians.  I would recommend that you do a little more "actual" investigation into this issue rather than just regurgitating bullshit lies generated by "Pro" gun control organizations.  Maybe start with the FBI Crime Statistics Department....they have the actual facts on these issues.  I myself have studied them and I can only conclude that your unfounded accusations are just simply baseless.  That combined with my own personal experience tells me with out a single doubt that the average American citizen is better off owning guns in order to defend themselves.  If you don't agree with me, then you don't have to own one; however that is your choice and your own misguided opinion should not however preclude me from owning a gun or guns.  Live your life your way and please leave me and anyone else who wants to own a gun alone.  This is a "free" country...if you don't like it here you are free to leave and live in a country where gun ownership is illegal.  In short if you want to be a victim...please go do it somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>It's almost certain that, if you had approached the home invader with a baseball bat, he would also have run away. So, not only is your conclusion misguided, but a single personal experience does not create a valid societal generalization.It is also certain that you know nothing at all about mass shooters, as you regurgitate NRA talking points which are NOT based on any valid research.I have studied this subject exhaustively, and have published tens of thousands of words on the subject. You are wrong on every count and your prejudice is typical of those who prefer myopia to understanding, and prefer selfishness over the pubic good.P.S. It is an indisputable fact that the 2nd Amendment was never intended to protect gun possession for self-defense (in spite of the new "right" magically discovered by Antonin Scalia), as such language was explicitly rejected by the Founders.</comment>

<comment>As I stated in another comment, facts mean nothing to you, nor real life experiences.  It's obvious only your view matters and we must all live just according to your opinion rather than the Constitution and Bill of Rights which has guided our country for more than 200 years.  It doesn't matter how much you want your opinion and messed up reinterpretation of the 2nd Amendment to be the Law of the Land, but it isn't.  So I guess you will just have to go on being pissed off at life and possibly the universe as "we the people" will continue to enjoy our right to own a gun(s) and exercise our right to self defense.  Meanwhile maybe you should just publish another paper on how we're all just so oblivious follow your messed up opinion on how we should all live our lives; by the way what's next on how we should all live our lives?  I suppose next you're going to tell us that we're only allowed to eat only vegetables and drink just water and only wipe with a single square of toilet paper.  People like you Robert are in serious need of psycho therapy and probably psychotropic drugs.  Move on with your pathetic life and learn to live with things you can NOT change.</comment>

<comment>They were not right wing Christians! You progressive loons really piss me off with your childish bull shit!The S. Carolina shooting was a right wing mental case, the rest were all liberals! Christians were targets in two o0f the shootings!</comment>

<comment>Thanks for proving, yet again, that anti-progressives are invariably stupid, ignorant and flagrant liars.This disinformation campaign alleging that most recent mass shooters are registered Democrats (or liberals) is based on the assertions of Roger Hedgecock, a right-wing radio show host. Hedgecock asserts, without providing any evidence or sources, that the Ft. Hood shooter Nidal Hasan, the Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho, the Aurora Theater shooter James Holmes and Adam Lanza of Sandy Hook infamy were all “registered Democrats”. He acknowledges that Klebold and Harris (the Columbine Colorado shooters) were too young to be registered voters but asserts, again without providing any evidence, that Harris and Klebold’s parents were progressives or liberal Democrats. All of these charges are utterly baseless.1. Nidal Hasan (the Ft. Hood shooter) lived in either Virginia (his state of residence prior to being sent to Ft. Hood) or Texas, neither of which has partisan registration. Therefore the claim that he was a "registered Democrat" is false.2. Since Virginia does not have partisan registration there is also no way to tell whether Seung-Hui Cho was a Democrat, but again because there is no partisan registration in the state we can say that the claim that he is a registered Democrat is FALSE. A more obvious point is that Cho was a resident alien, not a US citizen, so he was not eligible to vote in the US.3. The allegation that James Holmes was registered Democrat was based on a Breitbart blogger, Joel B. Pollack, who found voter registration records for a DIFFERENT James Holmes who was about the same age. Alex Jones’ Infowars and other right-wing websites then dutifully repeated the lie without verifying it. It was later determined that the Colorado Theater Shooter James Holmes was NOT registered to vote. The claim that James Holmes was a registered Democrat is FALSE.4. The claim that Adama Lanza is a registered Democrat has been suggested based not on any evidence that he was registered as one, but on the rather dubious claim that because Connecticut has almost 2:1 Democratic registration over Republicans, he was probably a Democrat. BUT the city of Newtown voted for Mitt Romney. Republican Senate candidate and Tea Party favorite Linda McMahon carried the city over Democrat Chris Murphy by an even larger margin. Add in the other information we have that Lanza’s mother was a “doomsday prepper” and a home schooler in a Republican-leaning city and we can pretty well dispense with the erroneous assumption that Lanza must have been a Democrat. According to at least one media source, Nancy Lanza was a registered Republican.5. Klebold and Harris of course were not old enough to vote and they had no apparent political affiliation. Allegations that they came from families of Democrats or liberal progressives appear to have no sources to substantiate those claims. What little ideology the boys demonstrated owed mostly to an admiration for Timothy McVeigh not Ted Kennedy. Any suggestion that the two boys were Democrats is demonstrably FALSE.6. Christopher Dorner, in his manifesto, stated his support for conservative Republican Jon Huntsman. He was not a Democrat, nor did he ever vote for Obama.According to a study released in June 2015 by the New America Foundation, almost twice as many people have died in attacks by right-wing groups in America as have died in attacks by Muslim extremists. Of the 26 attacks since 9/11, 19 (73%) were carried out by non-Muslims. </comment>

<comment>There were two terrorist attacks last week. Focusing on "Radical Islam" only addresses half the problem (expand that to "religious fundamentalism" and you might have a case).</comment>

<comment>I am sorry, but the VAST majority of murder being commited in the name of any "religious fundamentalism" is found primarily in ONE religion...In this case we have a president who decided to mock half of America about being afraid of women and children etc...No, not afraid just cautious...Guess what genius, as California demonstrates, gender is irrelevant with this group of fundamentalists...I am sorry Chrisitans don't fit your bogeyman scenario...You have to go all the way back to the Crusades to make such a comparison. Geting excited over one incident here or there, commited by other religions, over the course of the last 1000 years is what is really crazy...</comment>

<comment>The vast number of victims of terrorism are members of the same religion.  Is it equally true to say that it should be our focus to protect those people?</comment>

<comment>The PP shooter was Muslim? The Santa Barabara shooter was Muslim? The Sandy Hooke shooter was Muslim? </comment>

<comment>Are you people pretending that those shootings were religiously motivated now? Talk about intellectual dishonesty...</comment>

<comment>No, I was merely posing questions, which you and Sparta seemed to conveniently leave unanswered. But to answer yours, I can think of one of those examples that very likely was religiously motivated. </comment>

<comment>You can think of one that might have been religiously motivated hahaha. Good job.</comment>

<comment>Lol let's talk about intellectual dishonesty again...</comment>

<comment>Just further proof that gun violence isn't something the Democrats want to solve, it is a political tool.</comment>

<comment>Indeed...</comment>

<comment>See my remark 3 or 4 hops above yours. In short, militia training to be a legal gun holder - life sentence for an illegal gun.</comment>

<comment>What always gets me about you barrel boffers is that you say it's about people, not guns - but the moment anyone suggests something as simple as a background check to try and reduce the number of unstable people able to easily access firearms, you lose your shit. Make up your minds already!</comment>

<comment>What's the point of doing background checks, when nothing happens to the people who fail them ?Not to mention, all the people who constantly fail them falselyThis is a not about making laws work.This is about passing even more laws that are selectively enforced.</comment>

<comment>How about this simple 3 step process: 1) try to buy a gun 2) background check is performed 3) if check is passed, here's your gun. If it isn't, there's the door NO gun.It need be no more complicated than that. A background check does not say "this person is doing wrong now, lock them up!" but rather "this person has stuff in their past that indicates they are not safe to have a firearm".</comment>

<comment>How about..Because the system does NOT work.1) There are major failures, as well as technical faults in the system, to acquire the names of those who should be stopped.2) There are numerous false-positive delays and denialsAnd a great many of those delays and denials have been found to be because the system gets overloaded , so the clerks just rubber stamp a delay on it.The real question is that the right to "keep", which also includes purchase, is being abrogated for questionable justifications and results.------------------------How would you like , if you went to your local OffiiceSupplies Superstore and had to have a background check to have buy a pen and pad, or even a computer so that you canparticipate in this forum ?But FSICS (Free Speech Instant Check System) was put in place to stop terrorists from communicating with each other by pen and paper and using the internetWhy would you object ?After all we just had 2 terrorists kill 14 people.</comment>

<comment>Except that kind of system DOES work - it worked in the UK for 3 DECADES before handguns were all but banned. 3 mass shootings in as many decades. So actually, it is possible to definitively state that yes, background checks do work. Unless what little of that system that exists has been undermined by special interest groups like the NRA - then of course it will struggle. Properly funded and run, background checks work fine. That's a simple, cold hard fact.When it is harder to buy some medications, alcohol and cars than a firearm - a device with only one purpose, a weapon - there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with a country.</comment>

<comment>Unfotunately for you, there is no CAUSALITY demonstrated in ANY gun control methodology, to demonstrate that gun control reduces mass shootings.That's because, pay attention now, mass shootings are not caused by the presence of guns...Meanwhile BOTH the UK and Australia have had mass killings since then went to more gun control.The UK also had an 89% increase in ALL crimes, including crimes with guns, in the 10 years following their ban/confiscation.Your "harder to buy" nonsense is just that.It was demonstrated false with ProhibitionIt was demonstrated false with the War on DrugsAnd it was demonstrated false with the UK's handgun ban/confiscation, where today, there are more illegal handguns in the UK than were in total before the ban/confiscation.(per Home Office)The problem is a simple one.Correlation does not mean causation.And your argument is all correlation and no causation.</comment>

<comment>Why do you idiots always equate background checks with "complete ban"? The two are totally different. Bans do not work, everyone knows this. Checks and regulations do. The UK had 3 mass shootings in 3 decades, directly because guns were regulated. There was a fourth after that, involving shotguns and rifles (which were not banned) not pistols, again proving that limits work. 4 mass shootings in 5 decades, all thanks to sensible restrictions. The US has that (or more) a month. The difference is the availability of guns.Very few folks want to ban guns altogether, because they know it won't work - what most folks want is to stop unsuitable people (you know, those with a history of violence or on a No Fly list) from easily accessing guns. The only folks who oppose this are violent morons who know they'd fail and are attached to their penis enhancers.It should be noted I'm a long-time opponent of the UK handgun ban, we need to bring back the old system which is proven to work. Both the current UK law and the current US law (ban vs free for all) are proven failures.</comment>

<comment>Why do gun control idiots, on facing being demolished, immediately raise the "complete ban" red herring ?But hey, I'm game...Jamaica instituted a complete ban.How did that work out for them ?And I can reel of a whole list of other countries with complete bans that are total failuresAnd spare me that false, non-causal claims about how gun control stopped mass shootings in the UK.The UK didn't have that many to begin with.The numbers are so small, that you can't even bring up statistically meaningful data for comparison.By the way, Vermont basically NEVER had any restrictions on carry since it joined the union in 1781 as the 14th State.Now there are 6 other states that have joined Vermont as Constitutional Carry States.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And guess what.There has been NO EXPLOSION of crime in ANY of those StatesAs to believing that gun controllers want to ban guns completely,We only have to look at YOUR history to see the progression.And then we only have to look at gun controllers in the US, who have come out and CLEARLY stated that their ultimate objective is a complete and total disarmament of the public.So yeah, we have ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to believe that there is no intention for a complete ban.We have to proof that there is..</comment>

<comment>You alluded to a complete ban with the "prohibition" statement, not me, oh under-educated one.You can continue to deny its relevance, but the fact is that in the UK there have been four mass shootings in five decades. Four. That's it. The primary difference is the rate of gun ownership - even before the ban, gun ownership in the UK was far lower than in America and a far lower rate of gun crime. Overall, the UK crime rate is far lower than America's as well - in 2011, there were 6.52 million crimes in the UK, in the US there were 11.88 million.And before you trot out the "UK 4 times more violent" statistic, that is complete nonsense - comparing large categories such as violent crime is not possible, since the two nations regard different crimes as being violent and non-violent. In the UK all “crimes against the person,” including simple assaults, all robberies, and all “sexual offenses” are violent crime, whereas the FBI only counts murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.So in the UK, a lot more crimes are classed as violent ones, making a direct comparison of that classification impossible. Even causing "public fear, alarm or distress" is classed as a violent crime. However, when we compare individual crimes, such as murder rates (figures from 2010), the US had 4.8 murders per 100,000 citizens. The UK, 1.2. Indeed, violent crime in the UK has been declining since the 1990's and continued through the ban in 1997.Interestingly (again, figures from 2010), the US saw an overall drop in people owning guns between 1959 and 2010 and also saw a corresponding drop in gun crime.Although it is true that correlation does not equate to causation, when we see the same pattern repeated time after time, it becomes much more likely that the two are, indeed, linked.</comment>

<comment>You need to learn to read better, sonny..The phrase was:"It was demonstrated false with Prohibition"Notice the capital "p", you know the BIG "P" in the word "Prohibition" ??That makes it a PROPER NOUN rereferncing something SPECIFIC and NOT the common noun "prohibition" with a small "p"...You repeated reference to the number of mass shootings in the UK is a completely irrelevant factoid BECAUSE, you are ignoring a WHOLE SLEW of other factors like "cultural and social differences" when you are using that factoid to make about relative to the US.But what the hell.Why am I trying to teach an ignorant pig to just read plain English, not to mention sing Opera..See ya..<plonk></comment>

<comment>Conflation, and frankly, gross misrepresentation of statistics and perhaps ignorance or intentional misrepresentation of UK gun control legislative history and it's current state.Since you didn't specify which of the numerous legislative control measures you're referring to and you also didn't specify which reporting source you used (HO or CESW), we'll use the most recent 34 year period (1981-2015) and we'll look at both where the data is available (since we both know you're coming back with either "troll/stalker", "random insult", or "...semantics argument", this is TO you, but FOR everyone else being subjected to your ignorant and irrational behavior - Happy Holidays Internet!)  During this period there were three(3) legislative actions refining access to weapons. All three further reduced access to weapons, including firearms (in some cases, specifically firearms).First, we'll start off with the CESW report for 1981-2014. This includes everything except homicides and certain protected classes but, importantly, includes  crimes not reported to the police. The CESW has information on significantly more crimes than the police do! (the storied and fluid reporting semantics a are separate topic all together). If you use the HO numbers for this period, crime is statistically 'flat'.With this lens, there is no point anywhere in this 33 year period where crime increased by 89%. Did not happen.I want to believe that you will quote a single fact accurately, but its not looking good.  You can do it!Part two to follow.</comment>

<comment>All you have is nit-picking and hair-splitting as a rebuttalI supported my statementYou just waved your hands..No reason to continue..</comment>

<comment>Sir, you presented a premise, which you stated as fact, on a public forum.  I demonstrated that you clearly misrepresented the information. I provided sourced citation of factual data.  How is that hand waving?If you'd like to change your premise, and then have a debate about that, please let me know the new premise.You are calling a 33,000 person error "semantics" and "hair splitting". In no Universe is 300 == 33,804.The facts are derived from discrete measures, on clear and complete articulation, and on an understanding of all these factors.You are perverting the truth to support your position. The sad part is, its completely unnecessary. You can support your position with a fully articulated set of facts that rational humans will understand and appreciate. You just choose not to, because you enjoy doing this. I'm certain that you've never been in a position of authority because this behavior is shown to be completely ineffective at persuading people. Your behavior is idiotic.You do want people to support your position right?  The goal isn't to just get a bunch of complete strangers "riled up" on the internet?Apparently it's as much about entertaining yourself as it is doing whatever it is you're doing for the P2A camp. In my view, its "making them look dumb".</comment>

<comment>So you didn't say all crimes?  and you didn't say vehicular homicide = auto accident?  and you didn't call an air rifle, which has none of the qualities of an assault rifle, an assault rifle?  Never happened?You are 'derping' because you never engage in rational debate.Derisive remarks is your forte.Unfortunately, all humans were not created equally.I'll have a chart for you soon enough.</comment>

<comment>Keep wanking...And you were created a stupid and dishonest wanker.</comment>

<comment>Every system has issues.  Working together to resolve those issues through intelligent discourse yields a better future. The first step is realizing there is a problem; we can do better.</comment>

<comment>Bigigest problem with the system is the complete lack of enforcement against those that are caught..Why bother spending all that money and effort, and then doing nothing about the ones you catch ?I also notice that you chickened out on answering the question about what SIMILAR infringement you're willing to tolerate on your other rights.After all, if they can start infringing on one right.There is no reason for them to stop there, and not do the same about your other rights.</comment>

<comment>That is a systemic issue with the government and private enterprise, alike. Full agreement. I don't think we toss the whole thing out the window though. We iterate.Technology can help (it doesn't happen for free). Cooperation can help.I don't have any posts where you asked me that question (I just went through all your responses to me). Link it?Your premise is not sound, but I'll ignore that, and answer the question you didn't ask of me.Privacy would be the first one and probably only one. If the government (or anyone) for that matter said "if we monitor literally everything everyone does, we'll guarantee a significant reduction in crime/corruption of every kind", I'd be all for it. At the very least, my taxes would go down.As I've said to you at least twice before, I support 2nd amendment rights. I don't consider background checks an infringement (regardless of how broken the system is). I would not be against having to check my firearms in once a year, similar to the annual vehicle inspection. Inconvenient, definitely. Infringing, not at all.If we ever get in a situation where the government needs to take our firearms, and god bless us if we do, there isn't a damn thing any citizen can do about it.  There isn't parity of force today. I don't have strike drones or an effective defense against something I can't see. If that situation ever happens, your firearms will be the least of your worries. It's a pretty damn big if.The constitution is going to change. It might not be in your lifetime, but it will change, and significantly. It won't just be the 2nd amendment. The old ideas will not withstand the pressure of technology and the changes it requires of or impresses upon society. That force will crush everything we once knew and it'll happen in plain sight of the smiling masses. Certainly doesn't mean lay down, but there are more pressing issues.</comment>

<comment>The systemic issue is importantWe have laws that were passed that were supposed to work.They don't workEven when they are enforcedAnd now gun-controllers want more laws, that have been shown not to work elsewhere.Not going to happen in the USThe NRA woke up to this a few decades ago. They founded the NRA-ILA to fight against this salami-slicing encroachment on the 2nd Amendment.Those "old ideas" in the Constitution are such basic concepts that they will not change.Those ideas are timeless and are a reflection of man and mankind to be as free of the intrusion of others as possible.Only fools who think very short term, or don't think at all, buy into the notion that those are "old ideas" and "past their prime".</comment>

<comment>Is it short term thinking to consider that reasoning machines are not currently governed in any way?Is it short term thinking to realize that the organic variety of life is not the only way a human can 'exist'?Or are you just not aware of the current state of science?The arguments you are using to discount the success of gun control laws have been refined and reshaped to suit your position.  In the case of the UK changes, you've carved out a piece of history that best fits your position. It's a window that was nearly 30 years ago and in no way reflects the current state of affairs.If you look at the current state of UK gun crime, it's incredibly low. If you look at the state of UK gun crime in the most recent 15 year period its decreasing.If you don't attribute that fact to the changes in legislation, then what DO you attribute it to?</comment>

<comment>Doesn't matter how you try to gild the horseshit.It's still horseshit.Arguing "gun crime is low because of gun control" is just as dishonest as claiming that if there were no people, there would be no crime.Just plain dumb.I leave you to that nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Slippery slithering sir.  You ignore 97% of the questions I ask you. I'll try again.In the period between 2003 and 2015 (this is the "new reporting rules period") crimes involving guns in UK (CSEW & HO):2002-3:   10,2482003-4:   10,3382004-5:   11,0692005-6:   11,0882006-7:    9,645  <-- Violent Crimes Reduction Act Passed 2007-8:    9,8652008-9:    8,1992009-10:  8,0822010-11:  7,0402011-12:  6,0222012-13:  4,9272013-14:  4,860A > 52% reduction in crimes involving a firearm.To what do you attribute the decrease in crimes involving guns?</comment>

<comment>Funny how you cherry-pick your data 5 years after the gun ban confiscation..How about starting your data in 1982 or even further backThat way we'll see what the LONG TERM trend was, instead of a short term trend that fits your agenda and proves NOTHING about whether gun control had any effect.Come on back when you're not trying to fiddle the data, the same way that cops and prosecutors have been found fiddling the data in the UK, during that VERY SAME TIME PERIOD..</comment>

<comment>Again, you have not answered the question.  To what do you attribute the decrease?Also, have you been to the links I provided?  I'm not cherry picking.You complained about the state of crime reporting in the UK. The UK made changes to the crime reporting effective 2002.  Any data before 2002 is suspect.  The data YOU are using is in the period of "shoddy reporting".  Also, YOU are only looking at very small window.  I'm looking at the past 12 years.  The window I'm using is based on "improved reporting", is "recent data", AND is a longer period.The part you seem to be ignoring is that I'm going to need to go quite a ways back to find a number lower than the current number. So let's look at numbers in the "shoddy reporting period" and then compare them to today. It is important to note that if the data exists prior to 1998 somewhere other than a news article, its incredibly difficult to find, so I'll just quote YOUR suspect sources:1998/1999 (unverified, using YOUR news article link for the 89% increase window): 5,2092013/2014: 4,860That's a decrease, right?  You wanted a long term analysis. There it is.  The rate first increased (short term), and over the long term.... DECREASED  4,860 is less than 5,209.And again 1998/9, the number is suspect at best because the police were not reporting crimes appropriately, and that number does not show up in an official source (at least that I've been able to find). The change happened in 2002.  Could be less, could be more. Based on the data on ONS, it's probably a low estimate and is actually higher (they are still unsure that HO is reporting correctly).  If the authorities cannot accurately report the data, then arguments using the data are conjecture at best.I will keep looking for the official source though  (most of the tables they have published have "---"  as the value prior to 2002).</comment>

<comment>Again.I don't answer loaded questionsNor do I argue against cherry-picked data.Don't like it ?Don't try to play those games with me..If you can't help yourself, then accept that it will not work with me.</comment>

<comment>The question isn't loaded.1998/1999 (unverified, using YOUR news article link for the 89% increase window): 5,2092013/2014: 4,860DECREASED4,860 is less than 5,209.I'm asking to what do you attribute the decrease?Simple question.The source that you cited is using the same data I am using (except for 1998/1999 which came from Parliament).If I go back to the period before there were firearms, and then compare to today, I'll definitely find an increase.</comment>

<comment>Still lying...It was 89% over 10 years..http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new...You really can't stop lying..Poor thing</comment>

<comment>What you are doing is the exact definition of cherry pickingThe range in your article is: "1998-2008"The range I used is:             "1998-2014".2015 is not yet published.I am using the full range, starting at the date YOU selected.YOU are using a PARTIAL RANGE, starting at a date YOU selected, and stopping at the date that looks the best for the P2A camp.If you don't CHERRY PICK, the data shows decrease in crimes involving a firearm.C H E R R Y        P I C K I N GOh, btw how much money have a I made for you so far? Are you allowed to say?</comment>

<comment>If you want to demonstrate that there was no trend or that it was an opposite trend, then you have to go back at least 5+ years before 1997 to even show what the general trend was.IF it's a generational trend, then you have to go back 20+ years.I selected nothing..I gave you a cite that others reported an interesting trend between the years 1997-2008 where a downward trend in crime was not only stopped but reversed.And that reversal was only stopped and reversed again, by a massive hiring of police.Meanwhile during the same period, police and crown prosecutors have been caught with their hands in the cookie jar downgrading crime data for political reasons.Now you can flail about like the devil in a bowl of holy water, but it's not going to change data that has been clearly stated by the British government and reported in by mulltiple and disparate media..And yes, when you attempted to make an assortment of claims based on subsets like 1998-1999 or 2005-2008, you have indeed been trying to cherry pick..Which is why, I'm just stepping back and let you go around lying all over the place.</comment>

<comment>How have you demonstrated a trend?  You've provided data in a small window, which you yourself are calling suspect. You're using criteria which I apparently am not allowed to use? Double standard much?We'll try again (note that again, I'm stating the full range that is publicly available, including the unverifiable news source derived from private sector (Tories) parliamentary data:1998-1999: 5,2092002-3: 10,248  <-trending UP from your data point2003-4: 10,3382004-5: 11,0692005-6: 11,0882006-7: 9,645 <-- Violent Crimes Reduction Act Passed2007-8: 9,8652008-9: 8,1992009-10: 8,0822010-11: 7,0402011-12: 6,0222012-13: 4,927   <-trending DOWN from your data point2013-14: 4,860Up, then down. Long term trend is DECREASEShow me this 20 years before 1997 data. Please, because I'd love to take a look at it. It doesn't appear to be in the public domain.It's also curious that you're hyper focused on 1997. Why is that?It's certainly not the only legislation banning some class of firearm in the UK.Were there increases with any of the other 8 or more acts restricting access to firearms?So you attribute a decrease in crimes involving firearms to more police?</comment>

<comment>Winning!</comment>

<comment>Rather than calling people names like extremist and fetishist -- guaranteed to not convince them of your position -- how about we actually deal in facts?The AR-15, or any rifle for that matter, is used on only rarely in shootings. You just hear about them more because the media love to panic the public with the term "assault weapon."http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09...Most Level III and all Level IV body armor stops an AR round. If cops don't wear it, it's because it's heavy and hot and they rarely need it. As noted above, the "popular" AR-15 is not common on the street.And a 9mm pistol round goes through more drywall than a .223 because the long rifle bullet tumbles, breaks up and loses velocity. It's actually a better home-defense choice than the pistol.How about instead of punishing the 99.9999% of legal, safe gun owners who simply want to protect themselves, why don't we find out why most of these mass shooters are hopped up on psychotropic drugs and address that?https://www.google.com/webhp?i...Does bothering to check facts and offer a reasonable answer make me an extremist or fetishist?</comment>

<comment>Since you don't "bother to check facts" or "offer a reasonable answer", if not an ideological extremist or a gun fetishist then you are certainly a willful idiot and propagandist.Since you admit that most LEOs don't wear level III or IV body armor, then my statement is correct (and quoted from an FBI agent).And since it's true at Ar-type weapons are the tool of choice for the majority of public mass shooters, then your willful dismissal of the well-known danger of such weapons only paints your further as a willful deceiver.That you, further, pretend that a .223 round has less penetrating power than a 9mm, proves beyond shadow of doubt that you don't like facts (a 9mm has a muzzle energy of about 390 ft-lbs, while a .223 has an energy of 1280 ft-lbs.That you also claim - against the actual evidence - that "most of these mass shooters are hopped up on psychotropic drugs", is yet further proof of your disdain for documented facts.That you then pretend that enacting rational gun laws that the overwhelming majority of Americans - including most gun owners - support is "punishing" legal gun owners, paints you as an idiot acolyte of NRA propaganda.Don't bother with another deceptive response, as I have all the facts at my fingertips.</comment>

<comment>LOL, so not only extremist and fetishist, but idiot acolyte? When I'm the one who offered data to back up what my argument.What part of "tumble," "break up" and "lose velocity" didn't you understand? Foot-pounds aren't the only contributing factor to penetration. The 223/5.56mm has less penetrating power than 9mm:http://marker.to/E3OXyyQuote: "Despite the popularity of the round, too few realize that 9mm ball ammo can easily punch through not just one but several interior walls. By contrast, .223 rifle ammunition tends to tumble, turn and slow down when penetrating barriers, even more than a 9mm fired from some pistols. Many shooters like to debate this point, and admittedly on the surface it doesn’t seem logical, but studies done by SWAT teams over a decade ago revealed this phenomenon to be fact and it was one of the main reasons a lot of tactical teams transitioned to M-4s/AR-15s and gave up the H&K MP-5 SMG in the 80s and 90s."Re the shooters on psychotropic drugs, if you don't want to check the Google link to multiple articles I already posted, what's the point of talking? You've obviously drunk the koolaid. Ignore the facts, Robert. Go with your feelings.</comment>

<comment>You've presented far more propaganda than fact, and the wall penetration data is the least relevant issue, but the one you've latched onto.The fact is that the .223 round was chosen by NATO for maximum damage to the human body because of both kinetic energy and yaw and tumble."An M-16 rifle (.223 cal) is designed to produce larger wounds with high velocity, lower mass bullets that tumble, cavitate, and release energy quickly upon striking the target." - Firearms TutorialAs for the issue of mass shooters and SSRI drugs, I don't need your cherry-picked sites, since I've research this thoroughly and it's simply not true.There have been very few instances of mass shootings in which SSRI drugs were definitively involved.Frontier Middle School, Moses Lake WA (February 2, 1996)Barry Loukaitis, a 14-year-old student, entered his algebra classroom and opened fire, killing two and wounding another and then fatally shooting his algebra teacher. Loukaitis suffered from hyperactivity and clinical depression and was taking Ritalin at the time of the shooting.Thurston OR High School (May 20-21, 1998)At the age of 15, Kip Kinkel murdered his parents and engaged in a school shooting in Springfield, Oregon that left two students dead and 25 others wounded. Kip Kinkel was on Prozac for 3 months in the summer of 1997, and stopped tanking it in the fall of that year. The killing rampage was not until the spring of 1968.Columbine CO high school shooting (April 20, 1999)Eric Harris had been rejected by Marine Corps recruiters because he was under a doctor's care and had been prescribed an anti-depressant medication. In early 1998, Harris had taken Zoloft for two months, but soon became obsessed with homicidal and suicidal thoughts and was switched to Luvox, which was in his system at the time of the shooting, according to his autopsy, though some friends of Harris suggested that he had stopped taking the drug beforehand. In Eric’s private journal he lamented about how taking Luvox made him feel too “normal” and he therefore stopped taking it to “build on the rage” so he could go through with the shootings. During the investigation, two Luvox bottles prescribed to Harris were found in his home; one was empty, the other contained 100mg tablets.Dylan Klebold did not have any medications in his system at the time of his death. There is no documentation available to the public that confirms Dylan being prescribed medication at any time during his life.Virginia Tech (April 16, 2007)Seung-Hui Cho, a senior at Virginia Tech, had previously been diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder. In 2005, Cho was accused of stalking two female students. After an investigation, a Virginia special justice declared Cho mentally ill and ordered him to attend treatment. Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage. However, it is likely that Cho never complied in filling or taking this prescription; the toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal drugs were in his system during the time of the shooting.Northern Illinois University (Feb 14, 2008) Graduate student Steven Kazmierczak, described as an excellent student, was (according to his girlfriend) taking Xanax (anti-anxiety), Ambien (sleep aid), and Prozac (anti-depressant), which were prescribed to him by a psychiatrist. She said that he stopped taking Prozac about three weeks prior to the shooting. He allegedly had a history of mental illness and attempted suicides, was bullied in high school, and had shown an interest in previous school shootings, particularly those that occurred at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. According to a report published by the United States Fire Administration, Kazmierczak is believed to have studied Cho's actions and used a similar MO.Aurora CO theater shooting (July 20, 2012)James Eagan Holmes apparently met with at least three mental health professionals at the University of Colorado prior to the massacre. It was reported that Holmes was a big fan of superheroes, including Batman, and that his apartment was decorated with Batman paraphernalia. There are unconfirmed reports he became hooked on the narcotic prescription painkiller Vicodin, which was found in the system of Heath Ledger, the actor who played the Joker. Police found in his apartment prescription sertraline, a generic version of Zoloft used to treat depression, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder; and Clonazepam, usually prescribed to treat anxiety and panic attacks.Sandy Hook School shooting (Dec 14, 2012)Adam Lanza was diagnosed with autism spectrum (or Asperger's Syndrome), which is a brain-related developmental problem and not a mental illness. Lanza refused any medication and the autopsy found no drugs of any kind in his system.</comment>

<comment>223 was chosen because it had less recoil and soldiers could carry more rounds than the .308 used in the M-14</comment>

<comment>The AR-15 was introduced to special forces in Vietnam in 1961 and the soldiers liked its stopping power, and it was also being promoted at the time by General Curtis Lemay and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).</comment>

<comment>It had stopping power because the rate of twist on the barrel allowed the barely stabilized bullet to tumble on impact.But the Army wanted accuracy at 300M, so the rate of twist was quickly changed, and bulles didn't tumble anymore, and the .223 now mostly drilled holes, without transferring energy to the target.So it was known as a 'ineffective 'Poodle Shooter' with FMJ bullets.The service rifle wasn't the XM-16 the Green Berets used.LeMay wanted it as a light rifle for sentries to guard airfields, an excellent choice for that job.</comment>

<comment>"Stopping power" is a term used by layman, firearm magazines and ammo manufacturers.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it's a term used mostly by police.But thanks for continuing to display your ignorance.</comment>

<comment>Wrongly used.http://bulletsfirst.net/2014/0...</comment>

<comment>Says the one who has demonstrated his ignorance."Stopping power is the ability of a firearm or other weapon to cause ballistic trauma to a target (human or animal) enough to immediately incapacitate (and thus stop) the target. Stopping power is related to the physical properties of the bullet and the effect it has on its target... the physics involved are multifactorial, with caliber, muzzle velocity, bullet mass, bullet shape, and bullet material  all contributing." - Wikipedia</comment>

<comment>"Handgun stopping power is simply a myth" - FBI Training Division.</comment>

<comment>Oh man, you sure got us there with Wikipedia! Oh no! Not the Wikipedia of TROOOOFFFF!</comment>

<comment>Who are mostly poor shots and don't practice more than the minimum.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, neckbeard, marathag is more knowledgeable than your Wikipedia knowledge of the subject matter.</comment>

<comment>How many people are killed by AR-15s annually? Do you have any idea?</comment>

<comment>It had markedly less stopping power than 7.62 NATO M-14s or the 30-06 rifles of WWII and Korea. It was good enough. What was liked was light weight. Both weapon and ammo. </comment>

<comment>Considering the fact that starting in WWI, most combat was medium to short range, most soldiers did NOT need to carry large caliber long-range weapons.That is why the AK47 was so successfulIt is also why the AR15 also became so popularThe both were lighter carry and allowed for more ammo to be carried for the same load.</comment>

<comment>"An M-16 rifle (.223 cal) is designed to produce larger wounds with high velocity, lower mass bullets that tumble, cavitate, and release energy quickly upon striking the target." My point exactly! Wait, I forget -- were you arguing that .223 rounds penetrate, or don't penetrate? You seem to be arguing both sides.If you want to ignore the long list of drug-addled shooters I offered above, I'll grant you that a few were simply crazy (or radical Islamists, same thing). By definition, there's something mentally wrong with every one of them. My point was, why do you want to punish the rest of us because of them?Robert, my advice to you: Find a solution that intercepts bat-crap crazy nutbags BEFORE they launch on shooting sprees, WITHOUT going on a witch-hunt for normal people who simply desire to protect themselves from said whackos. Then everybody will be behind you!</comment>

<comment>As the overwhelming majority of Americans, including most gun owners, support tightened gun laws, your claims of "punishing" and "witchhunt" are gross attempts at emotional propaganda - not surprising from one who has no rational argument.</comment>

<comment>"Overwhelming majority"? Nope."Most gun owners"? Nope.Troll harder, neckbeard.</comment>
