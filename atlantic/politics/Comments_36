<comment>How is it that rigorous screening of migrants from nations with massive terrorist activity could be considered controversial?One would think that the decision to take in tens of thousands of potential jihadis would be the more disturbing issue.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats have finally taken a strong stand as traitors against America. The mask is off.</comment>

<comment>Um... "the homeland security secretary, the FBI director, and the national intelligence director must “certif[y]” to Congress that each individual refugee is not a “threat” to national security."Repeat this on per-refugee basis. And you call this not excessive?</comment>

<comment>The fact that the Democrats in Congress  have finally now voted against  adequate vetting of refugees shows that they have taken a significant step to position themselves as allies of Islam and enemies of those who wish to protect the USA against  Islamic terrorism.</comment>

<comment>Word.  Nothing ever goes wrong with legislation passed in panic mode.  I mean, the PATRIOT Act is such the model of a good law, amirite?</comment>

<comment>Meanwhile, progressives are PANICKING to bring in Muslims as fast as possible.As Donald Trump says - let's put a pause on the whole thing.Nobody needs panic mode, right?</comment>

<comment>Right.  Good thing no one's panicking.  Oh, wait, Teapublicans are wetting themselves.</comment>

<comment>No, I told you that progressives were PANICKING to bring in more Muslims. Can't you read?</comment>

<comment>Yes, that's what you said.  You're wrong, self-evidently, since they didn't allow the bill to be brought forward for a vote in the Senate.  Perhaps you should review *your* reading and comprehension skills.</comment>

<comment>You are babbling complete incoherent nonsense. Go take a sleeping pill and lie down.</comment>

<comment>And how long do our "progressive" brethren think they can ignore the outrages recently perpetrated by Muslim males in Cologne and other European cities?  The number of complaints has now exceeded 1,000.  It is frivolous to pretend that serious cultural incompatibilities aren't implicated here.  Prating about "racism" and "xenophobia" is indicative of a mindset of denial.Obama proposes to delegate "vetting" to the UN.  The UN always has our best interests at heart, no?  Ominously, the UN guidelines mandate that absence of information is not a basis for denial of "refugee" status.  That means we are going to be relying on well coached information volunteered by applicants to UN operatives.  How many are going to admit to temptation to explode themselves in crowded places, or commit sexual assault?We are glibly assured that no more than a third of these "refugees" will be adult males.  Male immigrants as young as 15, however, have been accused of serious sexual misconduct in Europe.  More importantly, how long before women demand to be reunited with the actual or purported fathers of their children?Whose interests does it serve to create more resentful, disaffected Muslim enclaves in the US?</comment>

<comment>The muslim males committing crime in Cologne weren't actually Syrian though, they were most north African and from the Caucasus and Balkans.  Chancers exploiting the refugee flow.Saying that it does make good sense to carefully vet any refugees from Syria that you take in.  There has been a thriving trade in faked Syrian documents, plus the Germans have taken up to six months to fingerprint them.Verify their documents and fingerprint, maybe even vet their beliefs, before they arrive, and you probably are better off prioritising women, children, the elderly, disabled and gay.</comment>

<comment>No, the offenders have been described by their victims as being, overwhelmingly, of "Arab" appearance and speech.  Syrians are well represented among the suspects."Vet their beliefs"--gimme a break.</comment>

<comment>No, German cops have repeatedly leaked that they weren't Syrians. For instance just yesterday, André Schulz,  President of the Federation of German Detectives said "Most of the perpetrators are people from north and west Africa, from the Caucasus and the Balkans.These people have not really fled from war, nor are they persecuted in any way. They've used the opportunity now to travel into Germany and commit crimes".Edit:  As to vetting their beliefs, what I meant is you'd be quite within your rights to reject anyone who fails to explain basic US norms, such as a lack of fundamentalism and a clear understanding that all forms of sexual assault or domination are wrong.  You could even give priority for our secular, but often Muslim, allies the Kurds, or persecuted minorities like the Yahzidi.  </comment>

<comment>From the horse's mouth:  "There is no doubt about who the perpetrators were: they were young, male, and looked North African or Arab" (Red Alert in Cologne, Volker Wagener, Deutsche Welle, 1-6-16.)As for "vetting," have you considered the handle "Candide"?  What, precisely, is the objection to letting the FBI manage this?</comment>

<comment>I'd involve the NSA and the CIA, as they have better knowledge of overseas issues, but I have no objection to anything you request to protect your own safety.  I'm just pointing out that actual war refugee aren't involved in the crime spree in Germany, they are all fakers.  Or fakirs.</comment>

<comment>Two Teenage Girls Gang-Raped by Four 'Syrian Nationals' in Southern Germany, Justin Huggler, The Telegraph, 1-8-16.Part of the New Year's Eve rape spree.</comment>

<comment>They weren't war refugees though, they'd lived here for decades, and weren't in a public celebration but rather had lured their 'friend' tot heir house.  You get white Christian US rapists, native Scots rapists, very nationality.</comment>

<comment>That's hardly how the Germans see it:  "...in the wake of massive attacks against women by a large horde of men, a large number of whom were asylum seekers..." (Groping Incidents in Cologne Exacerbate  EU Refugee Crisis, Bernd Riegert, Deutsche Welle, 1-9-16.)But butter wouldn't melt in the mouths of Syrian "refugees," would it?</comment>

<comment>Actually, all of the migrants are seeking asylum, that doesn't mean they are actually Syrians.  It's just a delaying tactic to stop them getting deported to their safe nations until they've enjoyed a decent, profitable holiday at someone elses expense.</comment>

<comment>It is actually a matter of jurisdiction. The NSA and CIA are foreign intelligence agencies and the FBI is charged with domestic security. The FBI and Immigration likely have accesses to any foreign intelligence information they need in order to vet refugees, but since anyone in the country legally has the same right to due process as a citizen it can't be used in criminal prosecutions unless it was collected under a warrant. The FBI is a law enforcement agency and the NSA and CIA are not.</comment>

<comment>I never said not to involve the FBI though, you said that on my behalf.  Take any precaution you deem suitable to vet asylees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.  A handful of them have already proven to be wolves in sheeps clothing.</comment>

<comment>What I meant was the NSA and CIA are not the proper agencies. Immigration and State Dept are the proper agencies, and if there is a threat identified then the FBI.</comment>

<comment>North Africans are predominantly Arab -- in case you were not aware of that.</comment>

<comment>Muslim lives before American lives! Voters now know where democrats stand! Senator Nelson from Florida can kiss his seat goodbye. Should be imprisoned for treason!</comment>

<comment>Majority of states support it, majority of Americans support it, majority in the House, majority in the Senate... "divisive".  That's the Democrat run media for you.</comment>

<comment>We are given to understand, of course, that everyone opposed to bringing multitudes of largely unemployable Middle Eastern migrants here is in thrall to Trump the Ogre.</comment>

<comment>Those who have undergone the vetting process for entry under the refugee program are the least likely to be threat of any immigrant or visitor to this country. The Republicans know very well that is true. Most of them have said they just want to make sure everyone is properly vetted, and in the next breath say they can't imagine how anyone can be absolutely sure there aren't terrorists lined up at the border. It is simple obstruction. They're not saying it's the Muslims, but it's the Muslims.</comment>

<comment>The Left wears out creation lecturing us that not all Middle Eastern Muslims are dangerous, and that it is "unfair" to punish the many for the faults of the few.  Be this as it may, the outrages in Europe would not have occurred, but for Muslim migration.  It is the height of impudence to demand that we tolerate such conduct, for the sake of accommodating the "many."The UN "vetting" program, which I've touched upon below, is a joke.  This is what Obama is relying on.We know exactly what will happen here.  These migrants will group with those who share their language and culture, forming disparate enclaves.  Most will not find the employment necessary to sustain a middle class lifestyle.   The Left, pandering for their votes, will encourage them to see themselves as "victims" of a cold, uncaring, unsharing culture.  Their young men will become resentful and disaffected--low hanging fruit for extremists.What all this boils down to is harvesting the ethnic vote.</comment>

<comment>Hate to burst your bigot bubble, but in this country about 90 percent of the perpetrators of assault and rape are good Christian folk.  It's probably a little lower in Europe as they don't seem to be quite so God bothered.  They're generally not quite as violent either. All refugees entering the US have been and will always be vetted by the United States government. The UN happens to provide assistance and information on request.  You might want to take your deranged One World Government/UN conspiracy rant on over to Alex Jones' infowars</comment>

<comment>Any way you cut it, we will largely be relying on information gleaned from the aspirants for "refugee" status themselves, if their name doesn't turn up on some sort of database.The line of "damage control" you are attempting here is being hooted down even on Democratic Underground.  "See, it's not a Muslim problem, it's just a rape problem."</comment>

<comment>I had lunch today with a guy who was a refugee, as a shild, from Uganda, who made it to the US about 30 years ago. He spent 20 years as a US naval officer and is now studying to be a doctor.Refugees come in all shapes and sizes, good and bad like other people.</comment>

<comment>And what does your friend think of the Muslim youths who were recently banned from a swimming pool in Germany, for shaking their erections at teenage girls?</comment>

<comment>"In his response to Reid’s remarks, McConnell rejected the premise that supporters of harsher screening are driven by hostility. Rather, he said, those Americans simply want to keep their families and communities safe."Safe from jihadis, but not so safe that we shouldn't sell guns to those on the terrorist watch list I guess. Oh,,,,and the lead in your water? Don't worry about it. Budget cuts. Small government. Local control.These people are amazing.</comment>
