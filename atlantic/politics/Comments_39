<comment>It is past time for Scalia to retire.  He is starting to sound like an Internet troll. </comment>

<comment>I thought he'd hit rock bottom when citing Jack Bauer in his defense of torture, but he's somehow gotten even more insane since then.</comment>

<comment>As a law student in the early 90s, I found myself often disagreeing with Scalia, but nevertheless, finding merit in elements of his opinions.  Those elements have become harder and harder to find.  They seem to have been replaced by an awkward bitterness that comes out in weird, pithy attempts at lead balloon humor. Even worse, his personal appearances are starting to border on delusional, reactionary rants - like a senile great-uncle who everyone's afraid will open his mouth at the Thanksgiving dinner table..</comment>

<comment>Scalia is the greatest Christian alive. Look at him use the Bible to support homophobia, misogyny, racism and locking up kids for life.</comment>

<comment>Fine.  Make juvenile lifers eligible for parole once they reach the age of 75.  The state will save money by not being responsible for their medical care.</comment>

<comment>The notion that we sentence children to life in prison without the possibility of parole is sickening, and the fact that there are those willing and eager to defend it is even more so.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter if they changed because they aren't being punished for that, they are being punished for what they DID and that cannot be changed.</comment>

<comment>These are people who are being sentenced for life without the possibility of parole for things they did as children.  Imagine spending seventy years in prison for something you did when you were fifteen.</comment>

<comment>You don't get a life sentence for typical 15 year old stuff.  You get a life sentence for things like murder.</comment>

<comment>Of course not.  That changes nothing of what I wrote.  These are still children.</comment>

<comment>Readers may be interested in flipping through The Lives of Juvenile Lifers, which reveals all manner of depressing-but-predictable statistics about race, socioeconomic background, and history of family abuse among this cohort.  Notably, African-American juveniles who killed a white victim had a 43.4% chance of getting life w/o possibility of parole while white juveniles who killed an African-American victim had but a 3.6% chance of receiving life w/o parole.</comment>

<comment>Remember, this is called "fair" in the United States.</comment>

<comment>'But Scalia sensed more at work. “This whole exercise, this whole distortion of Miller, is just a devious way of eliminating life without parole for juvenile offenders,” he replied.'Devious in an interesting choice of words coming from the man giving this opinion.I have wondered about the legality of life without parole in the first place, considering how irreversible the sentence is. Is giving a person no chance of rehabilitation not cruel and unusual? At least it should be used rarely. I discussed this with my wife, who has a psychology and counseling background. Her opinion is that there are some people who exhibit extreme personality disorders who may never be rehabilitated past a certain age. Statistics show that pedophilia recurrence is higher if the behavior is exhibited later in life. A young person may be curious, but an older person should certainly know the behavior is illegal and immoral. In these cases, I could see the argument, after a certain age, for life without parole. But at the same time, if a court can make that decision now, why can't we trust a parole board to make that decision later, with a lot more information to go on?</comment>

<comment>"The case was brought by Henry Montgomery, a Louisiana inmate who challenged his sentence for the killing of an East Baton Rouge sheriff’s deputy in 1963, when Montgomery was 17 years old. Racial animosity at the time of his trial was so intense, including reported local cross burnings by the resurgent Ku Klux Klan, that the Louisiana Supreme Court voided his original death sentence."OK, but he did kill the cop? Is that what is written between the lines of that paragraph and the piece as a whole? He did in fact kill the cop, right? Does anyone dispute that? Either he killed the cop, and then we can debate whether he should ever get out, or he didn't kill the cop, and then we should figure out how to free him for his wrongful conviction. What do KKK activities at the time have to do with his guilt or innocence? If he killed the officer, has anyone claimed that the KKK was present at the time he killed the officer? No, the point is to raise the specter of a very scary and terrible racist hate group and somehow that is supposed to mitigate his culpability.Again, he either did or did not kill the cop. Unless the KKK was present at the time of the killing or they were holding his family hostage until he killed the cop, the KKK is irrelevant to the discussion other than the obvious point of making some type of emotional/political appeal.Incidentally, I am not offering an opinion about whether or not he should be paroled; I can see both sides. I just bristle when I see the KKK being brought in as some type of ploy when they have no involvement in this case.</comment>

<comment>The KKK thing explained a procedural issue in how the case progressed. It is the reason the courts voided his original death sentence. If that had not happened, he would not be appealing today, because he would have been executed decades ago.It's not a ploy, it's an explanation of how this case even exists. I know the KKK always feels pretty sensationalized, but it's a key point here, not just a rabble-rousing red herring.</comment>

<comment>My understanding there are 26 federal prisoners under the age of 18 in federal custody inside the USA. Cartel hitmen, jihadist.</comment>
