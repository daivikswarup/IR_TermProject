<comment>Doesn't sound like an incredible lifeThe problem with conservative justices is that they believe they need some kind of legal backing to justify their ideology. In an ideal world, that might be true. But equalists clearly don't think this way, they're willing to bend any kind of rule to effect "compassion".So why bother with the smokescreen? Scalia's failings was not going outright nationalist and persecuting leftist ideas with the law as weapon, not excuse.Something to consider for future rightist jurists</comment>

<comment>WHAT??  you are really clueless young man.  You need to take a look at his reasoning to every decision he made as a justice.  It is anchored in the constitution.  He never legislated from the bench, he developed his opinions based solely on his interpretation of the constitution.  You really need to do your research before making uninformed comments.</comment>

<comment>the reason why leftists have any kind of power is because you adhere too strictly to the constitutionThe law should be used as a bludgeon against treasonous elements within the country, not protect them</comment>

<comment>What?  the point of the SC is to interpret the constitution and make legal decisions based on the constitution.  Legislative branch makes laws, within the framework of the constitution, Executive branch enforces laws and the SC makes sure all is within the authorities of the constitution.  Not sure what the point of your reply is?</comment>

<comment>Are you kidding??? Scalia backed state rights or constitutional laws when it suited his catholic, right-wing ideology.</comment>

<comment>And that was precisely the problem. Based on HIS interpretation, without any test in reality. That's the definition of hubris. The results (rampant corruption in government and the financial sector) are evident to anyone with eyes and ears.</comment>

<comment>Are you kidding me? He was a justice on the supreme court.  That was what his responsibility was - to interpret the constitution as the bases for constitutionality of law.  how is that hubris - it was his job.  The liberal judges do the same.  How is that corruption?  It is the job of the SC as part of the checks and balances system of government.  SC interprets law, legislative branch makes the law and the executive branch enforces the law.  Did you miss US government in high school?  You need to grow up young man and travel a bit and work with other countries and governments to understand what corruption is.  Every society has a certain level of corruption but to say it is rampant is utterly ignorant.  Spend some time working with other countries around the world and you will see corruption to a degree that makes the US look like choir boys.</comment>

<comment>Assumptions, assumptions. Brian you've given me the best laugh I've had all day! I'm neither "young", nor a "man" and I've travelled/lived overseas extensively, so you can cut the patronising language ;-)The key phrase, which you evidently missed in your haste to put me in my place, was "without test in reality". Scalia's style - to avoid all reference to legislative history in the belief that judges should interpret the Constitution strictly, according to the original meaning of its language - resulted in ignorant, arrogant and dogmatic decisions that (when tested in reality) had a corrosive effect on our government (of the people by the people for the people) its institutions and society at large. Citizens United and repeal of sections of the Voting Rights Act being the most recent myopic and self-serving examples.As for corruption, I have a big problem with the Koch brothers deciding who our next President is, even if you don't.</comment>

<comment>First, I wasn't trying to put you in your place but it is extremely frustrating to hear disparaging remarks against a man who stayed true to his believe of interpreting the constitution as strictly as he did.  I also disagree with you on what the purpose of the court is.  They are charged with interpreting the constitution which is the document this country is run on.  As for ignorant, arrogant and dogmatic decision I would agree that rowe vs wade is one of those decisions (in my opinion).  However, it was put to the test with the court and it made a ruling which I disagreed with.  It doesn't mean you have to agree with every judgment.Since it is obvious you will not listen to anything I say maybe you will listen to a liberal judge on the court and what she said about this great man.Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is remembering her colleague, Antonin Scalia, as a "treasured friend."Ginsburg said in a statement Sunday although the two justices differed in their interpretation of written texts, they were the same in their "reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.""From our years together at the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the Court and received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation," she said in the statement."Justice Scalia nailed all the weak spots—the 'applesauce' and 'argle bargle'—and gave me just what I needed to strengthen the majority opinion."She called Scalia, who died of an apparent heart attack in Texas, a jurist of "captivating brilliance and wit," adding that he could make even the "most sober judge laugh."With Justice Ginsburg's statement maybe you will see Scalia was well respected across all sectors or do you dislike Justice Ginsburg as well.As for the Koch brothers - I don't believe they had much to do with Obama being elected so not sure what you point is about the Koch brothers.  As a matter of fact they originally supported Scott Walker for the nomination in the republican party for this election cycle.  That worked out well for them didn't it.  I would like to know how they decide who should be president since they haven't done a very good job over the last 8 years and so far struck out in this cycle.  Now they will support the republican nominee whomever it is but how is that deciding who are next president is.One last note - if you have traveled so much then you should be quite aware your comment about corruption in the US is ridiculous.  is there corruption, sure (on both side of the aisle), but not to any extent that it makes a substantial impact on how this country is governed but if you believe that then I guess you will be voting for Donald Trump and if so then we need to have more discussion since that would destroy this country.</comment>

<comment>Also, since you are neither a man or young you just might be my aunt since you sound just like her.  Joan is it you?</comment>

<comment>Ha ha...no thank God! ;-) If anyone's guilty of lecturing Brian, it's you I'm afraid. Hate to let the air out of your balloon, but like most people I'm conservative on some issues, liberal on others. You need to get over this need to pigeonhole people!Is it possible to understand that I'm making a critical analysis of Scalia's decision-making process, not the man himself. If he was the life of the party, good for him. I didn't know the guy. I (we) just have to live with the consequences of his decisions.</comment>

<comment>This is going no where but I understand you are making a critical analysis about Scalia and you have the right to do so.  I actually posted a long comment before I made the Aunt comment but I don't see it.Instead of trying to write it I will just let Justice Ginsburg speak on Justice ScaliaToward the end of the opera Scalia/Ginsburg, tenor Scalia and soprano Ginsburg sing a duet: "We are different, we are one," different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.From our years together at the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the Court and received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation.Justice Scalia nailed all the weak spots — the "applesauce" and "argle bargle"—and gave me just what I needed to strengthen the majority opinion. He was a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh.The press referred to his "energetic fervor," "astringent intellect," "peppery prose," "acumen," and "affability," all apt descriptions. He was eminently quotable, his pungent opinions so clearly stated that his words never slipped from the reader's grasp.Justice Scalia once described as the peak of his days on the bench an evening at the Opera Ball when he joined two Washington National Opera tenors at the piano for a medley of songs. He called it the famous Three Tenors performance.He was, indeed, a magnificent performer. It was my great good fortune to have known him as working colleague and treasured friend.Bottom line - a great woman speaking about a great woman and the respect she had for him.  I wish others would have the same ability to recognize a great man who served this country with honor and distinction even though they disagree with his decisions.  Justice Ginsburg is a great woman who serves this country with honor and distinction even though I disagree with most of her decisions.</comment>

<comment>So either you're a, "transnationalist" or a "world class traveler". Skimming the cream off the world with others like you of perhaps different hues while not really going deep into other cultures.If strict construction had been followed in Scott v Sandford the case would have not been able to reach the conclusion that it did. For the court upon finding Dred Scott was not a U.S. citizen should have thrown out the rest of the case. Instead they took it upon themselves to partake of judicial activism in order to put to rest issues of slavery thinking they would make the matter judicial rather than political.Which in turn lead to the 1857 Panic and the Civil War.  Similar to current events. Four years ago, my quest to return and get my Masters in GIS by building upon my senior thesis that the US will break apart into 9-12 regions was considered absurd. Now I get more of a sad resignation from people when I discuss it. As for me, I am at peace with the inevitability. I just hope it is peaceful. Not to be expected but there is hope. No change just hope.</comment>

<comment>Ya, but she also has facts on her side.</comment>

<comment>Hey, Mr. Fusion!  Been looking for you!!  I'm inviting you to join a channel of The Atlantic that is filled with substantive and respectful dialogue.https://disqus.com/home/channel/theatl...</comment>

<comment>Hhmmm, thanks.</comment>

<comment>What facts?  She has stated no fact in her argument.  Fact is every judicial expert will state that Justice Scalia did root all of his decisions and opinions on the constitution and his interpretation of it.  Even liberal judges agree and respected Justice Scalia.  You may not agree with his opinions but that is irrelevant since if was his job to interprete the mean based on it original intent.  He did this better than most.  He never attempted to legislate from the bench as other do, he was a strict constitutionalist and that is all any should expect from a justice.</comment>

<comment>You may want to google "The Incoherence of Antonin Scalia," written by the not-at-all-liberal 7th Circuit Justice RIchard Posner a few years ago.</comment>

<comment>When you work with someone for 10,15, or 20 years; you do get some familiarity with them. Often that closeness morphs into close friendship. It does force you to respect the person, especially when one is as intelligent as Supreme Court Justices are and at the top of their profession.I know Scalia solely from his decisions. I have no idea of what his "off the bench" persona is like. Maybe he was able to totally disassociate himself from the bench when he was social.  Maybe his penchant for fine scotch / delicately smoked salmon / old Woody Allen movies was shared by others on the bench and in his life.I still disagree with many of his decisions.</comment>

<comment>And you have every right to disagree with his decisions as I disagree with others on the bench but I respect everyone of them for their dedication to service and diligence in defending what they believe the constitution allows the government to do or not do and to make decisions based on cases that are elevated to the SC.  (wow, that is one run-on sentence).Here is the statements made by Justice Ginsburg who is a liberal judge on the court.  As you will see in her comments as an example that liberals respected Scalia even when they disagreed on issues.Toward the end of the opera Scalia/Ginsburg, tenor Scalia and soprano Ginsburg sing a duet: "We are different, we are one," different in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence for the Constitution and the institution we serve.From our years together at the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the Court and received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial circulation.Justice Scalia nailed all the weak spots — the "applesauce" and "argle bargle"—and gave me just what I needed to strengthen the majority opinion. He was a jurist of captivating brilliance and wit, with a rare talent to make even the most sober judge laugh.The press referred to his "energetic fervor," "astringent intellect," "peppery prose," "acumen," and "affability," all apt descriptions. He was eminently quotable, his pungent opinions so clearly stated that his words never slipped from the reader's grasp.Justice Scalia once described as the peak of his days on the bench an evening at the Opera Ball when he joined two Washington National Opera tenors at the piano for a medley of songs. He called it the famous Three Tenors performance.He was, indeed, a magnificent performer. It was my great good fortune to have known him as working colleague and treasured friend.Seems it had more to do with his capabilities then his "off the bench" persona was like even though that is important as well.  Ginsburg is a class act, even though I disagree with here often.  Maybe liberals on this message board should take a lesson from this great woman as she speaks about the great man Scalia was.  Of course that will never happen since Anger and hate is all that matters to them.  It is sad for them that they carry so much anger with them everyday.  There are great people in government on both sides of the aisle and 99% do what they do for the betterment of the country.  Unfortunately people don't see that from either side. The Donald Trump rise to front runner is the best example from the conservative side.  Have a wonderful day Mr. Fusion, you seem reasonable, but I hope the quote from Justice Ginsburg gives you some pause on your comment and you realize that Justice Scalia was well RESPECTED and liked on both sides of the aisle.</comment>

<comment>He was a bigot himself</comment>

<comment>Scalia's epitaph should read, "He couldn't see the forest for the trees." An originalist who paid so much attention to the meanings of words, he lost sight of the intent of the sentences. The smallness of his thinking was masked by his arrogance and the prestige of his office.  Examples in his own words that demonstrate just how limited his mind really was:"Mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a death sentence properly reached.""Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.""The body of scientific evidence supporting creation science is as strong as that supporting evolution. In fact, it may be stronger.... The evidence for evolution is far less compelling than we have been led to believe. Evolution is not a scientific fact, since it cannot actually be observed in a laboratory. Rather, evolution is merely a scientific theory or guess.... It is a very bad guess at that. The scientific problems with evolution are so serious that it could accurately be termed a myth.""This is an execution, not surgery. Where does that come from, that you must find the method of execution that causes the least pain?""I think the main fight is to dissuade Americans from what the secularists are trying to persuade them to be true: that the separation of church and state means that the government cannot favor religion over nonreligion."</comment>

<comment>Now they just favor Muslims and import brigades of them.</comment>

<comment>Who is "they" and what the hell does this mean???</comment>

<comment>It means trolls care less about the ends than the means.</comment>

<comment>That's why we set up this new community Boomergal told you about.</comment>

<comment>   What's especially galling is this misimpression that Scalia was, regardless of his dyspeptic judicial orientation, a masterful legal opinion author, and careful scrutinizer (and user) of word.If the apparent quote from the Dover dissent ("...creation science...") is any indication, Scalia is situated among the stupidest humans (not just jurists) in all of history.  In this cite, every phrase and every word is wrongly applied and just plain wrong.  It's a hot mess of fabrications and delusions that can only be used in a therapy session to justify upping ones lithium prescription.Anyway, it's hard to believe these things could have been said in a conversation among drunken fools, let alone originate from written legal opinion of the highest court in the land.One can only hope you that you, T_Rat, are making these quotes up, but sadly, you aren't. </comment>

<comment>Regarding: creation science http://www.belcherfoundation.o...The quote is from his dissent Edwards vs. Aguillard, even though he put himself at the sidelines by prefacing "I by no means intend to endorse its accuracy" he still used this and other Senator Keith statements to bolster his case and dissent.Regarding: death sentenceAttributed to Herrera v. Collins    http://news.lawreader.com/2008...And what else he said there includes: "There is no basis in text, tradition, or even in contemporary practice (if that were enough), for finding in the Constitution a right to demand judicial consideration of newly discovered evidence of innocence brought forward after conviction.”Google facilitates corroboration for those who are willing to do the work (of typing out a few words in a browser window) for the rest of the quotes.So I agree that  that Scalia was not the masterful legal opinion author he is considered to be.  The quotes show that he was obsessed with word meaning and blind to intent.</comment>

<comment>You win the Internet today, T_Rat, for lifting the veil in this postmortem flurry of Scalia remembrance.  I'm not all that thrilled in offering you the medal, since I'm so appalled and disgusted by the nature of things you most appropriately offer, the kinds of things which citizens should know about malign elites, otherwise celebrated with unreflective adulation.I do offer one corrective or clarification to what you've said.  Regarding your suggestion that Scalia had an obsession with the meaning of words, I must say that he, in reality, often had an obsession with giving his own meaning to words, coining, literally, new meanings.  For example, he is plainly wrong in how he addresses and applies the terms "scientific theory."  He imbues "scientific theory" with a sense and meaning of fanciful delusion, as opposed to its accepted meaning and use in the scientific community of being a systematic and rational explanation of a body of carefully gathered observations.*Seriously, Scalia was an ignorant SOB. And that's all he was, and now that he's assumed room temperature, we have a much improved Scalia.*String Theory involves a notable exception in the proper use of the term theory.  Those in even the theoretical physics community know this and would concede the more appropriate terms would be "String Hypothesis."</comment>

<comment>Correction.  Dover case didn't make the Supreme Court thankfully.  </comment>

<comment>Thanks for that. Made my morning. I came to the conclusion decades ago "originalist"was just a fig leaf for  "we want wealthy white men to berestored to their position of unquestioned preeminence in all matters social economic and legal"...</comment>

<comment>that was an idiotic conclusion, did you educate yourself on it?</comment>

<comment>This guy will never be dead enough, if there was a hell Scalia would be chairman of the board.</comment>

<comment>As if you should be the judge as to who deserves to go to heaven and who deserves to be in hell?</comment>

<comment>There is no heaven or hell. Scalia will simply rot in the ground, like the rest of us.</comment>

<comment>His body will.  The rest is negative energy.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, no daisies growing on that grave.</comment>

<comment>He made the world an ugly place with his embrace of mans  twin evils racism and belief.</comment>

<comment>What did he do to make you so bitter?</comment>

<comment>Heller for one. Lawrence v Texas and DOMA for another.</comment>

<comment>You celebrate his death for making a decision striking down a law that rendered guns in the home useless as far as self-defense goes, for saying that a state is allowed to regulate sex (a case which he lost), and and for saying that the federal government is allowed to define marriage for itself (another case which he lost)? Can't you at least try to perceive the humanity in people you disagree with, or are you filled with the same myopic hatred for anyone who's a few years behind the times that's overtaken the left nowadays? (For the record, I think that the decisions striking down DOMA and sodomy laws were the right ones, but dissenting doesn't make you evil.)</comment>

<comment>He made "owning" a gun a right.</comment>

<comment>Celebrate his death? I celebrate that he is no longer on the bench. It would not make any difference if he had retired.</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic is hosting a party.  Please stay tuned for details.</comment>

<comment>LOL!!!  Good one!</comment>

<comment>Oh show us how tolerant you are! swoon!</comment>

<comment>I'm wholly intolerant of greaseball swine.</comment>

<comment>Yet, somehow a Supreme Court justice that doesn't care if an innocent man is executed is a commendable person. You know, the form is more important than a man's life.Or using an example of two men that deserved to be executed. It was a heinous crime and nothing could be too cruel in their death. Only, it turned out that they were innocent.If that makes liberals NASTY, then what is Scalia? Or you?</comment>

<comment>Do you ever proof-read your comments for content and meaning? Ever?</comment>

<comment>Scalia himself was intolerant and nasty and he said said that he didn't care to be evaluated as nasty and intolerant</comment>

<comment>And I am happy to oblige.</comment>

<comment>Scalia got constitutional originalism all wrong: the key phrase is 'in order to form a more perfect union.' That's an ongoing project, with meanings that change with time. The Founders recognized that. Pity that the atavistic Scalia never did.</comment>

<comment>Scalia recognized that is not one clear arch toward the future.  Societal attitudes can move over time but there is not a clear path that they are following.you and I might disagree with what makes the Union more perfect, Scalia believed that unelected judges should not be the ones deciding what would make the union more perfect, that aught to be left to the people and their representatives.</comment>

<comment>I agree with the spirit of your argument. But at crucial points, Justice Scalia displayed judicial activism as well as obstructionism. Best example of the former is the Heller v DC decision. The latter is displayed in Lawrence vs Texas where the Equal Protection Clause continued to mean different things to different Judges.I agree that MAKING laws from the bench is bad. That's why we have Congress or if need be Constitutional Conventions. But I do believe the common good is important before all else in the eyes of the Founders. The aforementioned Equal Protection Clause, and how its scope has changed over the years, shows that.</comment>

<comment>take Lawrence on equal protection, this should have been easy, did the prohibited activity apply to all people equally? If the answer is yes, you move on from equal protection.Shoving more and more things into equal protection removes people from the arch of their own history.  Gay marriage is legal everywhere only because Justice Kennedy likes the idea. That is no working democracy.</comment>

<comment>How was Heller "activism?" DC had a de facto total ban on a basic civil right. </comment>

<comment>I agree with you in part. But the mechanism to move that forward is to make changes to the constitution as prescribed by the constitution. It best to avoid reinterpreting the document and better to simply change it.</comment>

<comment>It would be wrong to rejoice in the man's death. Let him rest in peace. It would be foolish not to celebrate the fact that he is not on the SCOTUS anymore.This, after all, is the man who said that it was okay to execute an innocent man as long as due process had been followed.</comment>

<comment>That hunting trip with Cheney should have disqualified and removed him from the bench a long time ago.</comment>

<comment>Wow, there's a dumb comment.Is your opposition based on the activity or just having friends that are in politics?Is it OK for Elena Kagan to accompany Hillary to a WNBA basketball game?</comment>

<comment>One of the most gifted men to ever use the English language. An intellectual giant who was -most probably- murdered. Rest in Peace, justice Scalia. You're an amazing individual. Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Ah Mr. Trump. Like Nixon, you never let me down. Selah.</comment>

<comment>Murdered? In Texas? On a ranch?Cant wait to hear this conspiracy theory. It will be YUUUUUUGGE!!</comment>

<comment>I've been waiting for this!</comment>

<comment>Wait, where was Dick Cheney when this all went down?  Maybe Scalia was shot on the side of the head by accident.</comment>

<comment>Isn't he a loser, and don't you like people who didn't die?</comment>

<comment>Unsurprisingly, liberal slime balls are celebrating the death of a man more intelligent than they could ever hope to be. But they support Bernie Sanders, who cannot even do math. Lol. Silly children. Trump 2016 </comment>

<comment>Pull your fly up. Your face is showing.</comment>

<comment>**snicker**</comment>

<comment>I'd dance on rooftops if Trump were to die today.</comment>

<comment>In his victory lap in New Hampshire and last night he sure looked and sounded like he is approaching vapor lock.</comment>

<comment>Crossing my fingers. Two aholes gone in a week, one can hope.</comment>

<comment>You're not alone there!.</comment>

<comment>Mainly because you're a scumbag.</comment>

<comment>Because Trump is. </comment>

<comment>The oringinalist philosophy doesn't make sense. The Constitution was ratified in 1788. It is unrealistic to think that the Founding Fathers could have been prescient enough to anticipate how society, environment, and science would change over the history of the country. It has to be a document that is open to interpretation. </comment>

<comment>I realize it's hard for someone like you to think that. And that's fine. But for actual people, with actual intelligence, it's less difficult. </comment>

<comment>True that. Actual people with actual intelligence do see Scalia as someone that couldn't see the forest for the trees. Partisan morons can only see "their guy" and automatically fall in line.</comment>

<comment>All I need to do to respond to that is laugh. You're taking liberal failures of misunderstanding and projecting them. </comment>

<comment>Then laugh. The damage that Scalia did to our jurisprudence wasn't funny.</comment>

<comment>I watched a debate last night where a certain "Donald J. Trump" failed in an astounding manner. Is that you, Donald, now twittering on the Atlantic blog?</comment>

<comment>I have won every debate thus far. Thank you for asking though. </comment>

<comment>You sure "won" the one last night, especially on the issues. Hehe.</comment>

<comment>Sure!.</comment>

<comment>My fault. I thought you were interested in discussing the debate. </comment>

<comment>Trump is a shallow whiny bihtch. It was on full display last night.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who identifies with Trump could hardly be called a deep thinker. </comment>

<comment>True. But the other choice is National Socialist Bernie. ;)</comment>

<comment>Much better choice, and it is not "National Socialist". It is your attempt to imply Nazism, when, in fact, Trump is much more philosophically aligned with Hitler. </comment>

<comment>Not at all true, considering that's what Bernie majored in. ;)</comment>

<comment>"It has to be a document that is open to interpretation."Obviously not to today's Tealiban regressivists.</comment>

<comment>The core element of Scalias philosophy, and this is often lost on people, is that the Constitution was the document the framers ratified, and we all agree to at birth, because it is our governing document.The framers made sure there was a mechanism to amend it over time to adapt to changing circumstances, or to scrap it completely and create a whole new Constitution if necessary.So why give justices all the governing power? And that was what he was about - not letting the court govern, but putting the pressure of governing on the people. Make them use the democratic process to shape the world they live in.Scalia was human, and thus capable of making the same mistakes as any other human. I believe he also knew that his approach to the Constitution would benefit the conservative movement in the short term. But that isn't, in my opinion, why he took the approach he did. And I agree with his approach.</comment>

<comment>He was intentionally hacking the court and pumping intolerant dogma</comment>

<comment>It's a by product of believing in religion, and literal interpretation and execution of thousands of years old texts </comment>

<comment>So it should never have been amended? If the Constitution is too weak to be amended then it is pretty worthless. I happen to believe that our nation is stronger than that. </comment>

<comment>no one is arguing against amendment, why does this keep coming up.  The Amendment process is laid out in the document, if you want to change it, follow the process.</comment>

<comment>I was responding to "restore America", who at least implied that the Constitution, as written can not be changed or our entire nation will collapse. That is complete nonsense. </comment>

<comment>your original point still doesn't make sense.  The document can be changed, but by opening it up to interpretation, it can become meaningless.  not the intention.</comment>

<comment>Then why do courts exist, if not to interpret the Constitution and laws derived from it?</comment>

<comment>to understand and apply the law to the case in front of them.</comment>

<comment>OK and to interpret whether or not a law is constitutional. </comment>

<comment>For SCOTUS, that is the law that they are understanding and applying</comment>

<comment>"It has to be a document that is open to interpretation."Otherwise, 'freedom of speech' only applies to handwritten documents and the spoken word, and the government has the freedom to censor your email</comment>

<comment>The reverse actually. You have to read or straight up create things out of whole cloth to justify 1st Amendment not meaning exactly what it says. Just like those who claim the 2nd only applies to muskets.</comment>

<comment>Do you? In the middle of the 19th century, someone could have easily made an argument that the dots and dashes of the telegraph could hardly be considered 'speech'.</comment>

<comment>How? It transmitted information and coded language predated Independence. Visual telegraphs connected the Admiralty to naval ports in Britain when George Washington was a Provincial regiment captain. Nothing that has developed in communication tech is more than variation on a theme. To claim something in writing or involving isn't speech requires willfull ignorance. </comment>

<comment>"To claim something in writing or involving isn't speech requires willfull ignorance. "No different than the idea that the 14th Amendment only applies to freed slaves, even though it says nothing about slaves.</comment>

<comment>The 14th Amendment was only Freedmen. </comment>

<comment>You realize the left has benefited as much if not more from Citizens United as the right?</comment>

<comment>Politics won, America lost.</comment>

<comment>No liberty won. </comment>

<comment>Liberty isn't unlimited money in politics. You sir are a fool.</comment>

<comment>Actually it is. The laws "limiting" money are always designed to favor  certain parties or groups. Pre-Citizens United unions could have an outsized amount of money in elections when other groups were limited.</comment>

<comment>Actually it isn't. Giving one person the ability to buy an election, isn't Liberty. Do you believe that one day, you too will be a billionaire?</comment>

<comment>http://blogs.reuters.com/great...If that was the case all those anti-gun candidates Bloomberg has poured money to for years should have won handily rather than lose by huge margins. Jeb and Hilary should already have nominations not be losing badly. Money alone gets you nothing in an election.</comment>

<comment>Ok I get it, you find it virtuous to give one person the ability to buy an election. Move along!</comment>

<comment>Except it isn't remotely. Read my link. The criticism of the ruling is absurd. </comment>

<comment>Jackass, Citizen's United was about shutting down a movie that was critical of Hillary Clinton, it was about liberty.</comment>

<comment>Would the "left" you are referring to be the DNC Democrats?</comment>

<comment>The left in general. Citizens United gave power to previously silenced groups. Sanders wouldn't be beating Hilary without it.</comment>

<comment>That's applied logic right there!</comment>

<comment>Most of the groups helping fund Sanders campaign wouldn't exist without Citizens United. The groups that were allowed to donate prior to that like major unions or leftwing big donors like Soros are solidly behind DNC establishment and thus Hilary. </comment>

<comment>Which groups are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>Several academic groups. Bunch of PACs which wouldn't exist without it. </comment>

<comment>Sanders is funded by "PACs"?</comment>

<comment>Every candidate is. They're a basic part of the election process now. Which is a very good. They've broken the monopolies a small number of groups and donors had on both parties. </comment>

<comment>I have no idea what you mean.  Sanders' average donation is thirty four dollars, a veritable miracle of crowd-funding.</comment>

<comment>You just described several PACs. Many of the largest lobbying groups function based upon large numbers of small donations. Pre-Citizens even small amounts could end up being heavily regulated. Usually to keep some political machine in power. Campaign finance laws create rather than prevent corruption and buying elections.</comment>

<comment>Half the world is rolling in perma wars because of it</comment>

<comment>Just for the record, you think it's a good idea that the Government should be able to suppress the advertisement or showing of a movie about a politician who is running for office.I honestly cannot understand how anyone would think that this is a good idea.</comment>

<comment>I don't know what you're referring to, Terry.</comment>

<comment>The Citizen's United decision.  The film was Hillary: the movie.</comment>

<comment>Scalia didn't have the temperament or character to be a Supreme Court Justice. He was more suited to personal injury litigation.</comment>

<comment>Reportedly a member of the arch-reactionary RC organization Opus Dei, I would judge his temperament or character to have been more suited to the Holy Inquisition.</comment>

<comment>I can't bring myself to be mad at the guy.  As much as I loath the long lasting effect he had on our laws, Scalia was following a consistent philosophy that he passionately believed in.</comment>

<comment>We need a true conservative in there to replace him. The liberal justices almost never consider an alternative reading of the constitution, while the conservatives in the court tend to consider other views.

<comment>I'm sure President Obama will nominate a truly qualified candidate in "due time", one who was confirmed to the current post he or she holds as an Appellate Court Judge, one who was confirmed by the current Senate unanimously within the last two years. Then......let the Senate block this candidate. You realize this is not just a Presidential Election? Last time I checked there were 24 republican Senate seats up for grabs. Imho, given that scenario, we may end up not only with a democratic President, but also with a democratic Senate majority. Get out the pop corn, the show will be entertaining.</comment>

<comment>Sri Srinivasan is the name I'm seeing the most.  He's considered a non-partisan, though liberal leaning.  This is not a Presidential election as you pointed out, but Obama is playing political games just like the GOP by most likely selecting a moderate so as to claim that the Repubs are just interfering and therefore to push the presidential election one way or the other.My point has nothing to do with this however, so you've missed my point.  Voters will punish one party or the other either way.  My concern is that having a more balanced SC is important as it lives and evolves through each congress and president.  I don't want more liberal group think as the current set of liberal justices currently display.</comment>

<comment>This post is too smart for the person you responded to.Sorry. You're wasting your time.</comment>

<comment>Well, the wannabe Donald is back. Has it ever occurred to you that "Donald J. Trump" could have proven just last night that he is suffering from electyle dysfunction? And there is no tadalafil-like medication to cure it.</comment>

<comment>You probably thought that was clever, huh?</comment>

<comment>Well, incidentally, I did. Have a problem with it?</comment>

<comment>Well, turns out I didn't miss your point at all. Besides Srinivasan there are a host of possibilities that the Senate will have a hard time rejecting. I totally agree that every single Justice on the SCOTUS should be somewhere in the moderate range of the judicial branch, no matter who appoints them.I will point out again, though, that the replacement of Scalia poses a severe threat to the Republicans, given the rhetoric coming out so far indicating once again the mentality to block everything this President does.</comment>

<comment>The president is a hyper-partisan hack. So that won't happen.</comment>

<comment>ooohhh you are so edgy and controversial</comment>

<comment>thank you</comment>

<comment>You are despicable.</comment>

<comment>Easy to see why is it now so impossible to support anyone from the modern hate movement that defines Leftist politics today.  Actively cheering and seeking death of people over a difference of opinion?  Very strong following of people such as Hitler and Stalin!No wonder over 20 million weapons are now sold every year in the US.  People are preparing for their own preservation against a totalitarian hate movement.  These people are wise and right to be prepared.</comment>

<comment>cheering, yes.Seeking death? Not in your dreams you stupid Regressive.</comment>

<comment>Your comment about Justice Thomas?  Not only seeking death, but blatantly racist!  Very Leftist of you!</comment>

<comment>Me saying I hope Thomas is next is not "seeking death" you silly Regressive.And how am I racist?</comment>

<comment>I would say seeking to take the world back to the totalitarianism of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, etc. is the true regression.  Embrace individual rights and quit calling for death like your heroes.</comment>

<comment>Then you have nothing to worry about. Seeking that people are free to live their lives and keep their rights is nothing comparable to what Hitler or Stalin did.But then again you are the type of person who wants to take away people's rights to begin with.</comment>

<comment>I am the embodiment of free choice and individual rights.  You live your life as you choose and I will make the choice to live my life by my choices.  It is the hate-based Left seeking to eliminate any choice beyond half of the citizens choosing to reproduce or not.  You keep your choices off of my body and I will respect you in the same way.  Send henchmen to my home to enforce your will and expect retribution in a highly effective and permanent manner.</comment>

<comment>"    It is the hate-based Left seeking to eliminate any choice beyond half of the citizens choosing to reproduce or not."Wtf are you even talking about? What does the Left have to do with people reproducing?</comment>

<comment>OMG!!  The Left refused to consolidate the victory of Roe vs. Wade and expand it to all citizens.  Therefore, until that expansion occurs, it is NOT a Constitutional right since no Constitutional Right can only apply to some citizens.  It is currently in violation of the 14th Amendment and no one on the Left has made any attempt to fix this problem.</comment>

<comment>"The Left refused to consolidate the victory of Roe vs. Wade and expand it to all citizens."What are you talking about? The victory of Roe vs. Wade applies to everyone already.", it is NOT a Constitutional right since no Constitutional Right can only apply to some citizens."Yet the right to privacy under the Due Process Clause extends to a woman's decision to have an abortion applies to all citizens."It is currently in violation of the 14th Amendment and no one on the Left has made any attempt to fix this problem."Thats because there is nothing to fix. You are delusional. The right to have an abortion applies to everyone. What do you want the Left to do about it? And why are you demanding that the Right do anything about it?</comment>

<comment>Because it was the Left who abandoned their principles on this issue as well as the imposition on Draft registration for men only.  Those two events destroyed support for the ERA because, suddenly, the Leftist reformers had no further interest in equality.  The Roe v. Wade issue is pretty clear; woman can impose their choice upon men.  This is a fundamental violation of equality.  If a woman can abort, than men must be provided with an equivalent decision within the bounds of biology.  Women would still retain the ultimate decision, but men could choose to not participate early in the pregnancy.  If the woman can choose to place the baby for adoption, then the man should have the same choice.  This is not difficult to understand.</comment>

<comment>"Because it was the Left who abandoned their principles on this issue as well as the imposition on Draft registration for men only."Now we are talking about the Draft? Man you really are psychotic."If a woman can abort, than men must be provided with an equivalent decision within the bounds of biology."Well perhaps you should start working on changing human DNA so that men can start getting pregnant. Perhaps you can team up with Harry Potter or perhaps Captain Kirk to help you with that one.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for confirming your hard Left hate status.  Please keep posting your anti-equality rants.</comment>

<comment>Really?</comment>

<comment>Yes, really.  Problem?</comment>

<comment>Quintessential Leftist.Actively hateful.</comment>

<comment>That's pretty disgusting of you to say.</comment>

<comment>My thoughts exactly </comment>

<comment>America has lost a treasure and a defender of the Constitution during a time when it is under attack by those who wish to "transform" America into something it is not.We need people on the Supreme Court who respect and understand the Constitution.  We need people on the Court who understand their role is to make decisions based on Constitutional law, not based on feelings or what is politically trendy at the moment.Sadly, we do not have a president who understands this.</comment>

<comment>defender of the constitution? lmaoIn his dissent about obergefell he basically supported the act of "the will of the people" redefining what marriage is. IE: The majority vote then deciding that the minority no longer has a right to marriage.Which is against what the Constitution stands for.</comment>

<comment>He properly understand that it is not the role of the Court to redefine marriage.</comment>

<comment>exactly. Which is why the Regressive Rights attempt to redefine marriage has been found to be unconstitutional every single time they've tried to redefine it.DOMA, Prop 8, all unconstitutional attempts to redefine marriage.</comment>

<comment>^Leftist mental gymnastics assigning DOMA, passed by Bill Clinton, to the Right. lol</comment>

<comment>Just cause it was signed by Bill Clinton doesn't mean a damn thing. He was the guy in the office at the time.The better question is who started the whole DOMA, redefining marriage, movement to begin with?</comment>

<comment>Clinton. When it was passed under his watch.Please stop with your nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Clinton did not create DOMA you idiot. He just signed it.Who created it to begin with?</comment>

<comment>Clinton. When he signed it. Literally created it. Moron.</comment>

<comment>He did not create DOMA you idiot.Who started the whole ball rolling on DOMA to begin with? Someone had conceive the idea, write it down on paper, introduce it to legislation, and a hundred more steps before it ended up on Clinton's desk.So who started it?</comment>

<comment>Clinton. When he signed it. Got the whole thing rolling.Thanks for playing, moron.</comment>

<comment>Still nope you idiot.Someone had to conceive the idea, write it down, introduce it to legislation, and a hundred more steps before it ended up on Clinton's desk.So who started it?</comment>

<comment>Clinton When he signed it.Moron.</comment>

<comment>before he signed it moron.Who came up with the idea, wrote it down, and introduced it to legislation?</comment>

<comment>But Clinton signed it. SO he owns it.The end.</comment>

<comment>Bob Barr, Don Nickles, and The House Judiciary Committee"and honor a collective moral judgement and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality"I see stupid Regressives, even back then, were trying to legislate morality.You guys never learn.</comment>

<comment>I see you are taking your cues from Trump and name calling. Tsk tsk</comment>

<comment>Government attempts to control "marriage" is a fundamental violation of the Freedom of Association.  It can only be defined by those participating in their own marriage.  Period.  Remove it from governmental interference, be it tax law, social security, or anything else.</comment>

<comment>"  It can only be defined by those participating in their own marriage."Exactly.Which is why things like DOMA and Prop 8 failed. Because those were attempts to try and define what marriage is for other people.</comment>

<comment>NO!  They failed because it is a fundamental right of Free Association.  You do not get to vote on another person's fundamental right!  The marriage "license" laws were created in an effort to control the private activity of other people; especially inter-racial marriage.   There is absolutely no reason for such a thing as a marriage license. They are, by definition, government supremacy efforts at controlling others, just as the current "Left" is absolutely known  to do.</comment>

<comment>"They failed because it is a fundamental right of Free Association."Exactly they tried to define what marriage is for other people, which isn't their business to begin with."You do not get to vote on another person's fundamental right!"Tell that to them, they are the ones who don't get it" They are, by definition, government supremacy efforts at controlling others, just as the current "Left" is absolutely known  to do."Right psycho, just like the "left" is stopping people from procreating as well</comment>

<comment>what about bigamy and incest?</comment>

<comment>Don't need a license for either of those.</comment>

<comment>It is unconstitutional to discriminate based on a variety of factors. The court didn't redefine anything. It prevented discrimination. Where in the constitution is marriage defined?</comment>

<comment>What "discrimination"?</comment>

<comment>What a revelation on your part!</comment>

<comment>The discrimination of not allowing people who love each other, to marry? Should we have separate drinking fountains and restrooms for "the gays"? Where again is marriage defined in the constitution? </comment>

<comment>Who the hell was stopping people from loving "each other"?   Please try to get a grip on reality.</comment>

<comment>Scalia's point would be that if the Constitution covered "The discrimination of not allowing people who love each other, to marry"Then the Constitution must force the recognition of marriages of sibling, parent to children, multiple marriages and any group of people who 'Love' each other.try again, you loose</comment>

<comment>I get it, you are for discrimination, move along.</comment>

<comment>You need to understand where your mushy thinking leads.   My guess is that your opponents will never refer to you as brilliant. </comment>

<comment>He was a genius.</comment>

<comment>The president understands and appreciates the Constitution more than any of the current candidates.  Trump is blatantly hostile: "'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.”</comment>

<comment>^Nonsensical jibber-jabber</comment>

But for those who are violent, a danger to themselves or others, we need to get them off the street before they can terrorize our communities. This is just common sense."</comment>

<comment>Cited indictment stands</comment>

<comment>Oh?Here's just a small sampling of Obama's "understanding" of the Constitution:Between January 2012 and June 2013, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the Justice Department’s extreme positions 9 times. The cases ranged from criminal procedure to property rights, religious liberty to immigration, securities regulation to tax law. They had nothing in common other than the government’s view that federal power is virtually unlimited. As a comparison, in the entire Bush and Clinton presidencies, the government suffered 15 and 23 unanimous rulings, respectively.Political profiling by the IRS. After seeing a rise in the number of applications for tax-exempt status, the IRS in 2010 compiled a “be on the lookout” (“BOLO”) list to identify organizations engaged in political activities. The list included words such as “Tea Party,” “Patriots,” and “Israel”; subjects such as government spending, debt, or taxes; and activities such as criticizing the government, educating about the Constitution, or challenging Obamacare. The targeting continued through May of this year.http://www.forbes.com/sites/re...</comment>

<comment>Obama criticized the IRS for their political profiling.  Actually I think he was generally good on the Constitution, like when he told college kids that they can stand a little criticism, and when he said to Muslims that they must accept freedom of religion.  But his staff wasn't as good.  E.g. Loretta Lynch and her comments about 'hate speech'.  Even Obama knows that's bs.</comment>

<comment>Right what did he do about it? Who got fired? Who went to jail?</comment>

<comment>How Obama trashes the Constitution:Violating religious freedom. Mr. Obama’s Department of Health and Human Services ignored the First Amendment by issuing a Soviet-style order to Catholic and other faith-based institutions to violate their beliefs and provide insurance covering abortifacients, contraceptives and sterilizations.Appointing agency “czars” without Senate approval. Article II, Section 2, gives the president the power to appoint ambassadors, judges and top agency officials, but only with the “Advice and Consent of the Senate.” Mr. Obama has appointed, without Senate approval, more than two dozen “czars” in federal agencies.Making illegal recess appointments. Article II, Section 2 allows the President to “fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.” While the Senate was in session, Mr. Obama made recess appointments of Richard Cordray to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and three members of the National Labor Relations Board. http://townhall.com/columnists...</comment>

<comment>Your religious freedom stops at discrimination</comment>

<comment>Obviously very hard to impossible for some to understand.</comment>

<comment>Who was it who said 'There is no greater threat to the freedom of your religion, than 'freedom of religion'?</comment>

<comment>An idiot.  There is no greater threat to free expression than the secular caliphate - e.g. Communism, Nazism, and now French 'laicite'.</comment>

<comment>What discrimination?  Such as the federal government forcing people to go against their faith or freedom of conscience?</comment>

<comment>Anyway my point is that all the candidates are worse.  If Cruz gets into power then he will stage an Islamic attack and immediately rescind the entire Bill of Rights.  Marcobot will do exactly as his Cuban handlers programmed him.</comment>

<comment>No, he didn't. He ordered public employees to follow the law.  That is in no way a breach of "the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech".  It is simply a term of employment.  Any religious nut was free to take alternative employment. Your employer can stipulate all sorts of rules on you beyond what the law states if you agree to that contract, or you can hit the road, Jack.The federal government also bans it's employees from smoking marijuana at work, and that is a far clearer breach of the religious rights of Rastafarians.This cartoon on Free Speech should be added into your constitution to explain it better.</comment>

<comment>Classy...</comment>

<comment>Write 'fundamentalist' instead of 'originalist' and see how it looks.</comment>

<comment>As a liberal I disagreed vehemently with a lot of what Scalia thought and stood for, but reading some of the comments on this thread left me mortified. I'm not happy to hear an honest (if often misguided and pig-headed) man died. Best wishes to all of Scalia's family and friends.</comment>

<comment>Honest? The man went hunting with the V-P when a case against the V-P was before the court.</comment>

<comment>You can't have a 10,000 page Constitution covering every issue, nor can you see the future, the Constitution has to be flexible enough to deal with those realities. Is that living? IDK but it can't be stiff and dead.</comment>

<comment>But it can be limited. It is supposed to be limited.People are living. We should have the liberty to cover every unmentioned issue, be flexible enough to deal with certain realities, and progress into the future.(See the 9th Amendment.)</comment>

<comment>Right, as it should be, but the framers never considered 'digital goods' and stealing them is not the same as stealing a regular phyical thing, but it is still stealing.</comment>

<comment>That's why we can amend to compensate for such changes.</comment>

<comment>I bet Democrats are celebrating. Scalia was a RWNJ tool.Best case scenario is Obama or the next Democrat president gets to replace Scalia  with a Liberal justice.Worst case scenario is a Republican president gets to replace Scalia with another "conservative", and nothing changes. But if a Republican becomes President, it is very unlikely that a Justice as RWNJ as Scalia will be his replacement.Democrats can't lose. </comment>

<comment>The so called "originalist" was libertine when it came to the 2nd.</comment>

<comment>The fact the "originalism" (i.e., what was actually written, and what was actually intended is what is considered the actual meaning) was ever not respectable or is still a minority position is bonkers.And the fact that any serious legal scholars or practitioners consider the Constitution a "living document" (i.e., the reader gets to interpret it to mean whatever they want) is just as bonkers.</comment>

<comment>So you want to shoehorn 21th Century America into an 18th Century way of thinking?</comment>

<comment>How is the way of thinking different? If the way of thinking is really different what amendments show for that? Or do you prefer to bypass the amendment process?If a Justice calls the Constitution "living" why can't citizens call the laws living?There is an 35 MPH speed limit sign near me that is 90s thinking (that is when it was put up). I consider that number living and now I have a faster car than the typical 90s cars.</comment>

<comment>Well the Framers didn't like the idea of large standing armies, do you want to disband the military in peacetime?</comment>

<comment>That is from left field.If we don't like what was written, what the meaning is, what the intention is, we can amend all we want. There is a process for that. But we can't just make up living meanings. The Justices that do that are the height of arrogance and the height of tyranny. The law schools that promote such deconstruction are at the height of treason.If you don't like the process put up by the Founders or any of their foundational ideas, then you can amass a military and found your own country.</comment>

<comment>A 'living' Constitution to me means you apply the general vague principles outlined in the Constitution, to new situations that are similar. The basic thought process remains consistent, not that you 'make up' things that have no basis in the texts.</comment>

<comment>That puts a lot of power in those interpreting the new situations, and the way such an approach tends to play out is that new things are made up. New rights are found that are not there. Using the 14th amendment to ban states from recognizing the uniqueness of the male-female union (something entirely universal) is a case in point of where there is no basis in the text or intention of the text.In my example above, the new situation is that cars are faster now. The vague principle is that we should be slow enough for others around us, but everyone is faster now. So if I followed a  loose construction I could interpret the 35 number as living, and freely drive 45.</comment>

<comment>Ok let's use the 14th Amendment as an example, there is NO possible way you can read it and say it ONLY applies to Blacks, at the VERY,VERY least it would apply to ALL races. Asian, Jews(not really a race but). You couldn't possibly say yes the 14th Amendment protects against discrimination against Blacks, but discrimination against Asians is fine. furthermore it's a short leap to include people with disabilities and women in that protection, slightly farther for gays.</comment>

<comment>But the Equal Rights Amendment that would have included women was never passed.Women and Men ARE different. That is a biological fact. Laws should not be forced to ignore this. The 14th Amendment cannot be read to force the law to ignore the reality of human nature. Trying to ram an utterly subjective (and anti-scientific) political agenda like radical gender-indistinguishability is what we get when there is a loose construction/living view of the written document.</comment>

<comment>So you would defend a law that says on a beach that men don't have to wear a shirt and can go bare chested, but a woman has to wear a top? Exactly what does a woman have on her chest that a man does not,  remember a lot of those guys are pretty fat.</comment>

<comment>That is not that bad of a law. It aligns with the male-female distinctions written into our biology and psyche. There are tangible differences between a topless (non-breastfeeding) female and a topless male especially regarding the effect (invasive result) on others around you.</comment>

<comment>Well ISIS would agree with you, Europe...not so much.</comment>

<comment>Is there a Godwin law for ISIS yet?Europe is not that good of example to look up to.</comment>

<comment>Like 'freedom of speech' now extends to all forms of communication, not just handwritten documents and the words that come out of your mouth.Like 'freedom of religion' now includes religions that didn't exist 225 years ago, such as Mormonism.Like how 'We the People' now includes persons who would never have been considered 'people' at the time, and may grow to include others.</comment>

<comment>Considering the coming wave of driverless cars, this may not be the best example for your case</comment>

<comment>Can follow certain legal pontificator's leads and program my driverless car to interpret the speed limit as a "living" number?</comment>

<comment>Considering the better response times and safer driving capabilities of your car and others over you, then that 35 MPH will probably become as important as the $20 limit in the 7A.</comment>

<comment>Scalia wrote some wonderful decisions its true but...  Did he ever truly understand the U.S.A. Constitution?  I dont think so.   He played word games and practiced deciet as any good BAR card member does.  Look at the articles statement:"upholding the federal government’s power to ban marijuana in states where it is medically legal."   Yet nowhere in the Constitution does it delegate any authority to pass legislation applicable to any state, it specifically states where Congress can pass law that apply to the people and it is only in Washington D.C. and the Territorys or on Forts where the feds own the land AND have been ceded exclusive jurisdiction.See the proof here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...So... he requires the Constitutional authority when making some arguments but not on others.  No IRS jurisdiction over people in any state has ever been shown to exist.  Hamilton clearly stated in the Federalist Papers #17 that the states alone had jurisdiction to prosecute criminal and civil matters regarding the people. SO no federal criminal laws apply outside of Washington and the Federal Zone.Next   all government Agents suffer from psychosis and are mentally disturbed when claiming fictional parties have any rights, can sue and be sued, etc. as Corporations and Governments dont exist in nature and are not real and cannot be percieved by ones senses so they are the alter egos of men and women who are BAR cards and its really the BAR cards that express THEIR will in any court and pretend they can "re-present" a fictional thing, that they can never speak with, no understand the wishes of, or execute the intent of the Fiction because....it (Corporation) cant tell you its wishes and express its rights so the Attorney is a fraud saying he re-presents something that does not exist.</comment>

<comment>Yet nowhere in the Constitution does it delegate any authority to pass legislation applicable to any stateNot true. There have been many decisions upholding the supremacy clause. see Art. IV, Sec. 2  it specifically states where Congress can pass law that apply to the people and it is only in Washington D.C. and the Territorys or on Forts where the feds own the land AND have been ceded exclusive jurisdiction.Wrong. Pants on Fire wrong.http://www.politifact.com/pund...Next   all government Agents suffer from psychosis and are mentally disturbed when claiming fictional parties have any rights, can sue and be sued, etc. as Corporations and Governments dont exist in nature and are not real and cannot be percieved by ones senses so they are the alter egos of men and women who are BAR cards and its really the BAR cards that express THEIR will in any court and pretend they can "re-present" a fictional thing, that they can never speak with, no understand the wishes of, or execute the intent of the Fiction because....it (Corporation) cant tell you its wishes and express its rights so the Attorney is a fraud saying he re-presents something that does not exist.So government agents suffer from psychosis yes, we can see that.</comment>

<comment>Art. IV sec. 2 says nothing about the Congress being able to legislate or having jurisdiction in any state??? So...The Constitution doesn't say that Congress has the authority to pass legislation outside of Washington D.C. The proof is shown on my youtube channel and apparently you didn't watch it or you would see that my statement is true,   But you are allowed you opinion, its just that you opinion cannot change the Constitution no more than a judges opinion can.</comment>

<comment>My mistake and I apologize. It is Art. VI (Six), not IV Four). It means that the US Constitution and Congress are superior to the States. If you knew anything about the Constitution you would know that, regardless of if I messed up my Roman Numerals.No, I don't accept youtube. Or personal blogs. Or personal written pamphlets. You don't know about the Supremacy Clause, why would anyone expect you to know anything else about the Constitution?</comment>

<comment>If you are going to understand anything you will have to think about it and read it, watch, or hear it somewhere or you can just imagine it.   Your refusal to show evidence the Constitution expressly grants Congress the power to pass any law that applies and has jurisdiction outside of Washington D.C. or the Territorys is my proof that they dont have that right.  The supremacy clause only states the the Constitution when in conflict with a states laws is superior, but the state is sovereign also so... as with any written law it only applies if you complain about it and wish to enforce your rights under it.  The Government has no rights, its only purpose is to secure my rights.  Anything imposition by another man on my free will unless i have harmed another man is slavery.   You dont build a case upon the Constitution, I can.   But....you wish to remain ignorant on the subject so you will remain uniformed.</comment>

<comment>  Your refusal to show evidence the Constitution expressly grants Congress the power to pass any law that applies and has jurisdiction outside of Washington D.C. or the Territorys is my proof that they dont have that right.Now this is where you blew it. I just posted the Art. XI, Cl. 2 that says exactly that."This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; ... "Yes, the Constitution. Available on online and in many books.  The "laws of the United States" doesn't mean the laws of Kentucky, South Carolina, or Timbuctu. It means laws passed by the United States Congress and signed by the President of the United States." ... shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby"The Supreme Court has determined that that makes a Federal Law superior and preempts a State law. And yes, the Constitution does state that the Supreme Court has the final determination of what the Constitution means.***You dont build a case upon the Constitution, I can.Only you haven't built a case on anything. You made some stupid claims with no evidence. I actually did post the relevant part of the Constitution.***In Ware v. Hylton,  3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796), the United States Supreme Court for the first time applied the Supremacy Clause to strike down a state statute. Virginia had passed a statute during the Revolutionary War allowing the state to confiscate debt payments by Virginia citizens to British creditors. The Supreme Court found that this Virginia statute was inconsistent with the Treaty of Paris with Britain, which protected the rights of British creditors. Relying on the Supremacy Clause, the Supreme Court held that the treaty superseded Virginia's statute, and that it was the duty of the courts to declare Virginia's statute "null and void".In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304 (1816), and Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264 (1821), the Supreme Court held that the Supremacy Clause and the judicial power granted in Article III give the Supreme Court the ultimate power to review state court decisions involving issues arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. Therefore, the Supreme Court has the final say in matters involving federal law, including constitutional interpretation, and can overrule decisions by state courts.In McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819), the Supreme Court reviewed a tax levied by Maryland  on the federally incorporated Bank of the United States. The Court found that if a state had the power to tax a federally incorporated institution, then the state effectively had the power to destroy the federal institution, thereby thwarting the intent and purpose of Congress. This would make the states superior to the federal government. The Court found that this would be inconsistent with the Supremacy Clause, which makes federal law superior to state law. The Court therefore held that Maryland's tax on the bank was unconstitutional because the tax violated the Supremacy Clause.In Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. 506 (1859), the Supreme Court held that state courts cannot issue rulings that contradict the decisions of federal courts, citing the Supremacy Clause, and overturning a decision by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. Specifically, the court found it was illegal for state officials to interfere with the work of U.S. Marshals enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act or to order the release of federal prisoners held for violation of that Act. The Supreme Court reasoned that because the Supremacy Clause established federal law as the law of the land, the Wisconsin courts could not nullify the judgments of a federal court. The Supreme Court held that under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts have  the final jurisdiction in all cases involving the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the states therefore cannot interfere with federal court judgments.</comment>

<comment>Once again you fail.   I ask you to show where in the Constitution a power is delegated to Congress to pass any law and where said acts/law shall apply, and....you dont.The Supremacy clause says nothing about where... the acts of congress apply, it only says the Constitution and any laws made in pursuance to it are the law of the land (commonlaw).   It doesn't grant any powers not already granted, you are making an assumption of some grant of authority which simply is NOT THERE.What is there is this powers granted to Congress:Art.1,sec. 8>17>To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Auhhtoiry over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be,…Art.4, sec.3>2>The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States;…The above is the only granting of legislative power and jurisdicition to congress, to excercise prosecuting criminal and civil actions in any state is not granted.  but  since you like judges opinions so much , which have no more authority than my opinion here ya go:"(b) As to lands acquired by the United States by purchase or condemnation for the purposes of the improvements.  Lands were thus acquired on the banks of the rivers from individual owners, and the United States obtained title in fee simple.  Respondent contends that, by virtue of Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17, of the Federal Constitution, the United States acquired exclusive jurisdiction.{GO>3}	Clause 17 provides that Congress shall have power "to exercise exclusive Legislation" over all Places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings."Exclusive legislation" is consistent only with exclusive jurisdiction. Surplus Trading Co. v. Cook, supra, p. GO>652.  As we said in that case, it is not unusual for the United States to own within a state lands which are set apart and used for public purposes.  Such ownership and use, without more, do not withdraw the lands from the jurisdiction of the state.  They lands remain part of her territory and within the operation of her laws, save that [302 U.S. 142] the latter cannot affect the title of the United States or embarrass it in using the lands or interfere with its right of disposal.Id., p. GO>650.  Clause 17 governs those cases where the United States acquires lands with the consent of the Legislature of the state for the purposes there described.  If lands are otherwise acquired, and jurisdiction is ceded by the state to the United States, the terms of the cession, to the extent that they may lawfully be prescribed -- that is, consistently with the carrying out of the purpose of the acquisition -- determine the extent of the federal jurisdiction.  GO>Fort Leavenworth R. Co. v. Lowe, 114 U.S. 525, GO>527, GO>538-539; GO>Palmer v. Barrett, 162 U.S. 399, GO>402-403; GO>Arlington Hotel Co. v. Fant, 278 U.S. 439, GO>451; GO>United States v. Unzeuta, 281 U.S. 138, GO>142; Surplus Trading Company v. Cook, supra.	Are the locks and dams in the instant case "needful buildings" within the purview of clause 17?  The state contends that they are not.  If the clause were construed according to the rule of ejusdem generis, it could be plausibly contended that "needful buildings" are those of the same sort as forts, magazines, arsenals, and dockyards -- that is, structures for military purposes.  And it may be that the thought of such "strongholds" was uppermost in the minds of the framers.  Elliot's Debates, volume 5, pp. 130, 440, 511; cf. Story on the Constitution, volume 2, § 1224.  But such a narrow construction has been found not to be absolutely required, and to be unsupported by sound reason in view of the nature and functions of the national government which the Constitution established.	In Sharon v. Hill, 24 F. 726, 730, 731, Justice Field (sitting with Judge Sawyer) considered the provision to be applicable to a court building and custom house on land which had been purchased with the consent of the state.  In GO>Battle v. United States, 209 U.S. 36, GO>37, we held that "post offices are among the `other needful [302 U.S. 143] buildings'" within clause 17.  See also United States v. Wurtzbarger, 276 F. 753, 755; Arlington Hotel v. Fant, supra.  Locks and dams for the improvement of navigation, which are as clearly within the federal authority as post offices, have been regarded as "needful buildings."  United States v. Tucker, 122 F. 518, 522.  We take that view.  We construe the phrase "other needful buildings" as embracing whatever structures are found to be necessary in the performance of the functions of the federal government.        James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 [verified]no right to enforce any congressional act outside of the Federal Zone ( Washington D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and American Somoa.But...for someone who cant read anybody else's writings you seem to choose to do just that, while refusing to see the proof I provided on youtube.Dont worry i wont cast any more of my pearls before swine with you.</comment>

<comment>Scalia was a footsoldier in the Republican war against gay Americans. He and his kind helped make millions of Americans feel like second class citizens. Not as bad as Nazi Germany's war against the Jews, but nothing to be proud of either. His partisanship in the Bush v. Gore decision helped put Bush 43 into office and set the country on the road to fiscal irresponsibility, from which we don't seem to be able to erxtricate ourselves. In the end, we will all pay the price if we are still around. If we are lucky, the price won't be as high as what the Germans paid during the Weimar era and later.Scalia seemed to forget about the discrimination faced by Italian immigrants to this country a century ago. The Reed-Johnson immigration bill of 1924, sponsored by Republicans, was targeted particularly at would be immigrants from Italy, as well as Jewish immigrants from Poland. In a PBS documentary on Italian Americans, he noted the discrimination he faced as child of Italian immigrants. But it didn't seem to affect his rulings on later groups facing discrimination.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Scalia was the worst type of Judge, he was an originalist right up to the point that line of thinking would take him places he politically didn't want to go, then he became a 'contextualist'. It didn't matter how good your case was if you were a petitioner with a position disliked by Scalia, not even if you tailored your case to address his so called  Judicial sensibilities, he would always find a way to worm out of giving you a win.</comment>

<comment>Basically, he was hypocritical scum.</comment>

<comment>Scalia said he didn't like to use 'Legislative Intent', to me that is the most bizarre lack of common sense possible.Why you would not go to the 'horse's mouth' to find out their goal when the people who wrote a law who are still alive and can tell you exactly what they intended is case study inremaining willfully ignorant.</comment>

<comment>because if doesn't matter what their intent is if it isn't expressly written in the law.  If it isn't written the law the unwritten intent of the law can be perverted over the years.  This is basic legislation.  Why do you think written laws are so detailed?  To use legislative intend of a law to pass judgment on constitutionality is dangerous and reckless.   From a legal perspective you can't use what the legislation's intent was all you can look at is what is written as law.  Your argument is completely flawed and dangerous.</comment>

<comment>No, even a child KNOWS words and phrases can be ambiguous, How about how the 2nd Amendment is written? The definition of Racism? A million other things, with that understanding of language, it would be INSANE to insert your interpretation of a passage, when the author is readily available. Do you think Scalia could render a more accurate understanding of 'American Pie' than Don McLean?</comment>

<comment>The issue is that people who are attempting to follow the law can't keep asking what each term means (assuming that all of the lawmakers agree on the intent), the work of the legislator is to get the intent on paper.</comment>

<comment>Well they sign off on the final version by voting for it, so there is that. Why can't they ask? The ACA is 1000's of pages long and pretty clear EXCEPT for a certain ambiguous phrase, why not just ask the people who wrote it what they meant? Would that likely not result in a better outcome then someone else guessing at it? Of course you can't do that with the 2nd Amendment as the authors are all dead.</comment>

<comment>The same terms may mean one thing to those who wrote it, another to those who voted for it and still another by the one who signed it into law.With the ACA both sides would have said that  exchanges established by the state means established by the state.Scalia's opinion (and common sense) was that the court reads it as written, the legislative branch is free to change the wording whenever it likes.</comment>

<comment>You KNOW changing the wording is not possible with this obstructionist Congress or it would have been done, actually I think that is in Bad Faith to a former Congress, as it could and should have been easily fixed.</comment>

<comment>You've almost got it.Judges should not care about how to fix it as long as the power to fix it is in the correct hands.What you think of as the obstructionist congress would just as accurately be described representing the will of the people.  Separation of power is hard.</comment>

<comment>Republicans make mistakes in their own laws and bills(well they would if they actually passed anything), I am sure this will set precedent for a future Democrat Congress to show no mercy for the opposition party.</comment>

<comment>there is a process for correcting drafting errors, this was not one.</comment>

<comment>There is a process for nominating and confirming a Supreme Court justice during a sitting president's statutory term.  I assume you're all in favor of that's going forward?</comment>

<comment>Nomination is totally up to the president, Confirmation is totally up to the Senate.  I would expect the president to nominate and would expect the senate to stal.</comment>

<comment>Oh, right: advise, consent and stall, it's right there in Article II.  Advise not to perform one's duties, and stall until giving consent next time there's a Republican in office.</comment>

<comment>Next time, last time both sides do it, it is a power that the Senate has and the Senate works at it's own pace.Judges are routinely held up, sometime for years.The only shot is to pick someone that they can't say no to.  If I were a black woman with a law degree, I would stay by the phone.</comment>

<comment>Kennedy, 1988, election year, Dem Senate, 97-0.Also, learn grammar and spelling if you want to be taken seriously.</comment>

<comment>A pick that appealed to both sides, it can be done.  Reagan was good at it.Ironically, if Scalia's theory of the court prevailed, these decisions would be less important because the court would be more constrained to the letter of the law.  When we're appointing 9 people to rule for the rest of their lives, our elected representatives have a duty to use all of their power to get their choice.</comment>

<comment>Sri Srinivasan, also confirmed 97-0 three years ago.  But suddenly, no nominee of Obama's could possibly appeal to both sides?  You wingy nut jobs are just too funny.</comment>

<comment>What's your point, I said that I could be done but I very much doubt that it will be this time.The Dems held Miguel Estrada for two years because he was Latino and a conservative and they didn't want him to eventually make it to SCOTUS.  Anything can happen.The major factors I see are;You've got two sitting republican Senators running for PresidentScalia was a very important force on the court his replacement is importantThe Republicans have a strong majority in the Senate. The Republican base is unhappy with their current representationI just don't see it happening this term</comment>

<comment>Ah, the Party Of No runs for president in 2016 as the Party Of No Supreme Court Hearings Until A Republican Is President.  That oughta work!  Especially with 24 out of 34 Senate seats with GOP incumbents this year.The current wisdom seems to be that if you confirm this year, you'll get someone like Srinivasan, who worked in the Bush Administration.  If you wait until Hillary is elected, you'll probably get Obama, or someone farther left.  Either way, you lose.</comment>

<comment>LOL.You do realize that even if Clinton somehow avoids being indicted and somehow wins this race, the Republicans will still control the Senate.I doubt even the ABA would claim Obama to be minimally qualified, that would be an easy one to vote down.Plus, if they have someone decent in the process, they could confirm sometime after the election.Seems the best course of action is to wait.</comment>

<comment>Kennedy was Reagan's third pick in the fall of 87, the first two were shot down and it was all over before the election year started.Anything short of a perfect pick will not get through, I would suggest Miguel Estrada.</comment>

<comment>Ann Coulter's buddy?  Maybe Obama should nominate her, instead.</comment>

<comment>I have no idea who he's friends with, I do know that the racist dems kept him off the circuit court for the sole reason that he was Latino.</comment>

<comment>Umm - the current Congress represents the will of Grover Norquist and the Tea Party.</comment>

<comment>If either of them had their say  there certainly would have been no  spending deal and the ACA would be gone.  Hell, they couldn't even defund planned parenthood.think again.</comment>

<comment>Still whining about the ACA?  That was three Congresses ago.Anyway, your point was about fixing drafting errors.  There is no process to screw in a light bulb at the present time, much less fix drafting errors.</comment>

<comment>The ACA was just fully funded again in December by the Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Oh. My. Gosh.  They fully funded health care, AND the Defense Department too?  The world is coming to an end.</comment>

<comment>do you understand any of this?  what is your point?</comment>

<comment>The unfortunate passing Antonin Scalia is a reminder to me that I am glad that I am not a modern-day liberal.   The gleeful vitriolic language liberals have been using during the past 24 hours in reaction to his death has been disgusting to say the least.</comment>

<comment>The only thing "unfortunate" about Scalia's death is that it didn't happen 30 years sooner.</comment>

<comment>If you knew anyone who was harmed by the Defense of Marriage Act, you might have come to a different conclusion. Someone I knew was forced to choose between his country and his job vs. giving up his partner. He moved abroad and married his partner there. </comment>

<comment>No was harmed by the Defense of Marriage Act.   Get a grip.</comment>

<comment>And the gleeful praise being heaped upon a racist man who worked diligently for decades to deny civil rights to various minorities, undermined the Civil Rights Act, and shifted power from the people to corporations is better?He was a monstrous person, and those flinging accolades at him reveal their own monstrosity by doing so.  In terms of vitriol, it's even worse because it affects millions of people and not just one.</comment>

<comment>The only pertinent remark about this fascist's life is that the world is a much better place now that he's dead and gone.</comment>

<comment>Oh great,  More vile hate.   Is that all you "tolerant" liberals have to offer?</comment>

<comment>What makes you think "tolerant" means above criticism ?</comment>

<comment>Have a home or work address? I could send you down to Hades.</comment>

<comment>Great man was lost yesterday.  Thank you Justice Scalia for all you did.  You were a true constitutional scholar and what you did on the court has made this country better.  Your approach changed the way the court deliberated on decisions.  Even the liberal judges have followed your model.  Even though other justices may have disagreed with your opinions at time they all had, without exception, incredible respect for what you did for this county and the court.  Your legacy will extend for generations along with your opinions and decisions on the court.  You were a man who link all of your decisions to constitution reasoning as the constitution was historically written not how some wished it was written.</comment>

<comment>I would like to see Obama offer right of first refusal for replacing Scalia to Hillary:A lifetime influential post with no more House investigations to hassle withTrifecta of influence in Government Branches as SOS, US Senator and now SCOTUS Justice not many, if any can match resume wiseSenate would have to say yes or no to one of their former colleagues in a formal Senate hearing,  and the political theater would be high dramaBlow the minds of billionaire funding cabals to see just how agile their political organizations really are in response </comment>

<comment>appreciate that English is not your first language but are you saying that Hillary's resume would be better than someone who actually Judged before?It would also be irresponsible to nominate someone who is currently under an FBI criminal investigation. The billionaire supporters would probably just switch to Biden, they'd be fine with it.</comment>

<comment>Given that federal judges from DC Court make most of SCOTUS candidate pool are ok with a lot of objectionable policy including:Mass incarceration through BS gruff lawsMass corruption through unlimited campaign finance schemes and voting restrictionsI say give her s shotThanks for pointing out I am Californian, a place where strict grammarians on internet comment sections get  called out as pedantic choads</comment>

<comment>I was not being pedantic, I was trying to figure out your point.If you're looking for someone who understands mass corruption and voting restrictions, Hillary knows how.Still think federal charges may complicate things</comment>

<comment>It may be uncouth to say this but nonetheless Scalia's death has changed the political calculus of the 2016 elections and is a great opportunity to shift the court in a more liberal minded direction. Getting one or two more liberals on the court  bench would be a big win if pulled off. And now it's more important than ever for Dems to take the Senate and WH. Ginsburg could go any moment so the balance of the court could lean either way. This election season may be the most consequential in quite some time.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.</comment>

<comment>Maybe a new york or california jew or catholic?BTW. what kind of name is "Eisner"?German?</comment>

<comment>I'd settle for a liberal minded justice from whatever state that person may come from.The origin of my last name is irrelevant to my comment.</comment>

<comment>BTW, what is your affiliation?  KKK?</comment>

<comment>It's the Supreme Court, it's not supposed to be about politics. Thanks for helping to drive our democracy further into the realms of oligarchies and dictatorships though.</comment>

<comment>Save the BS self-righteousness. The Supreme Court has been political since its founding. You obviously don't know about the history of the Supreme Court or you would have known about the "Midnight Judges". Adams tried to cram as many Federalist judges throughout the circuit courts literally days and hours before the election of Jefferson. As I liberal I want as many liberal judges as possible as any conservative should want as many conservative judges as possible. The Court isn't and has never been above politics.</comment>

<comment>If you remove suicides, it becomes abundantly clear that gun violence is mostly committed by blacks in urban areas.Given that they already handicap police in urban areas and we don't lock away nearly enough young black men (shocking as their incarceration rate already is), liberals cannot reclaim many desirable urban centers for gentrification unless they confiscate weapons nationwide.Background checks and closing "loopholes" don't stop criminal blacks from getting weapons—but this is the left choosing making incremental steps toward their end-goal.</comment>

<comment>Drat! You're revealed our nefarious lefty plan, to corner the inner-city real estate market by making it a little harder for people to shoot each other.</comment>

<comment>And that was the correct decision, moron</comment>

<comment>Let me fix that for you: that was the correct decision if you're a moron.</comment>

<comment>We are not disarming.  You are powerless </comment>

<comment>Little or no regulation? Maybe in VT.Gun deaths have been coming down as the people arm up. Heller was correct, stop trying to scare people into buying more guns.</comment>

<comment>You have a home or work address? I could add you to that total.</comment>

<comment>Because DC was such a paradise before Heller.</comment>

<comment>You understand that gun deaths have DECLINED since that ruling right? Or are you just not concerned about your obvious intellectual dishonesty?</comment>

<comment>Scalia finally did something I agree with.</comment>

<comment>Disgusting comment on your part.</comment>

<comment>Really? Besides selling vegetables or being an obnoxious little jerk with a better job than he deserved, exactly what was he good for? Did he invent anything? Shoot anything but little birds? The problem is that this country rewards things like him. He couldn't have survived for ten seconds outside the strange bubble he lived in. POS.</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Well, so was Scalia.</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot and that's why you don't understand why Scalia was a great man.  All you can do is sling mud.</comment>

<comment>It's certainly great that he's dead, I'll give you that.</comment>

<comment>Were you born an idiot or did you learn to become one in school?</comment>

<comment>That's all you wingnuts have, is name calling?  Weak.</comment>

<comment>The noted political humorist Bob Woodward told a particularly hilarious joke on CNN this morning.  He opined that the vacancy should be filled by someone other than Obama, because Scalia's death "disturbs the balance" on the Court, and Americans REALLY want the Court to be in balance.  If Obama (or a Democrat successor, for that matter) names the next justice, the Court will immediately swing way out of balance to the Left.Actually, watching him, he seemed serious about that argument; which is, of course, what made it so funny.</comment>

<comment>RIP.Sorry you were murdered.</comment>

<comment>Tony was probably just "Chokin the Chicken" and his heart gave out; Rest in Peace, Judge.</comment>

<comment>A perverts death.</comment>

<comment>"There are those who contend that it does not benefit African Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well," Scalia said referencing an amicus brief.=======We're celebrating this guy?!?!</comment>

<comment>Only those who agreed with him are.</comment>

<comment>It only shows how far behind the world and largely prejudiced conservative judges become as they age.</comment>

<comment>You have a problem with him referring to an amicus brief?  It's his job.</comment>

<comment>Dropout rates for minority students are higher because they are disadvantaged in primary/secondary education and are admitted with less rigorous academic standards.SCOTUS is not a political branch of government, so I'm sorry that its inclination towards challenging thought offends you.</comment>

<comment>What a great loss Scalia's death is to the defense of our constitution and liberty. Obama surely feels this moment will provide his icing on the cake opportunity to "fundamentally transform America". To all you folks who sat out and stayed home in 2012, this is just another reason why elections have consequences.  We can only hope and pray our Congress does the right thing and delay, delay, delay on this next appointment.</comment>

<comment>Bunch more elderly white Tea Turds die every day.  Keep delaying.</comment>

<comment>You're still an idiot.</comment>

<comment>By his own belief system, he's currently lugging around large rocks for all eternity as punishment for his supreme arrogance. He was an egomaniac. Now he's a corpse. Old news.</comment>

<comment>You know nothing about Scalia's belief system, values or faith.Supreme arrogance?  Then a miserable afterlife awaits your Obama.</comment>
