<comment>Why shouldn't women be able to take on any job in the military just like a man? It has been very sexist up until now as if women haven't got the strength or the fortitude to carry out any tough job. There are some weak men out there, sorry men but it's true. Some women alongside them in maybe a combat zone would wipe the floor with them as regards courage and stamina. So it's about time the ladies were treated as equals. It's been a man worlds for far too long in the military.</comment>

<comment>Women are treated as equals in the military.  In performance, pay, evaluations, etc.  Since the dawn of mankind, warfighting has naturally been the province of men--with a few exceptions.  Women were and are treated as complete equals in whatever field they serve.  But both because the vast majority of women are physically incapable of ground combat and--even more importantly--the notion of putting 19 year old girls in the horror, filth, depravity, and pain of war was seen as incompatible with society's values.  You don't even need to have served in combat--just watch Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, or Full Metal Jacket.Soldiers fight to defend our way of life back home. Complete equality before the law and in public life for women, minorities, the LGBT community and others is intrinsic in the idea of America.  But the military is not a democracy; it is not society at large.  It exists to defend democracy and society at large.  All military members would tell you they believe in complete equality for women at home--whether its pay, time off, hiring and promotion, protection from sexual assault, etc.The issue is that, now, people who know very little about the military are trying to manipulate it as if it was a civilian institution.  The Army is not General Motors.  The Marine Corps is not Hewlett Packard.</comment>

<comment>There you go, assuming women aren't able to exist in a combat zone where conditions maybe awful. Women are much stronger than you apparently are giving them credit for.</comment>

<comment>Not according to the armyWomen's fitness requirements are literally cut in half</comment>

<comment>Women in combat roles should have their own combat units.  It would allow for specialization based on average physical ability rather than lowering the physical standards for the existing units.</comment>

<comment>A whole unit of women in forward combat....that's a great ideaWe should put the women's college sports teams against the men's as well</comment>

<comment>Several countries have made it work.  If women are demanding the right to defend their country, it should be implemented in a way that makes the military stronger not weaker.  This would give everyone a better chance of coming back alive.</comment>

<comment>Remind us how many females graduated from Marine IOC?</comment>

<comment>Remind us of all the categories you believe are inferior?Women?Gays?Blacks?Muslims ?Jews?Who am I forgetting?  </comment>

<comment>Yes, darling?</comment>

<comment>Go back to the clinic where that nice lady gives you the pills and get some more.</comment>

<comment>Is that what you were told? Good to know.</comment>

<comment>The destruction of an institution driven by people who know nothing about and care nothing for the military and who certainly are not going to send THEIR daughters into the hell of war.  That some military and retired military members support the change in policy means nothing.  We have about 2 million active duty, reserve and Guard personnel plus God knows how many veterans.  That some out of such a large pool would be supportive shouldn't surprise anyone--even if they're retired Generals.  But the military is also a quasi-political animal--the top leadership knew this change was going to be forced upon them and most chose not to fight it, whether they agreed or not.  General Dunford--as Commandant of the Marines and later Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--quietly, professionally, but clearly made his opposition known, as he was asked to do.  But the idea that the services are on board is a sham--a disgusting lie.  The burden was placed on them to defend what has been the "policy" for thousands of years--that women do not fight in the muck of war.  But everyone knew that presenting a case against the change was a losing battle--so all but the Marines didn't even try.  General Dunford displayed real courage.  As a loyal soldier, he will duly implement the policy--knowing all the while it will lead to disaster.</comment>

<comment>"the burden was placed on them to defend what has been the 'policy' for thousands of years - that women do not fight in the muck of war".You should brush up on history.  The Mongols and the vikings, only to name these two, had integrated armies. At best, your concept describes the western conceptualization of war and who should be taking part in it.At the end of the day, if the soldier can meet all the qualifying criteria for a position, who cares whether they have breasts or not ? If a woman happens to be the best person for the job, why prevent her from taking it  ?</comment>

<comment>Are you forgetting we have an an volunteer force since Vietnam? If they meet individual requirements any woman should be allowed to serve in any position she is qualified for. In spec ops roles I doubt they will be changing fitness requirements.</comment>

<comment>People are hung up on the physical, but that's likely to be something of a non-issue. Failure rates will be higher for females then males, but they already are. Those women who make it through will be fine, physically.The psychological toll of ground combat on very young women is the more worrisome aspect. Men don't even hold up to it very well long term - as the high rates of veteran PTSD, suicide, homelessness, etc, can attest. Many of these men are so completely undone by war that they're just not able to hold themselves or their lives together afterward. Have we studied what this effect will be on 18-25 year old females, or are we just completely hung up on whether they can carry rucksacks or not?</comment>

<comment>So you are saying that women's brains are more susceptible to the psychological toll of war than men's ? Can you back this up ?</comment>

<comment>There is a lot backing that up.  It's not really in question as a matter of factWomen have a much different fight/flight reflex than menIt's a very basic part of human psychology</comment>

<comment>I will stay on the fence until the numbers start rolling in. These gals will have to be extraordinary to prove themselves in the field. The first sign of preferential treatment will be evident soon enough IMO. Social media is just to big to hide it.</comment>

<comment>Don't *all* personnel "have to be extraordinary to prove themselves in the field?"</comment>

<comment>Lord no.  Scrubs are usually carried along but these are women we are talking about. Yah dig ?  Being a scrub is hard on the whole unit, but being a women scrub ?  It will get ugly if she isn't at the upper end with her skills.</comment>

<comment>So men can be below average, but women have to be superior.Got it.How ugly is your heart?</comment>

<comment>I wasn't being ugly and have no problem with this decision.  SOME DO !!!!  Don't you get it ?  The below average men will struggle big time with girls outdoing them !  And some of the better solgiers will put crazy demands on over achieving women.  Point your close minded finger somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>No, there is no difference in the expectations between sexes therefore they have the same standards. You don't just believe that women have lower abilities, right? You are not possibly suggesting that women are physically weaker by nature? Blasphemy! How dare you suggest such a thing. You male chauvinistic pig.</comment>

<comment>Not necessarily. People who've never been in the military have this idea of the infantry as King Leonidas and his 300, but in reality - it's not rare to have guys who couldn't hack it at your average Crossfit gym so far as pure physicality goes, or guys who are dumber then a sack of hair and scored so poorly on the ASVAB they didn't qualify for much of anything else.One point I will concede to the feminists: people have a tendency to compare these women to the absolute pinnacle of male achievement, rather then the actual guys actually performing these jobs. As I said below, the psychological aspect worries me more. </comment>

<comment>This is ridiculous - if women are actually held to the exact same standards as men almost none will get through to the most demanding combat positions, but I suspect there will be tremendous pressure to lower them to show this policy is "working."  This will of course degrade the effectiveness of integrated units since all the men will have to wonder whether their female comrades were allowed to slide through rather than having earned it on the merits.  Sound familiar to anyone?I have a lot of respect for what women are capable of, and as someone who likes to participate in a mode of personal fitness that is often referred to as a cult for its participants' enthusiasm for high intensity exercise, I see what a woman in elite physical condition can do multiple times a week.  However even these extraordinary ladies cannot match men who are just a bit better than average - it's just our physiology and it's can't be wished away through feel-good policies like this.</comment>

<comment>No, there won't be. The standards will be identical for women and men. Which makes this policy a good litmus test for finding out who had reasonable concerns, and who's just a venomous misogynist.</comment>

<comment>The standards are not the same NOW, even in damned basic. http://usarmybasic.com/army-ph... Why would you expect it to be any different going forward?</comment>

<comment>Well I'd hope for specialized combat positions the standards would be the same.</comment>

<comment>According to reasonable information the women were not held to the same standards.http://www.people.com/article/...</comment>

<comment>This is completely unsubstantiated. And anyways, only 2 women passed. Think of it like this: Every 4 years at the Summer Olympics there are women who can squat 500 pounds and bench press 450 (more weight than 99.9999% of men on planet Earth can lift). There are women who can run the 100 meter dash in 10.9 seconds (faster than 99.99999% of men on planet Earth). The idea that there can't possibly be some women out there qualified for special forces is ludicrous.  Obviously, there are way, way less of them than men. But they exist.</comment>

<comment>The May 7 failure date alone proves the point.   Women are running into what is known from the sports world as the 'golden ratio' (women's best is ~90% of the men's best). As an example, the worldwide top women's sprinter is slower than ~250 of the top men's sprinters.  The ratio get worse as you compare non-exceptional athletes.http://www.theatlantic.com/tec...This is the inherent issue when dealing with jobs that have necessary physical standards. The solution would be to create women only combat unit and specialized units.  This allows women the right to defend their country while also giving everyone the best chance to come back safely.</comment>

<comment>So do they now have to register for the draft?</comment>

<comment>Welcome to 2105, Rip Van Winkle.  There have been some changes while you've been napping.</comment>

<comment>The draft has been outlawed for like 40 years. What the hell are you babbling about?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure he meant the Selective Service registration that all US resident males have to partake in between their 18th and 25th birthdays. That is essentially the precursor to being able to, in case of need, have a draft.</comment>

<comment>There is no draft, and never will be.</comment>

<comment>You don't understand the Selective Service System, do you? It is not about whether there is a draft now (which I never said, you sockpuppet), but that it allows for a draft in case of need. Straight from the SSS website:When the all-volunteer force was established, it was not intended to stand alone in time of national emergency. If, by law, it is determined that a return to the draft is required, the Selective Service System would be responsible for supplying manpower through the induction process to fill vacancies that could not be filled through voluntary enlistments.https://www.sss.gov/About/Even...Read it and weep, you ignoramus.</comment>

<comment>No, YOU don't understand. There will never be a draft, ever. The selective service registration is a completely meaningless relic that might as well not exist,</comment>

<comment>Thank you for proving that you don't understand, lumpenprole.</comment>

<comment>Christ you're stupid. There will never be a draft again, ever. It would be too politically toxic, plus human body count wars are a thing of the past.</comment>

<comment>Keep proving to us that you don't understand the concept of having a system in place for an unlikely and undesirable event, but nevertheless failing to be prepared is preparing to fail, you numbskulled cretin.</comment>

<comment>OK, dimwit, every male is required to register for the draft just in case.https://www.sss.gov/Registrati...So if you haven't, have a nice time in Leavenworth.</comment>

<comment>Lol that doesn't matter. There will never be a draft ever again.</comment>

<comment>So are you saying that there will never be another World War?</comment>

<comment>I'm saying there will never be a draft, exactly the words I just posted. It's too politically toxic and the days of wars fought by having the most bodies are over.</comment>

<comment>That seems awfully presumptuous and naive. Our volunteer force was pushed to the limit with just the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and those were both small, undeveloped and fractured nations.A Third World War with China and Russia on the other side could very well result in the need for an American fighting force 10 to 20 times it's current size. Political will is likely to change drastically if we suffered a significant terrorist attack and combined threat of economic and strategic loses with our allies.</comment>

<comment>The impetus for a draft is also likely to come from the left and the right. In a Third World War economic conditions would be such that poor and working class kids would have little alternatives for jobs outside of military service, and influential politicians may be inclined to require that all Americans share the burden of defending the nation.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...https://www.wsws.org/en/articl...Senator Chuck Hagel (Republican from Nebraska), appearing on NBC television’s “Today Show” on Wednesday, said that mandatory military service had to be considered in the face of what he described as a “generational war against terrorism.”</comment>

<comment>I'm so glad you're so confident there will never be another major war. Perhaps you can enlighten us as to the source of your profound knowledge?Oh, and also, Lol that doesn't matter. You still go to prison if you don't register.</comment>

<comment>There will be dozens, hundreds, thousands of wars in the future. But never a draft. Most people get this. It's pretty simple.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure you're entirely sane. This is predicated on the assumption that the United States will remain prohibitively the world's preeminent military power into the indefinite future. You have absolutely no evidence of that and all the evidence of history is against it. So no, most people don't get this. It isn't simple at all. It is what the British thought once. And if it were true, there would be no selective service at all. That would be a cost that is easy to cut. So SOMEONE has been creating contingency plans that involve conscription.Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Except for you. You'll be in prison.</comment>

<comment>I'm absolutely sure anyone who thinks a damn military draft is ever going to happen again in modern America is an idiot, at best.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, it's pretty clear you're nothing but a damn troll and an idiot to boot.I'm not wasting time on your stupid ass any more. Have a nice day.</comment>

<comment>At the very least, there are contingency plans to draft medical workers.http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10...So far, you haven't presented either evidence or a logical argument why you think it can't ever happen. You've just made assertions. Consequently, you're just blowing smoke.</comment>

<comment>I don't doubt that the Marine Corps research was prey to some presupposing-the-outcome. But this would be a much stronger criticism if the other services had performed research that didn't make the mistakes that the USMC research is being called out for and which did not show sex-related differences in performance. But either they didn't do that research at all, or they did it and the results didn't look good enough to put out.</comment>

<comment>No one who called out the USMC study could argue there wasn't a sex related difference in the outcome.</comment>

<comment>I thought the USMC study was pretty compelling, and I say that as a general supporter of Carter's decision.</comment>

<comment>So "10 percent of military specialties" that weren't available to women equals opportunities that were "deeply constrained". What a joke. The fact of the matter is, in combat related positions, where physical standards are high, most military women fail to meet or exceed those standards. Congrats on your participation award.</comment>

<comment>Most military women aren't interested in serving in combat-related positions. This will provide an opportunity for the handful of very driven female service members who are interested and able. They will mostly be officers and they will disproportionately be from the service academies. For this small group, the lack of specialties *were* a major constraint on their careers because combat folks look a lot better for promotion to the highest ranks, and these are people who could otherwise be competitive.</comment>

<comment>At some point in the not-too-distant past (probably a number of years after the termination of the draft), the armed forces stopped being primarily a military organization optimized to provide national defense and/or project US foreign policy an has evolved to a sort of job placement program that is much closer in intent and purpose to the civil service.Sorta like arming the United States Postal Service.</comment>

<comment>The entire issue is very complex, but under no circumstance, barring a significant shortage of male personnel that had formerly been alleviated by the draft, does the inclusion of women into any potential combat situation tend to improve the military's combat effectiveness in that situation.The best that can be said is that in some few cases it does not materially and measurably degrade it.And in that instance what we have is a warm admiration for the few females who were able, by tremendous personal effort and some level of genetic variation, to achieve either parity or near-parity with a comparable male who graded out as "average" on the physical tests.We are trading a demonstrably more physically robust average recruit for a chance to feel good about the personal achievement of a statistical few.And maybe that really is OK in the sorts of "war" we currently fight, where we control the airspace, control logistical tail, and are technologically superior in almost all confrontations. But should we lose that advantage, hypothetically fighting a First World adversary that has a draft, we'll some find out if the nation has the fortitude and emotional stamina to see 18-year old women come home in flag-draped aluminum boxes, row upon row, in the belly of a Globemaster each week.This would change, I think. I don't know: perhaps it will be for the better.</comment>

<comment>You're putting all the importance on physical requirements, which are important, but definitely not the only valuable quality. An average physical performer who excels in other other crucial combat tasks (e.x. navigation) is just as valuable to the team as the physically strongest individual. You need a mix of talents, even on the battlefield.</comment>

<comment>My concern is that as a tendency, the physical capabilities of a squad (8 or more) or a fireteam (4), for example, will be measurably reduced.E.g., a fireteam, there is a light machine gunner and the rounds are carried by all other members. While it is accurate that some females with combat designation will be able to carry an assigned load of ammunition, a fair perecentage will not be able to carry as a much and as far and as fast. So with one or more females you tend to end up with this:1) Everything is just fine, all female members by chance happen to be able to carry the full load of the average male team member; or2) All average male team members carry a larger load to make up for the inability of a female member (could happen with males, too, but less likely under testing standards); or3) The team carries less ammunition; or4) Proportionally fewer women are assigned to fireteams, allowing the fireteams to tend to meet all previous physical expectations.#1 is fine, no degradation.#2 makes the other team members wonder why they have to carry extra, and resent it.#3 makes the team unable to stay in the field as long.#4 makes the male members of a combat brigade wonder why it is that women combat soldiers are numerically under-represetned in the more dangerous assignments (fireteam), and over-represented in the less dangerous ones (logistical support).#2 & #4 lead to poor morale.These are tendencies, not absolutes.If we do not face a first rate power (and arguably we have not since the Korean War, with China--and they really weren't first rate at that time) it doesn't matter  all that much, but if we ever tangles with any of the modern 1st rate armies, and especially if we cannot get air superiority, it is very likely to matter, I think.</comment>

<comment>The armed forces won't take men who can't meet the physical requirements either; there won't be anybody (male or female) on the team who can't, for example, carry an assigned load.I don't understand #4. We're talking about volunteer soldiers here, the ones who are in dangerous roles competed to get those positions, so I don't see them being upset that somebody is sitting at a desk somewhere.</comment>

<comment>Now, I don't think this is true for fireteams. I think you're conflating this with special ops and the like. Fireteams are just standard ground combat sub-units, like squad.So when a person enlists, they are not given choice of placement beyond any deal they make at enlistment. If they are in undifferentiated ground forces, they could end up as a supply sergeant, or they could be the non-com leader of a squad, or the could by the rifleman in a fireteam."The armed forces won't take men who can't meet the physical requirements either; there won't be anybody (male or female) on the team who can't, for example, carry an assigned load."They've already done this: as little as 3 years ago there were two standards for the timed 2 mile run, for example, male/female. If there is enough pressure to make the test identical, there is some fear that the standards could be lowered to being identical: the men's tests would be the same as the women's, but in all tests except for sit-ups, this would represent a significant drop in the performance level.http://www.military.com/milita...Here's an exceprt:"For the first time in more than 20 years, the Army is gearing  up to change its fitness test for every Soldier. Gone is the simple  pushup, sit up, and run routine, and in its place comes a battery of  sprints, jumps and rows."and"Army  officials are also looking into how to grade the new tests, with a  simple "excellent," "good" or "poor" potentially replacing a pass-fail  or a point score."So this tells us that in response to the directive to admit women into combat roles, the Army got rise of push-ups, sit-ups, and the 2 mile run, replaced it with sprints jumps and rows. And they have removed the FAIL bar, and replaced it with excellent, good, and poor, but apparently not disqualifying anyone.This really, REALLY looks to me like a lower standard.The pre-2011 male combat-ready physical tests represented a threshold of required physical ability--the armed forces were not trying to disqualify combat people--there was no need. They were ALL men, and they needed as many as they could, given that there was no draft. But these levels were deemed by the command structure to represent the minimum required physical ability to be in the field, in combat, and now for women this is less.So what happened? Did the armed forces make everything *lighter* so that it would be easier to carry? Or rather. if they made some parts lighter, did they increase the load in other areas: that is to say, if the combat infantry man/woman carried 60 lb in Korea, do they now carry 40lb, or, more likely, they just carry more payload (maybe 150 rounds of 308 in Korea, now 250 of 223 in Afghanistan).I will try to make it stark.Let's say that 100 women and 100 men *want* to be in combat units. If the armed forces leaves the physical tests as they were 3 years ago, as many as 85 of the women will not make it. Perhaps 20 of the men will not make it, but probably less than that.So what happens afterward? Do the 85 women meekly go back to support roles and forget their ambitions to lead a combat unit? Or do they, and other civilians like yourself, raise a sufficient ruckus to get them placed, somehow. If so, that "somehow" will be either:a) lower standards for women who will be expected to do the same physical job as men; orb) lower standards for both men and women.Now recall what I had just said: the levels from 3 years ago were put in place because military experts, who at that time had no motive to disqualify *anyone*, figured that the tests represented the minimum standard. If we either let women go in at a lower standard, or we lower the standard for both sexes, we have de facto not met the minimum physical requirements identified by men and women whose job it is to determine what a functional combat soldier must do.So do we say that they don't know what they are doing, but we, sitting and drinking a triple breve before a monitor somewhere on the west coast--we know better? Maybe we do, but this needs a lot of support.If it is true that the standard is not changed or reduced and few women can get in, and this is ACCEPTED as a reality, this is OK. There may be other issues that emerge, but I would think it's OK to allow qualified women to try, and possibly to fail--or succeed. But this has to be done without tweaking the standards.</comment>

<comment>But just because some one is an average physical performer it does not mean they will be exceptional in some other area.Or more to the point, there is no particular reason to think that a woman who meets the physical requirements will be exceptional in one of those areas compared to a random male.  Some will.  Some will be up to the physical standard and deficient in other areas.The Marines will figure it out.  I think this actually will be of benefit, but not for the reasons that progressive folks tend to imagine.  The Marines aren't going to discover a treasure trove of ass kicking females to fill combat roles. They're going to spend a lot of extra money and do a lot of planning for a crop of female Infantry that is barely going to exist.They're just going to pay more attention to setting actual physical requirements for these roles, instead of getting by on the fuzzy logic that any man can fill these roles as long as he made it through (male) boot camp.  Which is basically how it works now.  If you can hack boot camp and you can hack SOI (which is more technically demanding than boot camp, but less physically demanding), then you meet the standards to be a basic grunt.Or I should say, that's how it worked when I served.  That was 15 years ago, so maybe a more recent Marine enlistee can shed some light.</comment>

<comment>I don't think progressives are imagining a trove of ass-kicking females. I think they approach it from a similar perspective as others do: if an individual can hack it, they should have a shot at combat roles.Most people understand men will continue to outnumber women in combat roles.</comment>

<comment>While I am probably fine with this in theory, given the political realities and existing evidence, it is highly likely that standards will be reduced generally and reduced for females in particular in order to accomodate these political whims.  Moreover, I am not that confident that a female that is able to pass even an honest fitness test will perform as reliably as comparably scoring men several years hence.There are vast physical differences between men and women.  Most of these favor men by a very large margin in these sorts of roles.  Physical conditioning and determination can only accomplish so much and does little to deal with different baseline fragility.   I have known some very competitive female athletes where their teams had rates of injury MUCH higher despite measurably less aggressive play (e.g., repeated torn ACLs, broken bones, etc).  High rates of injuries like this alone can lead to reduced effectiveness and higher mortality rates in actual combat situations (never mind personality and other differences).</comment>

<comment>My god this is one of the dumbest things I have ever read. Wow.</comment>

<comment>As I think your detailed point by point refutation of his argument makes absolutely clear.  My take is that a) everyone will go into this saying that physical standards won't change to accommodate women b) it will become clear that vanishingly small numbers of women - perhaps none - get through c) it will be argued these standards are irrelevant in modern world, with other factors being more important d) as elsewhere in the armed forces, physical standards for women at the pointy end will be lowered significantly relative to men e) it won't matter for some time, if ever and f) at some stage the US armed forces will find itself without air superiority and short on helicopters and have to tab 90 km in 3 days carrying 30-40 kg loads and fight a battle at the end of it as the Brits did in the Falklands and not be able to do to it and lose a battle and perhaps a war.</comment>

<comment>If realistic evaluation of the physical differences where maintained, then the military could make functional female combat units.  As an example light sniper teams (no ghillie suits, etc).</comment>

<comment>Well said. Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Damn nice!</comment>

<comment>Averages tell you quite a bit about where to focus training resources. For example 85% of men who meet minimum physical standards can pass infantry training and 20% of females who who meet minimum physical standards can pass infantry training where are your dollars and time better spent?Considering how much is spent for more advanced or specialized training there is no justification for it.</comment>

<comment>I for one won't believe that we are really in 2015 (soon 2016) until we see quotas for transsexuals with physical handicaps in the Special Forces. We need to show our enemies who we are. The military has too far ignored, sidelined, and oppressed both the disabled and transsexuals, so it should show its openheartedness and institute a 10% minimum in all combat units of this special group of victims of patriarchal oppression.Age also shouldn't be a factor, ageism is just the flipside of transphobia and sexism. Octogenarian women (and some men, of course) should be welcomed with open arms in line infantry battalion, just as long as they don't have to handle those awful, awful weapons of war assault rifles, which should be banned. Give them a nice shotgun like Joe Biden said instead. It will scare the enemy by the sound that is makes. And you cannot miss with it.</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>This article is so filled with idiot ill informed comments it's not possible to address them all. However this is clear:   This decision will lead to more dead Marines</comment>

<comment>There's a reason why men and women's sport are separated. You don't see women in  mens major league baseball. soccer, football, basketball or hockey.  Why?  Because they are slower, less powerful, less accurate, and more indecisive when it's crunch time for big plays.   Now the so-called glass ceiling is shattered?  What's shattered is our collective ideas of reason and logic.</comment>

<comment>I'm all for it. Allowing poor and working class young women to take the place of my sons so that they can pursue their education and keep their limbs and their sanity is a win win.</comment>

<comment>Congrats- a new low in a place I thought had exhausted that possibility! Hope your sons steer clear of hurtful words while pursuing their educations...</comment>

<comment>No hurt intended. I have had enough men in my family chewed up and spit out by war that words are of very little concern.</comment>

<comment>The Day of "Killer Trannys in Space" has come. The apocalypse can't be far now.</comment>

<comment>The military can certainly allow women to join combat roles but this is exactly the wrong way to go about it.  Barring some exceptional athletes, most women do not have the minimum upper body strength required.  The solution is not to lower the standards.  The solution is to create women only combat units and build around the physical strengths and weakness of the average military ready woman.</comment>

<comment>Neither Barno nor Benshael know what they are talking about. What really sucks about their screed, is that they defer to a liberal [ and thus totally biased and ideological ] NPR to determine whether or not the same Marines who conquered Iwo Jima or held the Pusan, are the sexist as.holes of the 21st that will hold the women back simply because there is a greater need for combat equality, than there is the means by which female warriors can actually, unlike a fat, civilian, non-serving, Obamabot Carter [ hey, just like the other Carter, eh, except for the fact that that one, actually served ], deliver the goods when the deal goes down.Ten pullups Carter?Or three?The 100 in 9.1? [ men ]Or 10.2? [ women]?China?Or America..............?</comment>

<comment>The American armed forces will continue to be volunteer units, separated from and politically distinct from the population at large.These forces are, in many ways -- the French Foreign Legion of America . . . adding women to the mix doesn't change that at all . . .</comment>

<comment>The French Foreign Legion is made up of people from outside of France. Only the officers are French citizens. The US military draws its volunteer force from all across the country, and from every demographic. In other words, your comparison is utterly false.</comment>

<comment>It's meant to  point out a similarity, not an exact parallel.Readers need to have a degree of sophistication.This isn't exactly secret information:http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05...</comment>

<comment>That didn't refute anything I said. In the real world, far from the NYT's Manhattan, the majority of Americans not only are acquainted with the military, but know people that served.Again, the only similarity the US military has with the Foreign Legion is that they are both military organizations.</comment>

<comment>You Just illustrated my point, complete with arrogance  and anti-intellectualism . . .  In the real world, far from the NYT's Manhattan, the majority of Americans not only are acquainted with the military, but know people that served.Yes, if only those pointy-headed people would stop all that READING!This is Rushbo detritus . . .</comment>

<comment>You still haven't refuted one thing that I said. You can look at the demographics here:http://download.militaryonesou...You made a dumb comment that was a thinly veiled attempt to paint the members of the military as a mercenary force. You're now angry because I called you out on it. Own it and move on.</comment>

<comment>My comments were not thinly veiled, they point out a clear fact: the US military population is  markedly different from the traditional citizen army, and encouraged by its management to remain so.The US military is purposely separated from the American public since the Vietnam debacle showed its leaders that they cannot rely on citizen soldiers to fight their stupid wars.These soldiers display and people notice their much more conservative orientation.  Rush Limbaugh freely broadcasts to them -- this is a division of military commanders to shape the politics of service people -- and it works.The populations that are drawn from are not the issue, it's what segment of these populations they represent and encourage, and mold once they're in.Give orders to someone else -- maybe you're a collared subject, but the rest of us are able to speak and think outside your mental box.</comment>

<comment>A military can't be "separated" from a population from which it draws its volunteers, by definition. As I pointed out, they come from all walks of life and every area of the country. Your weak attempt to paint them as "the other" is a projection of your own biases against the military.By the way, along with Rush LImbaugh, AFN also broadcasts liberals such as Bill Press and Stephanie Miller. Of course, you would have know that if you would have an iota of knowledge as to what you were talking about, which you don't.</comment>

<comment>Thank you military info officer.Yes, they can be separated, and they are.You have no answer for the information in the Times article, just re-assertion of your talking points.You've distilled out a portion of the American public, and made it into a majority in the military, that does not jibe with the population at large.Yes, I'm sure you're proud to have Limbaugh on AFNhttp://www.csmonitor.com/USA/M...</comment>

<comment>You're the one that hasn't backed up your talk with evidence. I did, and you can't refute it. The people in the military come from all incomes, areas and political persuasions. In fact, more military people see themselves as independents and Democrats than they do as Republicans.https://www.washingtonpost.com...You simply don't know what you are talking about.</comment>

<comment>You simply present stuff that proves my point.First of all, you distort: you say  In fact, more military people see themselves as independents and Democrats than they do as Republicans.read the real info -- from your own "proof" below - - - -Headline: Iraq and Afghan vets are conservative. But, they’re not all Republicans.Conventional wisdom dictates that the military is one of the most Republican and conservative institutions in the United States. That's only half true.The current generation of military service members is more conservative than the public at large, for sure. But they are not much more Republican -- with nearly half identifying as political independents, according to a new poll of military service members from the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation.Just over a quarter of the 2.6 million military members who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001 identify as Republicans, outnumbering by 10 percentage points those who identify as Democrats. That compares with the general public's 6 to 11 point Democratic tilt in Post-ABC polls last fall. Fully 47 percent of veterans are political independents, compared with 40 percent of the public. When pushed, however, military members lean more Republican than Democratic by a significant 45 to 33 percent margin, with 15 percent remaining truly independent. The general public tends to tilt slightly Democratic.OOOPS!You're a well-trained trickster, a match for any tobacco company or coal industry obfuscator  -- but in the end -- you're just raking fertilizer into the conversation.</comment>

<comment>So 48% are either Democrats or independents. Which is three points more than the Republicans. I guess math isn't your best subject either.</comment>

The general public tends to tilt slightly Democratic.Carly Fiorina tends to do the same thing, when proven wrong, just double down on the falsehood.Been going on for some time now, this gap, as noted in this very publication,.http://www.theatlantic.com/mag...That's Tom Ricks, an expert and not hostile to the armed forces.It's a gap that's wide in many areas . . .http://www.military.com/daily-...But go on, keep denying it. It actually helps to have you do that -- a lesson for readers. </comment>

<comment>Pointing out the fact that 48% is larger than 45% is a falsehood? Interesting take.By the way, pointing out as the articles do that the share of the population that has or is serving is shrinking  is not the same as your argument that the service is becoming politicized.</comment>

<comment>From the article you  cited: When pushed, however, military members lean more Republican than Democratic by a significant 45 to 33 percent margin, with 15 percent remaining truly independent. The general public tends to tilt slightly Democratic.Selective, aren't we? Hoping no one reads down that far?And, true to your pr handbook, you just slide past the first article I cited -- here's the subhead . . .U.S. military personnel of all ranks are feeling increasingly alienated from their own country, and are becoming both more conservative and more politically active than ever before. Do they see America clearly?Again, this is from Tom Ricks, an expert on the military and very supportive of same.And, lest we forget, we can see specific examples -- say, Tom Cotton, a real bug-eyed militarist and extremist/nationalist/sexist -- pitch perfect example . . .http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/...http://www.dailykos.com/story/...http://www.salon.com/2015/03/1...</comment>

<comment>Independents make up 15%, Democrats 33%, and Republicans 44%. Which, again, means the majority aren't Republicans. And this was a recent poll of actual service members, not an almost 20 year old piece by Ricks.You point to Tom Cotton, I can point to Tammy Duckworth. Neither are evidence of anything, other than supporting my point that all types serve.</comment>

<comment>LOL.Yeah, pulling numbers out of your briefing book, no backup.Cotton much more typical.Male, Southern.The Ricks piece shows how long-standing this has been."All types seve" is not a statistic, especially when stacked against the evidence I've presented.Your comment list is "private" which often means a spokesperson, doing pr duty.You have me illustrate my point, however . . .</comment>

<comment>The numbers were right there in the poll, and you QUOTED them, idiot.The demographics data I linked showed the came from all walks of life and regions. The political polling I linked showed the majority were independents or Democrats.You can't refute any of that. The facts just don't back up your biases against the US military.</comment>

<comment>The crap you posted was unfounded, and the article you posted disproved your case -- as clearly highlighted.Here, lying propagandistWhen pushed, however, military members lean more Republican than Democratic by a significant 45 to 33 percent margin, with 15 percent remaining truly independent. The general public tends to tilt slightly Democratic.Here, armed forces troll, eben more evidence. Among the things he mentions is that the US military is drawn from a minority of citizens.Richard Myers, ex-US military chief, warns of split with civilianshttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-...Go try to fool some unemployed kid into joining up. Offer them a misleading "future" so they can get killed and/or mangled. Maybe you can get a promotion.</comment>

<comment>Lol. You're really dense. Take the Independents, at 15%, then add in the Democrats, at 33%.15 + 33 = 48%The number of Republicans is 45%.48>45In other words, you're wrong. That's a healthy mix of people in the military. And you're welcome for the math lesson.</comment>

<comment>What happens to the women who joined up assuming they would never be ordered into combat?.In past wars male soldiers in traditional non-combat jobs (band members, clerks, cooks, etc.) were sometimes ordered to pick up a rifle and head toward the enemy. But as males they entered service knowing that was a possibility.Although some women (mostly career officers) want to serve in combat I suspect that most women now serving wanted only "safe" assignments.Thanks to this change they now face the possibility of being ordered to fight.</comment>

<comment>This will give ISIS and other radical Islamists extra incentive to capture U.S. troops.</comment>

<comment>Women on the front lines in combat also means that more women will more likely be hit, stabbed, shot, and blown up by enemy men soldiers. That's going to be quite a shock to feminists who have come to assume that they can hit men all they want to and men aren't allowed to hit them back. Enemy men soldiers will be hitting them, a lot. And complaining that that is unfair to women isn't going to mean diddly to anyone.</comment>

<comment>Men have fought on the front lines for hundreds of years. I say nothing BUT women in the front lines for the next 100. They can even have their own gendered command structure IMHO. Deploy them tomorrow. 100% female commanded, led, fighting, communications, support, the works. Women want equality, let them have it but they don't get to dictate terms. Put up or shut up.</comment>
