<comment>I have been there Orange !  Once in the early 1990 and again about 4 years ago.  It's a facking shathole !   They are migrating back to cities like Jackson Ms. and turning them into shatholes.  Due to pure corruption and backwoods ignorance.  Have you heard of Kenny Stokes ?</comment>

<comment>Umm... Chicago is beautiful, I was there just last year. You have no idea what you're talking about, at all. You're just another poorly informed racist.</comment>

<comment>With a murder rate like that ?  How can it not be a shathole ?   Pssst, I'm a mixed race mutt.  I can't be racist.</comment>

<comment>Anyone can be racist if you believe a specific kind of people are inherently morally inferior and thus destroy the communities of which they migrate, similar to what you've done.I'm not calling you a racist, but you could be.</comment>

<comment>Specifics ?  The city of Jackson Ms. is 80 % black .   LEADERSHIP is the problem first and foremost.</comment>

<comment>Nice and extremely racist comment right there Orange.   Chicago by default is a shathole. Not because of the inhabitants. The murder rate.</comment>

<comment>“He has been with us so long that our whole industrial, commercial and agricultural structure has been built on a black foundation. It is the only labor we have—if we lose it, we go bankrupt.”That's the story of the Old South in a nutshell right there. They always needed black labor, just not black human beings.</comment>

<comment>A very interesting aspect of our history that few understand.The untold story though is that Northern cities were gearing up for the WWI demand and also the new automobile boom. After the Armistice, when the factories slowed right down, it was the new African Americans that were the first to be let go. When the boom of the '20s came along, the labor was fed more by white labor leaving the farms. The second wave of African Americans didn't happen until WWII loomed.Please, more of these articles.</comment>

<comment>It was a mixed bag.  Some unions and cities black and white workers forged long lasting bonds.  Others they fought as much with each other as with management.</comment>
