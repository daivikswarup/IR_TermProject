<comment>Since Malik recently came to the US on a visa from her previous home in Saudi Arabia, perhaps that process is a good place to start?</comment>

<comment>So you're advocating that we finally pull the plug on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and make them accountable for exporting and supporting Wahabbist Islam? Glad you think so.</comment>

<comment>Wait, we can't do that -- Saudi Arabia is one of our closest allies!</comment>

<comment>define ally first.</comment>

<comment>Apparently it means "country we buy stuff from, suck up to, tolerate massive human rights violations by, and supply massive amounts of weapons to, while they promulgate an ideology that threatens us."  You know, the usual.</comment>

<comment>With allies like Saudi Arabia...</comment>

<comment>*don't forget Pakistan*</comment>

<comment>You mean 'Porkistan'?</comment>

<comment>Obama pronounces it "Pockey Stan".</comment>

<comment>Ben Carson pronounces it "South America".</comment>

<comment>Ben Carson is barely sentient.</comment>

<comment>But he has such a nice smile...</comment>

<comment>Think of the money...er...children!</comment>

<comment>To me in this case, allies means Oilies.</comment>

<comment>Ha, these chickenhawk Repubs probably don't even understand why what you're saying is so important, especially after their behavior since Iraq 2003.</comment>

<comment>The only way to stop the Saudis from exporting this hateful ideology is to bomb Iran! Oh, and repeal Obamacare.Murica!</comment>

<comment>....or blame my friend Vladimir.</comment>

<comment>In fairness, Putin is a slippery bast*rd, and the only large head of state outside of military dictatorships who has probably personally tortured somebody.It is very easy to make him a boogie man</comment>

<comment>HW Bush was CIA director, maybe he got his hands dirty?  But no question, Putin is literally a Bond villain at this point.  I mean, polonium assassination? Nuts.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure Bush ordered it at some point. But let's not forget that Putin was a KGB operative. Do I have proof that he personally tortured somebody. No, but looking at him, he looks like the kind of person who could do it, then wash the blood off and make himself a cup of tea without any further consideration </comment>

<comment>Putin was a petty gangster in his youth, he got his hands dirty before he even got to the KGB</comment>

<comment>Oh totally. Bush is still a pussy. Just seemed like the kind of pussy that would torture someone to prove he's not a pussy, which is a total pussy move.</comment>

<comment>The FBI tells us that the terrorist responsible for the San Bernardino shooting was a Pakistani national and ISIS sympathizer who first entered the country on a K-1 Visa in July 2014..Senator Rand Paul has introduced legislation to suspend visas from high-risk countries.With 314 million Americans, we certainly don’t have a people shortage. A common sense approach is suspending immigration from countries where millions of Muslims advocate murder of non-believers in the name of Allah.</comment>

<comment>My understanding was that Malik was Pakistani, the couple met online and married while on hajj in Saudi Arabia but neither of them are actually Arabs.</comment>

<comment>They are both  ethnically Pakistani. Both of his parents were from Pakistan and his father left the United States to return there. </comment>

<comment>Great...Another refugee, who comes here to spit out an anchor baby, only to go back to the "war torn" area he fled etc...Sounds like the Boston bombers...Anybody looking at this pattern?</comment>

<comment>Uh..yeah. I´ll look into it right away. I´m heading over to WND.</comment>

<comment>Except he wasn't a refugee. The boston bomber wasn't a refuge either, but seeking asylum here in the USA.</comment>

<comment>Correct me if I'm wrong butif u r seeking asylum, u r a refugeehttps://www.google.com/webhp?s...</comment>

<comment>They are both technically Muslims.</comment>

<comment>She is, apparently, Pakistani as it is reported she has a Pakistani passport.</comment>

<comment>yes, Saudi Arabia is the brain of Wahhabism, and Pakistan is its musclesFrankly, there is very little difference between what the IS practically and officially demanding the people who are living under their reign, and what the Saudi Arabia practically and officially demanding its citizens to follow, for example:Official IS law "Muslims who convert to other religions will be given death sentence "Official Saudi Arabia law "It's a crime punishable by death for Saudis to convert to other religions "</comment>

<comment>Maybe you can start by freezing all immigration.</comment>

<comment>The man was born here.</comment>

<comment>His wife wasn't.</comment>

<comment>Stop .. you are make too much sense.</comment>

<comment>You think that stopping ALL forms of migration to our country makes sense?  If so, for how long?  Until there are no followers of Islam on Earth?</comment>

<comment>God forbid we push pause on the people Ponzi Scheme...Oh the horror...We have done so multiple times throughout our history...Seems appropriate now..</comment>

<comment>As someone with a foreign born wife, you do realize how radical what you are purposing? How many countries do not allow for foreign spouses? Are you that cowardly?</comment>

<comment>Maybe we can just allow women from Brazil. </comment>

<comment>LOL, good luck stopping fiance and marriage visas, especially when only one person who has immigrated that way (out of hundreds of thousands, if not millions) has committed a terrorist act/mass murder.</comment>

<comment>Muslims are the only immigrants that grow less and less assimilated as time goes by.  Each successive generation is more ethnic.  A complete reversal, the way these immigrants settle in.It's vital to begin with simple steps, taking our lead from France:France is shutting down mosques.  They began with 3 and will move forward from there.  That needs to be done here.France prohibits hijabs, burkas, niqabs.  That needs to be done here.</comment>

<comment>Just back from Paris. Your post is contradicted by our seeing hijabs, burkas, niqabs, and plenty of other elegant and fashionable scarves, shawls, hats and other styles for chilly days on the rues and boulevards. And as if anyone cared. All in a most civilized energetic welcoming atmosphere for all.</comment>

<comment>You're back from Paris, which has a hijab prohibition which is being enforced.  If Muslims are breaking the law, that might be what you're referring to, and I'm sure you love it.  However, the law isn't going away, and it will get much worse for you all now that you are committing horrific acts in the country you people chose to move to.Further, France just shut down 3 mosques and is about to close more.There can be no civilized anything where there is Islam.  It's demonic.</comment>

<comment>My goodness. First, I am a US native, grandchild of Armenians who were caught up un the Armenian genocide in Turkey in 1915.In my post I merely reported what we saw in Paris. If I could I would spend much more of my time there, and partly because I felt welcomed. By all, Muslims we met included, among whom were security officers who checked us out on entering  Musée Picasso and Notre Dame.I am very sorry but your postings ring false.</comment>

<comment>what is the difference between Islam and the so-called christian fundamentalists here?  Not too much from where I sit.</comment>

<comment>Islam - the cult which has been massacring people in 610 and has not stopped since (even up to the present).  Every Muslim country is a country that was converted at the point of a sword and through beheading.As for Islam in 2015, Islam is fighting a war, not in Israel, and not in Europe, and not in the U.S., but WORLDWIDE, from India (where they massacre people daily), to Argentina, to Mali, to Sweden, to the U.S., to EVERYWHERE.It's a sick cult, and no, all religions are not alike.  I'm sick and tired of people trying to pull justifications out of their rear to "forgive" the massacres of Islam.  Jainism is peaceful, as is Buddhism.  Hinduism is not flying planes into buildings, Judaism is not shooting cartoonists in the face (though they are being stabbed and bombed daily by Islam), Christians are not removing the genitals of females, nor committing honor killings, nor doing tying gays to a chair and kicking it off a high roof, etc. etc. etc.STOP DEFENDING PSYCHOPATHS.</comment>

<comment>Please provide battles, dates, etc. for the Islamic conquest of Indonesia, the largest single Muslim country.</comment>

<comment>Bombings of embassies, bombings of hotels, bombings of stock exchanges, bombings of cafes and coffee shops and restaurants, bombings of consulates, bombings of buses, burnings of churches and temples, from the 15th century to the present, Islamic barbarity and extreme cruelty toward Buddhists, Hindus and Christians has taken over what was NOT Islamic.Fact is, there are no true Islamic countries.  All have been taken over by the savagery and psychopathy of Islam's followers.You seriously need to do a little research before you type BS.</comment>

<comment>In other words, you have a generalized dislike for Islam and Muslims, which you cannot or will not back up by any specific facts. Got it.</comment>

<comment>Islam?  You BETCHA.  Muslims?  Former Muslims, those who have abandoned the cult of Islam are perfectly fine with me.  As for your question, you know damned well that Islam functions by taking over countries at the point of a sword, gun, torture, violence, etc.  You don't need me to tell you this.  Your problem is that you know this, and think it's okay.  </comment>

<comment>If what you say is true, you should have no trouble mustering the facts to back it up. So I'm calling you on it yet again: name the specific, major acts of violence by which Muslims established Islam as the majority religion of Indonesia. Battles, assassinations, other violent acts, and approximate dates.</comment>

<comment>Muslim, I'm neither your librarian, nor your dhimmi.  Start researching it now.</comment>

<comment>Who´s defending you? Certainly not me.</comment>

<comment>Uggghhh.... your stroll through orange county I'm sure also let you rest easy that there's no poverty in America too.</comment>

<comment>Actually, American Muslims are much more assimilated because of our separation of Church and State, their higher education levels, and greater economic opportunity. If anything, our Muslims can serve as a model and a reserve of moderated interpretation in the long run process for reformation of Islam. Relatively few are radicals, and many more are cooperative with law enforcement despite the overall prejudice that some Americans have against them.</comment>

<comment>BS.  You're excellent at taqiyya.  Congrats.</comment>

<comment>The ones who come here to study then work here? Sure! It's very likely none of these Syrians could pass a GED test though. </comment>

<comment>Do mean furthering a police state?  Think first about the ramifications.</comment>

<comment>No, actually.  I suggest responding to the war by fighting Islam where it is found:  mosques - the birth of terrorists, stopping all immigration (since subsequent generations are even less assimilated than the first - Muslims are "different" in everything, aren't they, the poor dears?), spying of Muslims, particularly those who have been even remotely on sites which are associated with terrorism - CAIR comes to mind, as it has been listed by the FBI as a terrorist-funding organization (even though the Obama Admin has been very friendly to it).  In other words, they are fighting a war against us.  We'll fight the war right back.</comment>

<comment>CAIR has not been "listed By the FBI as a terrorist funding organization", you pathetic little creature.</comment>

<comment>Is that so?  You need to google it.  I'll get you started and you continue after this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Correct.  We could have prevented that by denying entry to his parents, thirty-odd years ago.  It's too late for that, but it's not too late to start denying entry from now on to anyone *like* his parents.</comment>

<comment>Makes about as much sense as freezing all gun sales.  Which is to say, no sense at all.</comment>

<comment>You want to freeze immigration to America from any country???That's totally unnecessary.We in Europe will gladly take all your undocumented Mexicans if you take all our documented (including European born) Muslims.</comment>

<comment>I´ll make you a better deal. We´ll send you Donald Trump, and you can keep Berlusconi.</comment>

<comment>We should deport the Kardashians.</comment>

<comment>Kardashistan won´t have them.</comment>

<comment>Japan doesn't have these types of problems and it ain't because of their gun laws.</comment>

<comment>They have the legacy of a brutal World War and being brutal hegemons prior to that.  Having actually dealt with war makes the citizens less likely to think they are armchair chickenhawks.</comment>

<comment>Actually it's because they don't let the Muslims in.</comment>

<comment>Actually they do, on tourist visas.  There's also a rather large Muslim Turkish community in Japan.  Historically, btw, terrorists use tourist visas.</comment>

<comment>I think you mean Germany, no?</comment>

<comment>No. You are incorrect. There is not a large Turkish Muslim community in Japan.You may need to quantify your use of the word "large."</comment>

<comment>I meant to write their largest Muslim community is Turkish.</comment>

<comment>I don't think ISIS is in Turkey, they have a very different language and culture from Iraq. Terrorists blow things up there but I don't think the terrorists actually come regular parts of Turkey, more like border areas near other countries. </comment>

<comment>Serena Shim, the American reporter who died in mysterious circumstances in Turkey the other day, had previously reported that ISIS militants were being smuggled back and forth over the border with Turkey. The Turkish government then accused her of spying.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/new...Also, Erdogan is an Islamist, although of a less violent sort.</comment>

<comment>It's because they have zero presence in the Middle East or other Muslim regions.  If they decide they are going to join some international coalition to bomb in these regions, I suspect they'll be targets, too.I am not for a second suggesting the evil barbarians "have a point."  I'm merely looking at what they want to achieve - hegemony over a particular region, who is in their way to achieving that (US, France, Britain, Russia...), and noticing that it is those countries they are attacking, not ones which are not in their way.  They are not killing people in Chile, Japan, Ireland, Barbados, Germany, Mexico, etc. </comment>

<comment>The ISIS and AQ issue is mostly found in Iraq and not other countries that have a lot of Muslims. Just because terrorism is based on Islam doesn't mean all Muslims believe in terrorism.That's like saying Christians all support the Planned Parenthood shooters, but there are plenty of predominantly Christian countries without anti abortion violence.The Muslims in Japan probably come from countries like Malaysia, India and Indonesia that don't have these kinds of terrorist groups. However the US and especially Europe is closer via airplane to the ISIS area.</comment>

<comment>"Just because terrorism is based on Islam doesn't mean all Muslims believe in terrorism."Of course.  What in the world gave you the idea I thought otherwise?  Maybe you mean to respond to someone else?My point is that those Muslims who are terrorists, what .03%?, are upset about our presence in the Middle East and other Muslim-populated regions and are attempting to become a hegemon in those regions.  They are attacking nations which are obstacles to that goal, not nations who are not an obstacle to that goal.</comment>

<comment>Yikes I hope you are wrong on your .03% that would make for 300,000 terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Math isn't my strong suit.  :) But hopefully you catch my drift.</comment>

<comment>No you may be correct which is scary...1 billion Muslims makes for a lot of terrorists.</comment>

<comment>There's millions of Muslims who believe in radical Islamic fundamentalism. Fortunetly there's approximately 1.6 billion Muslims on the planet so the actual portion of the overall population that is radicalized is rather small.Watch - someone will post a pew research survey saying 28% of Muslims agree with suicide bombing civilians in defense of Islam and then claim 28% of Muslims support terrorism. Happens almost every time. </comment>

<comment>The percentage may be low but if it is really 1.6 billion and .03% are engaged in terrorism that would be 4.8 million which is a frighteningly high number.</comment>

<comment>That number sounds high, but even if its lower, it's still in the millions. However, it's not like it's one homogenous group. It's a bunch of different groups, and they often work against each other. And not everyone of those Muslims is a killer - most are not - they just ascribe to certain radical beliefs. </comment>

<comment>480,000, not 4.8 million.</comment>

<comment>Ahh yes, decimal point location makes all of the difference. Still a staggeringly high number if accurate.</comment>

<comment>All perfectly bogus numbers. Meaningless in the grand scheme.</comment>

<comment>Umm... I agree with your point that all Muslims are not terrorists, but you seem to be unaware of the great many terrorist attacks that have occurred around the world, many of them in Muslim majority countries. Muslims are, in fact, the largest group of victims of this particular brand of extremist right wing terrorism. Groups who, if the were Christian, we would be condemning as the extreme right wing, have been attacking Muslims in Muslim majority countries for a long time now, as well as in countries that border on Muslim countries. There was just an article on this very site after the Paris attacks more or less scolding people for reacting to Paris and not reacting to an attack in Beirut the day before.Malaysia, specifically, is an interesting example, and one I've been following with unquiet feelings. It is 60% Muslim, which is puts it in a relatively unique category because it is Muslim majority, but not overwhelmingly so. It was once secular and no longer is. There is an interesting comparison with Turkey because whereas in Turkey women wanted to wear a headscarf and were disallowed in certain places, in Malaysia women who don't want to wear a headscarf have reported being pressured to do so.Islamism is a worldwide movement to impose a non-Democratic theocracy wherever it can.</comment>

<comment>Japan sent troops to the ME at some point in the past decade. Don't remember the details. That's what inspired Al Qaeda to kidnap some Japanese dudes in iraq. I'm basing that on memory though, I could be wrong. (Regardless, I'm agreeing with your pont)</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the info.</comment>

<comment>Regarding Germany, they had a bomb threat that cause a stadium in Hanover to be evacuated.</comment>

<comment>Japan has very strict immigration policies. Essentially, they don't let anyone in. I suspect that allows them to avoid terrorism from islamic fanatics more than their gun laws do, so yes, I agree.</comment>

<comment>Has more to do with (overly broad generalization ) the Japanese culture being surprisingly racist</comment>

<comment>They do have a number of foreign guest workers, some more documented than others. Residency can be a bit tougher - but also, they're suffering from somewhat of a demographic challenge as a result, and would sorely benefit from increased immigration to offset their aging population. South Korea is the same way.</comment>

<comment>It also has caused a long term recession because they are losing young workers. Very few people die of terrorism in the West. I'd rather take my chances so at least there are enough working aged adults around when I'm old to pay my social security and Medicare benefits.</comment>

<comment>Chris, I hear what your saying,  but I'm not willing to take my chances,  even if the loses are minimal. It's the principal of it. I don't want to lose to these bastards. </comment>

<comment>Aum Shinrikyo says hello.</comment>

<comment>They havent spent a century screwing around in the M.E.</comment>

<comment>...including a non sequitur aggressive invasion of a sovereign nation in the Middle East within the last 15 years.This also explains the reticence of the government of Iraq to host an enduring commitment of American troops- they didn't want them in the first place. Unlike, say, the government of South Korea.</comment>

<comment>Yes it is. Japan has had nerve gas attacks and psychos going on knife rampages, but  neither of those kill as many people as a semiautomatic rifle in a crowded room. Canada has immigration that is more permissive than the US but the worst terrorist attack here in recent times killed 1 person</comment>

<comment>Nope. It's because of a homogenpus population</comment>

<comment>Is it important to distinguish between attacks planned and carried out by agents of ISIS and attacks carried out in the name of ISIS?  I think so, but it is certainly a conversation I'd like to see take place in the halls of Congress before any rash decisions are made.Here is hoping.</comment>

<comment>I'm hoping to wake up naked with Scarlett Johannson tomorrow... Crap in one hand, hope in the other--see which one fills up first.</comment>

<comment>Oh, did I forget to type using the sarcasm font again?  Darn.</comment>

<comment>Well, there go my chances. . . . but given that there's this issue with my wife and dog already in the bed, most likely I'll wind up on the floor if Scarlett happens by.</comment>

<comment>If we are talking about Scarlett Johansen I suggest not pooping in your hand, but rather use it, well... To think about Scarlett Johansen. 😍</comment>

<comment>"A conversation I'd like to see take place in the halls of Congress before any rash decisions take place." Have you met our congress? They seem to operate these days by careening wildly from one can they can't kick any further down to the road to the next before taking a much needed rest.Rash decisions, especially rash dicisions for political points to hit the other side with are the name of the game</comment>

<comment>Hey, at least they're not getting into brawls or beating other members senseless.  Anymore.https://en.wikipedia.org/w/ind...Or tear-gassing each other, for that matter:http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worl...</comment>

<comment>They don't duel anymore, which might be a more efficient way of figuring out what to do. Better than what they do now</comment>

<comment>any one of us could go on facebook right now and take 15 seconds to post that we're pledging our allegiance to ISIS. does that mean all our future actions qualify as ISIS "taking action in america?".sure looks like an act of radical islamic terror, but ascribing this to ISIS looks pretty absurd at this point.</comment>

<comment>ISIS takes credit for everything short of someone stubbing their toe, but yet they remain silent and have been about their involvement in this? I’d be slow to link it to ISIS too.It's looking more and more like a lone wolf thing than anything else.</comment>

<comment>No the female shooter was reported to have joined ISIS via Facebook. FBI has now said its officially a terrorist act.http://m.timesofindia.com/worl...</comment>

<comment>Did she "join" or just "pledge"?  There's probably a difference.</comment>

<comment>There is a difference considering that there is no evidence (so far) that she actually spoke to, met, or joined IS or was planning to.</comment>

<comment>That was my point.</comment>

<comment>You are clueless as usual. Laughable.</comment>

<comment>whatever - everyone would know they are terrorists. Come on.</comment>

<comment>So, if she hadn't pledged her loyalty to ISIS, she wouldn't have been a terrorist?</comment>

<comment>give it up/ it's terrorism with or without. You are a little behind.Too many terrorist sympathizers on here. Disgusting. </comment>

<comment>Why do you keep backing down from your own points, you silly little troll?Are you Breitbart trained?</comment>

<comment>Oops. All that name-calling and I was right about it all after all. I'm sure you feel pretty embarrassed about it.</comment>

<comment>Wow! You were "right" about something that we already knew.Nice try, clown.</comment>

<comment>Does name-calling help your low self-esteem issues? Apparently.Nope my point was it was ISIS backed and you denied it. Not to bright now that I was shown to be right :(</comment>

<comment>What difference did it make in what she did?</comment>

<comment>- Just pledging: She's swearing to follow ISIS ideology without actually being in contract with/directed by a larger cell or part of the organization.- Joining: She may have been directed by or coordinating with a larger cell which might have other plans for the area or the United States.So yeah, there's a big difference.</comment>

<comment>I can't believe you just said she "joined ISIS on Facebook" without a trace of satire.</comment>

<comment>It's true. Did you think they had a human resources dept.http://variety.com/2015/digita...</comment>

<comment>Still no trace of satire, and now no self-awareness either.</comment>

<comment>If someone has intentions and pledged to ISIS in any way, was in contact with ISIS, had a lot of pipe bombs and weaponry, was radicalized, and shot 14 people...it's terrorism. Sorry you don't get it. </comment>

<comment>I'm impressed with your goal post-moving skills.Sorry you're making an ass of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Sorry you are a terrorist defender - horrid!</comment>

<comment>Nice try, clown</comment>

<comment>Why are you still acting like terrorism is what's being debated? You're way out of your league here sweetheart.  Everyone knows it's terrorism. That doesn't mean it's ISIS.</comment>

<comment>It's about 80% and rising  that ISIS funded it. How did they afford a newer Yukon, house/rent, travel and all the weaponry etc on his low paying job. Think outside the box. And it's all the same anyway. Muslim ideology Terrorist groups. Why does it matter, but will be proven soon, that it's ISIS. </comment>

<comment>The dude was earning 70 k a year. He wasn't working at Burger king, you silly troll.</comment>

<comment>...says the real troll. Link please I heard much lower. </comment>

<comment>Oops as I thought bright one- it's ISIS. Who's out of their league?</comment>

<comment>No, but they have a terrorist help desk.http://www.nbcnews.com/storyli...</comment>

<comment>Oh really?"The shooting rampage that killed 14 people in California on Wednesday is being investigated by U.S. authorities as an act of terrorism that may have been inspired by overseas extremist groups.“This is now a federal terrorism investigation,” the FBI director, James Comey, said at a briefing in Washington Friday. There is no indication that the attackers, Tashfeen Malik and Syed Rizwan Farook, are “part of a cell or network” of terrorists, Comey said."http://www.bloomberg.com/news/...</comment>

<comment>Update - it's a terrorist attack. Why do y'all work so hard to dispute it.http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/04...</comment>

<comment>Obviously it was a terror attack. But we don't know if they had joined ISIS.</comment>

<comment>Stop making an ass of yourself, sarah.</comment>

<comment>You can sign up with ISIS on Facebook?  This must be news to Zuckerberg.</comment>

<comment>Yep - via Facebook. Shame on allowing it. </comment>

<comment>You're not wrong.  However it's important to note that ISIS has specifically encouraged these types of lone-wolf attacks through it's propaganda.  Something that Al-Quada was not generally inclined to advocate.</comment>

<comment>Osama and his replacement advocated lone wolf attacks all of the time.</comment>

<comment>This is how the atlantic sells it's articles.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be buying</comment>

<comment>Nope. Don't buy their nonsense. I'm here to educate dumbasses  like you.</comment>

<comment>Only the lo-life lo-class idiot fkheads moron mongrels attack posters with their ignorance like you.  Maybe one day you will crawl out of the sewer and rise to the level of a human being.  Do Not reply to any of my posts again.</comment>

<comment>I'm saddened there are such vile imbeciles like you around with nothing but piss and vinegar yet devoid of an iota if reason. BTW, I'll reply to whomever I damn well want. Even to cretins like you.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand.  What's the difference between pledging allegiance to ISIS and ISIS taking action in America?  I think people expect that ISIS only operates by having physical contact and training of terrorists abroad and then sending them to another country to commit their atrocities.  In fact, they spend at least as much time on the internet attempting to inspire "lone wolf" type attacks, which I suspect this was.  ISIS was probably just happily surprised that this couple went off.</comment>

<comment>i think there's a big difference between someone being actively in touch with members of ISIS over a period of time and someone self-identifying as a member (well, not even that, really - just pledging allegiance to an ISIS leader in the midst of the attack).while i agree that it's entirely possible that ISIS somehow inspired the attack, i think referring to this as "ISIS in America" is pretty irresponsible fear mongering.and as someone else pointed out below, ISIS is normally pretty quick to take credit for this sort of thing, so it's surprising that they haven't done so already.</comment>

<comment>Well, scary headlines aside, I just really don't see a difference between self-identifiers, actively being in touch with IS (remotely) and true foot soldiers.</comment>

<comment>whoa whoa whoa, what's this, a reasoned, non-vitriolic disagreement on the atlantic?  you're doing it all wrong, my friend!</comment>

<comment>The internet just broke!</comment>

<comment>You are both hitler. There, I fixed it </comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the difference would be that randos like these San Bernardino attackers wouldn't have the help to carry out something like 9/11.</comment>

<comment>I heard she liked two ISIS posts on facebook and tried to poke King Daesh.</comment>

<comment>ISIS is a 21st century terrorist organization, utliizing social media, the world is their battlefield.</comment>

<comment>The conservatives provided the ammunition.</comment>

<comment>That's just stupid. But, I've come to expect this from liberals. I guess you've at least come around to accepting that this is terrorism, rather than a "mass shooting." I'm guessing that's why you sound so bitter.</comment>

<comment>I'm not bitter sonny, I just am honest, realistic and right on target.  Oh, I am also not afraid and believe the vast majority of Muslims and Mexicans are good decent law abiding people.  Now, go ahead an insult me, the only way you folks know how to respond.</comment>

<comment>So, it wasn't a mass shooting? Did they run up to all those people and jam those bullets into their bodies?</comment>

<comment>It was islamic terrorism. Don't be so stupid.</comment>

<comment>So, it wasn´t a mass shooting?</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>You sound like you worship them or something. Dry your panties out please and stop being treasonous.</comment>

<comment>Because of the specific target, I’m betting that it was a combination of (possibly) settling some old work score   while  using their radical views to justify, train for, and carry out the attack.It lies somewhere in the middle of the continuum and combination between “workplace violence” and “Islamic terror.”</comment>

<comment>I bet you're right.  It's very telling that these two decided upon his workplace as the target.  I suspect they were preparing to commit this atrocity some place and only decided on upon this particular target only recently due to something that pissed him off.</comment>

<comment>Essentially a repeat of Ft. Hood shooting.</comment>

<comment>The concept that he was planning to eventually attack something anyway, but then Bob was a jerk at the Christmas party or something so he said "eh let's go for it now", is...some combination of chilling and horrifying and kind of darkly funny.</comment>

<comment>Bob should have thought twice before spiking the egg nog.  I blame Bob.</comment>

<comment>I was thinking that they had it planned for another location, but the argument (or whatever it was) with his coworkers led him to change targets and strike earlier than planned.</comment>

<comment>Climate change is probably the single largest contributor.Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>I heard ISIS is the biggest contributor to climate change because they hate us. </comment>

<comment>There's a smart guy by the name of Iyad El-Baghdadi who says that this kind of greyness, the "lone wolf vs. 'proper' ISIS operation" thing that's hard to define, is part of the point. They want people to be inspired to garage band their own terrorism, they want Americans to embrace Trump rhetoric, and they'll be more than happy to take credit for whatever attack comes up regardless.</comment>

<comment>That's right, and ISIS also definitely wants the West to over-react against its Muslim populations, to further radicalize them.</comment>

<comment>I'm kind of the "attack the broader ideas that encourage extremism while holding firm on the rights of people" mindset, the Maajid Nawaz school, but the current discourse in the US seems to be "internment camps" vs. "white shooters are called mentally ill".</comment>

<comment>The problem is that when you have 45% of people calling for internment camps it's kind of hard to be comfortable saying anything that could be construed as agreeing with those people.</comment>

<comment>I dig that, I really do. I've seen the right-wing rhetoric on this get worse than....actually, it's probably the worst it has ever been since Paris. I saw the horrible blob of a human being yell at the poor guy in Tennessee who just wanted to expand his mosque. I'm not with that crowd nor do I even comprehend mentally how anyone winds up that hateful.But I guess my counterpoint would be, if the left isn't even really talking coherently about radical Islamism at all, doesn't that give a little room for the Trump types to fill the void for the average person? This doesn't seem to be working much.</comment>

<comment>It does.  But nuanced argument is usually at a disadvantage in most situations.  I really don't know the answer here.</comment>

<comment>I heard Sam Harris articulate a similar point, that the left, by not discussing the realities of the situation with Islamism is creating a vacuum for the right wing crazies to fill. Its actually quite true I think. If its the fear of saying the wrong thing or being "pc" I don't know. Sometimes I think its the natural state of the left, generally the smarter and more thoughtful branch of things, to want to have discussions and analysis and in certain cases that can seem weak and ineffective.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I have some mixed views on Harris but I basically agree with him on this. His recent book with Maajid Nawaz (where, really, Nawaz was the main intellectual driver) was a really good read on this specific topic.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like victim blaming to me. My hesitation to become a generalizing anti-Islamic bigot is not responsible for the mere existence of xenophobic right wing trolls.</comment>

<comment>See,I think you've created a terrible false choice for yourself. Being aware of a threat posed by religious extremists, and discussing it realistically doesn't mean you're a bigot. When maniacs like Warren Jeffs and other Mormon fundamentalists are out there creating compounds of abused kids and forced subservience onto women, I think its perfectly reasonable to discuss that problem as one of a fundamentalist branch of a religion that needs to be shut down. This wouldn't mean you hate Mormons in general, and certainly no honest or reasonable person would assume you do.</comment>

<comment>I feel something similar when it comes to my opinion about a muscular foreign policy (I agree to a certain extent with old school neocon thought in that I think we have a moral imperative to use our resources in the extension and assertion of the principals of liberty and human rights.)The problem of course is that I say something like that, and the company I can be construed to count myself among are for the most part war criminals</comment>

<comment>Me too, that's a good analogy.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  And Osama bin Laden (hell be upon him) explicitly stated that he wished to inspire random jihadists.</comment>

<comment>It may not have been ISIS but I think the girl was already radicalized and was hardcore fundamentalist.http://time.com/4137383/stop-s..."The lawyer said the entire Farook family is shocked by what happened, and rarely spoke to Malik, whom he described as a “housewife” who usually wore a burka and who rarely showed her face even to her husband’s relatives."</comment>

<comment>Only if you're a moron and want to be put on a NSA/CIA/FBI watch list. ;)</comment>

<comment>i have no doubts that i'm already on several.</comment>

<comment>Exactement ! I only came for the butt hurt, but I'm sadly not satisfied. Maybe I should wait around some more. </comment>

<comment>you shouldn't have to wait too much longer before the trolls from both sides show up.</comment>

<comment>Jeez, it only took a few minutes, it's like.... like...like a dog whistle. </comment>

<comment>Any article on the internet, especially The Atlantic that has Islam as a subject, no matter how direct, turns into a dog whistle for the bigots and trolls. Sad really....</comment>

<comment>Things got pretty disgusting here yesterday.</comment>

<comment>It's been getting steadily disgusting in here by the day and the article.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps Drudge has ordered a "hit" on the Atlantic. The place has been rather thick with flying monkeys as of late.</comment>

<comment>You can tell when drudge plugs a story. The comments board becomes complete unhinged</comment>

<comment>True. It's the same thing over at MJ whenever David Corn writes an article involving one of Drudge's sacred cows. Over a thousand comments within a couple of hours, and the drool buckets keep returning for days.</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic boards aren't great, but there is a sizable group of serious (and not so serious comentators.) It's when I visit boards on drudged articles that I understand what mad dog rage and fear really looks like when it's roiling round in a gyre of sh*t</comment>

<comment>We know for certain that the neo-nazi forum deliberately targeted this one for a troll attack. Breitbart and Drudge just hyperlink here.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. I´ve been noticing an awful lot of outspoken white supremacists (not just silly trolls like dear old Pat) popping up here. They were most likely attracted by the attacks on their new-found guru, Donald Trump.</comment>

<comment>So lets see here, first pledges allegiance to isis, then shoots up a Christmas party full of people. Yep, must be work place violence. Let's ban all the guns, says no sane person at this point.</comment>

<comment>i don't recall arguing that this was workplace violence, or in favor of banning guns.  hell, i even said IN MY ORIGINAL POST that this appears to be radical islamic terror.  i'm not sure what you're trying to argue for here.</comment>

<comment>If a terrorist has a day job and goes to said job to commit an act of terrorism, then it is terrorism and workplace violence.They are not mutually exclusive. </comment>

<comment>Why can't we at least have instant background checks before being allowed to possess IEDs? That would have helped.Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>We shouldn't allow people on the no flight list to purchase IEDs as well. </comment>

<comment>She joined allegiance with ISIS during the shooting. How weird is that?Anyhow, something can be workplace violence and terrorism at the same time. Like if a terrorists has a job and goes to said job to commit an act of terrorism.Cheers. </comment>

<comment>Have to disagree; the proclamation of a new caliphate is significant to some believers, and acts can in fact be accurately ascribed to instructions coming from that authority. Proximity is not important.Simply because the we insist on saying things like "the so called Islamic State" doesn't mean they are not a State. States have authority, and issue orders all the time. When those orders are followed, and those doing it say they are indeed following them, how can not ascribe those actions to that State?</comment>

<comment>who upvotes your bullshit?</comment>

<comment>i'm not entirely sure why you harbor such animosity towards me.  was there some part of my post you disagree with?</comment>

<comment>I don't the family of the people killed really are too concerned about splitting hairs regarding the affiliation these Islamic trash worked under.</comment>

<comment>you're entirely correct, but i'm engaging with the content presented in the article, which tries to sell the narrative that this was "isis taking action".</comment>

<comment>No shit, but everyone else should be. It's kind of monumentally important to know if they were lone wolves or part of an organized network.</comment>

<comment>I'm just thankful that Obama continues to insist this wasn't terrorism because then it couldn't have been terrorism. #presidentfacepalm</comment>

<comment>Did I miss a press conference today?</comment>

<comment>I might have.  Last time I saw, he was insisting this may just be a "workplace" incident...  Can't remember the last time a disgruntled employee convinced his young-mother wife to join him in a suicide mission on one of those but heh...</comment>

<comment>It's true.  Executive leaders of the United States have magical powers that allows them to know motives immediately and talk about them before the law enforcement is ready to.</comment>

<comment>sIf one person can't know another's motives (in spite of written evidence in this case) then you must be in favor of eliminating hate crime prosecution then, right? Except, that's a tenet of left wing silliness... So, I'm sure you see a big difference.</comment>

<comment>Excellent attempt of toward goal post moving.</comment>

<comment>He said that it could be terrorism, but they still weren't sure at the time. Stop taking your cues from Breitbart.</comment>

<comment>#alaundrylistofwingnutmemesisn'tconvincingtryagainandilikehowyoucantcomeupwithanyonebetterhaha</comment>

<comment>Climate change was a contributing factor however.Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>Anyone who supported the Iraq war is also to blame for ISIS.</comment>

<comment>ISIS came about in the wake of the brutal crackdown by Assad of the Arab Spring protests in Syria.  Assad was in power pre 9/11.  The nation has incredible poverty and potable water shortages which lead to radicalization -- it's a bit more complicated than that.</comment>

<comment>Incorrect. ISIS is from Iraq, not Syria. They were once an al Qaeda group in Kurdistan but splintered off from AQ during the Iraq war after their current leader (an Iraqi) was imprisoned in an Iraqi prison camp run by the US military.</comment>

<comment>Apologies -- you're right.</comment>

<comment>What are we going to do about ISIS and the behavior associated with that entire group. That's the crux of the issue.I understand that the US military has caused a lot of stupid stuff in the past but there isn't any excuse for ISIS / AQ type groups continuing to act out in an uncontrolled manner and against noncombatants.</comment>

<comment>Here's what we shouldn't do. Bomb innocent civilians and support brutal regimes which sponsors or instigates terrorism such as Saudi Arabia and Israel. That's the issue. Not what we should do to stop Isis but what we ARE doing to make Isis stronger.</comment>

<comment>I agree that we should focus less on blowing people up in other countries and more on helping poor Americans.</comment>

<comment>lol, 'Climate change made ISIL arise'</comment>

<comment>Breitbart meme.</comment>

<comment>The idea of ISIS was slowly brewing probably as far back as the early Fifties.</comment>

<comment>So Hillary is to blame for ISIS. Got you.</comment>

<comment>Yeah she is. Got you, moron.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. ISIS did not exist during the time of the Iraq war. They grew out of the civil war in Syria, as well as the vacuum left behind when the US pulled out of Iraq too soon.</comment>

<comment>No, ISIS grew out of an amalgamation of exiled Ba'athists and the remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Yup and their core leadership is probably the remnants of senior enlisted and officers of Saddam's army. </comment>

<comment>Pick up a book. Read it.</comment>

<comment>You've got to remember that one possibility is that this isn't either "lone wolfing" or part of a network, but something in-between.  It's been predicted as far back as 9/11's aftermath, and maybe earlier, that this kind of Islamist terrorism is based on radical leadership inspiring attacks without actually being directly connected to them.  They simply put out a call for violence and make things like ideology and attack instructions publicly available without directly contacting or networking with adherents.  In other words, this pair could have been entirely inspired and directed by ISIS philosophy without having ever been in touch with them.</comment>

<comment>Question: Let's suppose we're all the way back to December, 1941. Germany has just declared war on the US. A German immigrant now living in the US takes it upon themselves to fight for the Reich by gathering up some weaponry and shooting up a gathering of employees at a nearby government office. So, what sort of discussion do you think we'd be having in the aftermath? Do you really think we'd be wasting any time trying to figure out how to classify what has just happened? Don't you think we would have all instantly recognized that this was simply war, coming on to our own shores?We are at war. War is politics carried on by other, violent means. This is how small, undermanned and ill-equipped regimes wage war on the cheap.In WWII we didn't have to wring our hands wondering what to do. We knew what to do, and it involved ALL of us.</comment>

<comment>We're already bombing ISIS.</comment>

<comment>Kind of what I'm thinking. Are people who say we're in a war suggesting invasion? You ready for the casualties? You ready for yet another round of attempting to nation build?</comment>

<comment>Agreed. You nailed it. Time to wake up America. This problem can't be wished away.</comment>

<comment>When did ISIS become a nation-state?</comment>

<comment>Since they control territory, levy taxes and have an Army.That's a Country, even if you wish it wasn't so.</comment>

<comment>That's not the definition of a nation-state under our Westphalian system.</comment>

<comment>And Belgium isn't a Nation-State either by that definition</comment>

<comment>Begium has polity.</comment>

<comment>who exactly do you propose "we" do "something" do, who is the "we", and what is the "something"?</comment>

<comment>Just stop with the bad faith argument and be straightforward and out with it: You want to lock up and/or throw out all of the Muslims while bomb the Middle East back to the stone age.</comment>

<comment>WWII was a tame problem. Terrorism is a wicked problem.</comment>

<comment>Now that we've taken out Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda seems to have quiesced quite a bit over here. So who do we have to take out to quiesce ISIS?</comment>

<comment>It's good to see The Atlantic come around to reality. I really like the work they do, and in general, they tend to be less inflammatory in their journalism than other 'mainstream' news outlets. But, I must say, I was dismayed by their quick jumping to conclusion that this was somehow just work place violence. Now we know. Let's hope the president can be a man, and own up to his jumping to conclusions too quickly.</comment>

<comment>You must be a very liberal person. Way too much race-baiting and gender political bias here.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I'm not. But, in the era of overtly liberal journalism, you have to pick and choose your sources. I feel that at least I'm getting interesting articles in The Atlantic, even though they tend to be filtered through the lens of liberalism.</comment>

<comment>Ok I get that. Thanks for being kind. :)</comment>

<comment>The FBI still has it labeled as workplace violence.</comment>

<comment>Not anymore,  it's now being investigated as a terrorist attack </comment>

<comment>Word? When it change?</comment>

<comment>It can actually be both -- see the Fort Hood shooting.</comment>

<comment>Which, in the case of Fort Hood, is absolutely ridiculous. It's all part of obama's inability to recognize the scourge of radical islam.</comment>

<comment>No wonder y'all think he's a dictator -- there's some magical powers you assign to the President.</comment>

<comment>Sigh.  A federal definition of workplace violence I grabbed off the web is "any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening disruptive behavior that occurs at the work site."  So yes, Fort Hood was WPV.  But then, the definition of "assault" is "unwanted contact."  A rape is an assault under that definition, but it trivializes rape to call it "assault," just like Fort Hood is trivialized by calling it "workplace violence" when the more precise term of "terrorism" is a better fit.</comment>

<comment>Sigh, most statutes call rape sexual assault. That's not trivial.  That's what it is.</comment>

<comment>Oh, here's a comb for those nits you're picking.  Fine, all rapes are sexual assaults, and all sexual assaults are assaults.  Again, I'd hope you'd agree that it trivializes a rape or a sexual assault to just call it an "assault."</comment>

<comment>And I'll get really picky and point out that traditionally, a *battery* is an unwanted contact and an "assault" is the *apprehension of contact.*  These things should really be called *sexual battery,* but everyone confuses the terms assault and battery and so they've blurred into the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Dude, you're the one who built a metaphor on factually incorrect statement.</comment>

<comment>Um, fine, the statement was slightly off and I tweaked it.  Have fun going up to a rape victim and telling them they received "unwanted contact."  Or going up to a Hood survivor and saying "Sorry about your workplace violence."  That's my point.</comment>

<comment>They did receive unwanted contact. </comment>

<comment>I'm not nitpicking -- I'm pointing out correct nomenclature.  Additionally, calling sexual assualt sexual assualt does not trivialize a crime.  That's you nitpicking.</comment>

<comment>*My* point was that if you called a rape an "assault," it's trivializing.  A classic assault is a punch.  You started nitpicking by bringing "sexual assault" into it.</comment>

<comment>My point is that rape is sexual assualt and you clearly don't have the legal knowledge to tell a hamburger from a hand grenade.</comment>

<comment>Um, I never disagreed with you on rape = sexual assault.  I said that it's trivializing to call a rape an assault even a rape is categorically an assault.  Show me where I did otherwise, and show me your bar license while you're at it.</comment>

<comment>Armchair analysis suggests an advanced timetable due to some sort of dispute, but the dispute itself could have been triggered by Syed's paranoia as he scouted... Eh. Crazy f*cks bought into bullsh*t and killed a lot of people. Le plus ce change...</comment>

<comment>Like 5 mins ago. The female shooter had joined ISIS- kinda a no brainier now.http://m.timesofindia.com/worl...</comment>

<comment>She's lying. It hasn't. They're still investigating.</comment>

<comment>Just this morning, NPR was blaming Farook's going postal on being upset with 'White supremacy". No joke. Check the transcripts of their morning news show.</comment>

<comment>It was pretty clear almost immediately that this wasn't workplace violence. A single shooter, maybe, but as soon as we knew it was more than one person that angle went out the window. As soon as I heard his name, it was clear what was going on (I hate to say it), and as details emerged, everything confirmed my suspicions.</comment>

<comment>I was rather dismayed and, frankly, puzzled by it. It's ironic because I let my subscription lapse over a dozen years ago when they were busy printing articles to drum up support for the Iraq war. I'm puzzled by Iraq war hawks who seem to be uncomfortable even talking about Islamist terrorism. I was very opposed to the invasion of Iraq myself and I'm not really sure where I stand on exactly what our involvement in Syria should be at this juncture. Still, it seems absurd to not talk about it.I'm also not particularly against gun control. The people who love guns seem very odd to me, or at least I can't relate to them. I guess I'm in the middle there. I was actually furious at the weak response in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. Yet this obsession with gun control in the wake of the San Bernardino shooting didn't even seem like it was genuine. It looked like some sort of displacement activity. It reminded me of when my mother asked my great grandmother to tell me out ethnic background and she said, "I think it's time to set the table."This whole thing has been all too weird. I'm frustrated and annoyed with our elected officials and the media.The French government encouraged people to fly the flag to show their patriotism in the wake of the shootings there. Why isn't our government doing that?</comment>

<comment>This article underscores just how poorly people understand ISIS.  They have to control territory in order to maintain their caliphate but the use of "self radicalized" to distance local sympathizers from ISIS' strategic planning in our rhetoric completely ignores that fact that ISIS is fomenting open rebellion in other countries.  These people are NOT "self" radicalized.  They are being radicalized by a central group with a plan that does not require every attack to be centrally directed.</comment>

<comment>"ISIS is fomenting open rebellion in other countries"Thank you for noting that. I'd upvote your comment multiple times if I could. I'm not really sure what the heck everybody's not getting on both the left and the right. The information's out there. I just gave a quote from Wikipedia to someone who said terrorism wasn't happening in Malaysia! Of course it's happening in Malaysia. And Indonesia. And Mali. And world wide.</comment>

<comment>This may be the second most influential terror attack of the century:Osama bin Laden's attack was extremely influential because he sparked what huge numbers of Muslims worldwide see as a Western war on Islam.  He moved the world toward a clash of civilizations that we have been fighting (badly) ever since.Syed Farook's attack proves something else: that no matter how nice, how familiar, how Western, how settled that Muslim guy in the cube next to yours is, he might come in tomorrow and blow your ass away.</comment>

<comment>Or that disgruntled white guy.</comment>

<comment>You mean the white Tsarnaev brothers?</comment>

<comment>Dylann Roof.Adam Lanza.Tim McVeigh.Wade Michael Page.</comment>

<comment>They were white, buffoon.</comment>

<comment>I just said that, azzhole.</comment>

<comment>Going postal is just rage plus guns.  I'm talking about terrorism - and why this attack is more terrifying than some others.  It's like the pod people in some horror movie.  Osama bin Laden wanted that clash of civilizations.  Farook wanted you to fear Muslims in general.</comment>

<comment>I'm trying to see how this is much different. It appears to be "rage + guns + self-justifying ideology providing validation." It's utterly indistinct from the Klebolds and Dears and Breiviks of the world other than the form of justification varies. The recipe remains the same.</comment>
