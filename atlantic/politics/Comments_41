<comment>Pity the crusading "journalist" who forged a government ID to trespass into a medical facility. If he'd gotten into a hospital instead, would you still humor him?</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't. Would you like me to forge *your* ID?</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't care as long as it didn't affect me. If it affected me I wouldn't care all that much unless it was really serious.</comment>

<comment>Curious. Would you be so kind as to provide a copy of your ID? I have some banks to visit, some loans to take...</comment>

<comment>Yes, imagine if he had gotten into a hospital...and done what exactly? just stood around the hospital? guess that's a crime worth jail time.</comment>

<comment>No. Showed a fake ID in an attempt to make off with human organs. Isn't that what he was doing at PP?</comment>

<comment>I think you mean "in an attempt to demonstrate people are making off with human organs." He had no intention of making off with them. He merely showed there is a willingness to sell them.</comment>

<comment>You misconstrue the point of this article hugely. Connor is not saying these people did not do something wrong, he is making the point that being overly litigious in said case - particularly the felony charge in regards to the ID - is stifling for journalism. Judicial precedent goes along way</comment>

<comment>If he produced videos of abuse occurring at that hospital, I'd hope we'd not humor him, but honor him.</comment>

<comment>And if he didn't? Becuase Daleiden's videos didn't produce any evidence of wrongdoing. So does the outcome matter?</comment>

<comment>PP officials were filmed discussing prices for human organs, and describing the altering of abortion procedures to procure the most intact specimens, both of which are illegal.</comment>

<comment>Great article. This is a clear example of how prosecutors and law enforcement in their cooperation with legislatures are unintentionally undermining the principles of our justice system. In some situations, they don't have sufficient evidence to convict people of big crimes. But, they do have evidence of smaller crimes. The smaller crimes don't merit the same penalty as larger crimes, but by unnecessarily and unjustly increasing the penalty for smaller crimes, prosecutors can get the big crime penalty while only providing proof of a small crime. In effect, they prove someone guilty of a small crime and get them the penalty of a big crime. The prosecutors circumvent the requirement to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the big crime. It undermines the justice system. Prosecutors only have to prove a small crime occurred in order to give someone the penalty for a much bigger crime. Bait-and-switch isn't justice and this case shows how unjust it can be. I can imagine the conversation now... "We can't get them on manslaughter, but we think they did it. Oh look, they had a fake ID. Let's put them away for 20 years. Who needs to prove manslaughter? I'm sure they're guilty. Case closed." Would you or I want our day in court or would we want to be thrown in jail for 20 years for a fake ID, broken tail light, failure to use a turn signal or some other small 'offense' because some prosecutors assumption that we did a crime that we didn't actually do?</comment>

<comment>And of course judges just stand by like Mortimer Snerd dupes. PDead wrong. Prosecutors don't pronounce sentence, judges do, and with an extraordinary degree of discretion.</comment>

<comment>In fact, many judges oppose mandatory minimums because they create situations in which no one believes the sentence fits the crime.</comment>

<comment>If someone has committed a crime, they should be prosecuted for that crime. Trading off tit-for-tat amnesty just does a disservice to the justice system. Political motivation is not an excuse.In the case of Mr. Daleinden, it's up to a judge to determine an appropriate sentence in the event that he is found guilty. Despite the media's focus on the theoretical maximum sentence, it is highly unlikely a judge would impose anything near that in the absence of damning circumstances.If we are a nation of laws, principles of fairness require us to apply those laws equally and impartially.</comment>

<comment>I think the point is that these laws aren't being applied equally and impartially--if these two people had done the same things in the service of a non-controversial cause (like exposing the mafia, as mentioned in the article), there would have been no issue. They are only being prosecuted because the people in charge disagree with their viewpoints.</comment>

<comment>In the case of PP it was a Grand Jury decision to indict.  The idea being that they represent the voice of the community and lend a degree of impartiality.</comment>

<comment>Yet, the Progressives wouldn't buy that if a Grand Jury no-billed (refused to indict) a cop who killed a black child, would they?  They'd call it racist and anything but impartial.Face it, the system as currently constituted makes a Grand Jury a tool of the prosecutor.  If the prosecutor wants an indictment, they get one.</comment>

<comment>Well I'm centrist, but I have a very hard time with the Tamir Rice case.  No indictment in the Michael Brown case I can easily understand.</comment>

<comment>Grand juries are toys of the prosecution. It's a rare prosecutor who can't get a GJ to indict and usually only happens when the prosecutor doesn't actually want to pursue the case but has to make some noise to pacify the community.</comment>

<comment>"the people in charge"? You mean, like, the Illuminati?Maybe if these two people had done the same things in service of a non-controversial cause, there would have been no issue. But Daleinden and Click are being prosecuted because of the high media profile of their cases. Which I actually find a fitting poetic justice, with the way both played to their respective crowds.</comment>

<comment>What's the mandatory minimum? Do you even know? My guess is 2 years - which is still way too f-ing much.</comment>

<comment>There is no mandatory minimum.  The defendant elects whether the judge or jury will sentence him if convicted.  If the sentence is 10 years or less, the defendant can get probation if the judge or jury decides to grant it.  Considering his clean record and lack of remorse, he's probably looking at about two to five in the pen, if convicted.  (33 years in Texas courtrooms for me so far.)  If I were his lawyer, I would advise him to get off his high horse and start telling people how sorry he is.  You don't have a First Amendment right to alter government records.  If anybody out there has any contrary authority, I'd love to see it.</comment>

<comment>I thought judges don't have the leeway in America to determine an appropriate sentence (some of them anyways)?Which is demonstrative of exactly what Conor is talking about, or so it seems to me.</comment>

<comment>"If someone has committed a crime, they should be prosecuted for that crime."And when there is an immense and enormously complicated and oftentimes arbitrary jungle of laws and regulations that no reasonably active person can consistently maintain the appearance of squeaky cleanness, when someone expresses dissent, the government should take advantage of the monstrous system it has created and mobilize its vast resources to entangle the gadfly in all-embracing net?</comment>

<comment>So you really didn't know that forging a government record is a crime?  Really?</comment>

<comment>So you really make idiotic peanut gallery comments without understanding what you read (or didn't read)? Really?</comment>

<comment>"it is highly unlikely a judge would impose anything near that in the absence of damning circumstances"The "damning circumstances" are dissent. That's the way the left works.</comment>

<comment>"If we are a nation of laws, principles of fairness require us to apply those laws equally and impartially."Great in theory, not what happens in practice.  Many innocent and non-violent offenders waste years of their lives in prison.  That's ridiculous and a waste of taxpayer resources.</comment>

<comment>"If we are a nation of laws, principles of fairness require us to apply those laws equally and impartially."That's just not how it works. How it works is that prosecutors decide whom to charge and when. If you're so certain that this is a fair country of laws applied equally and impartially, look to see how often police officers are fired for killing unarmed civilians, much less charged.</comment>

<comment>Agreed that a judge should mete out punishment that fits, however I feel that there's justification in prosecuting these two heavily for the serious infractions they committed... Not just for the way they went about it, but for what it resulted in. Due to the inflammatory rhetoric and chaos this whole stunt spawned (the move to defund PP- which serves millions of the public daily), the negative image the dishonest videos did to the image of PP, the lies and hyperbole from presidential candidates like Carly Fiorina, the day-to-day commentary in everything from comments sections to blogs, to legitimate news sites), we have a dangerous climate surrounding this issue. Don't forget the 3 people that were killed in Colorado Springs by the crazy crusader, or the multiple arson cases at PPs around the country that were directly a result of this smear campaign. Precedence must be set in prosecuting people that make shouting, "FIRE!" in a crowded theater look like a kid's joke. Look at what happened in Oregon. That was directly related to the lack of prosecution of the incident at the Bundy ranch in Nevada. These two activists need to at the very least be given some jail time, and frankly, Planned Parenthood should sue them for slander, libel, and fraudulent misrepresentation.</comment>

<comment>Another Libertarian opposed to grand juries and local governance.  Conor probably wants this all handled at the Federal level.</comment>

<comment>You clearly do not read the articles before commenting. Conor doesnt want this handled at all. He is arguing that our society is too quick to lawyer up and the judicial precedents set in such cases can have a stifling effect on journalism/free speech</comment>

<comment>The reason Harris County "lawyer end up" is that Tea Party Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick asked Devon Anderson, the GOP DA in Harris County, to convene a grand jury to investigate this very matter.  Neither PP nor the Harris County DA asked for this.  Daleiden's buddies asked for an investigation, and they got one.</comment>

<comment>It's annoying that you're comparing and equating an egregious (if minor) physical assault committed by a public employee -- an educator, no less -- on a journalist trying to cover protests which were a matter of national interest, to the other case, which seems to be based on an unfair interpretation of a law, one that would set a precedent that could be used to suppress investigative journalism.Or how about the utterly frivolous prosecutions of various police officers, like the guys who arrested Sandra Bland and Freddie Gray--did you forget about them?</comment>

<comment>It is not frivolous to investigate police officers whose suspects ended up dead and whom acted in such a way that excessive force has been alleged.Is a camera suddenly more important than two dead people (one of which died with a major spinal injury while in the custody [the kind you would expect in a physical injury, not from a birth defect])?Not to ignore what that student went through here, but let's not pretend that a, in your own words, "minor" physical assault that resulted in no injury to the victim is serious, but cases where people actually died are not serious/should be deemed frivolous.  I say this as a survivor of assault.</comment>

<comment>The Grand Jury went its own way here.  You can't call the Daleinden case an abuse of prosecutorial discretion.  That makes no sense.  If you're arguing that prosecutors should ignore the Grand Jury indictment for political purposes, you're advocating an abuse far worse than what you're trying to prevent.As for Click, assault is assault, and calling for violence is a crime.</comment>

<comment>Calling for violence is not and should not be a crime. If it was, lots of people from all over the political spectrum ranging from Malcolm X to Ted Cruz would be criminals, and free speech would be meaningless.</comment>

<comment>Well, no, that's not exactly how it works.</comment>

<comment>Well, there is a fine line. Calling for general violence (say, "let's kill all reporters") is legal. Calling for violence targeted onto some specific person is a crime. From the looks of it, we're dealing with the latter here.</comment>

<comment>>and calling for violence is a crime.This is the sort of 3rd grade reasoning I expect from neo-Nazi trolls."It's a crime so we should throw the book at em' Danno" does not work for minor crimes. The punishments are very, very harsh, even if they never spend a day in jail.In both of these cases it's not a serious crime and should not be punished by the all-powerful State.</comment>

<comment>It's being charged as a class 3 misdemeanor. No one is getting the book thrown at them.</comment>

<comment>It should be *IGNORED*. Along with all the drug crime.</comment>

<comment>Despite what your post says, no one is getting the book thrown at them.Also, you up-vote your own comments?</comment>

<comment>It may not be 'getting the book thrown at them' retaliative to how other people in America are treated, but it is globally.And of course I upvote my own comments! I love myself! Except when I don't!</comment>

<comment>"I love myself! Except when I don't!"Hey me too!</comment>

<comment>>The Grand Jury went its own way hereWhat kind of stupidity is this? You realize the prosecutor is the only one in the room with the GJ?You wouldn't buy it if a GJ let a cop off for blowing away a 12 year old boy, why are they suddenly independent here?</comment>

<comment>Grand Juries can return any indictment they want based on the evidence they are presented. A Prosecutor might be the only person in the room with them, but they do not control the Grand Jury output.</comment>

<comment>That prosecutor was under *ZERO* obligation to present the evidence they used to indict.</comment>

<comment>Unless you were part of the Grand Jury (which you weren't) you have no clue under what context the evidence that they had used fake ID's was introduced - as for evidence of the request for sale of tissues, well, one assumes the video had to be shown, and the video they made contained the evidence within it.</comment>

<comment>I would. GJ is precisely there to establish the guilt in these situations.</comment>

<comment>The GJ is there to do what the prosecutor tells them to. And they do, virtually every single time.</comment>

<comment>Except that they don't. http://www.justice.gov/sites/d... doesn't show that GJ will always convict people.</comment>

<comment>...You didn't read that.That paper does not break out grand jury outcomes. It's about total outcomes - including cases dropped by the prosecutor and not a grand jury, which is far more common.</comment>

<comment>Is he arguing that calling for violence shouldn't be a crime? That's what I don't understand. Or in just this instance, because it's noteable?</comment>

<comment>A key part of the Daleinden case: the result was not the exposure of illicit activity, but rather depicting perfectly legal activity as illegal. Given the amount of backlash Planned Parenthood suffered, some kind of legal recourse was necessary. If a reporter exposes a Mafia front, that's great and should largely fall within the bounds of protected journalistic activity. But Daleinden at the very least defamed Planned Parenthood and must be held accountable.Similarly, waving away Click's crime is simply accepting that anyone with sufficient muscle can, with impunity, restrict someone else's Constitutional rights. While it might be practical for a less well-known case to be ignored, it sets an extremely bad precedent for such a publicized case to be summarily dismissed as trivial. Doing so only invites more lawbreaking.</comment>

<comment>Defamation is a civil tort, not a criminal action.  If Daleinden defamed PP, then its up to PP to exercise its civil rights and sue.  It isn't the Harris County DA's job to prosecute on their behalf.</comment>

<comment>They are. As are several other groups.</comment>

<comment>Civil suit has been filed. I expect PP to be awarded damages</comment>

<comment>So the reporter has to gamble that her investigation actually leads to prosecution for criminal activity ... if the case can't be made/won, then she is toast?  Don't you think that might chill investigation into some things otherwise worthy of investigation?</comment>

<comment>The difference is that Melissa Chick is a horrid SWPL dildo catlady, and David Daleiden didn't restrict or abuse anyone's rights.</comment>

<comment>Forging government ID? That's abuse all right.</comment>

<comment>Oh noes, the horror, the horror!</comment>

<comment>Would you like me to show up at your house with a (forged) FBI ID and a (forged) search warrant?</comment>

<comment>Try.</comment>

<comment>And what, pray tell, are you going to do to stop me?</comment>

<comment>You're the one running your f*cking yam about kicking people's heads in. So, yeah try. What will I do to stop you? You'll see if you actually try, scumbag.</comment>

<comment>So... nothing? Thought so.</comment>

<comment>No, you don't get how this works. You're the one making threats. Put up or shut up, scumbag.</comment>

<comment>Let me ask you my question again: Would you like me to show up at your house with a (forged) FBI ID and a (forged) search warrant?Unless you are capable of identifying the forgeries on the fly, which I honestly doubt, your options are - either try to forcefully get rid of me (which, given the credentials, is equal to resisting a lawful demand of law enforcement officer - standoff, bullets flying, etc) - or submit to a search.</comment>

<comment>Is this an argument that using false IDs, faking government documents, and "minor" (potentially injurious, but noninjurious?) assault should NOT be crimes?  Then make that argument, Conor.  Instead, all you've done here is pleaded that minor crimes that are also newsmaking, political, or speech-related (or god-forbid, hypothetically to be committed by journalists) should be forgiven prior to prosecution.No.  I'm all for lenience at sentencing (depending on all the circumstances, of course), but Click and Daleiden appear to have committed crimes.  Their status as politically self-important people doesn't exempt them from prosecution.</comment>

<comment>20 f-ing years. That's too much. Two weeks is too much. And it makes all investigative journalism illegal.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, 20 years would be too much.  (Too bad Conor only reported the maximum possible sentence and omitted the minimum, if there is one.) I don't know if two weeks is too much.  A trial and sentence hearing will determine that.And no, it doesn't make all investigative journalism illegal, it just means that investigative journalists can't commit crimes in the course of their work and can't use their profession as a shield for wrongdoing.I'm ok with that.  I expect that.</comment>

<comment>>just means that investigative journalists can't commit crimes in >the course of their workEverything is a crime. You are by definition defrauding someone when you fail to tell them you are a reporter.Demanding absolute complicane in a police state with a million laws is the same thing as illegal.</comment>

<comment>I'm rolling all three of my eyes.</comment>

<comment>Actually, pretending to be medically licensed in order to gain access to biomaterial is a pretty serious crime.Something comparable would be going into a pharmacy and trying to talk the pharmacist into giving you oxycontin without a prescription because you have a feeling that he's giving out oxycontin without prescriptions and you want to "sting" him. If you get arrested in the process, surely you wouldn't be surprised. You can cry "journalism" but you'd have to acknowledge your part in what happened. Especially if the pharmacist wasn't even swayed to give you the drugs. Now your entire thesis is wrong too. That's pretty much what happened to Daleiden. Also, if you haven't produced anything of journalistic merit in the past it will be harder to convince anyone that you are a "journalist" rather than a person who is merely harassing, defaming, and intimidating an organization that hasn't done anything wrong.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's a really f-ing too serious crime. It's a 20 years of rape crime.*THAT* is the problem with Amerika.</comment>

<comment>If he got twenty years it would be outrageous. If his crime weren't acknowledged it would also be outrageous.I doubt he'll get anything approximating 20 years. If he did I would call it a gross miscarriage of justice. And I think he;s a vile toad.</comment>

<comment>He'll get at least two years - that's the mando-minimun.</comment>

<comment>For reals? Wow! I had no idea. I assumed he'd pay some fine and then slink off to California to tend to his civil law suit there.</comment>

<comment>One, if you can't do the time....Two, if you don't like that section of the Texas Penal Code, tell the legislature .</comment>

<comment>I don't think that fraud word means what you think it means.</comment>

<comment>Bu the only crime is giving a false name and having a fake ID.Wouldn't the same thing then apply to the people who go under cover at factories and farms to out illegal practices?  Or any journalist using a fake name/fake identity in order to uncover evidence of a crime?</comment>

<comment>In fact ag-gag laws do make it illegal to go undercover on a farm.</comment>

<comment>I thought some of those were overturned or being challenged in court?  They are clearly designed to prevent the uncovering of criminal activity that is damaging to the regions economy.....</comment>

<comment>They are, but they don't seem facially illegal. They make illegal things more illegal if the purpose is X.</comment>

<comment>It's the same thing though.Making it a crime to give a fake identity and take under cover photos or whatever of criminal activity.  That's insane on several fronts and people should have been irate that these laws were ever passed.It can't be a crime to go under cover to bring criminal activity to light, especially if the only "crimes" are use of a fake name and ID and taking footage, because then, investigative journalists whether they're citizen journalists or working for traditional media, have no protection and will be unable to perform this function.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is insane and unfair. But when has our government ever been sane or fair?</comment>

<comment>The solution to all this is my Question Authority plan. It's how our justice system works, but when it comes to politics everyone wants to rant, put on shows, and just act out.BLM and Daleiden could have both used my plan to push their agendas in completely legal ways that would have been much more effective than what they've done so far. Daleiden's group is pushing a halfway version of my plan: they've posted questions for PP but they aren't organizing efforts to have them asked on video.And, if these "ag gag" laws work as you say, the Question Authority plan is how to bring the problems to light and force politicians to change them.I realize some people feel butthurt about me showing them wrong or have other emotional issues. If they can overcome those emotional issues and use my plan it would be much better for their cause(s).</comment>

<comment>No, they would be unable to forge government records, as they have been probably since about 1776.  This really isn't complicated.</comment>

<comment>But he didn't uncover any evidence, and then lied and said he had.</comment>

<comment>What difference does that make?  You get to use a fake identity only if your under cover project is a success?If he 'lied' about it, then he should be sued by PP for slander and defamation.  Lying isn't a crime unless you're under oath.</comment>

<comment>You don't get to use a fake ID.  Ever.  This is not hard.</comment>

<comment>These aren't hard questions: if the thing is a crime it is a crime.  It doesn't matter about the political identity of the perpetrator.Using a false name or deceptive identity is not a crime (though it can be if you're talking to police).  Having a fake government document is.  And there are good reasons for it.</comment>

<comment>I guess we should be prosecuting a lot of 17-20 year olds then, for the fake government documents they are using to purchase alcohol illegally. And then I guess they should also be facing significant jail time, like these people are.</comment>

<comment>You're saying we should just let kids 17-20 use fake IDs to buy Boone's Farm?There are reasons for these laws.  We can change them, if we really want.  And I've never argued in any case for the maximum penalty to be universally applied (in fact, I'm all in favor of discretionary leniency in sentencing).But the key fact is that there are laws and we don't get to exempt people from them because they're journalists or young and dumb or animal activists or "well-meaning" or...</comment>

<comment>Well, I think the drinking age should be 18, so there's that.Okay, so it has to be illegal to use a fake ID.  But then it should be a misdemeanor, no?  More like a parking ticket unless it's part of some larger fraud or criminal enterprise.  I know they applied such a motive to the anti abortion people but I feel this is a wrong application, their goal was to uncover a crime, not "defraud" anyone including the government.I'd say the real 'key fact' is that we have probably hundreds and hundreds of similarly stupid laws with insane ranges of penalties that nobody apparently cares about or enforces except when they do.What's that saying about how the government can only crack down on the guilty, never the innocent, so the police state makes so many laws that everyone is a criminal if only you look hard enough.....</comment>

<comment>The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. - Ayn Rand</comment>

<comment>Tex.Penal Code 37.10.</comment>

<comment>We typically do exempt kids from the laws that require 20 years of prison rape for buying Boone's Farm.</comment>

<comment>They're "exempted" by virtue of the fact that there are no such laws.  Get real.</comment>

<comment>2nd degree felony in Texas to present forged government documents in service to fraud.That's what the journalists were charged with, and that's also what kids do when they buy beer with a fake-id.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I doubt it.  Underage purchase is a misdemeanor, not a fraud.  But if you can cite me a case (sounds like that would make news!) I'll believe you.</comment>

<comment>Those were my words. We seem to be in violent agreement. They do not enforce those laws in that way on kids.</comment>

<comment>Two laws can make one thing twice-illegal.Take sexting laws in Texas - it's a misdemeanor for a Texas kid to sext with another Texas kid he is legally allowed to have sex with (romeo and juliet ages +/- 3 years over the age of 14, or was it 2?).But it's *ALSO* child porn, which can also be prosecuted as either a state or federal crime.You see that charge on kid's rap sheet all the time - kid was charged with child porn to force them to plea to the sexting misdemeanor. It always works - just being on trial for a sex offense would ruin their lives.</comment>

<comment>Texas Penal Code sec. 37.10.  It's misdemeanor (up to a year) unless done with the intent to harm or defraud someone (20 to 29).</comment>

<comment>Thank you, sir or madam.</comment>

<comment>No. Farms are not medically licensed facilities. Planned parenthood is.Believe it or not, medically licensed facilities have permission to practice medicine and handle the resulting biomaterial. Whereas some random guy off the street has no legal rights to buy or handle biomaterial .</comment>

<comment>Is it of political and/or journalistic interest? Then it's a valid target.And it's 100% just as illegal to go undercover at a farm. It doesn't matter what you think the medical license means vs a hog farm's permission - all that matters is the law.</comment>

<comment>Valid target, yes. A pharmacy could be a valid target but can you try to buy controlled substances from them in your "sting"? Can you lie your way into an operating room in an attempt to do a sting on surgeons? At what point does the biological material and identity of patients come into play and become worthy of protection? What if they handed over the fetal tissue as he asked? Is that not a violation of the rights of the patient?</comment>

<comment>Yes and it depends. It depends on if your 'sting' involves interfering with the operation.At the point where some action is taken that uses said biological material - asking for it isn't enough, arranging delivery would be.</comment>

<comment>That is what the prosecutor has explained. Attempting to buy fetal tissue isn't ok. Just asking is a crime. If PP had agreed to his request where would he have stopped? Would he have taken possession of it to bring to protests and flash around to his friends? how far was he willing to go?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure it's illegal, but is it severely enough wrong to warrant harsh prosecution?</comment>

<comment>He's looking at up to a year for offering to buy.  </comment>

<comment>I'm glad we agree.  The law says 2-20 if convicted.  He's dead meat,  </comment>

<comment>If they forged a government record, yes.  I really don't know why this is so hard to understand.</comment>

<comment>The minimum sentence is two years. I think we agree that's too much also.</comment>

<comment>Who's this "we," Kemo Sabe?</comment>

<comment>Sensible people.</comment>

<comment>Is it? Isn't the point of a public punishment not so much correction for the one who committed the crime, but deterrence for those who may think about it?"Don't use false IDs for political agendas, or you TOO can go in the slammer for 20 years and kiss your life goodbye".</comment>

<comment>So political stuff is now illegal if it breaks any of our *MILLIONS* of laws?Nice police state you have there.</comment>

<comment>Only if you intend to harm or defraud.  Otherwise, a year or less.</comment>

<comment>'...it makes all investigative journalism illegal.'No, it doesn't.</comment>

<comment>How not? You can't use a fake ID, or even say you are someone else, or that's fraud and/or a felony.</comment>

<comment>Not all investigative journalism involves pretending you're someone else.</comment>

<comment>So what you're saying is if you were a reporter and you got a hot tip about a breaking story on the other side of town, and your car wouldn't start, it would be okay to steal my car to get the story?</comment>

<comment>The argument is made with examples that we shouldn't be over prosecuting and over criminalizing such conduct.</comment>

<comment>Most likely the reason for the over-prosecutions is that someone wants them prosecuted for their own ideological reasons.I know a family where the daughter engaged in sex with a guy while she was just under age and she became pregnant. But the guy isn't being charged with statutory rape because they consider him to be very handsome and sexy and she was very 'interested' in sex with him. So no one is filing any charges of statutory rape against him, because no one wants to.</comment>

<comment>conor's next piece: 'why the bundy family should keep your tax dollars and avoid prosecution'.Overburdened courts is a pathetic excuse to offer for non-sentencing one convicted of a serious crime.  The reality is that if a crime fits one of his twisted pet philosophies (anti-choice in this instance), conor applies his trusty libertarian 'laws apply to you, not my kind' approach to life.Among other things, daleiden is in the doc for illegal trade in human organs, though the risk to which countless poor women have been placed due to his illicit activities should be added to the charge sheet.</comment>

<comment>For those that don't know, Houston is a Democrat stronghold in Texas. The indictment is not a surprise. What will be a surprise is if anyone actually goes to jail. The superior courts will end up throwing out the case, as what happened is not outside the norm of investigative journalism.</comment>

<comment>That would be why it elected a conservative republican as DA then.Get your facts straight - Austin is a democratic stronghold, Houston and especially Harris County, not so much.</comment>

<comment>Report your facts straight: at least three of Houston's last four mayors were Democrats, and I suspect that Annise Parker was a Democrat also, no? (Five hours later: yes, Annise Parker is a Democrat, too.)</comment>

<comment>The DA is a republican hand picked to run the grand jury by a right wing republican.  </comment>

<comment>Houston *is* pretty Democratic. The rest of Harris County? Not so much. All the largest Texas cities are themselves pretty blue, but the ring suburbs around them are, for the most part, heavily Republican. That's how you get a Republican DA for Harris County and a liberal Democratic mayor for Houston. With a city that is only majority-Democrat by a fairly small margin, that's how county government becomes Republican even if the dominant entity in the county is Democratic.</comment>

<comment>Except, I personally know the DA, and know the politics within our city government, and I tell you, I am not surprised. Houston, as a city, is Democrat. The surrounding county has no bearing on how the city is run.</comment>

<comment>Except that a Harris County Grand Jury is drawn from a Harris County Jury Pool, not from Houston. So it has a big bearing on this indictment - and the non-indictment of Planned Parenthood. A jury pool of twenty drawn from a conservative county with a conservative Republican DA picked by a Republican politician hostile to Planned  Parenthood handed down this indictment - it does not look good for the indicted.You are not as informed as you think, bright boy.</comment>

<comment>Do you live here? Have you ever seen a map of Houston? Houston IS Harris County. If you lived here, you would know that even the parts of Harris County that isn't Houston are still heavily Democrat, and that trend continually gets worse. All the Republicans are moving out of the County to Fort Bend, Waller, and Montgomery, almost specifically for how s*** the City and County governments are on any given day.Now, if you knew anything about grand juries, particularly ones in Houston, is that they are easily swayed. Then, if you knew anything about Devon Anderson, you would know she is a political hack, and there is no real Republican party in Houston. And then, on top of all that, you would know Houston and Harris County are just shitty when it comes to their prosecution and jail systems. Seriously, we're compared to LA County for fucks sake. And then, you would know that Devon has already once before help an abortionist get out of legal problems.Anyways, lil' smug c***, I live here, work for and with the County and City governments, and know quite a few people scattered about in various offices.And I tell you, I am not surprised at the indictment. There is a reason PP is right next to UofH, and is shaped like a f***ing cash register.You are not as informed as you think, f*** boy.</comment>

<comment>I think the issue is less about Dem/Rep and more about government power</comment>

<comment>Liberals do not like free speech, or difference of opinion or any type of dissent, unless you AGREE with. Houston is a great example. And the GW cult freaks are another. Saying that those that deny GW should be in prison.  Yes, leftwingers are a threat to this Nation as much as the terrorists are.</comment>

<comment>As a newspaper editor who was a migrant from the U.S. said some years ago, the U.S. is far too punitive a country.More evidence of same.</comment>

<comment>I think the motto here should be "careful what you wish for"Since before the GW Bush admin, the right campaigned on tougher ID laws to control criminals, illegal aliens and the imaginary epidemic of voter fraud.  Now some right wing activists face 20 years pretending to be someone else when conducting a sting.The right has long campaigned on "truth in sentencing" and "tough on crime," and then some Western ranchers are sentenced to years in prison for a small fire that caused minimal damage.The left has increasingly sought punishment and even criminalization of various speech "crimes" by individuals and the media, and now we have a journalism professor being prosecuted for incitement.Its all ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Melissa Click is a villain for liberals too. We believe in free speech & press.</comment>

<comment>THIS. I'm blue-da-ba-dee-da-ba-die liberal here. She's a scumbag for calling for someone to be assaulted for trying to take photographs.These journalists should stop trying to paint false equivalences.</comment>

<comment>This country just loves punishing people. The Puritan Punitive States of America. God help you if you have to face a judge or government prosecutor, or the all-powerful IRS, which can seize everything you own without as much as a hearing. We have a government agency that operates above all Constitutional provisions.</comment>

<comment>In the Daleiden case, he did not harm the people he talked with on camera. He simply asked questions and allowed them to harm their own reputations. This should not be illegal, this is called whistleblowing. I could see an argument if he misrepresented their discussions (which has been claimed by some, based on video editing). The same is true for journalism, you can only be charged slander or libel if you misrepresent the truth in an effort to harm someone. It is also obvious, based on the views of Daleiden, that he did not intend to actually buy human organs.In the Click case, I think there should be some form of punishment, even if it's a fine instead of jail time. In order to protect free speech, there should be some kind of punishment for trying to coerce somebody into yielding their free speech rights with threats of physical removal. Especially by an employee of the government. Police officers should not be allowed to stop somebody from filming them as long as they are not disrupting police business, for example.</comment>

<comment>Nope. He edited the heck out of the videos, carefully removing footage that made it clear PP obeys the law. He also threw in grisly images from the internet because he was so certain they showed what "really" happened.He isn't getting charged for any of that. A Republican DA appointed by a Republican governor investigated the case in a state where attacking PP helps political careers. That guy found Daleiden broke the law.</comment>

<comment>No he didn't. An independent review by Coalfire Media, a top rated digital forensics firm, validated that the videos were no deceptively edited, with the only gaps being during occasions such as bathroom breaks and waiting for one thing or another. By the way, your "Republian" prosecutor sits on the board of Planned Parenthood. Funny how that doesn't bother you.</comment>

<comment>Not true. There is a person (singular) in the Harris County DA's office who sits on the PP board, and it's not DA Devon Anderson. One. Out of roughly 300 ADAs.</comment>

<comment>One REALLY big difference between the two parties in question: the anti-abortion activists do not hold a faculty position at one of the largest public universities in the country. Had Mizzou done the right thing and fired the un-tenured Ms. Click already by now, she probably wouldn't have been indicted.</comment>

<comment>You are actually saying that calling on people to physically attack journalists shouldn't get jail time?  What a low bar you set.</comment>

<comment>No, it shouldn't, because around 90% of the population has done that one or more times in their lives.</comment>

<comment>And I'm sure you would be consistent on this point if the politics were reversed. Suuuuuuuuuuuuure.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I would be. I hate the drug war. And the war on women. And the war on men. And too-harsh sentences for domestic violence.I've rarely seen a punishment in America that I agree with.</comment>

<comment>I hesitate to pull this cord, but who is being imprisoned/sentenced (and why) in this "war on women" (and men) that you speak of?</comment>

<comment>Too long and off topic:D Sorry:D</comment>

<comment>OK.</comment>

<comment>BTW: is it just me, or does the Texas prosecutor look like she could be Ted Cruz's sister?</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure these incidents are parallel.The "professor" is calling for violence against not only a reporter, but a student in addition to putting her hands on him, which qualifies as assault.  This isn't a free speech issue except that her actions were designed to limit the free speech of the reporter who was in a public space.The anti abortion video was an attempt to go "under cover" and document a perceived crime.  Whether they were right or wrong, prosecuting such a person seems to be saying that any type of undercover/investigative journalism could be similarly prosecuted, this seems much more chilling of the rights of the press and of whistleblowers than the other.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure why people think its ok to attempt to buy biomaterial under false pretenses.Do you think it's ok if some guy off the street fakes IDs to get into your hospital  and take your removed kidneys/appendix, etc? It's a pretty serious offense.I work in a medical clinic, the idea that some one with an agenda would muscle their way in and start trying to violate patient privacy scares me (and yes, him trying to take possesion of aborted fetuses is, imo, a violation of the patient's privacy, sorry).</comment>

<comment>Physically assaulting someone isn't speech. Muckraking is. These cases aren't remotely the same.</comment>

<comment>Man, I am looking forward to slapping those I disagree with politically across the face with impunity.  Where shall I start?</comment>

<comment>Nope, Click struck a reporter.That the reporter was not hurt is besides the point.She gets her day in court and gets to make her case. That is how it works.Oddly she is allowed the free speech she did her dam*dist to deny others.</comment>

<comment>No mention that the Harris County prosecutor sits on the board of Planned Parenthood. That makes it clear that this is a political prosecution by a vindictive, power-hungry political operator.</comment>

<comment>You are wrong.  It doesn't take much to fact check.  Why didn't you bother?The Harris County District Attorney is a Republican appointed by Rick Perry to a vacant position and then won a subsequent election.  One of her 300 assistant district attorneys (in a county with a population of 4 million), who has zero involvement in this case, sits on the Board of Planned Parenthood.</comment>

<comment>I also pointed this out to Tom elsewhere on the thread. Betcha he continues to use it as a talking point anyway.</comment>

<comment>Where did you get that steaming pile of bullshit?  Breitbart?</comment>

<comment>The Harris County web site.</comment>

<comment>Just read her bio and nowhere does it say she sits on the board of Planned Parenthood. Provide link please. </comment>

<comment>It's drivel that "Life News" a pro-life website has been pushing and people are buying it. This is why we need to define "journalism" more narrowly.</comment>

<comment>That's been disproven, please don't get your information from "Life news". You're the reason why we should lower the threshold of what is allowed to be called "journalism".The prosecutor is a pro-life Republican, appointed by a pro-life republicanhttp://www.motherjones.com/moj...</comment>

<comment>It should be expected that when CF offers an argument based on utility and the public good that it invariably tends to be his version of the public good. If we take that generally, then we don't try people for crimes we use a poll instead.I assume that CF is ready to revive his don't persecute Snowden blog piece when that is on the table again.</comment>

<comment>Subject to correction, I suspect that the average respectable journalistic organization is not in the business of forging driver's licenses.  Common sense -- and maybe a two-minute chat with their general counsel -- would suggest that's a hazardous course of acton.  A lot of attention has been given to driver's licenses in recent years, for reasons ranging from voter ID to TSA airplane-boarding requirements related to terrorism.  This is not the atmosphere in which prudent people, regardless of how pure they believe their motives to be, would decide to become ID forgers, especiallly in a very high-profile situation.  And if they decide to do so, they are responsible for the consequences.</comment>

<comment>Ah, the luxurious righteousness of the issue-specific zealot. [I actually did not notice this was by Mr. Friedersdorf; I'm just a d*ck in general, not trying to single you out.]</comment>

<comment>Who made these people "journalists"?  What other laws do "journalists" get to ignore? Maybe I will start calling myself a "journalist". Seem like all I need is a camera and an internet connection.</comment>

<comment>Right? Like I want to buy drugs. If I get busted I can call it "an expose on drug selling" I guess</comment>

<comment>Just a note about 'uninvestigated rapes' I assume that's a reference to rape kits that have not been amnalyzed.What happens is that the forensics are gathered at the time of the report, because the material is lost if not. But the case might not pan out for a zillion or two reasons, including the reluctance of the reporting party to go forward, strong evidence of consent, etc.So the State does not spend the resources to do forensic analysis on a non-existent case.There is no evidence at all of any substantial number of uninvestigated rapes. It's another instance of the glass bead game the elites in this country insist on playing in lieu of real involvement in actual issues.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. There are untested rape kits all over the country  http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-...</comment>

<comment>Did you read my comment?It wasn't about a regional pattern. It was an observation that the reason they're untested is that the case has fallen apart for other reasons, which happens a lot. So no one bothers to do analysis on a case that's never going forward.Anyone who thinks rape complaints are given short shrift in this system has never observed the system.</comment>

<comment>Stunned by this piece. It is a completely false equivalence: Prof. Click's actions, whilst illegal, were petty and caused no discernible harm. Her actions were distasteful, but likely made in the heat of the moment. She should be prosecuted and if found guilty, fined appropriately. OTOH Mr. Daleiden actions were premeditated and carefully planned. His intent from the start was to lie, distort and misrepresent in order to destroy a perfectly law-abiding organisation and ultimately deprive women of their legal right to healthcare.</comment>

<comment>"Even assuming she’s technically guilty, no physical harm came to the photographer..."It's easy to be dismissive of assault if you're not the victim and there are no physical scars, I guess.  Why don't you ask Mark Schierbecker how he was affected by Click's actions?</comment>

<comment>I don't know if it's urban legend, but I'm reminded of the story about the man who found kiddie porn on the internet, took snapshots of the websites (which included pictures), and went to the police. He was arrested and charged with possession of kiddie porn.</comment>

<comment>He can make his case in court. He could have just noted the url.Pretending to commit fraud, or blackmail or buy organs by doing any of these counts as doing them. What they are accused of are not harmless pranks or done in aid of law enforcement.</comment>

<comment>Suuuure.I hope you get raped in prison when they decide you aren't useful anymore.</comment>

<comment>These are not cases of prosecuting speech. One is a case of assault by a professor on a student. There is no excuse for such conduct. The other is a case of co-opting the criminal justice system for fun and profit. The lesson is if you want to use the justice system to attack your political rivals you better have your sh*t straight.</comment>

<comment>It is the height of hypocrisy for anyone on the left to defend Click. How can anyone justify a college professor seeking to bar a student - acting as a journalist - from a place on his own campus? And calling for a moving "wall of people" to push that student back is outrageous.Imagine if a right wing professor had called on students to push a black student away from photographing a frat outing on campus. Liberals would be howling in outrage.Click should have been fired. She wasn't because liberal administrators were sympathetic to her (absurd) cause. </comment>

<comment>I don't like the idea of hijacking two legitimate news stories to present a Libertarian polemic.</comment>

<comment>So why you bother to read Conor then?You knew what it would be.</comment>

<comment>I'm not inclined to defend either of the parties you compared. I also completely agree that criminally charging them would be asinine.</comment>

<comment>So, is author arguing that the various and sundry assault (threat of violence, with no touching) charges should be dropped from the books? If you threaten a Native American woman, the feds will come after you seeking years in prison. Most states have laws that make it a crime to threaten someone without touching them, which is usually classified as assault.I don't get it. Is he trying to say, all assault charges should be done away with, or just for this professor?</comment>

<comment>Is the author saying it was OK to show fake ID because it was in journalistic pursuit? Kids in some states — Florida and Illinois, for example — can be charged with a full-on felony for showing a fake ID. If they claim they were investigating the bar's policies on under-age drinking, does that make it be OK?</comment>

<comment>Surveille anyone long enough and you'll find them guilty of a crime.Ferretting out every minor infraction is what permits cities like Ferguson to apply the full vigor of every law against targetted groups.  Prosecutors who overreach this badly actually pervert the rule of law.</comment>

<comment>I didn't think  Daleiden was even the original target of the grand jury proceedings.  The Attorney General was going after Planned Parenthood and jury decided to indict him instead.   Normally, I would say that when you get hoisted on your own petard you've got no one to blame but yourself.   But I'm a little uncomfortable giving the prosecutors that much discretion.  It would rife for abuse.   I'd rather see the legislature fix the law and have the Governor pardon him.  I still want to know if they're including animal feces in meat packing plant.</comment>

<comment>Daleiden (allegedlly) engaged in criminal deceit in a fraudulent attempt to bring down a nationwide organization and possibly get people sent to prison.Click (allegedly) went beyond free speech to threatening & inciting violence and depriving other persons of their civil liberties, in a manner not all that different from Ammon Bundy and his friends.These cases are about action, not speech. Why should they not be held accountable?</comment>

<comment>They are dissenters and should be punished as such. It's a shame that Citizens United got away with criticizing Hillary Clinton in a movie. Even if the organization was (disgracefully) not disbanded, the leaders should have at least gotten the Dinesh D'Sousa treatment if not the Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. But definitely the Catherine Engelbrecht, Frank VanderSloot, and Brendan Eich treatments. Dissent cannot be tolerated.</comment>

<comment>i urge you to take a look at the charges planned parenthood actually filed against daleidan, as well as his criminal history. These two charges are a small sliver of a much larger pool of potential indictments -- in my opinion they got off easy. Don't forget their "undercover activism" included framing an entire organization, breaking the privacy bond of provider and patient (imagine having an abortion and seeing this become something to exploit for an orchestrated lie), pushing completely disrespectful congressional hearings and investigations that ended up clearing them of all wrongdoing, and inspiring the killing of 3 people and the further endangerment of anyone seeking health care at a pp clinic. Your example of a mafia front makes sense, except the mafia wasn't cleared of wrongdoing in all cases in which it was being investigated, and it never provided essential health care (pap smears, birth control, std tests) to millions of low-income Americans. If someone framed the human rights campaign, would we feel bad for the "whistleblowers"? If someone framed the black lives matter movement, would we feel bad for the "whistleblowers"? If this weren't tangentially related to abortion, would this article even exist? No. Because it's just another piece of rhetoric that oppresses women, men and the right to access essential contraceptive health care in this country.</comment>

<comment>Seriously, this guy acted in an attempt to violate patient privacy IMO. Pretty serious stuff</comment>

<comment>We the citizens do over-delegate to the courts our responsibility for public censure, and for conflict resolution.</comment>

<comment>I worked for a state court for many years, and one thing I learned is that the law and justice are not synonymous.</comment>

<comment>None of the people involved are being prosecuted for speech. Just a 'small' error on CF's part.It will be interesting to see if CF says the same about the Bundy's.</comment>

<comment>As much as I dislike Melissa Click, she shouldn't be prosecuted.  Assault?  Really?  She shoved someone.  It's wrong, but I can't see tax dollars going into punishing her.  Waste of money, waste of time.</comment>

<comment>Fish gotta swim. Birds gotta fly. And prosecutors gotta generate impressive-sounding statistics so that politicians can get re-elected.</comment>

<comment>We are an overly litigious society. Once again Connor makes sound sense in a sea of outrage.</comment>

<comment>Their deeds led to a mass shooting incident where people were murdered.  Far from dropping charges, adding "accessory to murder" would be more appropriate.</comment>

<comment>http://www.salon.com/2016/01/2...</comment>

<comment>A single kudo to the author for not running from integrity and truth.  But if I may simply add that the 2nd degree felony of a falsified government document is beyond absurd. Consider if an illegal alien used the exact same instrument to secure welfare resources from the state or to even simply cast a vote.  Neither the DA nor the idiot grand jurists would bother to indict.  They ignore that crime every day!  This is a political hit job and the government of Harris County is either willfully engaging in or succumbing to Brownshirt tactics that were supposedly vanquished about 70 years ago.</comment>

<comment>I don't live in Harris County, but I have been a lawyer in San Antonio for more than 30 years, and I am willing to bet you a side of beef and a new bbq pit that the DA would have that illegal alien in jail in a heartbeat, no bail.</comment>

<comment>Since you're a member of the Texas Bar and  proximal to Harris County, how about you present a single case where this DA has pursued a case, or any case of an illegal alien using a false government document in an effort to secure something of which he is not entitled? Are you standing on the position that absence of prosecution of a crime is proof there is no crime?  Do you also  subscribe to the falling tree, silently, in the forest theory?</comment>

<comment>I googled "Houston illegal alien fake drivers license" and got about 50 cases in the first two lines.  I am not proximal to Harris County.  Do you subscribe to the if I don't google it and don't therefore don't know of a prosecution then there weren't any theory?  What is it with you righties and your aversion to checking the facts for yourself?</comment>

<comment>There hasn't been a prosecution of such a case since 2008 (oddly coincidental it occurred before BHO's administration).  It's amusing that a so-called lawyer would cite Google search results as opposed to court records.  Obviously you didn't bother to read any of your own references.</comment>

<comment>Great article.  This is a clear example of how prosecutors and law enforcement in their cooperation with legislatures are unintentionally undermining the principles of our justice system.  In some situations, they don't have sufficient evidence to convict people of big crimes.  But, they do have evidence of smaller crimes.  The smaller crimes don't merit the same penalty as larger crimes, but by unnecessarily and unjustly increasing the penalty for smaller crimes, prosecutors can get the big crime penalty while only providing proof of a small crime.  In effect, they prove someone guilty of a small crime and get them the penalty of a big crime.  The prosecutors circumvent the requirement to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the big crime.  It undermines the justice system.  Prosecutors only have to prove a small crime occurred in order to give someone the penalty for a much bigger crime.  Bait-and-switch isn't justice and this case shows how unjust it can be.  I can imagine the conversation now... "We can't get them on manslaughter, but we think they did it.  Oh look, they had a fake ID.  Let's put them away for 20 years.  Who needs to prove manslaughter?  I'm sure they're guilty.  Case closed."  Would you or I want our day in court or would we want to be thrown in jail for 20 years for a fake ID, broken tail light, failure to use a turn signal or some other small 'offense' because some prosecutors assumption that we did a crime that we didn't actually do?</comment>

<comment>I work in a hospital. If some one with a doctored ID came in and tried to buy aborted fetuses, livers, kidneys, or whatever, I would call the cops ASAP and expect an arrest be made.</comment>

<comment>Ummm, not feeling the basis comparison or appeal to not prosecute. These is a HUGE difference between the examples mentioned- grasping at a photographer's camera, or asking for physical help (aka "assault), and creating a false narrative to smear, and following it all the way through to an end that in the least led to millions of public taxpayer money being caught up in courts, and at most, the murder of 3 people in Colorado, and the arson of PPs around the country. An absolute false equivalence of examples. What if a woman made a false claim that she was raped by a man? And that ruined his professional and family life, had him imprisoned, and led to his rape and/or murder? It's happened. Should that woman not be prosecuted? Not prosecuting sets precedent, like we had been seeing in Oregon, prefaced by what we saw in Nevada by the Bundys. What these 2 activists did was worse than shouting "FIRE!" in a crowded theater. They actively broke the law to entrap an organization based on their religious/moral beliefs, which led to major consequences, for the organization and the public... and they should pay dearly in one way or another.</comment>

<comment>The guy isn't going to spend 20 years in jail. He may not spend 20 minutes. My guess is the judge is threatening the maximum sentence to shake the guy up. I'm okay with that. If he ends up spendingHere's the difference between Daleiden and Click. She acted in the heat of the moment and did something wrong that not only caused no real harm, but also might be something she wouldn't have done had she been in a less emotionally charged situation and had she had some time to consider her actions. In the cold light of day, she has shown remorse and suffered personal humiliation and professional loss. I would say the penalty fit the crime. If she were sentence to some community service, that would be okay, but jail time for this is excessive.Datelined spent many months building this bogus case against Planned Parenthood and set out to damage them legally. Has he admitted he was wrong? Has he shown remorse?While his legal gambit failed, his political play succeeded. His fake videos took center stage at the Republican debates and there are those who still claim they are real and others who believe them. There are conversations going on to defund Planned Parenthood and people who may be underserved because of his stunt.When he writes an op-ed in the Wall Street journal admitting he lied, when he appears on O'Reilly confessing to his misdeeds, when he gets up at a Republican rally or goes before congress and pleads on behalf of Planned Parenthood being left alone, I'll join your crusade.Assuming that doesn't happens, if he really does get 20 years or even 20 months, I'll agree that's a bit stiff. But I don't have a problem with him being forced to sweat and having to do something to pay for his lies. Unlike Click, he has yet to suffer any true punishment.</comment>
