<comment>At least he doesn't have his sleeves rolled up. What a sorry representative of our government.</comment>

<comment>Ties are oppressive. There is zero reason for them to exist.</comment>

<comment>Hmm. On how many other issues are you and Ayatollah Khamenei of like views, I wonder? Or....are YOU the Supreme Ayatollah of Iran, slumming? If so, your English is impressive. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/652...</comment>

<comment>Why would you want there to be a tie on his ass? That's not where ties go! Do you even know how ties work?</comment>

<comment>Oh looky..... a sad hater.Ha ha. Love your whine. It makes me wet.</comment>

<comment>All the better for me to fulfill your fantasies, babe. No liberal justice will ever be seated under Obama at this point. Never happen. Better stock up on spermicide.</comment>

<comment>"babe"? "spermicide"?Ah yes, the usual right wing bigotry and assumptions.You are holding a losing hand. Clench it harder, maybe that will help....Ha ha. You fcuking loser.</comment>

<comment>You're talking to a dude.</comment>

<comment>What  kind of freak likes to pretend to be a woman online.  No doubt you are a geek that never gets laid.  Sad life you have.</comment>

<comment>There are effective ways to make a point, and ineffective, whiny shrill ones.</comment>

<comment>Who's Obama kidding with all the plaudits for Scalia?We all know he was popping champagne corks and whooping it up when he got the news. A hole-in-one wouldn't have made him any happier.</comment>

<comment>Of course he was. And now he gets to hog attention again with a court fight, running around scolding Republicans for being un-American in not obeying his wishes instantly. It's gonna be me-me-me all summer. Naturally a narcissist like Obama is thrilled.I'm not sure that this is going to work out well for the Dem candidates. The Court is a even hotter issue among conservatives than among liberals.</comment>

<comment>True, and it's going to be pretty rich if Obama -- who would revoke the Second Amendment in a heartbeat if it were within his power -- begins acting holier-than-thou about the Constitution.I would remind Obama that about 7 years ago, a certain president smirkily declared, “Elections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won.”And at the end of the day, the same rule applies to Congress, Mr. President.</comment>

<comment>Obama is already acting holier-than-thou about the Constitution. His hypocrisy is perfect in that respect. It  has no bounds.</comment>

<comment>Right, Obama is the same "scholar" who once complained that the Warren Court "didn’t break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution."He then derided the Constitution as "a charter of negative liberties. It says what the states can't do to you. Says what the federal government can't do to you but doesn't say what the federal government or state government must do on your behalf." His solution, of course, was to "bring about redistributive change."http://www.nationalreview.com/...Given that, as well as his obsessive opposition to the Second Amendment, there's nothing more pathetically amusing than watching Obama trying to wave the Constitution like a battle flag.</comment>

<comment>The strict constructionists; I love you folks, none of whom could survive more than a week in 1776. You can't even understand how an introductory absolute phrase in English syntax conditions an independent clause that follows.</comment>

<comment>The second Amendment? Being necessary for the security of the free state? The only Statist amendment in the Bill of Rights? Part of the citizen militia are you, ready to stand up anywhere all over the world personally with your tax dollars and your blood, with your well regulated armaments?Actually, this is one of those claims like Obama was not born in the US, or is not a Christian, as the President has openly stated on numerous occasions his support of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.For folks such as you, if the President on a sunny day would say the sun is out, you would reply, he is lying about the nighttime.</comment>

<comment>I find it entertaining that when it comes to the Second Amendment, you consider yourself more qualified to interpret the Founding Fathers' intent than hundreds of years of legal precedent that says citizens have a right to self-defense, regardless of whether they belong to a militia.The rest of your commentary about "folks such as you" has nothing to do with anything I've posted thus far, so I'll step back and let you continue to argue with your own imagination.</comment>

<comment>No, as a matter of fact; I understand grammar, and the weight given to an introductory absolute phrase to condition the independent clause that follows.  There is no other amendment in the Bill of Rights that conditions the right proffered with any such introductory phrase.  Not one. That amendment specifically conditions the right to bear arms with the necessity of securing the free state. There is no word in that Amendment that speaks to self-defense; it speaks only to the defense of the state. Folks such as yourself, the crazies who think Obama has ever stated, even once, that he would excise the Second Amendment, have problems with the English language simply because he would like to see common sense regulations to the commerce of the gun industry.</comment>

<comment>That's all very nice, but the Supreme Court has never seen it your way in the entire history of the United States. So that makes your opinion about as valuable as that of all the beer-swigging armchair quarterbacks who sat on their couches a week ago and screamed "expert" advice to Peyton Manning as he led his team in the Super Bowl.</comment>

<comment>Actually, until the Heller decision, the court for about a hundred years never ruled the way you think it has. Once again: can you show me anywhere in the language of the 2nd Amendment where it speaks to self defense? Anywhere?  This is law, a legal document, not a mind reading exercise.  If you want self defense added then write a new amendment.</comment>

<comment>I don't need to show you anything. The Heller decision didn't grant new rights -- it merely affirmed that under normal circumstances, Americans have a constitutional right to possess a firearm regardless of whether they belong to a militia.When in the entire history of the nation have Americans not had that right?Exactly.</comment>

<comment>You know the nicest things said about Scalia from the court were those remarks made by Ginsburg and Kagan, Justices nominated by Clinton and Obama.  Just saying.</comment>

<comment>...yes, you are an ass.</comment>

<comment>Google George W bush - plenty of pictures of him without a tie.  Are you calling him an ass too?</comment>

<comment>But this was an Presidential statement about an important man's death. Bush always wore a tie making such statements, just as Bush always wore a tie in the Oval Office. For Bush, this was a matter of respect. Obama fundamentally lacks respect for the office he holds.</comment>

<comment>And the Nation that put this dumb fuk in our government, shame on the poor crybabies</comment>

<comment>As I recall, that respectful W. took one full year out of the eight he was in office on vacation.  When a major historic city of our great nation, a city that turned back the British in the War of 1812, and was the birthplace of America's greatest cultural contribution to the world, jazz as popular dance music, was in the throes of a catastrophic flood, he laughed and played guitar, heckofajob Ms. Amnesia.</comment>

<comment>Lol! That's the best you can do? At least you took a break from exposing yourself to children, long enough to post something stupid.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, McConnel. I'm sure that if the president were a Republican right now you'd urge him not to nominate anyone either, right?</comment>

<comment>Well, since the Democrat Congress held off on approving much of the 2009 budget until after Bush was gone, there's hardly a precedent for magnanimity on that side of the aisle either.</comment>

<comment>The Teathugics would prefer to ignore the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Now there's some sophisticated commentary.</comment>

<comment>why should a leftist be allowed to make any decision, regardless of who is in office?The right is right and the left is wrong - the two things cannot be compared equally</comment>

<comment>Are you aware of the term, "literary irony"?</comment>

<comment>McConnel is awful at this stuff.He should have sucked Obama in, daring him to nominate a liberal, slow walked hearings through the summer and vote down early in the fall.</comment>

<comment>You've got a good point there. The whole GOPe is so disconnected they are hopeless at messaging anything. They are talking to the Congressional staff, not the American people.</comment>

<comment>The progressive courts have given the US some really F-up decision.   The Senate needs to block everyone until next year.</comment>

<comment>If they do that, the Democrats will block every Court nomination by the next R president.Do you REALLY want that?</comment>

<comment>I'm fine with that, It's a small price to pay to keep the courts from becoming progressive.</comment>

<comment>The balance is currently 4 liberals, 3 conservatives, and a swing vote. You don't just need to block the next progressive appointment, you actually need to get the seat filled, or the math won't work for you.</comment>

<comment>Your opinions are more important than the Constitution. Got it. The President is now only President for three years and can no longer nominate Supreme Court Justices in his fourth year.Talk about your unpatriotic hatred for the rule of law.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution says the Senate has to approve the appointment.</comment>

<comment>Well, what's the difference?Harry Reid changed the Senate filibuster rules to make it easier to confirm Obama appointments and used a procedural trick to pass Obamacare.Obama is fond of doing end runs around Congress. I also recall his smirky statement: "“Elections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won."Fair enough, Mr. President -- just don't cry about it when the blade cuts both ways.</comment>

<comment>"procedural trick?" that is defined and allowed by the Senate and House rulesboo-hoo</comment>

<comment>What was passed by reconciliation can be repealed by reconciliation.</comment>

<comment>Go for ityou're totally ignoring you'd have a veto to deal with anyway</comment>

<comment>And guess what the rules also say, Peter? The Senate also has the right to confirm or deny presidential nominations to the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>That would be political suicidebut sure go ahead</comment>

<comment>I don't recall it being political suicide when the Democrats denied Bush nominations. Besides, when it comes to their political future, the GOP Senate has more to fear from their own base if they cave to yet another Obama demand.</comment>

<comment>They stopped a few bush nominations but later accepted othersThat's different the GOP is flat out saying they don't want to accept anyone Obama nominates</comment>

<comment>So maybe they should have done it but not said it.</comment>

<comment>Why is that quote from Obama smirky? He did win, both times—no matter how low Megan Kelly had to bend to scrape Karl Rove's chin off the floor when Ohio went for Obama in 2012.And McConnell saying the American people deserve a Supreme Court justice chosen by the people. Well we already go that, via Obama.</comment>

<comment>Successful Presidents work with Congress. They don't announce beforehand that they will refuse to negotiate with the other party at all. This only sets people's backs up. But Obama was fine scolding Republicans instead of crafting bills that could get bipartisan support. The American people punished him for it at both midterms.</comment>

<comment>Wow, that is one perspective of history. Is that all you remember? That Obama just makes unilateral decisions all the time? Why did he do that? Is it because he has been blocked by a do-nothing Congress almost every step of the way? He wanted bipartisanship more than any other President, but when you have a party that says "Let's make him a one-term President" and "our job is to obstruct him at every turn," what do you think the Prez should do then?You don't remember any of that? He's crafted bills with bipartisan support, but's it's never enough for the GOP. They were going to be obstructive regardless.The midterms do not reflect everything the "people" hated about Obama. They also reflect disinterest and lower voter-turnout. That lack of voting has cost all of us.</comment>

<comment>Ah the projection of the right.  One week into the President's administration, Mitch McConnell swore to undercut the President at every turn to make him a failure.The last time the GOP tried to shut down government, which I recall you heartily cheered on, they did so after an agreement had been reached between the Senate Majority leader, a Democrat, and the House Majority leader, a Republican to allow for a clean vote on the House floor, and the agreement was a compromise between the President's plan and that of Congressman Ryan, in which while there were individual tweaks in terms of programs the Dems favored, the over all numbers represented Ryan's plan, and this not long following a Presidential election in which the issue over the budget was the single issue of the election, one in which the Republicans lost.  This discussion about negotiating is ridiculous.  There has never been a more intransigent group in American politics than the Republican House over the past five years.The right wing scream machine is an endless drone of whining, of which you are simply one more out of tune choruser.</comment>

<comment>You're undermining your own argument. Every Supreme Court justice has to be confirmed by a vote of the Senate -- and who elected the Senate?That's right, the people.So, just as the Democrat Senate didn't confirm every nominee Bush put forth, the Republican Senate isn't obligated to confirm every nominee Obama puts forth.This isn't North Korea, Lily -- there are three branches of government, and the other two get to have their say as well.</comment>

<comment>I didn't undermine my own argument. The people elected President Obama - twice. He nominates the Supreme Court Justices a governed by the Constitution. Yeah, that's right people - elected - the current President of the United States.This is not to say that the Senate can't confirm, but to put your own color on Obama's "smirkiness" or to seem to think he doesn't have the power or the "right" to appoint a Supreme is to be willfully ignorant of how government works.The Constitution doesn't say "not in your last year as President" or "not in an election year." That Cruz trying to lie and being bad at it.</comment>

<comment>You say:1. "Yeah, that's right people - elected - the current President of the United States."*** Sure, just as people ELECTED the senators who get to decide whether or not to confirm the president's nomination for Supreme Court justice. We have three branches of government, not one.* * * * *2. "to seem to think he doesn't have the power or the 'right' to appoint a Supreme is to be willfully ignorant of how government works."*** Actually, Obama has the power or the right to NOMINATE a Supreme -- he's not entitled to APPOINT a Supreme.The Senate has the final say on confirmation. If they don't like Obama's first choice ... and second ... and third ... they can continue voting them down until he either picks one they can live with or expends his term in office. It's not as if Democrats have never refused to confirm a Republican president's choice for Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>The 'next R pres' is years and years away...</comment>

<comment>I'm sure Cruz, Rubio, and the rest are already planning who they will nominate. Fortunately, all the GOP candidates have about the same chances of being President as I do. I would like to get me one of those super PACs though.</comment>

<comment>Great.  I think the last time I didn't dislike a Supreme Court nominee was Clarence Thomas.</comment>

<comment>More of the right-wing contempt for democracy on display.</comment>

<comment>Read the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>No not block just vote them down.</comment>

<comment>I don't ordinarily agree with Hillary, but I do here. The lack of respect for the Constitution by Mcconnell, Rubio and Cruz is plain for all to see.</comment>

<comment>Yeah... whatever happened to good old fashioned refusing to confirm?</comment>

<comment>Oh, please ...Where was all this pious moralizing when Harry Reid was blocking House bills, changing the Senate filibuster rules, passing Obamacare with a procedural trick and luxuriating in all the other pleasures of being the majority party in the Senate?</comment>

<comment>You can whine all you want about that, but all those bills actually were put up for a vote. Here we have the fanatical right rejecting a nominee before one is even named, essentially refusing the very idea that the elected leader of the country should be allowed to do his job. Quit pretending they're the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Ha, what a hilarious display of piety!I imagine that Obama's nomination(s) for the Supreme Court will be put up for a vote, too -- it's just that, as with many of Bush's nominees (such as John Bolton for UN ambassador), there's a very good chance that the Senate will vote it down.But look, let's not pretend that Obama and the Democrats really give a rip about subjecting every nomination to a Congressional vote. Does the name Craig Becker mean anything to you? Even after he failed to garner the necessary votes in the Senate, Obama used a recess appointment to put him on the National Labor Relations Board anyway.So really, this holier-than-thou theater isn't going to fool anybody. You're like Bill Belichick complaining about teams that deflate footballs.</comment>

<comment>You are a poster boy for false equivalence.  The historical record is there for all to see: there has never been a Congress in American history, not one that matches those during the Obama administration in the obstruction of judicial appointments.  Not one, not even close.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, right -- that's just an adult version of, "Wahhh! My side isn't getting our way every time!"Your knowledge of history is embarrassingly lacking: Fact is, the last 5 unconfirmed Supreme Court nominees came under Republican presidents; not since LBJ has a Democrat president failed to get his nominee through. Moreover, President Tyler tried 9 times to get a nominee approved by the Senate, and failed 8 times.So there's ample precedent for the GOP Senate to demand that Obama either send them a nominee who meets their criteria (an originalist, perhaps) or continue giving them the hook until time runs out on the Obama presidency.Hey, remember what the smirky Obama said in 2009? "Elections have consequences, and at the end of the day, I won."Why, yes you did, Mr. President -- and at the end of the day, the GOP won the Senate, too.</comment>

<comment>You mean the trick George W. Bush used to get tax breaks for the obscenely wealthy, et al, gutting the American economy in concert with a deregunomic housing market to offset a hundred year long record in job loss after the most prosperous administration era in our recent history, and a trillion dollar war not even put onto the budgetary books by the Republican House and Senate that nearly broke the American bank and set off a world wide depression? That trick?  And only because the R's would not countenance a straight up and down vote? Sorry....</comment>

<comment>Well, you're parroting all the Democrat talking points, but not everything bad in the universe was caused by Bush.I'm not even a Bush fan, but I know that Democrats like Barney Frank played a major role in the 2008 housing market collapse by pushing Fannie and Freddie to approve high-risk mortgages in the name of "affordable housing." Read all about it in The Atlantic: http://www.theatlantic.com/bus...In 2003, Bush tried to create a new agency that would supervise Fannie and Freddie, but whiny Dems like Frank insisted that there was no need for it: "These two entities -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- are not facing any kind of financial crisis," he insisted. Read all about that in the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09...And as late as July 2008, Big Barney (whose party controlled Congress) said this: "Fannie and Freddie are fundamentally sound, that they are not in danger of going under ... I think they are in good shape going forward."D'OH!So it's obvious that the Democrats' fingerprints are all over the financial meltdown, even if you'll never read that on the partisan talking-points sites you frequent.</comment>

<comment>Its funny how they openly mock and reject the Constitution when it suits them but want to claim that any action by Obama done without Congressional support is unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>Why don't we just do a reality TV show contest and whoever doesn't get kicked out of the courtroom gets to fill the vacancy?NB: since this is for TV, it would be a good idea to skew younger/ tighter-bodied than the typical Justice.</comment>

<comment>Four reliably conservative Justices? Would you like me to list the number of cases that would have been decided differently if that were true? For that matter, the four "liberal" justices frequently defy the fidelity of your simple-minded 4-1-4 depiction. This isn't journalism, it's a tenth grade current affairs paper.</comment>

<comment>Obama will never get to appoint the next SCJ. Never.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't mean we should sit and wait 11 months to even begin discussing the vacancy...</comment>

<comment>Puerile are we?</comment>

<comment>Do you have a crystal ball?</comment>

<comment>Guess Bernie or Hillary will have to do it, then.</comment>

<comment>Surprise surprise.  The GOP candidates want to disregard the Constitution in favor of politics, and claim its the "right thing to do".</comment>

<comment>And we'll lose both the First and Second amendments if obama and mincing liberals get their way.</comment>

<comment>Did you miss the last two elections?</comment>

<comment>A county's constitution can always be disregarded in favor of nationalist policies</comment>

<comment>Who cares about county constitutions?  And the Constitution hasn't been disregarded.... that is the point.</comment>

<comment>Ah, yes ... Harry Reid changed the Senate filibuster rules when it suited his purposes and used procedural maneuvers to pass Obamacare. Obama prefers executive orders and end runs around Congress, and would revoke the Second Amendment if it were within his power -- but lo and behold, suddenly Democrats are champions of the Constitution!And you wonder why American voters no longer trust party elites in Washington?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, why show any respect to a scholar on constitutional law? I mean, he's just the president, and well within his responsibilities within his office. </comment>

<comment>Obama, a Constitutional scholar? He doesn't even respect the document, calling it "a charter of negative liberties." And if it were up to him, he'd revoke the Second Amendment with an executive order.Nothing worthy of respect there. He's more obsessed with fundamentally changing America than bringing people together and making this nation stronger.</comment>

<comment>Waaaaah, I don't like the smart man in the WH! Waaaaah.Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at University of Chicago Law School between 1992 and 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, and ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for the United States House of Representatives in 2000 against incumbent Bobby Rush.</comment>

<comment>What "smart man in the White House"? He won't even release his college grades.His resume is on the light side when it comes to political experience, let alone management experience. Community organizing doesn't take a degree -- it's kind of like Protesting 101.</comment>

<comment>Lol, so where do you go to law school? He's the smartest potus since Cinton, easily, and possibly Kennedy. But I'm sure you're in a position to judge his intelligence.</comment>

<comment>I'm in as good a position to judge his intelligence as you are. You're basically the political version of an armchair quarterback.</comment>

<comment>As are you, my friend, only with the apparent added bias. Obama was a US senator as well as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, plus, oh yeah, President of the US for 7 years, and you say his political resume is light. Doesn't sound like a very credible opinion.</comment>

<comment>Except that I was talking about Obama's resume BEFORE he was president.He'd been a U.S. senator for only about 3 years prior to that. Considering that 14 presidents had previously served as vice president and at least 13 had more years than Obama in the U.S. Congress, do you seriously think Obama brought one of history's thicker resumes to the table from a national standpoint?</comment>

<comment>Maybe not. But as soon as someone uses the words community organizer or the name Hussein (not you) in their reply, I know that there is too much underlying bias to see how much Obama has accomplished despite an obstructionist congress, and the Turtle still holding to his treasonous positions. </comment>

<comment>OK, but I think you may have an unrealistic view of national politics.Since when has any Congress gone out of its way to help the other party's president succeed or remain in office more than one term?Certainly the Democrats didn't make life easy for Bush once they took control of Congress. They filibustered, refused to confirm nominees (such as John Bolton), talked about rejecting any future Supreme Court nominees until Bush left office (18 months later) and held off on approving the 2009 budget until Bush was gone, thereby bettering their chances of passing a budget with a trillion-dollar deficit.I'm not saying that's how Washington should work, only that it's how Washington does work at the moment. Even Obama is on record as saying as a senator in 2006 that the confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee "calls for meaningful advice and consent that includes an examination of a judge’s philosophy, ideology, and record."So ... the GOP Senate has every right to treat Obama's nominees the same way he treated Bush's.</comment>

<comment>They may have that right, but when McConnell comes straight out and says the responsibility should be left to the next POTUS, and that they won't even consider an Obama recommendation - even before he makes one - the discussion has now changed. The ideal scenario has them blocking a moderate Obama appointee, and then losing the senate to the dems in the next election, and ending up with a far more liberal justice. That would be perfect!</comment>

<comment>I don't think the discussion has changed at all. What has McConnell ever said that he hasn't taken back, particularly when he vows to stand up to Obama?On the other side, I think Obama is about as likely to nominate a moderate Supreme Court candidate as he is to utter the words "radical Islam." He's a hardcore political ideologue from head to toe, and I fully expect him to seek yet another way of playing the same divide-and-conquer game he's embraced for 7 years.</comment>

<comment>Pffft, whatever. Look, the black Kenyan Muslim gun-stealing, constitution-burning commie  in the Whitehouse will go down as one of the best POTUS in history despite a viciously obstructionist congress.  Deal with it.  </comment>

<comment>Yeah right, our kids and grandkids are going to thank Obama daily for that $20 trillion debt he so generously bestowed them with -- not to mention the incredible shrinking superpower that even the Iranians are now kicking around on the high seas. Meanwhile, the black poverty rate is higher and the median household income is smaller than when he took office.And if you seriously believe Boehner, Ryan and McConnell are obstructionists after the Harry Reid-approved omnibus bills they so meekly signed, you must have grown up in North Korea.</comment>

<comment>Your skewed perspectives are painful. That's why I tried to end this conversation once already. Hopefully, this second time will be more successful. </comment>

<comment>Ummm ... you're the one who can't stop trying to get the last word. Well, have at it.After this, I leave you to your sad little fantasy world, and your Justin Bieber-like adoration of Obama.</comment>

<comment>Best president of your lifetime, and history will recognize him as the same.</comment>

<comment>Your conclusion does not logically follow from the points you put forth.  And Executive Orders are not anything new - they were outlined by the Constitution and have been used by EVERY President - remember Bush using EA's to commit American troops to Afghanistan and Iraq?</comment>

<comment>My point was that average Americans are growing increasingly tired of the hypocrisy, political game-playing and other drama conducted by Washington establishment elitists of both parties.And if you want to talk history, there's nothing inherently unconstitutional about rejecting a Supreme Court nominee -- or more than one -- despite your claim that the GOP is threatening to "disregard the Constitution."President Tyler made nine Supreme Court nominations during the last 15 months of his presidency and eight of them were rejected by the Senate. And the last 5 unsuccessful Supreme Court nominees came from Republican presidents; not since LBJ has a Democrat failed to get his choice approved.So ... it's hardly a constitutional violation to reject one, or two, or even eight of a president's nominees.</comment>

<comment>8 were rejected by the Senate.  NOT ALL.  8.  Cruz and Rubio are asking that ALL nominees be rejected, before they've even been named.  Not a few.  Not "lets wait and see who he names".There is something that blatantly contradicts the constitution in rejecting ALL Presidential SCOTUS nominees solely for the purpose of hoping that your said wins in the election and then beginning the process to actually consider SCOTUS nominees.So yes you are correct - vowing not to consider any SCOTUS nominee put forth by this president does not violate any constitutional amendments but it is a direct and intentional contradiction of everything that the Constitution was put forth to advance.And the fact that you defend it is pathetic.</comment>

<comment>Oh, spare me your pious moral outrage.  Politics is a full-contact sport, and I've seen too much of the Democrats' tactics to fall for any of your sophistry.The Democrats are the party that made "bork" a verb after their treatment of one GOP Supreme Court nominee. Then there was the Anita Hill sideshow that accompanied the nomination of Clarence Thomas.Plus, it's not as if Harry Reid ever set any new integrity standards when he ran the Senate. Nor did he put a lot of effort into bipartisanship.  He changed the filibuster rules to make sure Obama got more of his nominees through, and he used a procedural trick to pass Obamacare.Sure that was all legal. So is the GOP Senate's ability to reject any Obama nominees they don't like ... which could be all of them. I'd suggest that he nominate a conservative originalist to improve his odds of getting a third Supreme Court nominee confirmed.Regardless, there's nothing more disingenuous than invoking the name of the Constitution when you're talking about a president who would suspend the Second Amendment tomorrow if he had the power.</comment>

<comment>1. Talk Ginsburg into retiring2. Nominate 2 SC justices</comment>

<comment>So Scalia is gone.  Such is life.</comment>

<comment>No need for a fight with the Senate.  Obama just makes his choice, but instead of calling them a nominee for SC Justice, simply names him or her to be a "voting observer" at the Supreme Court.Why waste time asking for Senate approval, when you can just make an executive decision?</comment>

<comment>It would not suprise me that some will advise him to try that.</comment>

<comment>It would be of a piece with making treaties into non-treaties so the Senate doesn't need to confirm them.</comment>

<comment>I'm in for Easterbrook. It's too bad that Posner is so old.</comment>

<comment>why would president obama want to nominate a couple of reagan appointees???LORETTA LYNCH NOW!!!</comment>

<comment>YOu would have a better chance of being a SCOTUS justice than her  LOL</comment>

<comment>Agreed on Posner.</comment>

<comment>i would like to see president obama nominate loretta lynch for the supreme court.</comment>

<comment>Eric holderjust to watch their heads all explode</comment>

<comment>Bring him up  to the hill let America see what an extremist he is then vote him down because he is unqualified.</comment>

<comment>This could get even more entertaining if Obama nominated himself for appointment.</comment>

<comment>i would image that such a nomination would be unconstitutional for violating separation of powers. but he could, and should, nominate loretta lynch.LORETTA LYNCH FOR THE SUPREME COURT NOW!!!</comment>

<comment>That would be a great pick, it would tied up for months and by the end everyone would agree to vote her down and we can roll into the next administration.fingers crossed</comment>

<comment>If Obama is allowed to pick another SCJ -- America is ruined.</comment>

<comment>He's doing his job, as dictated in the Constitution. Remember that document?</comment>

<comment>So will the republicans</comment>

<comment>Haven't done so in the past 5 years--the historically worst set of congresses ever.  Scofflaws who do nothing but campaign on doing nothing and having no ideas about what to do other than say no.</comment>

<comment>I've remembered that document every time Obama ran roughshod over it.</comment>

<comment>It's awesome how the GOP cherry picks what they like from that document and calls out everyone else for not "following" the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>The one he takes a whiz on daily?  Yeah, I know it...</comment>

<comment>So if the President fulfilling his Constitutional duties of nominating justices to the Supreme Court does so, America is ruined.  That's what we call strict construction constricted to a bathtub drain.  A left of center court in which the White House over the course of 24 years reflects the electoral view in which two thirds of those appointed are by a President in office, one or the other, 2/3 of those years.  America is ruined if the mandate of more than half of the voting electorate for President over the course of that time is given a proportional opportunity to appoint Supreme Court justices.God how I am amazed how many Americans have been sold such a bill of goods.  How long has the American left had to put up with the appointment of Clarence Thomas? How long will the individual citizens of our nation be saddled with the fundamental problem of our electoral process enabled by the Citizen's United decision?</comment>

<comment>Obama hasn't been fulfilling his Constitutional duties thus far, why all of the sudden you Dems think he should start now?  If you'll recall the same numbnuts who voted for CU (which I disagreed with) also allowed for Obamacare and also made magic by creating rights which previously did not exist in SSM.Now, you can continue to think you're replying to some Right Wing Nut who toes the party line.  You'd be wrong.  Since you brought it up let met tell you my response to Citizen's United --  I'll believe a corporation is a person when Texas executes one.   That being said, Obama picking another SCJ will be ruinous to this country.  Why?  Everything else he's done has been so far, why would this be any different?</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton dishonors our Constitution, our Country, our history, and women world wide simply by breathing our air.</comment>

<comment>Feel free to nominate someone.The Republicans will do their job and not confirm though.</comment>

<comment>Let him nominate let them have hearings and vote them down as many times as needed . All according to the Constitution . These liberal morons screaming about the constitution should google what "advise and consent" means</comment>

<comment>Let him nominate Srinivasan, whom everybody likes, who was given a 97-0 vote when nominated to the appellate courts, and let's just see how it goes. McConnell, et al, have already made their plans clear. But if not, let us see if Clinton wins and nominates the then former President Obama, as she has already previously mentioned, and watch the GOP bar a former United States two term President from getting to a vote.You miss the whole dynamic: the extreme right wing GOP is an obstructionist party, of the knee jerk variety.  The party of NO. The party of the Big Wall. The party of the demonizing other.  No solving problems, just making sure they go and on and on.</comment>

<comment>Hey liberals: When you get your way, the country goes into decline. I know that makes you feel good about yourselves, but not for the lives you ruin in the process.</comment>

<comment>Funny, when Bush was in charge I seem to remember the country mired in foreign occupation, constant military deaths, crony incompetence in New Orleans, and executive branch staff being convicted of multiple felonies.That's not even counting the economic incompetence that collapsed the world economy and sent the world into decline. I'll keep the Democrats thank you.If you think Cruz or Trump is any better, you haven't read their economic and tax plans which are basically a replay of Dubya's failed policies.</comment>

<comment>It's just as bad under Obama, except the media don't report it. Did you know that over 2,000 Americans have died in Afghanistan under Obama? But no reports, no "peace movement", no protests.</comment>

<comment>Certainly the several ways in which the President followed in the footsteps of former President Bush have been errors, but it should be noted vis a vis Afghanistan, had Bush not turned his attention to Iraq, we would have been well out of Afghanistan years before Obama took office.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans appear set on creating a Constitutional crisis. This, in spite of the fact that Mitch McConnell himself said (speaking in reference to Justice Alito's nomination in 2005): "The Constitution of the United States is at stake... "[T]he Republican conference intends to restore the principle that, regardless of party, any President's judicial nominees, after full debate, deserve a simple up-or-down vote.  I know that some of our colleagues wish that restoration of this principle were not required. But it is a measured step that my friends on the other side of the aisle have unfortunately made necessary. For the first time in 214 years, they have changed the Senate's 'advise and consent' responsibilities to 'advise and obstruct.'"The Republicans are not bound to vote for any of Obama's nominees. But they are not permitted to break faith with the customs of the country and our founding documents, by deliberately postponing a vote on those nominees, until such a time that is more politically favorable to them. THAT is a subversion of the democratic order. McConnell forbade the Democrats to trigger a Constitutional crisis with Alito's nomination, and the minimum standards of consistency and honor require the same of today's Republicans. After the 2013 Shutdown & Near-Default I have more faith in GOP radicalization than honor; their behavior in response to Obama's nominee will put that to the test.</comment>

<comment>"The Republicans are not bound to vote for any of Obama's nominees. But they are not permitted to break faith with the customs of the country and our founding documents, by deliberately postponing a vote on those nominees, until such a time that is more politically favorable to them"I think you need to brush up on your history. That's exactly what happened in 1968-1969 when Earl Warren retired and his replacement (Abe Fortas) was filibustered. The end result was that a new judge wasn't confirmed until a year after Warren's announcement and a new President (Nixon) was in office.Whether this was a good act is another story for another day. But it shows that such a move, contrary to your contention, is not outside the customs of our country.</comment>

<comment>I was too young to remember the why of that and I'm too lazy to look it up now, but I believe it was a bipartisan/southern Democrat thing. The liberal majority  in the Senate got their revenge by rejecting a Southern nominee of Nixon's, maybe even two.  I think eventually Rhenquist got in.  If the GOP does this, expect one or two Cruz nominees to burn.</comment>

<comment>Well mainly I was replying to a blogger who made the incorrect claim that it is part of our customs not to delay a vote. That is simply not the case.As to the back story on Fortas, you have the correct general idea. Many officials (more Democrats than Republicans) were upset over many of the "liberal" rulings of Earl Warren. This included rulings not only on civil rights but more importantly on criminal procedure. When Warren announced his retirement, LBJ appointed Fortas (who was already on the Court) to replace Warren. Although this is somewhat symbolic (the Chief Justice doesn't get any more votes than the other justices) Congress filibustered Fortas' appointment as CJ. It was a bipartisan effort based mainly on the fact that Fortas was also very liberal. The next President- Nixon- appointed Warren Burger as CJ to replace Earl Warren. Burger was quickly confirmed (i.e. there was no initial payback).Later, when Fortas himself retired, two of Nixon's appointments Clement Haynsworth and Harrold Carswell were rejected before Harry Blackmun was approved. Whether the Haynsworth and Carswell rejections were "payback" for Fortas is open to conjecture. Certainly it was not Democrat payback to Republicans. All three rejections were bipartisan.</comment>

<comment>When the Dems sat on Miguel Estrada's nomination for TWO WHOLE YEARS, was that a Constitutional crisis? You are such hypocrites, you leftists.</comment>

<comment>What I love about the false equivalence crowd among right wingers is how they can pick out one instance and say everyone does it, when the exception actually proves the rule.  There has never been a more obstructionist legislative environment when it comes to the appointments of justice than during the Obama administration, and it is not even close.</comment>

<comment>What are the chances that Obama will nominate someone who respects the U.S Constitution?Probably about the same as the chances that the sky will fall tomorrow.</comment>

<comment>Depends if Obama decides to be smart for once instead of ideological. His only chance to get someone approved is a moderate nomination. But that's not usually how he rolls.</comment>

<comment>Quite likely he will nominate Srinivasan, a moderate, and well liked and admired on both sides of the aisle. Quite as likely that the right in its typical taking their marbles, what few they have remaining, and go home will not tolerate even countenancing a nomination hearing. Waaaah, Obamaaaaaaah, Noooooooooooooooo! I do not expect any pre school matriculation by GOP legislators to happen soon.</comment>

<comment>Very high.</comment>

<comment>" four reliably conservative justices, four liberals, and one swing vote"Who are the reliable conservatives.......I know who the four liberals judges who never budge on important issues, and I know who the three reliable conservative judges, but to call Roberts a reliable conservative is a mistake.</comment>

<comment>Yes. As evidence, all you have to notice is the discussion about every controversial SCOTUS decision. Nobody wastes a breath or a line of ink wondering how the four liberals will vote. All the discussion is on the conservatives and Anthony Kennedy. The liberals always vote in lockstep.</comment>

<comment>Roberts always votes for corporate interest.  In this, his decision on ACA reflects exactly what the Heritage Foundation and Mitt Romney had in mind for health care, to preserve the private insurance industry and big pharma.  Only the bamboozled right wing cannot see what an incredible compromise ACA was, and much closer to John McCain's vision, with which he was utterly trounced in the Presidential debates, than Obama's own original position.Roberts' Citizen United decision was the most sweeping political SCOTUS judgment in recent history, and certainly his support for the Heller ruling turned back a hundred years of court rulings on the topic.  Roberts is a consistent conservative in a way that most of the tribal right is not.</comment>

<comment>It's going to take millions of phone calls, cards and letters to keep the Republicans from giving Obama his first pick.</comment>

<comment>The blue state Republicans can vote to confirm and he still won't get the 60 he needs.</comment>

<comment>Rot in the deepest, darkest pit of Hell you racist, homophobic, Bible thumping misogynist. Hopefully Thomas will join you soon.</comment>

<comment>He loved to be hated by you people. Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Not really mature, dude.</comment>

<comment>Don't get mad at him. He can't help it. It's just how his people are. It's in their nature.</comment>

<comment>"His people"?Are you saying that liberals are like that, or that trolls are like that?</comment>

<comment>I don't really give a shit amigo. I'm glad this trash is finally in the bin.</comment>

<comment>Read 'em and weep, conservatives.I'm going to enjoy your whiny, loser posts.</comment>

<comment>There will be no Obama (or Hillary) nominee who can get 60 votes. It will be 4-4 until Ginsberg dies. Then it's our turn to celebrate.</comment>

<comment>Like, I said, I'm going to enjoy your whining. :)I'm enjoying it already.</comment>

<comment>I hope you enjoy it when we shut down the government, default on the debt, and all you people starve without your food stamps.</comment>

<comment>HAHAHAHA!Listen to you.Loser. :)</comment>

<comment>Man..you really shouldn't be proud of the fact that you want the country to default.</comment>

<comment>Because a global financial meltdown won't hurt you?  Well, you've got the bunker filled with gold and Ramen noodles, so cool.  Ah, of course you are just trolling.  Have fun.</comment>

<comment>I don't think it's very conservative to want one branch of the government to be non functional for one year, let alone eight.</comment>

<comment>I never claimed to represent conservative opinion.</comment>

<comment>The only ones who seem to be whining are the folks who imagined that Scalia hated them.</comment>

<comment>Why would anyone care what an intellectual lightweight like Obama thinks about a real man and jurist? These last few months of this administration are going to be interesting in a Chinese curse kind of way.</comment>

<comment>Um, have any of the GOP heavyweights yet come to an understanding of the past 150 years of scientific evidence supporting the Theory of Evolution?</comment>

<comment>My guess is most of them have abandoned the theory of going to hell for the theory of "you only go around once in life so grab, grab, grab" and the Democrats are exactly the same. You won't find any believing Christians in the Democrat/Republican Clown Car Cabal.</comment>

<comment>The pragmatic choice is a judge in his or her 70s, with sterling moderate credentials. The chances of such an individual being nominated are higher, and it's a good hedge for an Administration which has no guarantee that the next Administration will be liberal. It's the same for Senate conservatives, if they fail to approve a moderate judge well advanced in years now, they could face a much younger and more liberal judge a year from now.</comment>

<comment>It's a good way to flush this out as the partisan nonsense it is.  The Democrats would try it as well, but they aren't in that position.  The interesting thing will be that if HRC wins,  the Senate, no matter how republican, would be forced to confirm her nominee, who would be more liberal than this theoretical moderate.</comment>

<comment>The only nominee she has spoken of, heh, Barack Hussein Obama.  The ultimate irony.</comment>

<comment>What if he nominates Susan Collins or Olympia Snow?  They are probably more liberal than their voting records, and as Senators, are chock full of Senatorial privilege.  I bet he nominates a female circuit court judge with moderate views appointed by a Bush, if such a thing exists.</comment>

<comment>Read about Sri Srinivasan, the leading candidate.  Better than those you mention.  He has to nominate a moderate and one with a sterling legalistic record, and he is likely to do so.  It will not matter. For six years now, the right has been complaining about a health care plan originally thought up by a conservative think tank, and first put into practice by a Republican governor.  Whatever this President does, the pesin envy of the GOP will subsume their response.</comment>

<comment>In some cases, that hate is due to his color.  If Obama nominated God the Holy Spirit, the Republicans would refuse to hold hearings, probably citing that "he or she is only the third person of the Trinity."Both parties, but especially the GOP, seem to have forgotten that what goes around comes around.  I kind of long for the days when these appointments went out as political favors.</comment>

<comment>I expect the GOP to win in November.  They are just way more motivated though this could really change that.  If that hapoens, no way Ginsberg lives 8 years, so any change in the balance won't last.</comment>

<comment>Has anyone pointed out yet that Thomas will now have no idea how to vote?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure that these are Mr. O's legitimate and true feelings towards Justice Scalia./sI can't help but think that Mr. O was gleeful when he heard of Justice Scalia's passing.  I'm also not surprised to see he alreadry has reportedly some nominees in mind and that he plans to push ahead and get the nomination process started.</comment>
