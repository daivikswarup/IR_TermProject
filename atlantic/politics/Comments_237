<comment>Here's an ad:That loser Trump is about to lose again. What a loser.</comment>

<comment>$4.4 billion in ad spending alone?  There is something sickenly wrong about the sums of money we're allowing to be spent on this.  We have a fully functioning news operation in this country; if advertising is the only way voters are getting their information, that's a serious problem.Ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about buying elections, this is a significant part of the issue.  Not to mention, how that money could be better spent on things we actually need.</comment>

<comment>I've said this before, but I'm genuinely envious of democratic countries whose "election season" is about two to three weeks long.</comment>

<comment>For larger countries, 2-3 weeks is a little short: It takes time to fly around, meet people, give speeches, have debates, etc.2-3 months would be fine.</comment>

<comment>Like North Korea or Cuba?</comment>

<comment>Canada just had it's longest election in decades which stirred quite a bit of controversy even though it was 'only' just over two and a half months (campaigns usually don't exceed much more than one month in recent times and a 'long' campaign usually registers as two months plus or minus a day).In the UK and New Zealand election campaigns rarely exceed a month.If ever there was a good catalyst to get more people to support campaign reform, I would imagine it's being constantly bombarded by a bunch of shallow, patronizing propaganda from grand-standing yahoos and their supporters. But who knows? It will be interesting to watch.</comment>

<comment>More like the UK and Australia.</comment>

<comment>Who should decide who can spend money on what?</comment>

<comment>You can be sure only a fraction of those billions are contributed by the average Joe voter.  The rest is lobbyist and special interest money.  And no, I don't agree with Citizens United that campaign contributions are a form of free speech.</comment>

<comment>"You can be sure only a fraction of those billions are contributed by the average Joe voter. The rest is lobbyist and special interest money."Well, we know that over $600 Million will come from fewer than 200 people, and that over a billion will be dark and anonymous.</comment>

<comment>It's working for Jeb!. All that money and they still can't shove crap down our throats, the poor, poor rich people. :-(</comment>

<comment>Don't worry about the poor RICH people, Hillary will be taking care of them soon enough.</comment>

<comment>It's not working so great for her either.</comment>

<comment>Dark and anonymous?  You mean like George Soros?</comment>

<comment>Citizens United stands for freedom of speech.   You favor letting a bunch of entrenched politicians writing the rules to keep down their opposition.</comment>

<comment>Citizens United stands for *bribery*. *I* favor letting a bunch of *well-financed individuals write* the rules *to favour their interests and* to keep down their opposition.FTFY.</comment>

<comment>Like the teachers and municipal workers unions?</comment>

<comment>Yes.  Anyone that could be considered a special interest group, regardless of which side of the political spectrum they're on.</comment>

<comment>The left wing media.  Who else?</comment>

<comment>The Democrats control the media.  Maybe we can have a one party system and avoid all of this?</comment>

<comment>Have you ever worked in the business?  When was the last time you were in a newsroom (for more than an hour)?  I've been working in mainstream news organizations for the last 15 years.  I can assure you the Democrats don't control anything.Pretty much everyone I've ever worked with was determinedly non-political on a professional level.  On a personal level the conservative/liberal split would surprise you.  It's pretty close to the population as a whole, and varies by region.  The boss types are, just like boss types in every industry, conservative leaning, and as in any industry they could care less about politics -- they're focused on $.</comment>

<comment>What is sickening is our Federal government spends nearly $4 trillion a year. Who wouldn't want to spend a fraction of that to try and control how such massive spending gets directed.  Think of all the cronies you could reward and  all the personal interests you could advance with that kind of control.</comment>

<comment>This is an extremely superficial analysis despite all the graphs, in terms of what citizens are subjected to. TV ads are easily avoided if you don't watch WMUR (a mediocre station at best) or the handful of Boston happy-talk type of stations.  But there is also a relentless flood of direct mail flyers and phone calls (pollsters and campaigns).  You should see the waste container at our post office, how many flyers never leave the building!  And we are among the many who just stop answering the phone from 5 p.m. - 8 p.m.</comment>

<comment>Iowa was extremely close.  DUH!Do you think Hillary is going to waste money on a state she will obviously lose by a landslide?  She is the one with the big money. I drove up to go skiing last week and did not see a single Hillary poster.  Maybe the old witch can't get any students to stick'em in the ground?</comment>

<comment>She may lose, but she still can get delegates there. I think the point about only having one state-based station is most relevant. Although I'm not sure there's really harm in advertising in Boston...won't they be advertising there eventually, anyway?</comment>

<comment>I'll be glad when this is over so we can go back to not hearing about New Hampshire for another 4 years.  They are irrelevant.  Might as well make Delaware the bellwether state.</comment>

<comment>What an incredible waste of money - particularly on campaigns that have no hope.  The billionaires funding this are a bunch of suckers.</comment>

<comment>In general they didn't become billionaires by wasting money.  Even in defeat they're greasing wheels and re-enforcing their network of cronies.</comment>

<comment>You give some money to the people you want to win.... and then you give some less money to the people you don't want to win. So, just in case they do, you can still go in and talk to them about that tax they are trying to impose.</comment>

<comment>Jeb!See?Spending $ is very important!</comment>

<comment>Is anyone actually convinced by political ads? Whenever I see one I just assume whatever it's saying is a lie. If I was told the earth goes around the sun in a political ad I'd call bulls*it</comment>

<comment>Well, people are stupid enough to convinced by politicians and I always assume when they're talking that they're lying, so why not also political ads?</comment>

<comment>Commercials are one of the main reasons why the only TV I watch comes from the Internet.</comment>

<comment>I have yet to see a campaign ad on television or in print. Then again, I live south of the Equator.Imagine my despair.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if some of the difference between Iowa and NH ad buys might be due to different media habits of the residents. I'm just guessing, based on anecdotes of my friends, but there are a fair number of cord-cutters in NH. TV here is perhaps less relevant.As for those here in the comments worried about the "buying of the election" those billions in ad spending suggest, note that all these ad buys have relatively little impact. Trump has bought the fewest ads, and Jeb the most. And their standings show no correlation. i like to think of ad buys by billionaires as wealth redistribution. </comment>

<comment>The article answers its own question: NH has one TV station and the Boston stations that NH viewers watch have some of the most expensive ad spaces of any market in the country.  But let me tell you what: when people are running for US Senate and/or governor in both states, political ads on Boston TV stations are absolutely inescapable.  Entire commercial breaks are comprised of them, half of which you are ineligible to vote for because you are in the other state.  It's  awful.</comment>
