IF CAPS TOO EXCITE YOU SIMPLY DONT READ THE COMMENT. </comment>

<comment>You say that like rolling back tax cuts isn't really taking money away from people.  Except it is, because the money never belonged to the government in the first place.</comment>

<comment>You should read this article:http://www.politico.com/magazi...</comment>

<comment>Government runs the printing presses. Every dollar in your wallet belonged to government first. Then they let you use it, and ask for some back in the form of taxes so they can provide services, like Social Security, Medicare, roads, ports, flood control, a military, and so forth. Its really a pretty good deal for most of us.</comment>

<comment>States can opt out of they don't like changes to the funding formula.</comment>

<comment>Won't change the stank on Canal.</comment>

<comment>There are going to be a lot of challenges in implementation in Louisiana, given the state's crippled budget situation and overall poor health care system.</comment>

<comment>There are challenges in providing all government services. Health care for the poor is one among many. Government has a responsibility here, so they need to do what they can within their constraints.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  I hope it goes well, but we should be aware that the situation is more ripe for challenges and problems than is normal with large bureaucracy.</comment>

<comment>Yes but other states have managed this already. Its not a Mars shot.</comment>

<comment>Louisiana's budget is in really bad shape.  Bobby Jindal was a fiscal disaster for the state.  Edwards is inheriting a situation that is not quite as bad, but similar to, the fiscal situation Obama inherited in 2008.  Louisiana has cut education and health care more severely than any state in the past eight years.  They have a lot of work to do just to get back to being minimally functional.</comment>

<comment>They're not providing health care, though; they're merely providing insurance.Good luck finding providers (outside of the ER) who will take Medicaid!</comment>

<comment>"Now, the work begins."Yeah, for all of us not on Medicaid who end up having to pay for it.</comment>

<comment>Guess what, Sherlock? You're paying for them anyway. What do you think happens when a poor person can't afford to pay for health care out of their own pocket? They wait until they get really sick, go to the ER, and the hospital has to absorb the cost. The prices you and I pay for our care has already taken into account that a large percentage of people can't pay.</comment>

<comment>You people always say that, but never mention that too is a problem created by the government.  The Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act is what requires hospitals to treat people that can't pay.</comment>

<comment>In other words, you want hospitals to be allowed to turn people away who can't pay. By the way, how do you determine when someone can't pay if they show up in the ER? If they're having a heart attack, do you stop to ask if they have insurance or enough cash on them?</comment>

<comment>What do you suppose happened prior to that law being passed in 1986?</comment>

<comment>Gee, why do you think that law was passed in the first place?</comment>

<comment>LOL, seriously.  Can people like John not imagine being in a situation where they don't have an ID but they're in need for emergency treatment?  If I were the richest man in the world I'd still want this law to exist.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure he's the "right" color so he wouldn't worry about it.</comment>

<comment>But it's still crazy- I mean, what if you go to the beach and almost drown- no ID = too bad?</comment>

<comment>the ironic thing is people like him blubber about death panels</comment>

<comment>People like John have insurance so they know they'll never be turned down by a hospital. And if he had his way, the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act would be repealed.</comment>

<comment>what happens if you're hit by a bus and forgot your insurance card that day?Should the hospital be allowed to let you bleed out while they call the insurance company?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but what if you're robbed and then stabbed? Now you have no ID and in need of a hospital visit. Surely John has thought of that? No?</comment>

<comment>John believes in the free market. And in the free market, you can negotiate, even when the customer needs your service the most. Have you been shot and you're bleeding out? OK, sign this contract that says we'll take your house and then we'll treat you.</comment>

<comment>It was common practice to shuffle around undesirable patients to various facilities until they got dumped on one that would take themgreat system if you have an emergency</comment>

<comment>so you don't care if they die?</comment>

<comment>He only cares about his money.</comment>

<comment>Do you care if kids die of malnutrition in Africa, because you can save a lot more lives with 50 cents a day worth of food than you can with $4,000 a year Medicaid insurance.</comment>

<comment>so you're answering my question, with a question?interesting.</comment>

<comment>Cause he doesn't want to admit that he enjoys seeing poor people die.</comment>

<comment>nice strawman you got there</comment>

<comment>It isn't a strawman, it is an argument based on comparative advantage. You're effectively trying to argue that the suffering of others is my responsibility to fix, so I am attempting to illustrate the folly of saying that in the context of providing expensive insurance to Americans in a world where millions are suffering from something even more basic and cheaply solved.</comment>

<comment>Its a nice tidy intellectual argument that is morally bankrupt. Just because we can't solve every problem doesn't mean we should not solve those that we can solve.</comment>

<comment>So why have you decided to try and solve a very expensive problem instead of a very cheap one impacting far more people?  I'll tell you why.  Politics.</comment>

<comment>Am I take that as another way of saying:"You are correct. I do not care if they die. And while this position may be cruel and morally bankrupt to you, let me redirect your ire and disapproval by suggesting that people die all the time in Africa and the costs for saving them is less. Ergo, when my general indifference and unwillingness to do more, even at an affordable cost, to help others is taken into account my callousness is rectified."I feel like this conversation would be more honest if you would just say 'You are correct. I don't care.' rather than trying to rectify yourself. If you really do have faith in your position, you should be openly acknowledging it rather than feeling the need to defend you honour for having that belief in the first place.</comment>

<comment>No, merely stating the response you wish to respond to does not make it my position.  Second, caring and action are two totally separate things.  If some climbers are stranded in an ice storm on Mount Everest I can still care what happens to them even though there is nothing I can do to assist.My position is that what happens to other people is only my responsibility if I caused the condition that they are suffering from or if I am their guardian.  Since I don't generate illness or injury and I have no dependents then sick or injured people aren't my responsibility.   Further, in the event that I do choose to use my money to help I do so  in a way that will do the most possible good, which is most certainly not spending thousands a year providing health care in expensive Countries like the US while folks are dying of malnutrition that can be prevented for less than $1 a day.</comment>

<comment>"My position is that what happens to other people is only my responsibility if I caused the condition that they are suffering from or if I am their guardian. Since I don't generate illness or injury and I have no dependents then sick or injured people aren't my responsibility. "Your conclusion is that they are not your responsibility and therefore do not care if they die or are not willing to pay what you currently pay in taxes to save their life. You made it clear that if it meant that if your taxes could be reduced if it meant that people at the emergency rooms could not afford to pay for their bills you would do so. It's either because you do not care if they die or you feel bad about what is happening but you are not willing to pay what you currently pay in taxes to save their life.</comment>

<comment>You keep misinterpreting lack of desire to act with lack of caring.  I could just as easily accuse you of not caring about starving people because you seem to want to spend thousands on emergency room treatments to save one person at the expense of letting a dozen starve to death.  As I have previously mentioned limited resources are best spent in the areas with the highest payback which does not include using high cost medical services to save one person in a world full of people dying for want of 50 cents a day worth of food.</comment>

<comment>"You keep misinterpreting lack of desire to act with lack of caring."I was actually looking at your preference to keep a trivial tax contribution rather than relinquishing it to save someone's life in an emergency situation if their ability to pay for a hospital bill couldn't immediately be proven. Your view both baffles and astounds me but I hope it changes and that's about all I can do here.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.  That law was signed by that crazy lefty Ronald Reagan.</comment>

<comment>There is no left or right, there is only authoritarian and anti-authoritarian.</comment>

<comment>No.  There is only yours.  Screw everybody else.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm...I always wondered who this guy was (the guy cheering about walking over the dead in the streets): https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Now I know.</comment>

<comment>Guess what trait all Trump supporters have in common? Authoritarianism. No wonder he's winning the Republican vote.</comment>

<comment>So we should let people just die at the curb? What....are you wearing an "I love Ebennezer Scrooge" t-shirt?</comment>

<comment>No, he's simply restating the Teahadist's "healthcare plan:"  "If you get sick, die quickly."</comment>

<comment>There is no we.  You do what you want and I'll do what I want and we'll leave everyone else to decide for themselves what they will do.  See how freedom works?</comment>

<comment>The we is Americans. See how a country works?</comment>

<comment>By working to subvert individual choice and compel participation under threat of force?</comment>

<comment>It'll be interesting to compare Kentucky and Louisiana a few years from now. One state is embracing Obamacare while the other is dismantling it. Or as Chelsea Clinton would say, they're dismaneling it.It would be nice if more Democrats would actually call out Medicaid opposition for what it really is. If you were to ask conservative voters who they think is poor, they'll say it's minorities. And that's what bothers them most. It isn't simply that tax dollars are being used to help poor people. It's that those poor people are black. Why did the state shrug when people were drowning in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina? Because it just a bunch of poor black people. Same with Flint. It's just a bunch of poor black people being poisoned.</comment>

<comment>Politics has tendency to oscillate, like a pendulum, between one extreme and another.</comment>

<comment>Awesome! If they hurry we can have all of Louisiana before death panels by the end of March.  Well, not ALL of Louisiana, just the Real Americans.</comment>

<comment>So, what exactly is a 'death panel'? And how many states that have expanded medicaid have held a 'death panel'? How many medicaid recipients have been sentenced to  death by 'death panels'? Just curious if you have any insight into this phenomenon!</comment>

<comment>Your sarcasm detector appears to be malfunctioning...</comment>

<comment>The thing is, enough right wing posters use your almost exact words that how is one to know when it is sarcasm?</comment>

<comment>This is true.  BTW, we've been doing our own forum on Disqus if you're interested</comment>

<comment>No thanks, Busy day and I already waste enough time here. Are you hiding from the Nazis?</comment>

<comment>Haha, kind of.  We started last week as a kind of alternative to the troll threads</comment>

<comment>I'm interested!</comment>

<comment>I'd be interested if you're willing to have me.  Is there a PM feature in Disqus?  (I'm something of a luddite.)</comment>

<comment>Yes of course!  You're one of my most admired commenters here.  I don't think we can PM, but if you check out my feed and if you find the What do you want to talk about? it links to our discussions and then you can follow that</comment>

<comment>Thanks!  I followed and posted a hello message.</comment>

<comment>I love the smell of socialism in the morning...</comment>

<comment>What do you do with a budget deficit? INCREASE SPENDING! Oh, makes total sense. And let's not forget that this guy only got elected because people didn't like Vitter.</comment>

<comment>Because health care for the sick poor is FREE right now in Louisiana, don't you know.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure you're joking (forgive me for my inability to sense sarcasm in writing) but if you ain't, let me remind you that when a government man tells you something is "free" it means "somebody else is paying for it".</comment>

<comment>I never understood the states that aren't taking the money for this. They are taxed on it and their taxes just go to another state. Even when the full federal funding is over the Feds still pay 90% of the cost to get a big chunk of their population insurance. This is like the biggest no brainer of all no brainers and denying insurance to people is morally pretty dubious, especially when the money's already there and allocated for this very purpose!</comment>

<comment>Spite is a powerful thing</comment>

<comment>Its ideology. Its all about opposiing government, regardless of the impact on their budget or their population.</comment>

<comment>If they admit Obama gave them something the universe might explode</comment>

<comment>They need to pretend Obama hasd nothing to do with it, like they did in Kentucky for a while.</comment>

<comment>Is it guaranteed that the fed will forever and always pay 90%?  If not then committing to shoulder the burden later might not be a good long term idea.</comment>

<comment>the SCOTUS ruled states can opt out.  So if the pricing arrangement is changed by a new law later they can drop it</comment>

<comment>Actually, I think the 90% is a match, not that the Feds cover 90% of all costs so that might be why many states ditched the expansion.  </comment>

<comment>No they ditched it out of political spite</comment>

<comment>90% is what is in the law. Someone would have to change the law to change that figure.</comment>

<comment>I think it is a 90% Match, not 90% coverage of new costs.   That could meat expansion is still a very expensive long term commitment.  </comment>

<comment>It's not a match.</comment>

<comment>I stand corrected.</comment>

<comment>I think they're playing the long game. People who qualify for Medicaid are probably poor enough to qualify for a host of other government bennies as well. From a government perspective, they're costly. Now, imagine you're a red state that hasn't expanded Medicaid, and you're surrounded by other states that did. How long do you think it will take before your poorest, sickest, most expensive citizens move across the state line to get free care elsewhere?</comment>

<comment>Once again, a Democrat is cleaning up the mess of an ideological, hopelessly impractical GOPer.</comment>

<comment>*trying to* clean up the mess(1) Jindal left an awfully big mess to clean up(2) Just because one party's ideas are lousy does not necessarily make the other party's ideas good, or even better.  (In this case, the policy change is a good one, but the implementation is still to be judged.)</comment>

<comment>"She described those problems with urgency in her voice: one northern city with a facility whose infant-mortality rate is “double many developing countries”; a statewide high HIV rate; high syphilis and STI rates; infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome, also known as neonatal withdrawal; and drug use. "Republicans freak out when a terrorist shoots 16 people in California, but could not care less if thousands of Americans die prematurely from lack of health care. In a rich country, it is shameful to have the health problems among the poor that we have.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes the south aint too smart.Like south carolina, some of them are just stepin fetchit bumpkins.</comment>

<comment>It's good that the people of Louisiana finally came to their senses and elected a governor who will work for them. They need all the help they can get after enduring years of Bobby Jindal. </comment>

<comment>Heck, just showing up and working *at all* is an infinite improvement over Gone-to-Iowa Jinal. It takes serious effort to be that derelict in one's duties.</comment>

<comment>"Louisiana Embraces Sanity"FTFY.</comment>

<comment>It's about time. Bobby Jindal was one brick short of a load anyway. He was like a talking points memo. Everything Obama suggests just had to be bad for the country. He like others in his party really couldn't give a flying fig about other people getting health care. They all have theirs so who cares about anyone else getting it? Republicans must be the most selfish party in creation. It's all about me myself an I with them.</comment>

<comment>The truth of Obamacare in Louisiana was exposed in his statement regarding implementation, he said he wants to have 300k in the system by July 1st, that is essentially the only block of people it will help, out of the millions of citizens we currently have. It's gonna hurt more people than it helps but in the mind of a Democrat that's acceptable.</comment>
