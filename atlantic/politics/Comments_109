<comment>The $64,000 question. Will he mention the 10 US sailors being held in Iran?Or just brag about the Iran deal?</comment>

<comment>Not a chance.</comment>

<comment>Why mention something that doesn't matter? Dudes are about to be released after we sailed into their water.</comment>

<comment>He is the Commander in Chief  It should matter to him.</comment>

<comment>Disgraceful by our Commander in Chief to quietly negotiate their release outside of public view instead of bravely using them to score cheap political points in a speech.  A total disgrace to our nation.  Thanks Obama!</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. I hope now that they've been safely and quickly released, the people steadily trying to manufacture crises where none exist will just move on to their newest make-believe crisis.</comment>

<comment>There's another make-believe crisis right after this manufactured crisis that we managed to survive?  This is a crisis!!  A crisis of make-believe crises!  Thanks Obama!</comment>

<comment>It demonstrates bad faith on Iran's part, especially WRT the nuclear deal. It doesn't require too much paranoia to suspect that the Iranians coordinated this just to embarrass Obama.</comment>

<comment>No it doesn't, and yes it requires quite a bit. We violated their territorial waters. It doesn't show bad faith unless they try and hold the sailors as a bargaining chip.Most experts believe this is about embarrassing Rouhani and trying to create distrust between the US and Iran. Don't play into their hands.</comment>

<comment>It worked.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't take too much paranoia to suspect the US ships were intentionally probing Iranian waters to assess their response... and the timing was determined by US officials not fond of Obama or the deal with Iran.</comment>

<comment>More than likely we deliberately entered their waters to test their response. We do that to them all the time.They had a duty (the US guys) to escape and they didn't, just like the pilot of the navy plane that China captured just before 911 had the duty to fly that plane into the ocean and destroying anything of value to the Chinese.</comment>

<comment>Didn't take the usual sort very long to try and politicize that did it? You and the Iranian hardliners all want the same thing, ironically.</comment>

<comment>Weird how the religious, nationalists, that hate women's rights, gays, ethnic minorities, totalize their enemies and appeal to fear and military jingoism are the same in both countries.</comment>

<comment>I want those sailors returned safely immediately.</comment>

<comment>You're not fooling anyone. You want to gin up conflict with Iran, and your intentions are transparent.Those sailors will be released, and you'll forget about them until the next time you need a proxy in your "Iran is bad and Obama is bad" narrative.</comment>

<comment>Here to agitate as usual with nothing positive to add.</comment>

<comment>Your initial comment was a partisan display to "agitate". My response is based in my understanding of the situation. Unlike you, I don't need to lie on this topic.You do realize Iran experts believe this may have been done by hardliners to embarrass Rouhani, right? That your rhetoric plays exactly into the hands of the hardliners you claim to oppose? The best thing to do is do what US officials are doing. Stay quiet and wait for them to be released. Supposedly a mechanical failure accidentally brought them into Iranian waters, but once they were there Iran did have a right to detain them.</comment>

<comment>And what experts are you referring to?</comment>

<comment>Ones quoted in half a dozen news articles and on twitter. Try Google sometime. The IRGC using incidents like this to attack moderates in Iran is pretty well known at this point, it's not exactly novel. That's why they're claiming we were "snooping" on them.</comment>

<comment>So no experts just your BS</comment>

<comment>I don't feel like digging up names for what I know is a bad faith right wing troll. Try the NYT, I know they have an article up. I know Iranian politics well enough to be secure in my assertion. What I stated isn't controversial.I don't know who you think you're fooling into thinking you understand this subject, honestly. You're best known for trolling with the neo-Nazi crowd and attacking anyone that is mean to their ilk. </comment>

<comment>Always.  His view is always the same:  The Koran is not really violent, Islam is the religion of peace, women are treated like queens by Muslims, Muslim countries are wonderful and trustworthy, and we should bring in as many as possible to the U.S.</comment>

<comment>Iran is our enemy.  Obama is leaving us a fine mess with an enemy.  We will be dealing with this crap for decades.</comment>

<comment>There are no "enemies" in international politics. There are people you can work with, and people you can't, and those categories constantly change.Nice to see the neo-Nazi contingent is how here in force though. Maybe the site will catch you all. </comment>

<comment>How many more months of the Muslim left?  I will throw a party.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for exposing yourself as a racist bottom feeder. Go play with the rest of your ilk. I know none of you know the first thing about Iran or international law.</comment>

<comment>Islam is not a race.Buy  yourself a clue </comment>

<comment>You're a racist!  Does it ever get old?</comment>

<comment>You're a naive fool if you think we don't have enemies.  Iran is absolutely an enemy to the United States. </comment>

<comment>The botched war in Iraq is what created several terrorists for each of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who died because of us. That's what's going to take decades to fix.</comment>

<comment>Oh.  I'm so glad you told me that.  For a moment I thought it was the Koran, which instructs Muslims to lie and deceive non-Muslims and Jews, and orders the conversion to Islam of non-Muslims and Jews, or else they should be murdered.Also, I was so confused before you told me that.  I thought for a moment that Muslims had treated females worse than dogs for 1400 years.  Apparently not, huh?</comment>

<comment>Apparently your bigotry blinds you to billions of peaceful Muslims. I know you want to blame every single member of a huge group for the failures of a small group. I'm sure that's what Jesus would do.</comment>

<comment>Are these "peaceful" Muslims raised with the Koran, or are they atheists?  Because if they were raised with the Koran, they were raised to despise non-Muslims, to despise Jews, to lie and deceive both, and to kill both if these do not convert.  How about those "peaceful" Muslims, huh?</comment>

<comment>I realize that you've already made up your mind and won't listen to anything that even remotely contradicts your insistence that Islam is the only religion that calls for non-believers to be killed and that killing non-believers is the only thing that's contained in the Quran, but just in case there are folks out there whose minds aren't completely closed to facts and reason, I'll just point to Deuteronomy. Leviticus gets the bad rap, but Deuteronomy contains some of the most bloodthirsty passages in all the Bible. There's even one that calls for the entire populations of towns (including believers!) to be killed if there is so much as a single non-believer in the town.Why don't you go monger your hate at Stormfront or 4chan. Those folks eat that stuff up.</comment>

<comment>First thing I did after reading what you wrote about Muslims, is look up at your ID, and you are OF COURSE, a male.  A liberal male.  No wonder you don't give a s**t how Muslims treat females, how they've treated females for 1400 years, and are willing to paint them as saints.  Do run along.</comment>

<comment>Who cares? Iran is treating it like an accident and will be letting them go soon.</comment>

<comment>They were arrested according to Iranian news .</comment>

<comment>Where? Fars has nothing, and that's a regime paper. If they're not bragging about it, there's a reason.</comment>

<comment>"However, FARS, an Iranian news agency, said that the ten sailors had been arrested and were suspected of “snooping.”"https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>I checked on the Fars site. The fact that they aren't using that for propaganda purposes is telling. I wish WashPo would place a link to the source.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, no. </comment>

<comment>Yes he is an Iranian terrorist supporter</comment>

<comment>He will always back a Muslim first.</comment>

<comment>"He will always back a Muslim first."Refusing to vilify billions of Muslims because of the actions of terrorists is simply a rational, grown-up response.</comment>

<comment>You noticed that too.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>No, it means that they aren't trying to make this an issue. Look on the Fars site, there's plenty of thinly veiled regime propaganda. If they wanted this to be an issue, they could make it one. What state-run media (Fars is considered semi-official but aligned with the regime) says or doesn't say is a big clue about intent.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>If he had the balls he would say You get your 100 Billion when we get back our sailors that would get them back alot faster.</comment>

<comment>Iran doesn't want to make an incident out of this.</comment>

<comment>WE shall see very soon.</comment>

<comment>Yes they do- to taunt Obama. There was nothing but Iran's word saying the Navy guys accidentally ventured into their territory. No confirmation they did. Poor Navy guys. </comment>

<comment>Except the US military that admits a mechanical failure seems to have caused those boats to cross the border.</comment>

<comment>Link please? Are you cheering that this accidental mishap is all it takes. They still have our other 3 hostages. And we have their $150B that we still give them even though they broke the deal a couple of months ago. </comment>

<comment>NYT. Go Google it yourself.</comment>

<comment>So that was just wishful thinking </comment>

<comment>What, you're too dishonest to google the New York Times yourself?</comment>

<comment>They announced they would be released on Wednesday (tomorrow) before the President finished speaking.</comment>

<comment>You have no compassion. Yes it matters a lot. And you trust Iran- ha ha </comment>

<comment>Iran is our enemy, but not to Obama!  Obama has never met a Koranist he didn't like.</comment>

<comment>Iran is not our enemy. And, they are fully abiding by the nuclear agreement.</comment>

<comment>You couldn't find Iran on a map but like most Obama pod people you need to believe that electing the half-black guy who lived in Muslim lands as a kid meant the world would love us. </comment>

<comment>^and this is why even your own call you the party of stupid^</comment>

<comment>Ok, chicken little. Your time is up</comment>

<comment>Esther!  Time to soak your false teeth.  Nice and white they are, too!</comment>

<comment>Of course he's not going to mention it. It's not an act of war. Our guys broke down and wandered into their territory. If they aren't returned, then yes start the war drums! Until then, it's hard to rationalize such an overreaction if we imagine the situation reversed and two foreign boats full of sailors were patrolling in our waters. Cable news would be going into hysterics for blood!</comment>

<comment>Yes, let's drop our bombs now and kill all 77 million Iranians. Russia and China will then do the same to us, but we can destroy the entire world before we all die in fire, anguish and radioactive ash. And we can do it on the basis of a few U.S. sailors messing around in a part of the world we have no business in.Damn, with morons like you the planet doesn't stand a chance.</comment>

<comment>Need more hyperbole there. You are not the only Obama drama queen here. </comment>

<comment>says the right wing drama queen</comment>

<comment>Yes, I overstepped my mark. But I get so sick of this insanity.</comment>

<comment>"Damn, with morons like you the planet doesn't stand a chance."___I think the "chance" lies in the distinction between having a Disqus account and having control of the country's bombs.</comment>

<comment>He's so weak and Kerry is so incompetent that those sailors will certainly be in Iranian custody longer than our hostages after the 1979 revolution.  Thanks Obama!</comment>

<comment>That's the trouble with the fake crisis people. They don't have the attention span to hear the answers to the things they're afraid of. He's a natural born citizen. He's not a Muslim. And the sailors are free.</comment>

<comment>The seaman have been released without a hitch in case you haven't seen the news today.</comment>

<comment>That's only $6,400 per sailor.</comment>

<comment>Go Obama, be super partisan and lay down what you want from for the next Democrat president.Protect your legacy, fight for the future!Michele looks fabulous, omg. Wife and her friends are still talking about how they hope they look as good as her.Paul Ryan looks like a pelican.He's doing it! He's talking about the future! OMG! Obama! Don't leave us!

This year, may Eid also be a time in which we recognize the values of progress, pluralism, and acceptance that bind us together as a Nation and a global community. By working together to advance mutual understanding, we point the way to a brighter future for all."or this?"Some of the comments that have been uttered about Islam do not reflect the sentiments of my government or the sentiments of most Americans. Islam, as practiced by the vast majority of people, is a peaceful religion, a religion that respects others. Ours is a country based upon tolerance and we welcome people of all faiths in America."oh wait, that was GWB back in 02</comment>

<comment>That is for sure. Koolaid drinkers, all of them.</comment>

<comment>That's a Democratic main issue. It's what we're fighting for.</comment>

<comment>Did you get a chill down your leg?</comment>

<comment>One last time from the KENYAN.  Thank GOD!!</comment>

<comment>Coming from the dude who thought the President controlled the budget lol! Get lost loser! At least be an intelligent racist!</comment>

<comment>Never said that.  You on ludes or something boy?</comment>

<comment>I agree! It was a beautiful speech!</comment>

<comment>Right, same old bullshit.</comment>

<comment>8 years loser! Haters going to hate the 8!</comment>

<comment>If your profanity is meant to emphasize the awesomeness of his eighth speech, again, I couldn't agree more!</comment>

<comment>What speech was awesome?</comment>

<comment>Hey Mr.Mod that posted here earlier? You still around? Can you do something about the neo-Nazi infestation on this site?</comment>

<comment>Naidm! Do you hate me!?</comment>

<comment>You will be the 1 st to go</comment>

<comment>Bradan, you're not going to get them to ban anyone. I'm still baffled as to how the hell you ever got banned</comment>

<comment>Exactly, one dude had a damn swatstika as a profile pic and wasn't banned.</comment>

<comment>Worth a try, they posted earlier. Besides, it apparently drives the trolls crazy whenever I say it, so it's at least amusing. They love identifying themselves.</comment>

<comment>this is true.</comment>

<comment>Naidm! Why won't you talk to me?! I miss you!</comment>

<comment>You're being bloody weird tonight :P</comment>

<comment>I'm drunk af. I've stopped smoking for three months and my wife wanted me to drink with her.</comment>

<comment>Whatever you're drinking I think you should try something a bit lighter :P</comment>

<comment>Naidm! You're so nice now! Omg! I love you! My wife said you needed to find a lady, did you find one?</comment>

<comment>All you do make ad hominem attacks on people. Other than that, you nothing interesting to say.</comment>

<comment>so Biden is suppose to cure cancer...?</comment>

<comment>Bubba said what?Please speak up. We can't hear you from that pile of shite you live in.</comment>

<comment>The guy's bombed seven countries and lost two wars.</comment>

<comment>Didn't' he inherit all of those wars?</comment>

<comment>So much for giving peace a chance.</comment>

<comment>He cut unemployment in half. For that alone, he is one of the greats.</comment>

<comment>You and Obama need to get a room....</comment>

<comment>He's bigger than you!</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>And kickstarting the renewable energy (and fracking) revolution. America is an energy superpower again.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.Thank companies like Anadarko for the fracking revolution.Obama had nothing positive to do with it.</comment>

<comment>I'm a liberal but he didn't change healthcare to provide for all, he didn't end our involvement in the middle east, and only partially opened Cuba. Congress still has to end the embargo. Sooo yea, try to keep your facts straight.</comment>

<comment>Excellent retort. I especially appreciated the article you linked backing up your claim.</comment>

<comment>The ACA expanded Medicare. It did NOT create access to healthcare for everyone, that's simply an incorrect statement, or worse, an out and out lie. He "ended" the war in Iraq in the same way I "finished" my lunch yet expect to have it again tomorrow... for the rest of my life. Which is to say it isn't over, and has no sign of ending anytime soon. And as I mentioned earlier, he "opened up" Cuba only so far as he could (good on him), Congress still needs to end the embargo.I'm not anti-Obama but you're spouting off half-truths and outright false statements as praise of him.P.S. please don't tell me your "commie" comment was directed at Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>So you think Bernie's a commie. Must be easier to get away without thinking when you're just a democrat in name only.Ending the Iraq war didn't get us out of Iraq and you know it. Quit acting like we aren't, at this very moment, discussing going right back into the war you credit him with ending. It isn't over, and never truly ended since we're still there carrying out bombing missions against ISIS. We're just a vote away from going back in (something Obama called for in SOTU if you actually bothered to watch) any clear-eyed person would acknowledge this.As for Medi-CAL what an embarrassment! Medi-CAL is just California's name for the state exchange set-up under the ACA. It's literally the ACA. You seem to be under the impression that everyone can get health insurance through the ACA, I'll give you news flash, they can't. Look up U.S. percentage uninsured if you want some concrete evidence. Bernie, the guy you call a commie because you're a dumb-sh*t, is the guy discussing healthcare for all by the way. Perhaps you should pay attention.As for Cuba you just didn't understand what I said. Obama "normalized" relations and reopened the embassy there. What hasn't been done is the U.S. embargo being lifted since it requires Congress. I'm not arguing Obama did something wrong, or that he didn't do as much as he could, just specifying the embargo still remains.</comment>

<comment>Precisely the opposite. He didn't do anything the way you think he did.</comment>

<comment>Right, by stopping the counting of the tens of millions still without jobs.</comment>

<comment>He's using the same system that his predecessors used.</comment>

<comment>He is? really? Source and link please. I would like to read up on that.</comment>

<comment>Let the right wing fap trolls begin...</comment>

<comment>They seem pretty cranky tonight.</comment>

<comment>They've lost, and they know it.</comment>

<comment>You want to come over and watch Netflix?</comment>

<comment>Nope. You fap alone (as usual).It's sad. Boo hoo.</comment>

<comment>I have a new waterbed.</comment>

<comment>That hasn't worked for you before, has it?Sad. You lonely white guys break my heart.</comment>

<comment>How do you know I'm white?  I could be Asian.</comment>

<comment>if there is a moderator here, banning Mean_Girl would be a great place to start</comment>

<comment>How about Ahab the Arab? The obvious racist. I mean, really f*cking obvious. At least Simon shows you he's a white supremacist through text.</comment>

<comment>Who is that?</comment>

<comment>he can be second but seriously a person who literally only posts insults specifically regarding masturbation is ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Why? Since most of your comments are masturbatory in nature, what problem to do have with someone pointing that out?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>And you wonder why you have no friends at all.ha ha</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. So your sad right wing panties are in a bunch (or you wanted some "special" attention from me?)Sorry. You are a boring troll. And you don't warrant my favors.</comment>

<comment>They want a right wing troll circle j*rk.</comment>

<comment>Do you want to be in the center?</comment>
