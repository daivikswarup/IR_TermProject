<comment>Trump is very entertaining. It might be worth having him in office simply for that. One reason the common person doesn't know or care about political issues is politics are too boring, especially in today's age of constant stimulation.Trump may actually get Americans into politics again if he wins. Good. For those who are worried about a president Trump, don't worry. We have a separation of powers that will keep things balanced."Get the popcorn, honey, President Trump is on!"</comment>

<comment>I've heard a couple of people say that. I guess it really is the fall of Rome.</comment>

<comment>Rome has already fallen, as the Iranian visit there recently demonstrated...we're next, and I don't want my country to be next.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a big baby.  He is afraid of a little blonde news lady.  What a chump.</comment>

<comment>Republicans put one actor in the white house with Reagan. They now turn to another entertainer. Its what the GOP stands for....racism, greed, sound bite solutions, and entertainment!</comment>

<comment>The thing that makes this funny is that the guy currently living in the white house had absolutely no qualifications to be president. Regardless of whether or not you like him, he had objectively zero qualifications.</comment>

<comment>Bush jr left in 2009, after two useless wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression (as well as 9/11) occurred on his watch.Nobody was less qualified to be President than the Twig...</comment>

<comment>He'd been governor of Texas... I mean, he did a bad job as president but he was qualified.</comment>

<comment>and Obama was a State Senator and a US Senator prior to being president</comment>

<comment>a one term junior senator (2 years) and a state senator.  no executive experience, no accomplishments outside successful campaigning.</comment>

<comment>Looking back at our presidents executive experience has never really been a good indicator of how well someone does in the WH.</comment>

<comment>maybe so.</comment>

<comment>Bush proves so-called "qualifications" are no indicator of future performance.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, but the question was about qualifications.</comment>

<comment>Who the heck made you boss of the Comment Board?</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry Mrs. Simpson.  I was out of line and I apologize.</comment>

<comment>Same with Bill Clinton...he brought his state scandals to culminate into a federal impeachment.</comment>

<comment>Which was never ratified, thus, never enforced.And the point is..?</comment>

<comment>Governor of Texas is a largely ceremonial position. The only actual executive power he has is the appointment of individuals to commissions and committees.Just sayin'. I actually agree that Obama needed more time in the Senate, and I generally prefer people with some executive experience as candidates for executive office. People like, say, Hilary Clinton (or, if you're in the GOP, John Kasich or Jeb Bush).</comment>

<comment>I'd say working in the Senate is a qualification. However you feel about him, that's an objective qualification.</comment>

<comment>2 years? He was a trainee.</comment>

<comment>So you live in an alternate reality where January 3, 2005 through November 16, 2008 is two years.  Got it.</comment>

<comment>my mistake. 3 years, considering he spent the last year running for president.</comment>

<comment>Almost four years.  Not too much less than what JFK had.</comment>

<comment>I think Obama has done an admirable job given the situation.  My whole point was that people shouldn't put so much emphasis on "qualifications".</comment>

<comment>Not zero. Just not enough. He needed a full term in the Senate, preferably two, at the least. Something people thinking of voting for Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio ought to think a thing or two about.</comment>

<comment>> the guy currently living in the white house had absolutely no qualifications to be presidentHe wasn't thirty five years or older? Hyperbolize moronically much?</comment>

<comment>Relax.</comment>

<comment>Indeed. The GOP leadership and "conservative" base lost to someone with "objectively zero qualifications". Twice!The GOP/"conservative" way of doing things is a great big failure. Too bad their base is too dim to figure that out.</comment>

<comment>Good Lord...this isn't a game.  This is real life with real consequences.</comment>

<comment>Great, another mainstream media attempt to steer opinions. How's that working out so far?Try being a journalist and write the article without your opinion (because frankly no one cares what you think anyway)</comment>

<comment>You care enough to comment.</comment>

<comment>Poor Santorum and Huckster. I bet they thought they were attending some non-partisan veterans benefit thing. Instead they got a Trump campaign rally with barely a focus on vets.</comment>

<comment>Really?  The event was just over an hour and veterans talked for at least 40 minutes.</comment>

<comment>They're pretty much just in the race to keep their profile (and book sales, and cable news contributor status) up by this point. So it makes perfect sense to me.</comment>

<comment>You realize the other candidates are only sane *in comparison to Trump*, right?</comment>

<comment>Trump didn't take any air out of any room.  He acted like a big baby.  What a boob.Good grief.</comment>

<comment>Preach the word, goy! What we need is eight years of Hillary Clinton. She makes me proud to be a woman and is a great example of what we should all strive to be. Her compassion and empathy, and ability to take charge and lead is without parallel. She's the best candidate in the field and shows that you can be a woman with a conscience and be tough with the anti-progressive forces of evil in the world.</comment>

<comment>I have never voted for a Republicant in my life but I think I'd vote for anyone over her. Because she has no soul. She's a cardboard cutout of a craven politician.</comment>

<comment>And that would be retarded if you care about people more than your personal perceptions of a politician </comment>

<comment>Yeah sure. Except Bernie cares more. And btw, choosing a president is like choosing a roommate because we have to see and hear that person for at least four years. And she's about as enjoyable as fingernails on a chalkboard.</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about the GE. I care about things like the Supreme Court, climate change and the future of the ACA much more than how much someone annoys me on TV.</comment>

<comment>Maybe she won't seem as bad in eight months compared to whoever she runs against. it's going to be hold-your-nose-and-vote either way. There was something about an FBI investigation on tv this morning which would end her campaign if indicted.</comment>

<comment>She won't get indicted. And you do not want the clown car GOP controlling the 3 branches of government. That would definitely equal the fall of the Rome. More land wars in the Middle East and sending the country into bankruptcy.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't be so sure about no indictment. Everyone said Bernie and Donald wouldn't be taken seriously.</comment>

<comment>Another story yesterday saying that the FBI  has so much evidence that the director will resign in protest if Loretta lynch refuses to indict her.</comment>

<comment>Trump follows the lead of the Grizzly Mama -- quit in a petulant hissy-fit when you face questions.When Palin babbled on (was she sober?), she -- the quitter -- was standing in front of the new quitter -- all testosterone but unable to stand up to hostile questioning.Actually governing Alaska proved too much of a distraction for the reality show star.Both of them have earned the sneers of anyone with a brain.</comment>

<comment>Turns out the donations he claimed go directly to vets don't go to vets at all, but to his personal foundation !http://thefederalist.com/2016/...</comment>

<comment>Do you know that the money he raised last night will NOT go to the vets?</comment>

<comment>I do find it odd he'd have it go through his own charity rather than having a reputable veterans charity like Wounded Warriors.</comment>

<comment>You find it odd he might want to spread the money to more than just one charity?</comment>

<comment>Except it was for one charity:  Trumps own one</comment>

<comment>Wounded warriors gets a lot of flack for overhead.</comment>

<comment>Do you know that the money he raised last night WILL go to the vets?</comment>

<comment>According to Forbes, between 2009 and 2013, the Donald J. Trump Foundation distributed $5.5 million to 298 charities. That's an average of  $18,456 per charity. Which, normally, would be fine -- micro-targeting non-profits for specific projects is pretty much how foundations roll. During that time, $57,000 went to seven veterans' organizations, an average of $8,142.86 per group. In 2012 alone, the Trump Foundation gave $57,000 to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.Also, according to The Daily Caller, Trump gave up to $250,000 of his own money to the Clinton Foundation during that time frame. Donald Trump is known, in charitable giving circles, as the "0.00013% man." As in, that's how much of his wealth he donates annually, making him among the most miserly of rich people in the nation.Even more to the point, he did not start the Trump Foundation with an endowment, leaving it to subsist solely on contributions (this is not normal for a foundation), and he has not donated any of his own money to the foundation since 2008.</comment>

<comment>Molly I love how you report these trump conventions....I feel like Im at Wrestlemania or a redneck bowling alley on Saturday night. Funny!Trump is the perfect posterboy for the failed Baby Boomer generation. This group of geriatric hippies is finally getting exactly what they want.....a rich simpleton entertainer, another actor in the white house, whose blustering meaningless commentary on the world perfectly represent the 60's failed white ex hippie Me Generation that brought us fast food, fructose soft drinks, drugs, sex, and rock and roll. The past 50 years of divorce, violence, racism, serial killers, guns, and greed of the Baby Boomers now climaxes with Trump! Lol. Donald Trump is the ultimate social justice warrior for the younger generations who see now clearly the stupidity and ignorance of this failed Boomer Generation of morons who have helped create the destroyed America we all have suffered through the last 30-40 years. Trump will lead them like some new age Jim Jones to the purple koolaid, where these people will fall off the very cliff the Republicans they voted for the past 30 years created for them.</comment>

<comment>Trump, Santorum & Huck.  Three of the most putrid human beings imaginable.  Poor Iowans, it's bad enough they have to endure tornadoes, being a flyover state, and fat white guys in overalls - but this?</comment>

<comment>I was hoping Santorum and Huckabee would endorse Trump. I love both those guys. Santorum was the best Congressman I ever had.</comment>

<comment>I live in Pennsylvania too, but the other side of the state.  Funny you say how much you liked him as a rep in the Pittsburgh suburbs.  He acted far more like a moderate Republican in those days.  Now, he is beholden to the Evangelicals and can't move to the right quick enough.Thankfully, he was booted as our Senator when the stupid really started to show.</comment>

<comment>This pretty much was a de facto endorsement. Both Huckabee and Santorum's campaigns are dead in the water. By showing up to his rally, they pretty much encouraged their supporters to jump ship.</comment>

<comment>It was a rogues gallery missing it's main rogue.</comment>

<comment>Can't stump the Trump! Why even try? </comment>

<comment>Better headline: Vietnam War Draft Dodger Hosts Veteran's Fundraiser</comment>

<comment>Huckabee and Santorum should endorse Trump. They'd probably get Cabinet positions in return.</comment>

<comment>That's funny because of how much he hates the Iran deal. With those two in his cabinet we'd be more of a theocracy than we are now.</comment>

<comment>Question: Prior to using the plight of veterans as his political human shield after insulting all POWs, exactly how much did Trump contribute to veteran's causes before?We do know that Trump had no use for veterans before since he made an issue of it in New York City wanting to keep them away from his propertieshttp://www.nydailynews.com/new...</comment>

<comment>You are deliberately distorting the truth.Trump was merely speaking up for store-owners who pay very high taxes to the city and deserve to not have their businesses impeded by uncontrolled peddlers who unsafely block streets for pedestrians.As a New Yorker, I can tell you that 99% of the peddlers are recent immigrants and NOT military veterans.</comment>

<comment>If there's one thing we New Yorkers are not, it's thin-skinned... Our hide is thick, like a Rhino's... and we got the horn too.</comment>

<comment>Probably Staten Island</comment>

<comment>that much is true.Trumps crapping on McCain for being a POW has been quickly forgotten though hasn't it?</comment>

<comment>We all appreciate McCain's military service. We do not appreciate that since then-  he has acted corruptly ( Keating Five ) and also promoted Barack Obama while he was allegedly supposed to be running against him.</comment>

<comment>But thats not what Trump went after.  He called POW's "losers" for being captured</comment>

<comment>You are lying. He called McCain a loser for losing the election.</comment>

<comment>"He's a War hero because he was captured.  I like people who weren't captured"direct quote</comment>

<comment>You think I wouldn't notice that the word "loser" doesn't appear in that quote?  I would destroy a dufus like you in a courtroom.</comment>

<comment>It's still pretty disrespectful of a person now claiming to support veterans.</comment>

<comment>No, McCain does not get a free pass on doing stupid things from a position of power - just because as a young man he showed extraordinary bravery.</comment>

<comment>Then go after his policy history.  Instead like everytime Trump goes for the personal low blow attack instead of talking about anything of substance.</comment>

<comment>McCain started the whole tiff by calling Trump supporters "crazies". I guess you didn't know that before you started bloviating.</comment>

<comment>Little potato, does: "He's a War hero because he was captured.  I like people who weren't captured."show empathy towards POWs?  Answer yes or no.</comment>

<comment>Of course POW are failures, not heroes, they GOT CAUGHT by the enemy. I am with Trump on this one, I like the ones who did not get captured.</comment>

<comment>McCain was one of the GOP ringleaders that lobbied for the Iraq War.  Was he brainwashed by the Neocon propaganda, or simply corrupt, following orders from his financial backers?Total Campaign Contributions Received by John McCain: $8,690,401.

<comment>Sarah Palin stabbed McCain in the back, when she endorsed Trump.  She's an ingrate and disloyal... just a grandstanding attention seeker.</comment>

<comment>WTF? When did Sarah Palin ever make a personal pledge to McCain to never endorse Trump?What an off-the-wall weird comment.</comment>

<comment>He seems to be off his game this morning.</comment>

<comment>I never claimed that Palin pledged to McCain that she would never endorse Trump.What I'm trying to say is that Sarah Palin owes her rise to national prominence thanks to her patron, John McCain.Trump insulted McCain and denigrated McCain's personal sacrifice; Palin overlooked all that, just to get in the national spotlight again.  That's a stab in the back, IMO.</comment>

<comment>You are right about that. However, Sarah Palin correctly sees that there are much bigger issues for the nation than a little tiff between Trump and McCain.In the big picture, she did the right thing.</comment>

<comment>Nobody cares about Sarah Palin one way ro the other.  It was a way for Trump to dominate one news cycle and she's already vanished.</comment>

<comment>And, like Trump, Palin's a crybaby who quits when the going gets tough</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>No, she owes McCain nothing. In 2008, McCain saw the writing on the wall way before anyone else. His second Saturday Night Live appearance that campaign, literally the week before the election, maybe two, was all about kneecapping Sarah Palin's political future. He was forced into accepting her, and once he knew he would not win, he did everything he could to prevent her from gaining further power. She doesn't owe him anything.Ironically, the John McCain who showed up in his concession speech was the John McCain of 2000, and that John McCain could well have won that election, George W. Bush or no.</comment>

<comment>No to mention his being a Pro-torture, Neo-Con, war monger.</comment>

<comment>Trump: a draft dodger who whines about those who served honorably...</comment>

<comment>McSame is an absolute chicken. I agree with Trump on that.  Real heroes do not get captured, real heroes take part in actually fighting and capturing the enemy.</comment>

<comment>Store owners?  What small business owners near Trump? Are you nuts? Blocking streets? They did not block anything. They had rights and Trump had no regard for their plight.The truth is Trump never stood up for veterans nor did he stand up for 9/11 first responders until he needed them a political shields. That is the flat out truth</comment>

<comment>Now you are talking b*llsh*t.  The Daily News article you linked to was on the subject of businesses complaining about street vendors. Did you even read it?I do not know where you live, but you don't seem to know much about New York City. Street vendors crowding sidewalks are always an issue here.You stuff about "no regard for their plight" is just stupid. There are licenses and compromises must be worked out between competing interests.Making comments about the street vendor situation is in NO WAY a veteran's issue.You are talking krappe in a silly bid to trash-talk Trump.</comment>

<comment>"businesses complaining about street vendors."Yeh like Tiffany's and every high end luxury store there. They did not like the riff-raff to blemish their upper east midtown luxury aura.Any idea how wide those streets are? This is not lower Manhattan.And you did not read the article. The street vendors included veterans who had a right and a license to be there.Trump is a liar and a hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>Let's see your stats. How many veteran vendors were there in the areas that Trump complained about? Two?</comment>

<comment>No</comment>

<comment>Cut the krappe. The Trump Foundation has donated money to veterans' groups.  Trump was never in office - it is idiotic to try to ding him for not doing anything for 9/11 first responders. Trump as a private citizen cannot fix the whole world.Lots of billionaires are much richer than Trump - why doesn't Bill Gates take care of 9/11 first responders beyond what the government is already doing?</comment>

<comment>Bill Gates's charitable giving, 2014: $9.8 billion.Donald Trump's charitable giving, 2009 through 2013: $5.5 million, only $57,000 of which was to military veterans' foundations.Strawman destroyed.  If you twist yourself any more, you'll turn into a curly fry!</comment>

<comment>Ignorant partisan.  For most of his life, Bill Gates' "charity" consisted of donating copies of Windows to schools - a totally self-serving move.Only in recent years did he start donating money to fight diseases in the Third World ( which also has nothing to do with veterans).You like him because he is a Dem.</comment>

<comment>Non sequiturs are a hallmark of a befuddled mind, little potato.   And you are so easily flummoxed.</comment>

<comment>"The Trump Foundation has donated money to veterans' groups"Prove itAl Demato and Rudy Guiliani were private citizens and went all out to push that bill. Trump refused. Bill Gates never lived in NYC. Trump is a lowlife</comment>

<comment>Trump is a leader- as shown by his brilliant decision to put charity for veterans on the front burner - while the other Republican midgets fling poo at each other.Hopefully Fox learned a lesson that childish taunting of presidential candidates has consequences for their bottom line.   Since Fox lacks basic etiquette, they can only learn through a hit to their bottom line.Anyway, their bias is clear. Murdoch is a Wall Street guy - and he fears a hit to his portfolio if immigration law starts getting enforced, and workers' wages start going up.</comment>

<comment>I haven't seen any data that indicates whether or not FOX lost viewership, as a result of Trump's boycott... of course, such data may be suspect, depending on the source.After that sarcastic tweet from Roger Ailes. Trump had no choice but to flip off FOX.The race is still early and I wonder if Trump will continue to boycott any future debates held on FOX.</comment>

<comment>Veterans, disabled veterans and their needs have been around many years, why is Trump deciding just now to devote attention to them?Is it perhaps that he really didn’t need veteran’s votes or the public’s attention until it was a self-serving need for his own benefit?  After all, he has publicly stated how he doesn’t like veterans who were captured.</comment>

<comment>What a dumb post.  Anytime that ANYBODY does something charitable for a group, some shlemiel can snipe from the sidelines saying "Where were you last year?"BTW, Trump's foundation HAS given money to veteran organizations before.</comment>

<comment>Yes, over the course of FIVE years the foundation gave veterans groups $57,000. About 1% of its total charitable donations.His last "veterans fundraiser" was for "Veterans For A Strong America", a group who stood up for him after he bashed McCain's military service in the war he draft dodged. Just one little problem… the group's ONLY member was the grifter who founded it, and TRUMPY's campaign could never even say how much was raised.</comment>

<comment>Sir, are you insinuating that Mister Trump's recent epiphany is disingenuous?</comment>

<comment>Trump had a loner hand, he played it last night; did he take all the tricks, or has he been euchred?</comment>

<comment>Trump is all about Trump. Trump is NOT about veterans and they would do well to wise up to this buffoon. It is stunning that any vet would attend or any veteran group even accept any money from this man after Trump said John McCain was not a hero! What kind of patriots are they that they would lower themselves to listen to this man who belittled one of their own? I find that stunning but shows how some vets put such little value on their own cause to even be in the same room as Trump and listen to his crap.</comment>

<comment>I always enjoy reading your articles and truly respect your analytical prowess, but why include multiple implications that Mr. Trump is not going to give the money raised to Veterans Groups when from what's written here it's clear that you are the one who's offered no evidence to explain your suspicion?  This is exactly why none of Trump's supporters are swayed when people accuse him of being 'wimpy' in the face of hostile media treatment.  He is the subject of unprovoked, unsubstantiated media attacks, and instead of being wimpy he actually calls journalists out on it and fights back.  He's just not the guy his opponents make him out to be (in my humble opinion).</comment>

<comment>"I do not feel good about turning down money. My whole life, I have been greedy, greedy, greedy. But now I want to be greedy for the United States," he said. "I will grab all that money. I will be greedy for the United States. But I always feel guilty."http://www.washingtonexaminer....Just like Johnny Rocco in Key Largo:Johnny Rocco:         There's only one Johnny RoccoJames Temple:         How do you account for it?      Frank McCloud:         He knows what he wants. Don't you, Rocco?      Johnny Rocco:         Sure.      James Temple:         What's that?      Frank McCloud:         Tell him, Rocco.      Johnny Rocco:         Well, I want uh ...      Frank McCloud:         He wants more, don't you, Rocco?      Johnny Rocco:         Yeah. That's it. More. That's right! I want more!      James Temple:         Will you ever get enough?      Frank McCloud:         Will you, Rocco?      Johnny Rocco:         Well, I never have. No, I guess I won't. You, do you know what you want?      Frank McCloud:         Yes, I had hopes once, but I gave them up.      Johnny Rocco:         Hopes for what?      Frank McCloud:         A world in which there's no place for Johnny Rocco.http://www.screeninsults.com/k...</comment>

<comment>Trump is the only candidate up there who's opinion about religion is "Its okay I guess..." and not "JESUS IS LOORDDAAH!"   He's the only one who says "Planned parenthood isn't all bad. They do some good stuff." and not "BURN THE BABY MURDERERS!!!!"  He's the only one who has said "If we revoke Obamacare we're going to have to replace it with something." instead of "NUKE IT FROM ORBIT!"  He's the only one on the right who is more interested in walling off foreign countries then he is in bombing them back to the stone-age. I hate to break it to you guys, but he is the most moderate candidate on the right. They don't get any better, merely less annoying.</comment>

<comment>He should be debating with Hillary and Bernie where he belongs</comment>

<comment>Can't refute that.</comment>

<comment>He's somewhat interested in bombing them and also in stealing their natural resources, which would also lead to war.</comment>

<comment>Trump won the night by because he got to appear on at least 2 networks for free and his biggest opponent, Tom Cruz, got beat up in the debate. I predict the RNC will make debate attendance mandatory in the future.</comment>

<comment>The three democrats will never be president .... In case you don't know who they are, here are their names:Hillary ClintonBernie SandersDonald Trump</comment>

<comment>The Fox debate attracted four times the number of viewers as all coverage of the Trump event combined. Sorry Donald. You LOST.</comment>

<comment>The question is whether Trump suffered more political damage by ducking the debate than his competitors suffered by showing up. Cruz, in particular, seems to have gotten the sort of relentless, personalized beating from the moderators that's typically reserved for the frontrunner. . . and they may have drawn some blood with those video clips of Ted Cruz.Escaping that kind of treatment while helping to make sure that your nearest rival gets a huge helping of it doesn't seem (at least in retrospect) like a bad decision.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Trump ducked the debate because he was statistically tied with Cruz in IA and correctly calculated that participating in the debate could only hurt him.  It was cowardly, but also shrewd.</comment>

<comment>I would much rather see a fund-raiser helping people than watch the debates.  Trump won for doing something constructive.  I can't stand watching debate candidates ramble on over their time limit hoping to give someone a jab. The last time I watched the debates religiously was when Obama promised to get the troops home within X amount of days. We all saw how that timely promise meant nothing.My decision will be made a day before the election due to past experience.  Up until then, it is all smoke and mirrors. We can get something close to it on the wrestling channel.</comment>
