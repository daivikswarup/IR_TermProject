<comment>But the DOE does exist and yet, as you point out, whole swaths of the US are packed to the gills with low graduation rates. If, as you believe, there is a direct and positive  correlation between the two, then how can so many districts not be getting the desired results DOE policy and guidance should guarantee?</comment>

<comment>Laws against murder exist, and yet people are still murdered.  Should we repeal murder laws? Or can we accept that policies that aren't perfect can still have positive effects?</comment>

<comment>Your comparison is apples to kumquats.What I'm suggesting is we already KNOW that children have neurological windows of learning opportunity. Once that window closes, the skills not learned become problems. Yes they can be learned but they will never be automatic.Experimenting with systems of information delivery may seem justifiable, but if those systems fail, and many have, the child who was short changed cannot easily "catch up" which has a snowball effect as well. The farther they get behind, the more difficult and less rewarding it becomes for them to even try. Hence the drop out rate. At a certain point school becomes a prison cell, not a window on the world.Our children are future Americans who will be expected to pull their weight in society and who will start at a distinct disadvantage so long as we keep treating them like lab rats for every "new" academic fad that comes down the pike.Don't take my word for it. Ask the generation of kids who spent their precious learning window studying New Math.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>If you're advocating early childhood education, great news, I'm on board!My point is that we shouldn't give up education policy entirely because of less-than-perfect results or results that don't match expectations. Are changes warranted? Sure.An aside: I don't really trust states with education.  I wish I could, but as your state has proven, individual states are more apt to lard their textbooks with creationism and historical revisionism than the nation at large.</comment>

<comment>I live in tennesee...a great state and wonderful people...but given half the chance... the state legislature would be passing laws to teach the bible math and science  and creationism.... and that sort of thing would destroy generations of kids opportunity to qualify for admission to colleges and universities....</comment>

<comment>"but given half the chance... the state legislature would be passing laws to teach the bible math and science  and creationism.... and that sort of thing would destroy generations of kids opportunity to qualify for admission to colleges and universities...."___This problem is easily solved, because if given half a chance they'd also change the admission requirements for entry to colleges and universities.</comment>

<comment>Ms. TS ... " apples to kumquats" ... that is so you ...</comment>

<comment>Happy Thanksgiving, A. :)))))</comment>

<comment>And to you and yours ...</comment>

<comment>It's a working day for us. Our "pay it forward" decision when we first started in practice was to open for business every holiday except July 4th. Our waiting room is already starting to fill up so......everyone have a great day and see you tomorrow, Lord willin and the creek don't rise!</comment>

<comment>Ms. TS, Do you charge holiday rates?</comment>

<comment>Nope. And kids are free. We're honored to be able to pay it forward at this stage, but remember we're just Family Med as of a few months ago. Doc Welby.......... only not as good lookin. :)))</comment>

<comment>Ms. Honeychile, Marcus ain't my cup of tea ...</comment>

<comment>you are correct...but you must be able to trust the federal system... would you trust the one we have now ?</comment>

<comment>Yeh I knew you were, OP.  :)))My point was it's not the requirement that matters. It's the means by which the requirement is met that counts. Your trust in fed gov't is concerning only in that, unlike Europe, kids here are NOT allowed to fail. In Europe they definitely are so by the time they reach high school, those who are not capable of doing pure academics have been filtered out so of course the kids left make higher grades than Americans where social promotion allows LESS intellectually inclined kids to "lower" the overall score sample.No Child Left Behind, another federal program, further crippled our system. Most teachers will tell you that they spend a grossly disproportionate  amount of time with minimally functional kids than with their mainstream and higher students, who are often left to fend for themselves. Many good teachers have retired in frustration over this unrealistic program.Standardized testing WITH CONSEQUENCES in fed dollars dealt another blow to school systems. I have read hundreds of accounts where teachers, feeling so pressured by their district to score well on that one test, teach the test....in some extreme cases, every single day. This of course comes at a cost to other subjects. But the penalties for not doing so are far greater so they just make the kids take the test over and over. This is horrible but since Fed Gov't doesn't look beyond those test scores, it's the only survival tool many poor school districts have in order to keep fed money flowing into the system.Why do you think, just because a state gov't is in charge, that that state would require less of students or reject already proven nationally available systems? Why would any state gov't expect it's voters not to expect them to do a good job on education?And before you even THINK about the canard that people in one "area" of the country are somehow genetically inferior intellectually I remind you of the sub set of abysmal scores coming out of huge ghetto areas in the north and mid west cities.Bottom line, I believe that until "social promotion" and "no child left behind" are ditched, it won't make a whit of difference what system is adopted by whom. Both groups will keep test scores artificially low for the states and indeed the whole nation. Until we are prepared to create a career path for students who are neither interested in or adept at academics, our drop out rates and work performance rates after graduation will also be inferior to those of other nations.</comment>

<comment>I just cannot disagree strongly enough, individualism created excellence in America.  In nearly every aspect.If you really, really feel this way, though, why not put in the work to get a constitutional amendment passed?  That way, you would't be in violation of Amendment IX and X, and it would be an addition to Article I, section 8.I, for one, would be opposing your efforts, as the results of federal government selectively funding mandates and regulation has been disastrous.</comment>

<comment>Correct comrade........ever since the D O E has existed results have plummeted and then there  is the fact that education is not a federal purview.</comment>

<comment>It is one failed federal program after another. Each president promising he'll succeed where his predecessor has failed.The US, with its 320M people, is now nearly as large as Western Europe. Europe doesn't have a Department of Education. Each state of the EU handles it separately. Canada with its 35M leaved education to eat healthy province.The larger the US gets, the more difficult it becomes to manage from Washington.Sanders likes Denmark, so do I.  Denmark's population is lower than that of the SF Bay Area and that population is nearly homogeneous.Democrats, like Sanders, want to pretend they can run a Denmark like economy from a Moscow like beauracracy in Washington. </comment>

<comment>I like the way you think. Perhaps one day the centralized US government can be just as weak as the centralized European government, and can project military power to the same extent the centralized European government does.</comment>

<comment>Its funny how you think. Are you in favor of each states having their military and foreign policy then.</comment>

<comment>It shouldn't exist. Education is not a federal issue.</comment>

<comment>Anything that cuts down on the time wasted on preparing for numerous standardized tests has got to make life better for teachers and students. Glad to see this happening!</comment>

<comment>As a Democrat and life long teacher, Arne Duncan might be the worst SoE in a generation.  He followed the neo-liberalism playbook down to the letter.  His use of federal incentives was borderline unconstitutional and thank goodness he is gone.</comment>

<comment>As someone who is often accused of being a shill for both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, I am in complete argreement.  Huzzah!</comment>

<comment>The Federal Government has no business being involved in Education. Close the DOE and return full control and the money back to the states.</comment>

<comment>Obviously, NCLB was unrealistic.  Some children, disproportionately black and Hispanic children, will be left behind.  Penalizing schools with a lot of them was never the right thing to do, although it was well-intentioned.I sincerely hope that we do maintain the testing requirements.  Best would be a single, federally-mandated test per year, starting around 4th grade.  Lest we throw the baby out with the bath water</comment>

<comment>The federal government next needs to remove the racial quotas on school disicipline that were implemented by Eric Holder and Arne Duncan. </comment>

<comment>What's good about this is that it was the product of bi-partisan negotiation, with each side prepared to give up some of what they wanted to get most of what they wanted.This principle - of two sides with opposing wants negotiating a workable solution for the common good - is the foundational tenet of our system of government.Our congress is largely broken nowadays because it has become the prevailing viewpoint of both the right and the left that they should not compromise, nor should they negotiate in good faith with the other party.This kind of spoiled-brat, temper tantrum approach by people who are supposed to be responsibly creating national-level policy is why Congress gets almost nothing accomplished besides taking pot-shots at each other.Oh, I almost forgot, they CAN agree to vote themselves pay-raises.And THAT is why the public is so disgusted with Congress. They show up like a bunch of whining babies who can't tie their shoes.How can you possibly respect a group of people that have reduced themselves to such a despicable level?</comment>

<comment>The democrats have done a lot of damage to America's education system</comment>

<comment>As someone who taught mathematics, the tools that learners need are pencils and paper, not government policies.</comment>

<comment>Why replace it with anything?</comment>

<comment>I find it interesting that the affluent parents of children in high-end prep schools find it unnecessary to use to use mandated testing from outside the building to know whether learning is occurring.</comment>
