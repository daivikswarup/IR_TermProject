<comment>Nice example of racism. The whole article is racist. There isn't such a thing as race. Yet notice how important race is to the writer of this. There is no scientific basis for race. Its not a real thing. Yet here is the The Atlantic publishing something that is purely made up nonsense.This is racism. Its not science. This is all fakery used to distract people. </comment>

<comment>Then, tribalism?</comment>

<comment>White Liberals should watch this carefully. They will be cast aside when their votes are no longer needed. </comment>

<comment>Mr. Garcia's thinking is why I think you don't see as many statewide minority officials.When you have districts that are majority-minority, and oftentimes the person who wins is someone who plays up ethnic identity.But this not only creates a somewhat insular network, but it is going to push away voters who do not share that ethnic identity when they go for statewide audiences. If someone is perceived as being, for example, the voice/representative of hispanics, why would whites (or African Americans) want to vote for them? Conversely however, if you have a representative, who is Hispanic, makes it part of their identity, but not their raison d'être, they will are going to be much more likely to win statewide.This is part of the reason why when you see minorities winning statewide they either A) come from more diverse (e.g not an ethnic enclave) districts, and had to work with a variety of groups, or B) Republican, (who don't come from majority-minority districts). Its not surprising that Obama came from Illinois, and not for example, from Georgia.</comment>

<comment>Garcia and Rodriguez, have joined Smith, Johnson, and Miller in the top ten most common surnames in the nation. In addition, the latest Census Bureau study on surnames in the United States indicates that the number of Hispanic surnames in the top 25 doubled from 1990 to 2000. Garcia jumped from number 18 to number 8 on the list, and Rodriguez moved from 22 to 9.</comment>
