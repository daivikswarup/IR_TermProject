<comment>Such a surprise.  All the people and groups that Trump hates, members of the Millionaires' Club are not among them.He's said constantly that millionaires would pay a lot more taxes if he were President, so I guess that is another Whopper for Mr. Whopper of the Year.  http://www.factcheck.org/2015/...What kind of person supports this cretin?</comment>

<comment>The same cretins that support folks like Hillrod or anyone else that has EVER run for the job. We are all guilty of supporting damn lies and thieves.</comment>

<comment>You got something on topic to say?</comment>

<comment>Is answering a question not on topic ?</comment>

<comment>Those who support Trump apparently care more for his vile speak and bluster than looking for a real serious candidate. Trump and his supporters are embarrassing the country.</comment>

<comment>Fellow cretins, I'm afraid.</comment>

<comment>What a m-fk-ing clown.  How long will the Republican Party put up with the stupidity.  Let's just cut taxes for everyone to 0% and watch the country disintegrate into a sub-Saharan anarchy.</comment>

<comment>The GOP is, unfortunately, stuck in the proverbial bed it made. I've said it before and I'll say it again: The Republican Party as we know it today isn't going to last much longer. Maybe another 5 years, maybe another 50, but I'd wager not much more than that. It's too big an umbrella; it's going to have to split into at least a couple of parties (xenophobic, theocracy-minded populists vs. civil rights-minded fiscal conservatives, I'd guess, but who knows what the exact split will look like?). The only thing holding it together right now is the fact that any split means Democrats get to divide and conquer for a little while. (To a lesser extent, the same could be said of the Democratic Party, too - once populist, then progressive, and now centrist, but still dragging flotsam from its previous lives behind it, because you have to be a 500-pound gorilla to fight a 500-pound gorilla.) It's political brinksmanship at its basest.</comment>

<comment>There's a few good things in this plan like taxing carried interest as ordinary income.  But the $25000 standard deduction ($50000 for joint filers) combined with the top rate going from 39.6 to 25% assures you that 1. You're going to have deficits forever.  And 2. the middle class are getting the least of the tax cuts.  Also eliminating the estate tax and the medicare tax on investment income says this is just some Republican fantasy tax plan.  I wonder if Trump even had much to do with it.</comment>

<comment>" the medicare tax on investment income"I can see your points except for lumping this in as a repellent GOP-type tax. This is, as you'd know, a new tax for 2014, I believe, and the 3.5% that is essentially added to the cap gain rate might equally be viewed as a covert and backdoor plan by the Democrats to raise the cap gains rate in fact without raising it in name. It is, therefore, the very definition of "tax and spend" that dogs the footsteps of the Democratic party.It's not a disaster for me--it caused some reworking of spreadsheets and resultant strategies--but it's the kind of nasty and arbitrary surprise that those who invest don't like; it may be that I'm under-informed, but I only fully realized what this was when talking to my CPA after it was implemented--and I suspect that this was the plan all along--a sort of stealth surcharge on cap gains.One would also like to think that taxes that were nominally instituted to support a specific program or outcome might have some association with or relationship to that outcome. But laying a tax on investment to pay for medical subsidies really stretches this association.</comment>

<comment>Oh, its absolutely a way to raise the capital gains rate without raising it in name.  The medicare tax itself is a way to raise income taxes without raising them in name.  But why should investment income get any special treatment?  Its tough to consider it a surcharge either when its already charged on most other income.  Not having it on investment income creates a big loophole for the self employed and wealthy. Also, I'm not sure how investment income has any less of a link to Medicare than salary income does (which is to say neither have any association at all).</comment>

<comment>I'm having a bit of trouble following this precisely, and it may be on my end, having already started taking down some holiday cheer, but..."But why should investment income get any special treatment?"It is less that I object to the "treatment" and more that I object to changes in the status quo.You set up strategies based on a certain set of assumptions, and in this case it was cap gains is 15% in most cases  I deal with. You make long term purchases all the while knowing that thing can change, but when they do, you still aren't going to be happy about it. It causes at the minimum more work, and could actual cost some real money." Its tough to consider it a surcharge either when its already charged on most other income."Not sure what you mean here and I don't wish to criticize based on incomplete understand, but what it sounds like is..."My wife has cancer, so it's OK if she also has malaria.""Not having it on investment income creates a big loophole for the self employed and wealthy."That was the intent: to stimulate investment.Yep, and again maybe I misunderstand, but essentially saying that"I'm not sure how investment income has any less of a link to Medicare than salary income does (which is to say neither have any association at all)."is just another way of saying "misery loves company".</comment>

<comment>There's legislative risk in any investment.  Its not like the rate has been 15% forever.  Its really only been that way since 2003.  Its been higher in the past.  Anybody who bought something in the 80s with the intent of realizing the gain in 2007 or so got an unexpected bonus.  Anybody who bought in 2007 and sold recently paid more in tax than originally expected.  I guess that's not fair but its a risk you take when you invest."My wife has cancer, so it's OK if she also has malaria."No idea what you're getting at there.  Its about treating all income equally.  A fairly simple concept."That was the intent: to stimulate investment."Except its not investment when you take your income as S corp dividends instead of salary.  Its not investment when you're taking fees as carried interest instead of salary.  Its just a loophole for certain types of workers - mainly rich ones.</comment>

To subsidize a service that I'll never use, God willing, and if I do, I won't be subsidized, most likely."No idea what you're getting at there.  Its about treating all income equally.  A fairly simple concept."So you join me in supporting an income tax cut to the levels of cap gains?  :^)"Except its not investment when you take your income as S corp dividends instead of salary.  Its not investment when you're taking fees as carried interest instead of salary.  Its just a loophole for certain types of workers - mainly rich ones."I agree with you on these points, but want to point out that we were discussing cap gains as a government-sponsored way to increase investment.So far as loopholes, yep, they're there. They've been purchased. So the proposition before each individual within the US social/political system is: should I direct my finite energies toward eliminating all such loopholes; should I direct my finite energies toward creating loopholes that will benefit me and others of my stratum; or should I try to get myself into a financial position to try to utilize the existing loopholes?If I had enough energy to do only one, it would be the last one; there is actually a fairly high chance of this happening, and many of the steps in getting there are within my control.</comment>

<comment>"it's the injection of instability, and it's not something you like when actively and individually investing"Its a risk.  And no, you do like risk while investing - so long as you're paid for it.  If nothing was risky then nothing would pay any better than a T-bill.  Just make sure to diversify and hedge away whatever risks you don't want to take and you'll be fine."To subsidize a service that I'll never use"You're never going to use Medicare?  Do you plan to leave the country for retirement?"So you join me in supporting an income tax cut to the levels of cap gains?"If it was financially possible, sure.  But it isn't.  It would create unsustainable deficits." should I try to get myself into a financial position to try to utilize the existing loopholes?"One, that's not easy to do.  I'm sure we'd all love to manage PE funds but that's just not going to happen.  Also, why should the government provide extra incentives for people so they pursue already lucrative jobs?  It just distorts the economy.  People forgo careers that create more wealth to pursue ones that generate better takehome pay.  So less wealth ends up being created in the economy.</comment>

<comment>"You're never going to use Medicare?  Do you plan to leave the country for retirement?"I hadn't realized that the investment tax was to support Medicare. I had thought that:"Higher income taxpayers, as well as taxpayers with sources of income that are defined as net investment income in the statute, pay an additional 3.8% tax to offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Silly me! The Medicare tax that had come out of my check since 1966, for the remainder of my working career, and, like SS, against which I now claim, was NOT for Medicare, but the net investment tax was? Is that right? Or were they BOTH for Medicare?"One, that's not easy to do."It's not all that hard to get some of the less selective ones: cap gains in lieu of income tax, methods to minimize inheritance tax, deductions for mortgage interest, etc." Also, why should the government provide extra incentives for people so they pursue already lucrative jobs?"In part because these higher paying jobs also are taxed at an increasingly higher rate?But let's not delude ourselves over this. The government is not attempting to structure a tax system that's *fair*; it's simply trying to efficiently get the most revenue from earners and still avoid the wrath of both the general voting public and financial contributors who expect the creation of loopholes."People forgo careers that create more wealth to pursue ones that generate better takehome pay."You may have an important point here that I'd like to consider. Could you give an example and a brief explanation of what this point means?</comment>

<comment>It is, therefore, the very definition of "tax and spend" that dogs the footsteps of the Democratic party.As opposed to the GOP that likes to cut taxes, spend and borrow ?</comment>

<comment>The GOP cuts Taxes and Spends more than the Demsthen they whine endlessly about the deficitcan't have it both ways bro</comment>

<comment>This is not a partisan pry bar I'm using. I think both parties are filled to the brim with pathetically transparent self-aggrandizing opportunists who attempt to purchase public favor where, and however, they can. I'm using it in my comment to show the label that sticks to them, rightly or wrongly, and they open themselves to this criticism by adding the de facto cap gains surcharge to pay for subsidies that vanishingly few who pay cap gains will EVER use.Wow. Considered that way, it's also naked redistribution, another rap the Demos are hung with, and in this case they're sure cooperating with the strategies of their critics, who will, without doubt, point this out during election time.But as I said, they're all a bunch flimflam artists, amusing the passing rubes in any way the can, battered hat on the sidewalk before them, and at the end of the day, the one(s) with the most nickles, quarters, and dimes, wins.</comment>

<comment> I think both parties are filled to the brim with pathetically transparent self-aggrandizing opportunists who attempt to purchase public favor where, and however, they can.And that is a false equivalency. If the Democrats are the "Tax and Spend" party, then they are the responsible party by paying for what the citizens want. it's also naked redistribution, another rap the Demos are hung with,So why is that a problem? Those with the money benefit the most from society. Even Trump thinks there should be a $25,000 personal exemption on income taxes. So far, flat tax rates are mostly a right wing nut dream.</comment>

<comment>"If the Democrats are the "Tax and Spend" party,"Yeah, but they don't spend on *me*."Those with the money benefit the most from society."I think you've got cause and effect backwards here. The way it reads is that because society takes it upon itself to benefit them, that's why they're wealthy. But I think the causal chain is that because they're wealthy, they derive more benefit from the society in which they live--and largely do so by paying for these benefits--purchasing them with their wealth. Cars, homes, schools, medical care, etc.And does this surprise you, that people who have money spend it to buy things (benefits) that people without cannot buy? I mean, what would be the reason to have money--go to the trouble to acquire it--if this were not true?</comment>

<comment>It is, therefore, the very definition of "tax and spend" that dogs the footsteps of the Democratic party."Tax and spend" by any other name would still be the responsible way of paying for something people want. Of course, most know that those who use that term in a derogatory manner, would rather put it all on the National Credit Card and let our children pay for it.</comment>

<comment>Right, but you must have read my point for even introducing the term into this discussion. They will be accused of playing to form.Not that this matters to me, but you know, just sayin...</comment>

<comment>Oh what a surprise. Donald Trumps' tax plan benefits people like himself millionaires and billionaires! Yet his supporters who live in a parallel universe believe he really cares about them! He cares not one iota about them or anyone else in the country other than those who like himself have so much money they don't know what to do with it and fly around in their own private jets! Donald Trump is in the right party, the party of the wealthy. The gullible and those who know squat about the Constitution apparently fall for his gibberish alongside his crude and disgusting behavior. How sad that some have no respect for the office of the presidency that they would even think of electing someone like Donald Trump.</comment>

<comment>Trump also proposed a one time, massive tax of American wealth, which they completely ignored in their analysis.  I don't know if Trump's tax plan benefits or hurts the wealthy, but the Tax Policy Center's analysis is, literally, half assed.</comment>

<comment>So Trump is lying in his own tax proposal?</comment>

<comment>There have been numerous analyses. All come to the same conclusion. It will largely benefit the extreme wealthy. The very people who support Trump are the ones who will suffer if Trumps' or any other of the Conservative economical plans were to go into effect. GWB's tax cuts were very harmful to the middle class and massively benefited the wealthy.No surprize, 50% of all campaign contributions now come from just 100 US families</comment>

<comment>What you pinkos on the left don't seem to understand is that winners win and losers get to watch. Look, how is America going to be great again if we let the smart people with the big shlongs get tapped by the government to provide hand outs for Mexicans driving souped up Hondas and eating steak fajitas instead of beans and rice. Not one story about Hillary getting her granny panties all in a bunch while telling lies about Trump, but story after story about Trump making a real effort to put American first again spun as some kind of Archie Bunker set piece. We're going to send those people on a 11million Man Trail of Tears, plug the Internet and defeat ISIS and drop a couple of nukes on whoever has the balls to stand up and say America is not great (again!).Get use to it America. The winners are in charge now.</comment>

<comment>CLIFF!!</comment>

<comment>Now I'm afraid. There are people who are giving any importance to a clown who began his campaign as such. Why media keep talking about him? Is he really a contendant? You can't be serious "analyzing" a tax plan that comes from this lunatic. Moreover, imagine him making sacrifices for his fellow americans. It's evident that the only beneficed with any of his "plans" will be him and his truly fellow billionaires.</comment>

<comment>He's the leading candidate for the opposition party. The opposition party is often voted into the White House after two terms of the ruling party. He really is a contender.</comment>

<comment>He has 33% support, from signed up republicans, in a field of 13. Hardly a groundswell. Let's see where he is in 6 months. My guess he will be back firing people and marrying younger women as his ego will not accept a President's salary.</comment>

<comment>While I am not a Trump Supporter, people have been saying that for the entire six months Trump has been in the race. In the mean time, even though his comments just get more outrageous, his popularity grows each time.I look forward to Trump trying to convince the American voter that he is a viable candidate. When the electorate at large gives him a 2/3rds disapproval, the Democrats will have a cakewalk into the White House and Congress.</comment>

<comment>I think it's more his media coverage and recognisance grows, not his popularity per se.I still have to think this is one big self promotion gig pulled off by one of the best (shameless) self promoters of our time.. paid for by others. He has done this before..maybe this is all just fodder for his next book.</comment>

<comment>Ah, but don't you know? The Donald is too CLASSY for policy.</comment>

<comment>Why is anyone surprised that this narcissist  wants to benefit those like himself?</comment>

<comment>Trumpettes don't do math .</comment>

<comment>But they will eat crap and enjoy it if Trump tells them it tastes good.</comment>

<comment>The plan also comes with a hefty price tag. Trump’s plan would cut federal revenue by nearly $10 trillion over a decade================================I call BS on this number.   A trillion dollar per year. The analysis was done by the progressive tax policy center.  And progressives always lie.They also fail to note, the most effective stimulus are tax cuts.</comment>

<comment>Got a citation on your claims then?</comment>

<comment>read the article</comment>

<comment>Trumps own website?</comment>

<comment>So you have no rebuttal to the Tax Policy Center then. Like Trump, you prefer fantasy BS over reality.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the most effective stimulus of the wealth disparity..</comment>

<comment>Change effective to ineffective and you would be right.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing effective about our government.</comment>

<comment>Business Taxes• Reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent.=======================The corporate tax rate should be cut.  Companies are leaving the US due to the high tax rate.</comment>

<comment>No one actually pays that rate once deducitons and credits are finished withCompanies are leaving the US for cheaper labor</comment>

<comment>The manufacturing is going to places with cheaper labor. The head offices are going where the taxes are lower. That usually means places like Ireland.  In most cases, that is just a small office with a title on the door saying ACME WORLD HEADQUARTERS. The actual decision making and R&D is still in the US.The important detail is that the IRS does not get to tax the company on its overall profits, only those earned in the US while the company can write off all the R&D, marketing, etc.</comment>

<comment>No..they are leaving for cheaper tax rates.</comment>

<comment>I would have little problem cutting corporate rates if we also cut loopholes for corporations and made the investment tax rate the same as earned income. Seriously, some dude earning $14 million in income paid an effective 14% in income taxes. He wasn't working as he spent the previous three years running for President.http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/2...</comment>

<comment>Investment tax rate should lower than waged income.  There is no risk in wages.</comment>

<comment>Let's not pretend that Trump's tax proposal is serious at allWhat he likely did was take Jeb Bush's plan and bracket by bracket he lowered the rates without any thought to the implications.While all the candidates seek not to add to the deficit initially, they all do but relatively little.Trump's plan was not thought through and adds $10 Trillion to the deficit. Conservative groups have panned his plan.So let's not pretend that this is a serious plan at all.</comment>

<comment>His plan is so serious you won't even believe how serious it is!</comment>

<comment>It is not a serious and certainly not thought through proposal.I can almost guarantee, knowing Trump has no advisers that they took Bush's proposal and lowered the rates to make himself look better but without extrapolating the implications of that.As a result:"The plan would also be a large tax cut, which would increase the federal government’s deficit by over $10 trillion, both on a static and dynamic basis."http://taxfoundation.org/artic...That is over ten time more than any other tax proposal.  In other words, it is not a serious proposal.</comment>

<comment>Congress just approved over $600 billion in tax breaks last week, led by Republicans who sniffed that they didn't get everything they wanted.It's a serious proposal, all right.  Embarrassed?  You should be.</comment>

<comment>And your drivel has what to do with Trump's laughable tax proposal?</comment>

<comment>That it's just another typical REPUBLICAN tax proposal:1.  Lower taxes on the wealthy;2.  Run up the national debt;3.  Blame it on the "tax and spend Democrats;"4.  Propose cuts to Social Security and Medicare, 'cause...5.  Take yuge contributions from billionaires and exclaim, "Why, those Democrats are giving things away to buy votes!"  Not the Republicans.  No. They give tax cuts to the wealthy, take the contributions, use them to get re-elected by dolts such as...what's your name again?Paul Ryan, every Republican candidate for President.</comment>

<comment>Its the most serious plan ever. Yuge. Believe me you are going to love this plan. Its a beautiful plan. This plan will make America great again. All we do is lose, and we are gonna win with this plan and stop losing. This plan will schlong the shit out of ISIS by the way. I'm being serious here.</comment>

<comment>So let's not pretend that this is a serious plan at all.But you pretend all the time.Trump put this out there as his plan. As with any politician, he owns it. Unless, you want to suggest Ho Chi Minh wasn't a communist.</comment>

<comment>Flagged  You lost an argument and told you never to respond to me again, trollI will flag all your comments to me.</comment>

<comment>I think you do not understand the meaning of that word flag.</comment>

<comment>He's up to his third or fourth name.</comment>

<comment>You claimed Ho Chi Minh wasn't a communist. He was from a young age. You lied and were schooled. Now you're back to threatening others.You and the word troll go so well together.</comment>

<comment>One more time and then I am flagging ALL your comments you ign0rant trollIf you bothered to read ANY biographies of Ho Chi Minh they would tell you that he was a Nationalist.If he was a Communist why did he initially seek help for independence from Woodrow Wilson and then following WW II sought an alliance as an independent country from Harry Truman? Was the U.S. a communist country? Are you that shallow and uneducated?He USED communism to get what he wanted because they offered him assistance in gaining what he wanted which was independence. He was a a Nationalist. Go read at least one biography instead of your 10 second google garbage or stay willfully stupid.Even another commenter tried to explain that to you but intelligence is not you strength.Now I am flagging ALL your abusive comments and hopefully you get banned again, troll</comment>

<comment>Funny, when pressed multiple times, you have been unable to show any citation saying Ho was a Nationalist. Not one.You lied about Ho Chi Minh and you lied about never posting again. You constantly lie in your comments. You should know what that makes you.However, if you can show a citation showing he was a nationalist rather than a communist then I will read it. Yet, everyone knows you won't. Instead, you'll rant about flagging a comment that shows you lied.</comment>

<comment>flagging all your comments irn0rant trollgo read a book and stop lying</comment>

<comment>Yeah,  well,  on this one,  I'm pretty sure that if an expat spends forty years trying to wrest his country from colonial rule and foreign influence,  you can fairly call him a nationalist.   And,  he was a Communist economically and by way of political alliance with Communist China. </comment>

<comment>Ho moved to Paris France in his 20s. That is where he joined the Communist Party shortly afterwards. Ho was a leader in the local Communist Parties until moving to Moscow for education by the Soviet Communists. He was a communist plain and simple. Krugar claims that Ho became a communist as a matter of convenience.Inspired by the success of Vladimir Lenin’s Bolshevik Revolution, he joined the new French Communist Party in 1920 and traveled to Moscow three years later. He soon began recruiting members of a Vietnamese nationalist movement that would form the basis of the Indochinese Communist Party (founded in Hong Kong in 1930) and traveled the world, including Brussels, Paris and Siam (now Thailand), where he worked as a representative of the Communist International organization.http://www.history.com/topics/...see also http://countrystudies.us/vietn...and http://asianhistory.about.com/...</comment>

<comment>Kluger,  I don't know Mr.  Fusion,  but he's been using the same Disqus name for YEARS.   Your rant and threats seem grounded in the notion that only you can divine what is or is not a "fact."  HO Chi Minh?He was a busboy in Brooklyn around the Administration of Woodrow Wilson,  and any bio that puts him in a suit at the White House as a spokesman for a movement that wouldn't be formed until twenty years later seems beyond credulity.He was a nationalist,  but lived in China and was married in the same place as Chou en Lai.   He most certainly embraced Communism throughout the periods he was a political leader.  By definition, any guy that starts a movement to free his nation from colonial rule is a nationalist.   Hell,  every political leader considers himself a nationalist.  But his economic model was clearly Communism.End the food fight before we all sit down to Christmas dinner. </comment>

<comment>He was a nationalist. Period.He used communists to gain independence when Truman turned him down.If he were communist then why would he reach out to Truman for an alliance after the war? With his region turning communist the fact that he still chose to reach out to Truman shows he was not an ideological communist. If Truman conceded to his wished would Vietnam had been communist? No.I would suggest you read any one of his biographies because it is clear that he was not ideological at all and would align with whomever helped with independence. Historians pointed that distinction out.And he had past names.</comment>

<comment>Well,  for what it's worth,  a summary of scholarly work summarizes,  "He led the Việt Minhindependence movement from 1941 onward, establishing theCommunist-ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at thebattle of Điện Biên Phủ. He officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health problems, but remained a highly visible figurehead and inspiration for those Vietnamese fighting for his cause—a united, communist Vietnam—until his death. After the war, Saigon, the former capital of the Republic of Vietnam, was renamedHồ Chí Minh City."That's Wikipedia.   It supports your claim of nationalism,  but doesn't recognize your penchant to avoid calling him a Communist.You'll not get help from Truman.   He "reached out"  to him with the full knowledge that we had supported Communists against Hitler and Tojo for the prior six years.Why don't you settle for half a fruitcake here and enjoy the holidays? </comment>

<comment>Unfortunately for you and that nutcase, I read a few of his biographies and historians agree with me.</comment>
