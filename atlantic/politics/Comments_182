<comment>The Atlantic is on a religious concern-trolling tear. So there's one church in Brooklyn that draws people back in from the "spiritual, not religious" set where its members feel compelled to explain themselves to their social circle. There are also millions of Christians attending maybe a couple hundred thousand traditional churches in New York City. Hipsters, even!</comment>

<comment>Ahaha ...I suppose you refer to the egregious Kim Davis, the woman "persecuted" for not doing her job, which she swore on the Bible to do? Maybe Hobby Lobby being persecuted by all the people who don't want to have their private lives dictated to by holier than thou "Christians"? Or the judge persectued for not being allowed to erect "Biblical" injunctions in the courtyard? Or all the "Christians" being persecuted by folks not saying "Merry Christmas" and daring to say "Happy Holidays"? You do know something about the separation of Church and state, right?Perhaps you can open the newspaper and cite some of those several instances on your own.</comment>

<comment>No, the "mafia" doesn't care if her name is on it or not. They just want a license. And the format of the license isn't up to the "LGBT mafia", but rather the state of Kentucky, which hasn't gotten around to changing it yet.</comment>

<comment>Nononono...she asked AFTER she got jailed that no licenses be issued with her name on them so that she wouldn't be granting them in absentia.  Totally different reasoning designed by her lawyers to increase her market value as a "Christian martyr".  Just wait for the talk show rounds and the book deals, etc. Those "Christian" lawyers are something else, kinda remind me of the money changers in the court of the temple. And the "martyr" is out of jail, and had her celebrity status enhanced by the "Christian" visits of Huckabee and Cruz, oozing sincerity and support in front of the TeeVee cameras, to increase the duration of their sell by date.</comment>

<comment>No....she said nothing about her name until after she was jailed. She was jailed for refusing to allow her deputies to carry out the duties of her office. She was offered a reasonable accommodation (as she should have been under the law), and refused it. At that point, she failed to uphold her oath of office.</comment>

<comment>Please tell me precisely what Kentucky statute authorizes her to issue marriage licenses to a same sex couple?Even better, copypasta the relevant portion(s) of the code.Thanks.And, to spare us all a waste of time, do not tell me what SCOTUS said - SCOTUS can only invalidate an unconstitutional law, not write a new one.</comment>

<comment>???If SCOTUS can'rt say same sex marriage is Constitutional, then who can?  Only you?  God? Are you being Manichean?</comment>

<comment>Ummm this isn't about writing a law. It is about applying the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution to people.  I suddenly read something Huckabee said and I realized where you are coming from. The laws in Kentucky are subject to the Constitution, not the other way around. Kim Davis is subject to the Constitution and isn't allowed to discriminate based on her so-called religious beliefs.  Suppose you were required to grow a beard in order to appear before a Jewish judge, would that be OK by you?  Or how about requiring women to cover their heads in front of men? Would that be OK by you? Those are all religious preferences based on personal interpretations of the Bible. Under the Constitution you are not allowed to impose your religious preferences on other people.I don't expect you to understand established law, since you consider Huckabee to be a good source, so I won't discuss this any further. But you need to take a high school civics class.</comment>

<comment>Your lack of knowledge about news events or Christianity in general is pretty obvious. Like Godzilla in a tutu.</comment>

<comment>I cuite goood news sources and you claim I lack knowldge. You look pretty ignorant from where I stand, but feeling sorry for yourself is an earmarkof right wing Christians</comment>

<comment>Maybe u dont watch enough news in general.</comment>

<comment>No, I read news, which means I can get more information in a very short period of time. Watching people babble on TeeVee is a waste of time and a good way to be a big know-nothing.</comment>

<comment>Where and how in the United States are they persecuted? Do they risk being jailed for attending services? Are their churches constantly at risk or being bombed or set on fire? Are they being beaten for wearing crosses around their necks? Are they being sold or kidnapped into slavery by a more "dominant" group.Didn't think so.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Each of those cases started with Christians persecuting others, and they all got rich. In fact, the reason the judge put Kim Davis in jail (for not doing her job, natch), instead of giving her a fine is because he said her troll army (paraphrasing) would raise the money overnight and she wouldn't actually be punished.ETA there's been some allegations that Memories Pizza played you like a fiddle and knew you were going to throw all those donations their way.</comment>

<comment>None of those are examples of Christian persecution, but they are good examples of Christians breaking the law, and breaking their oath of office while enforcing their religion on other people. Your the one who is being willfully ignorant.  Requiring someone to obey the law is not persecution.</comment>

<comment>oh please.  American Christians are some of the most well-off, privileged people on Earth.  When ISIS starts cutting off their heads, then they can whine about persecution. Being compelled not to discriminate is *not* persecution.</comment>

<comment>When was the last time a gay person got their head cut off?  What are THEY whining about (by your standards)?</comment>

<comment>Oh, good Lord. LGBT "Mafia"? On the other hand, if they decided to put a horse's head in somebody's bed, they'd find a way to make it look fabulous.</comment>

<comment>Whether or not people want to believe this, it's true... and no, I don't watch Fox News. There is a strain of anti-Christian sentiment that grows and grows in its vociferousness.Just because it's a subtle form of persecution, does not mean it's not real.</comment>

<comment>Anti-Christian sentiment, based on the bigotry and oppressive attitudes expressed by a distressingly large proportion of Christians (including some of those commenting on this article) - who may or may not be the majority, but who certainly are the most vocal - is not the same as persecution.</comment>

<comment>No, we're not.</comment>

<comment>"Persecuted" is having your head cut off or exploded by ISIS. "Dealing with pluralism" is what life in the USA is called.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that "persecuted" and "having to deal with some unfortunate stereotypes that are sadly true of some of my fellow believers" are the same thing at all. Not even close.</comment>

<comment>Newsflash:  church attendance IS counter cultural.</comment>

<comment>Newsflash: no one cares if you go to church or not</comment>

<comment>You're half right.  No one cares if you don't attend church.  Which is why this article exists.  </comment>

<comment>I think you're half right too</comment>

<comment>Just imagine if you two combined your powers</comment>

<comment>Let me see, people get together for a "Christian" meal, no one objects, but the people who attend are afraid to say they do this, in a country where "Christians" seem to think they are persecuted if anyone believes that  "Christianity" is not the law of the land...and most people claim to be "Christians". Is this a nothingburger story or what? Is there a story here? Did something get left out?</comment>

<comment>Most people want to believe they're "normal" or in the vast majority, a persecuted minority or the first people to do something. The people in this story, and the writer, have opted for a mentality straddling #2 and #3. Because you don't really have a compelling story if you're just another group of people being left alone to do something unremarkable.</comment>

<comment>I attended a similar "younger" church on Long Island, it fell apart within a few years because it started to resemble a high-school popularity contest. Lots of the males used it as a place to pick up girls, and most of the girls fought over the same guy, each insisting "God told them" he was going to be their husband. Pretty sure God didn't tell all of those girls they were going to marry him. There was a lot of drama and gossip between everyone, and a lot of the new comers or "less popular" folks got ignored. I ended up being dragged into some unintentional nonsense and so I stopped going because it was no longer a "Christ centered" place to be. I was on the worship team, I was on the hospitality team, I helped lead bible studies and prayer groups. I was pretty involved with these people. You'd think someone would call to check on me after a few weeks of being absent? Nope. I was one less girl to compete with. This was my final Christian straw, I'm an atheist now and couldn't be happier. Most of these groups have very little to do with Christ at all, I wouldn't be surprised if this little church is non-existent in a few years.</comment>

<comment>That's brutal.  I am sorry that happened to you.</comment>

<comment>It was upsetting at the time but I've learned and grown a lot from the experience, I have a better sense of what I truly believe now and the kind of people I want in my life.</comment>

<comment>FLUFFY, how can you believe if you are an atheist?  I thought atheists used their minds to think?  I suppose you must also have no respect for our Declaration of Independence.  That being the case I think you should be made a slave of your government should they decide that is what you are good for.  So if you are truly an atheist stop trying to convince anyone that you "truly believe" in anything.  That is just oh so self- contradictory and silly.</comment>

<comment>You clearly need to educate yourself on what an Atheist actually is.  I wasn't attempting to convince anyone of anything.</comment>

<comment>A lot of churches are like that.  Youth outreach and singles outreach are designed for like-minded people to get together.</comment>

<comment>then it's not really about God or Christ is it? They'd be better off calling it "Conservative Singles Night".</comment>

<comment>That sadly sounds familiar. I think there's a lot of pressure on conservative Christian girls to find a husband. What do you believe now?I'm trying to separate Christ from the behavior of His followers. I've thought about trying a more liberal church.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes, finding one that does some work in your community that you really believe in, and volunteering with them for an afternoon, can be a good way to scope out the congregation first.</comment>

<comment>I am an atheist. I no longer believe there is a "higher power" nor do I believe we require the sacrifice of another to absolve us from our sins. I believe it is up to each individual to own up to whatever wrong doings they have done and do what they can to make it right-as that is all one can do if you wish to grow and be better than who you were yesterday. God is not required for these things, only a willingness to be honest and introspective with oneself.I do not believe anyone is born inherently good or bad (aka a sinner). I believe those things are determined throughout the course of your life based on how you choose to live out your life, though we do have common sense and some things (like raping and murdering) are just known not to do (this doesn't mean that it doesn't happen, but it's common knowledge that we're at the very least, not supposed to do these things,)  I often find it puzzling when the devout argue that atheist cannot be moral people because they have no "rule book" to follow. Does this mean that if their Bible or Koran or whatever didn't specify not to kill people, they would? Considering religion has a bad history of violence, I'm not sure that rule book is really doing them any favors. I believe that we are it and we are ultimately in control of how our lives pan out, good, bad or otherwise and when we die we die. That's it. No Heaven, no Hell. When "bad" things happen in your life, it's not God punishing you or God trying to teach you something, it's simply an unpleasant event that you are experiencing and it will pass. If you learn from it great, but don't fool yourself into think some divine being has his/her or its sights on you. I believe that perhaps if we stopped spending so much time looking down into our holy books and fighting over which God is the right one and waging war over the way other people live, and instead looked upward to the stars and educated ourselves more in science and astronomy (not to be confused with astrology) we'd have a better understanding of ourselves, each other and the rest of creation and perhaps we would treat each other and our home on Earth with a little more care, empathy and compassion. There's a beautiful video on YouTube that I watch frequently, it's Neil deGrasse Tyson answering the question "What is the most astounding fact?"https://www.youtube.com/watch?...We are bigger than we think we are, and so much more than what we think we are, religion shuts out any understanding of that. At least that's how it seems to me. If you still need a church to go to, I hope you find a place where you feel at home, as for me, my church is on top of the mountains and in the forest and by the river beds and up in the night sky. Be well.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for such a thoughtful reply.</comment>

<comment>You don't want a Church that is Christian.  You want a Church that accepts your bad behavior as "okey-dokey"</comment>

<comment>Yes and your behavior on this site and the way you speak to people is oh so Christ like.</comment>

<comment>The way he speaks to people on this site is a lot closer to how Jesus spoke to unrepentant sinners who rejected Him, than your idol that you have concocted that you call jesus."You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart." Matt 12:34"You serpents, you brood of vipers, how can you escape the sentence of hell?" Matt 23:33"You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. [...]" John 8:44Nor were His condemnations just reserved for the Pharisees, Sadducees and scribes, but also whole towns of both rich and poor, healthy and sick who did not repent and rejected Him (Matt 11:20-24).In fact, the person you are commenting towards is a bit tame compared to Jesus...</comment>

<comment>I do not have an idol. Not sure what you're talking about. The verses you shared are, as you said Jesus talking to unrepentant sinners. How does Obri know that Erica is an "unrepentant sinner"? Obri made a judgment without knowing anything about the person he was speaking too. She simply said she was trying to separate the behavior of church members from what she knows about God and Jesus and that she'd like to find a likeminded church. What's unrepentant and sinful about that? How is she "rejecting" Christ by wanting to find a better church? And then Obri decides that this means she's just looking for a place to get away with "sinning".Did Jesus make his judgments based on assumptions, or did he get to know people he was working with and handle them accordingly?</comment>

<comment>No. I want a church that is Christian, not Republican.</comment>

<comment>So, because people disappoint you, you give up on Christ?</comment>

<comment>No, I educated myself and realized the bible and religion in general is more or less an adult sized fairy tale.  Its funny we eventually tell kids the truth about Santa and the tooth fairy but we refuse to let go of our own imaginary friends.</comment>

<comment>I see. You educated yourself. And now since you're educated, you feel quite comfortable ridiculing people of faith for believing in "adult-sized" fairy tales and having "imaginary friends" while you compare God with Santa Claus and the tooth fairy. Very nice.I imagine you consider yourself a better person now. And quite superior to those silly girls in your former "youth" church. I wonder what would have happened if you had been one of the popular ones. I'm guessing you would not have found the need to get "educated."</comment>

<comment>I don't know if you're a religious believer or not, but if you are -- how is your response in any way representative of your religious beliefs? Were you converted because someone mocked you and misrepresented your own beliefs?I think if we want to show people that our religion is valuable and that it "works," we would represent the values of our religion. If we cannot display any added value for our religion, why would anyone want to follow what we follow?</comment>

<comment>My religious beliefs are my own business, but, trust me, I'm not a person easily mocked (and, if you know your Bible, neither is God). Faith is not a matter of "added value."</comment>

<comment>Perhaps. I just don't think it's constructive to mock people as a means to educate them or even to evangelize them.If you are a religious believer, I'd be curious to find out whether your conversion happened because someone mocked you for your non-belief.Most of the people I meet who are religious believers have a conversion experience that comes about from conversation and connection, not mocking. If it works for you, then great.</comment>

<comment>I didn't ridicule anyone until you gave me your snarky response, that ridicule is directed at you and you alone.There were actually several factors that led me to where I am. If you had come at me respectfully I would have been happy to give you a more tactful response, as you can see in my dialogue with Erica, I was very respectful., even encouraged her to find a church that fit for her and wished her well on her journey.I have no problem with people of faith, I have a problem with people getting angry with me for not having faith in God, which is what you expressed in your original comment. As if my non-belief is somehow a personal attack against you.I do consider myself a better person than who I was years ago, but I do not consider myself better than anyone else as I do not waste my time comparing myself to others.  You also must not have read my original post- I was very involved with this church and quite popular, that has nothing to do with anything.</comment>

<comment>There was neither snark nor ridicule in my original question. You chose to view it in that way and respond in kind. But in the end, even tactful people of faith (like Erica) still believe in adult-sized fairy tales on the order of Santa Claus and the tooth fairy, don't they.</comment>

<comment>"So, because people disappoint you, you give up on Christ?"Sorry, reads like a defensive snarky response  from someone who's butt hurt that someone else doesn't like their God anymore- and I still think it is. Your responses that followed only support my stance.  And yeah, if Erica remains committed to her faith/religion  that's fine. Never said it wasn't</comment>

<comment>Sweetie, I'm not the least bit hurt, butt or otherwise, that you don't like "my" God. The finely honed sense of superiority exhibited by the converted (in this case, converted atheist) never fails to amuse.</comment>

<comment>And the smug condescension exhibited by the "faithful" never fails to amuse either. Have a great day.</comment>

<comment>At last a worthy retort. Touché.Please try to remember that you atheists haven't invented anything. Man is born with the capacity to be saint or sinner (we call it free will). Human nature being what it is, sin often wins out. People of faith believe in repentance, redemption and everlasting life. Atheists have no use for such beliefs. They instead often believe that they subscribe to a superior ethos because there is no end game reward for living a moral, ethical life. Therefore, they inhabit a higher moral plane  should they succeed in living such a life. They are wrong about that, I think, but are entitled to that belief as much as I am entitled to mine.  There, I hope that wasn't too condescendingly smug for you.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure what you mean by we haven't invented anything? As far as what? If you mean that no atheist has done or invented anything to contribute to society  I suggest you read the works of  Stephen Hawking (among others).I believe in repentance and redemption as well, I simply do not believe you need a higher power to attain that.  And yes, I think there is something to be said about people who need a book to tell them how to behave and the fact that they only behave "rightly" because of what they gain from it. Shouldn't  you do what's right and good because it is right and good regardless of what your "reward" will be on earth or elsewhere?As far as being entitled to beliefs, I had a professor tell our class that we are only entitled to the beliefs and opinions we could back up with facts. That's not bad advice.And you were good on the condescending smugness until that last sentence. Why keep beating the horse?</comment>

<comment>I'm finding that in Brooklyn, this church is actually more "normal" than you'd think. There are a lot of communities like this sprouting up all over—they're too disconnected from one another to realize that they are living side by side.</comment>

<comment>it’s definitely not a Unitarian church. “We’re very Biblically grounded,” Scott said.He's conflated Unitarians with Unitarian Universalists. Both reject the Trinity.  The UUers are open to the principles in other texts.</comment>

<comment>'Judean People's Front'. We're the People's Front of Judea! 'Judean People's Front'. -Life of Brian</comment>

<comment>Q: What do you get when you cross a UU-er with a Jehovah's Witness?A: People who go around knocking on doors for no particular reason.</comment>

<comment>Great! The other version I've heard is "people who knock on doors and then don't have anything to say".</comment>

<comment>Good article. I don't think Christians need to cringe. They can simply represent.Brooklyn being what it is, and Christ being known as the friend of sinners, I'm sure Christians will find it easy to make friends in Brooklyn.(Yeah, a bit tongue in cheek. But really, being a Christian is completely safe in America. Being obnoxious will probably result in blowback, though.)</comment>

<comment>"Christ being known as the friend of repentant sinners"Forgot a word...Jesus condemned those who rejected Him and did not repent, whether rich or poor, healthy or sick (Matt 12:20-24). Nor were His words kind to those who taught error or to those who followed in ignorance (Matt 23:13-36).2 days late, but that word is very important...</comment>

<comment>You should continue your preaching in this style, then. It is probably very effective.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a congregation of people doing what they're supposed to be doing as Christians. Bless them.</comment>

<comment>Sigh....so Catholics and Protestants aren't Christians?  Pretty condescending.</comment>

<comment>Of course not - only pretentious hipsters (but don't call them that) are, and they're courageously standing up to their hipster brethren.</comment>

<comment>What a great idea for a congregation, as part of the emerging church movement!  I found it striking that folks have to explain their church attendance to their friends as though it is something strange.  There have always been church goers in Brooklyn, conservative or not, and there is no need to presume that any church goer is a rabid conservative because there have always been Christians within the political left and in the moderate middle.  That is quite clear from American history as well as church history, so there is no need to apologize.  If anything, it sounds like some people need new friends.</comment>

<comment>nonsense</comment>

<comment>As a Christian this article made me feel uncomfortable.</comment>

<comment>New york, keep it.</comment>

<comment>Has anyone mentioned that the last supper mosaic clearly has a female (M.M.)to the left of J.o'Nazz?  It brings up the apocryphal Book of Mary/J. was married narrative cited in also in the DaVinci Code.  Was Mary payed as much as the other apostles?</comment>

<comment>I've been a member of St. Lydia's for three years, and Emma Green captured our community well. For the snarky intelligentsia of Brooklyn, something so hokey and backwater as "being a Christian" is akin to wearing Oakley sunglasses and really liking, say, Tim McGraw. You don't do that here. But this church is a breath of fresh air--a place where sincerity is un-ironically valued, you don't have to hide your feelings under a cloak of wit or barbed reference. Regardless of Christian theology or dogma, I think that's what "church" should be. A place where the community works together honestly to meditate on the good, the bad and the ugly of living together. We recently talked about "worshiping/wavering," which is a candid assessment of many congregants' feelings and a mental space where I think many New Yorkers would feel comfortable. We like to grapple and fight the status-quo. (Isn't that why we fled the vapid, cookie-cutter suburbs to Brooklyn in the first place? It wasn't ALL for the indie bands and artisanal mayonnaise, right?)</comment>
