<comment>What would life be like if we replaced them all with blacks, a couple latinos and one Asian guy ??</comment>

<comment>Haiti, or Detroit.</comment>

<comment>Yep.</comment>

<comment>How many will be women?</comment>

<comment>Whaaaaaaat !!!! ????</comment>

<comment>Each state gets two senators, which means places that are overwhelmingly white like South Dakota and Montana get the same amount of senators as places like California or Florida.So, this shouldn't be shocking.</comment>

<comment>And the lack of staff diversity?</comment>

<comment>People from the state represented have a huge step up in staff hiring, and a lot of the senior staffers are those who worked closely with the Senator and the Senator's network before that Senator was elected to the Senate, so they'll represent the demographics of those states, and will usually look very similar to the Senator.</comment>

<comment>Do majorities of other races or ethnicities overwhelm you? Is Mumbai overwhelmingly Indian? Is Tokyo overwhelmingly Japanese?</comment>

<comment>The article is misleading. The Senate, being the upper chamber, is elected out of the states. And nearly all states are majority white, with the vast majority of those holding non-Hispanic white majorities to boot.We have a chamber which is closer to the people; it's called the House of Representatives. Whether or not the House is "too white" (assuming "too white" is undesirable) might be a more interesting discussion. But to cast such aspersions at the Senate is disingenuous. In fact, if you tried to force the Senate's demographics to match the nation's it'd actually become less representative in a relative sense. Now, the staffing might be a bit more diverse than it is, but even here the overwhelming whiteness is hardly a surprise.</comment>

<comment>And so many of these senators have been in the Senate way too long.</comment>

<comment>Eh, there's always a lag. Citizenship and age structure favor whites as a voting bloc even when we're in the minority in absolute terms. Minority voting power is dispersed and usually not a single ethnic bloc. Senators get reelected for decades. Whites are more likely to have a pile of cash to run for Senate on a lark. EtcThe Senate should be more diverse but there are practical, non-nefarious reasons why it isn't.</comment>

<comment>Anticipated future demographics would have no baring the current racial makeup of the Senate.  Especially since whites are currently in the majority in absolute population terms.</comment>

<comment>And the fact of creeping demographics is scaring the tea out of some Americans...</comment>

<comment>I guess you could vote for someone else if ethnic diversity is your only concern.  Still wouldn't matter.  These people will always be unrepresentative due to the background required to get to this point.  That's why not a single one of them gives a sh!t about any of us.  Pick your crook by color if you like, but in the end you still get a crook.</comment>

<comment>When you take a country from nearly 90% White to nearly 60% White in several decades, you encounter these little problems.</comment>

<comment>PC tribal mentality yet again. I guess it's "Tribal Tuesday" at the Atlantic. Identity is important, sure, but substance is even more important. Would a Herman Cain Presidency be hugely beneficial to African-Americans, more than, say, a Bernie Sanders Presidency ? Berman , stop your holier than though bs, and focus on substantive issues, I don't care what colour or creed are Walmart workers, they're getting screwed ,and need help, NOW. I don't care about gender, race or creed in the Senate, i care that they are holding the Country back on Income Inequality, Gun-control, War on Drugs, Reproductive Rights, etc, etc.</comment>

<comment>Sort of like Hollywood!! LOL</comment>

<comment>I'd like to throw in another reason: age. The average US Senator is 62 years old. This puts them born in the mid-1950s when the US was 89.5% white. When you consider this factor, the shocking statistic that 95% of the US Senate is white is less shocking. It is not an excuse or an alternative explanation, but it cannot be ignored.</comment>

<comment>Reporter says institution is too white. Je--- I mean News at 11.</comment>

<comment>Nor only white, but male.  There have only been 44 women in the Senate since the 1700's.  20 now.</comment>

<comment>That is worrying. That's why we wrote more info on the subject here: http://www.northstarnewstoday....</comment>
