<comment>This does not surprise me at all.I used to play pool at a bar that some cops frequented.  I played pool with them on occasion.They joked about people on the force who would assault civilians on the regular.They should have been reporting these people to their superiors and getting them arrested, instead they laughed.</comment>

<comment>Do you know what happens to cops that "snitch" on other cops?http://www.politico.com/magazi...This stuff still happens. It's the "blue wall".</comment>

<comment>I am aware that is an issue that needs to be addressed with prison terms for criminal conspiracy.I would personally love if they started applying RICO laws to police organizations.http://articles.baltimoresun.c...</comment>

<comment>Disgusting.Absolutely disgusting.I hope these guys get near the maximum. Their scum and villainy, which undermines the well-being of society by undoing the legitimacy of proper authority is a damnable offense of the highest order.</comment>

<comment>Everything you said and more - I want to know about the cops who don't beat on suspects but stand by and cover up for those that do.  I have no faith in any police officer because I truly believe that no matter how pure as the driven snow they are in their own conduct - they will always lie, obfuscate the truth or at best, stay silent when it comes to criminal conduct by their fellow officers.  I don't trust any of them.</comment>

<comment>Where are the prosecutions for perjury?  A perjury prosecution is pretty cut and dry, would strike at the core rottenness of the system, and would prevent a crooked cop from working in law enforcement again.</comment>

<comment>1) Prosecutors are on the same "side" as cops.  They work with them every day, they rely on the cop's work to perform their functions.  Cops and prosecutors are work buddies.  Getting a prosecutor to charge a cop is like rolling a boulder up a hill.2) Why do you think the system would want to prevent a crooked cop from working in law enforcement again?  The entire system is set up to give crappy cops piles of second chances.  Cops run the system that trains, vets, hires, and reviews officers.  The entire system is highly insular and *designed* to prevent job loss for everyone involved.People need to realize - the court system (judges, prosecutors) are part and parcel of the same system as cops.  There's zero incentive for anyone to go after dirty cops until something truly heinous is caught on tape and publicized before the evidence gets "corrected".</comment>

<comment>I call on perjury because its legally simpler and harder to justify, and its hard for the prosecutors to NOT justify charging it.  We can argue whether a cop was reasonable in being a little more aggressive, but lying and obstruction is much clearer.</comment>

<comment>Perjury can be pretty hard to prove.  You have to prove that someone knowingly lied - you basically have to prove what someone was *thinking*.It's a tricky charge.  Prosecutors used to taking the easy way out aren't going to use an extra-hard-to-prove charge to go after people they don't want to charge with anything anyway!</comment>

<comment>I've always maintained that asking a prosecutor to charge a cop with anything is tantamount to expecting a drug addict to turn in their dealer for moral reasons.  As you point out, it is an interdependent system and that is why cops are so emboldened to flaunt the laws they are sworn to uphold on an ongoing basis.  They know there is a system in place to cover for them and in the rare instance where the system is obliged to act, the cop can be pretty sure of a slap on the wrist as consequence for his "misbehaviour".I believe that when officers of the law break the law they should be treated to harsher penalties than the average citizen in the same legal circumstance.  After all, they can hardly claim ignorance of the law or the likely outcomes of breaking it.</comment>

<comment>We should be pressing prosecutors on the perjury angle.</comment>

<comment>And even then, they will tell you to not believe your lying eyes.</comment>

<comment>I know of a State cop who shot himself just before he was to testify against other State cops. That's all I know, but no matter what you take away from that, it's sick.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they were fed up with armed drug thugs putting their lives at risk every day, and snapped; their should be a cop equivalent of the black-rage defense.</comment>

<comment>We're all fed up with armed white southern racists in the country who do drugs and promote the KKK</comment>

<comment>Oh?  Tell me about them.</comment>

<comment>Don't need to, Theyve existed for hundreds of years</comment>

<comment>If that's the case, then they're not fit to be law enforcement officers.Moreover, cops already use the "black-rage defense," which as the person who coined the term admits,Getting back to the first point, seriously, a cop who loses control due to not handling job stress needs to be removed from active duty.</comment>

<comment>Obviously, but we can still sympathize with them over sympathizing with the criminal who is the far worse scourge on his community and no doubt had the beating long coming.</comment>

<comment>The mental gymnastics to victim-blame you're doing are astonishing.  Which member of the defense team for these cops were you?</comment>

<comment>Sounds more like one of those "But if he was innocent the cops wouldn't have hit him!" types</comment>

<comment>Don't be silly. Everyone sympathizes with their own. If your son had a criminal record and the police shot him, would you go around saying, "Oh, I'm glad the police got him, that worthless thug. He got what he had coming, and I'm glad?" Of course not.Funny how you don't point a finger at the cops, who sympathize with their own to the point of betraying their oaths of duty.And while we're at it, why is a drug dealer a "scourge on his community?" Any legitimate conservative should acknowledge that a drug dealer is simply filling a demand for a product that, however potentially dangerous, free citizens should have the right to use.We have drug dealers only because there's a War on Drugs, and most drug dealers are only drug dealers because they have no other options.Besides, here's what that drug arrest netted in the form of drugs:Agents seized 147 grams of cocaine, valued at $7,000;815 illegally diverted pharmaceutical drugs of various types, including Oxycodone and Hydrocodone, valued at $21,000;ten (10) grams of marijuana, valued at $100; [plus guns, cash, and cars].For all the noise the cops made, that was a penny-ante haul, not even $30k at full retail price, so stop acting like the guy was an American El Chapo or something.</comment>

<comment>"Any legitimate conservative should acknowledge that a drug dealer is simply filling a demand for a product that, however potentially dangerous, free citizens should have the right to use."You describe a libertarian.  Social conservatives don't want others to have that much free enterprise and individual liberty, they want others to conform to their morality.</comment>

<comment>  Social conservatives don't want others to have that much free enterprise and individual liberty, they want others to conform to their morality.Wanting others to conform to their morality is hardly unique to conservatives.</comment>

<comment>At this point, a neighbourhood drug dealer is probably polling higher numbers than any cops. </comment>

<comment>In a slum, certainly, that is what makes it a slum and why those people live there.</comment>

<comment>You don't get out much. </comment>

<comment>A Capitalist supplier of dried plants is a worst scourge than a group of roving police thugs?  A group of thugs who act as a swarming eating, beating, killing machine?Now go talk to Colorado and Washington about sending in these cops and beating and smashing in the faces of the Legislature there with a 5-1 manpower advantage.  Every one of those Congressmen etc. are drug dealers now.  Also every cent not given to them from the federal government because they make enough from this tax.  Explain that?  I don't care if you are against mary jane, I am against beer and whiskey but I don't beat the hell out of my neighbors and fellow Citizens because of it.I think these cops have a beating coming.  Or what exactly is your concept?  They pass a two week course and they have a "beating" and "killing" permit for life?  Every cop has a license to kill?</comment>

<comment>I couldn't care less about weed, I am talking about the armed criminal class with mile long rap sheets.</comment>

<comment>So you want government agents to have the right to go after you because they've had a bad day.</comment>

<comment>Brutal and disgusting. They should all be charged with aggravated assault. Just beating a helpless person is totally nuts.</comment>

<comment>"What are the odds that this is the first time a cop in that department needlessly brutalized a suspect or allowed a colleague to do so?"Powerball has better odds.</comment>

<comment>Come on second amendmenters, stop this government abuse.  Take your guns and fight these g-men.</comment>

<comment>Just another day in Nazi America.  Good on the sheriff for his swift and decisive action, I wish more superior officers were like him and less like the thugs.</comment>

<comment>Good point.  The Sheriff sounds appropriately disgusted but nowadays even a sensible statement and action by a top Police guy I find to be suspicious.  My bet is always he has a more important agenda (his re-election and protecting his cronys) in his mind than Citizen safety and protection.  This is just the outcome of so many years of police lying and fakery.  The good ones (whom we need immensely) get no respect anymore and that is the shame.The system of electing "cops" is actually quite the issue here as well.  When they win the election, they are mini-hitlers out there with armed thugs (their cops) and the Judges and Lawyers backing them up.  It is just a system seemingly taylor-made for corruption and violent criminal cops.</comment>

<comment>What are those cans that get thrown from the truck as it comes to a stop?</comment>
