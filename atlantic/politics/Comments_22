<comment>Trumps instinct is to win. That's what he's doing here. He doesn't spend any time at all analyzing this stuff. He just does it and it works.</comment>

<comment>Yes, this is because Trump is an opportunist</comment>

<comment>He's MY opportunist.</comment>

<comment>Only til he finds a better opportunity with someone else</comment>

<comment>It's not a marriage. I know that going in. Just deport some illegals, restrict a little  immigration, opt out of a few free trade agreements, and close our bases in Japsn, Germany, and Korea. Then move on to someone new.</comment>

<comment>Just wink at a few beatings, shrug at a few murders, encourage suppression of speech in Trump's vicinity, and then move on to someone even more vile</comment>

<comment>Shrug at a few murders?  Kate Steinle?</comment>

<comment>I doubt many here even know who she is.</comment>

<comment>If anyone reads the news they would know.</comment>

<comment>You're on the Atlantic. Dopes abound</comment>

<comment>Your socialist sophistry will not prevail</comment>

<comment>No, I think most of us understand that she was a young woman killed by an illegal immigrant, whose murderer is now shorthand for over twelve million people in the fervid right-wing imagination.</comment>

<comment>You just HAD to prove wreckinball's point, didn't you cupcake?</comment>

<comment>Seeing as his point was that we "don't even know who she is," you sound really silly right now, muffin.</comment>

<comment>EDITED: Sorry, double post, sweetcheeks.</comment>

<comment>But the reference was addressed to the comment above it, which accused Trump of "shrug[ging] at a few murders."</comment>

<comment>Tcha.</comment>

<comment>I first shrugged because, you know, strawman. But then, charitably, I thought you might not know of the Trumpster's response to the beating of a black person in November? Or his advocating the mass murder of civilians in the Middle East? etc etc</comment>

<comment>A dead women killed by an illegal with a missing federal gun is a strawman?</comment>

<comment>It has nothing to do with the fact that Trump endorses brutality to people who oppose him. And actively vilifies the people brutalized by his supporters.Hence, strawman argument and OT</comment>

<comment>What is this brutality you talk about.</comment>

<comment>You must be confusing Trump with Obama.</comment>

<comment>hahahaha</comment>

<comment>you have trump confused with the Clintons.  Where did they find Libby's body?</comment>

<comment>omg go play with the other trolls</comment>

<comment>only to the low information progressives...you know all of them</comment>

<comment>You really are a sad little Breitbartian, aren´t you?</comment>

<comment>Trump has been running for over six months, he proposed his Muslims ban two months ago, he proposed his crazy deportations plan before that. He's mentioned Steinle at least once. Nothing he's said or done has had any impact on the immigration issue. No one with any power supports Trump's Muslims plan and they never will.Trump's plans will go nowhere. By proposing crazy plans, Trump has guaranteed that Obama will get to push his agenda for another year. Trump could have helped stop Obama's immigration agenda as part of his campaign, but Trump decided to appeal to deranged mouthbreathers instead.Trump is to stopping illegal immigration what Velveeta is to cheese, Dr. Nick is to surgery, and Britney Spears is to singing.How to help stop Trump right now: stumptrump.us</comment>

<comment>I know the left does not care about a dead women at the hands an illegal.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for illustrating why it's so difficult to stop illegal immigration. You're attempting to make opposing it a partisan issue, even though "conservatives" are obviously incapable of doing anything. We need liberals to oppose their leaders over it, instead those like you push liberals into the arms of their leaders.Consider putting your precious pride aside and doing things my way for a change.</comment>

<comment>Sanctuary cities are the way to go huh?  I wish someone would make a sanctuary city to ignore federal gun law.</comment>

<comment>"Sanctuary cities are the way to go huh?"Please sit down, shut up, and let me drive. People like you have been constantly helping Obama for the past eight years. Give it a rest already. Go f up something else.</comment>

<comment>Helping Obama?  Shut up.   You don't have the skills to back the care out of the drive way.</comment>

<comment>Dumb people like you think you know best, but you don't. That's why amnesty continues and Obama has been able to get one item on his agenda after another. People like you have fiercely opposed Obama for eight years, and Obama has consistently won.Smart and sane people would look at that record and realize they were doing things the wrong way. Idiots like you just double down.Everyone else: this is how to stop Obama's immigration agenda right now:24ahead.com/stop-amnesty-chall...Despite hundreds of attempts, I can't get Obama's supposed opponents to help with that. Instead, they just want to keep doing the same stupid things that have consistently helped Obama. Those like "CitizenAusterity" might as well be drawing a check from OFA, if they aren't already.</comment>

<comment>It's not that hard.</comment>

<comment>OK, then tell us your plan. Then, I'll show why it won't work.I have a plan that will work, but those like you are too dumb and deranged to help with it.</comment>

<comment>Here's the plan d*ckweed:IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAINThe three core principles of Donald J. Trump's immigration planWhen politicians talk about “immigration reform” they mean: amnesty, cheap labor and open borders. The Schumer-Rubio immigration bill was nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties.Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first – not wealthy globetrotting donors. We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own. That must change. Here are the three core principles of real immigration reform:1. A nation without borders is not a nation. There must be a wall across the southern border.2. A nation without laws is not a nation. Laws passed in accordance with our Constitutional system of government must be enforced.3. A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation. Any immigration plan must improve jobs, wages and security for all Americans.Make Mexico Pay For The WallFor many years, Mexico’s leaders have been taking advantage of the United States by using illegal immigration to export the crime and poverty in their own country (as well as in other Latin American countries). They have even published pamphlets on how to illegally immigrate to the United States. The costs for the United States have been extraordinary: U.S. taxpayers have been asked to pick up hundreds of billions in healthcare costs, housing costs, education costs, welfare costs, etc. Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011. The effects on jobseekers have also been disastrous, and black Americans have been particularly harmed.The impact in terms of crime has been tragic. In recent weeks, the headlines have been covered with cases of criminals who crossed our border illegally only to go on to commit horrific crimes against Americans. Most recently, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, with a long arrest record, is charged with breaking into a 64 year-old woman’s home, crushing her skull and eye sockets with a hammer, raping her, and murdering her. The Police Chief in Santa Maria says the “blood trail” leads straight to Washington.In 2011, the Government Accountability Office found that there were a shocking 3 million arrests attached to the incarcerated alien population, including tens of thousands of violent beatings, rapes and murders.Meanwhile, Mexico continues to make billions on not only our bad trade deals but also relies heavily on the billions of dollars in remittances sent from illegal immigrants in the United States back to Mexico ($22 billion in 2013 alone).In short, the Mexican government has taken the United States to the cleaners. They are responsible for this problem, and they must help pay to clean it up.The cost of building a permanent border wall pales mightily in comparison to what American taxpayers spend every single year on dealing with the fallout of illegal immigration on their communities, schools and unemployment offices.Mexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards – of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options].  We will not be taken advantage of anymore.Defend The Laws And Constitution Of The United StatesAmerica will only be great as long as America remains a nation of laws that lives according to the Constitution. No one is above the law. The following steps will return to the American people the safety of their laws, which politicians have stolen from them:Triple the number of ICE officers. As the President of the ICE Officers’ Council explained in Congressional testimony: “Only approximately 5,000 officers and agents within ICE perform the lion’s share of ICE’s immigration mission…Compare that to the Los Angeles Police Department at approximately 10,000 officers. Approximately 5,000 officers in ICE cover 50 states, Puerto Rico and Guam, and are attempting to enforce immigration law against 11 million illegal aliens already in the interior of the United States. Since 9-11, the U.S. Border Patrol has tripled in size, while ICE’s immigration enforcement arm, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), has remained at relatively the same size.” This will be funded by accepting the recommendation of the Inspector General for Tax Administration and eliminating tax credit payments to illegal immigrants.Nationwide e-verify. This simple measure will protect jobs for unemployed Americans.Mandatory return of all criminal aliens. The Obama Administration has released 76,000 aliens from its custody with criminal convictions since 2013 alone. All criminal aliens must be returned to their home countries, a process which can be aided by canceling any visas to foreign countries which will not accept their own criminals, and making it a separate and additional crime to commit an offense while here illegally.Detention—not catch-and-release. Illegal aliens apprehended crossing the border must be detained until they are sent home, no more catch-and-release.Defund sanctuary cities. Cut-off federal grants to any city which refuses to cooperate with federal law enforcement.Enhanced penalties for overstaying a visa. Millions of people come to the United States on temporary visas but refuse to leave, without consequence. This is a threat to national security. Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires should be subject to criminal penalties; this will also help give local jurisdictions the power to hold visa overstays until federal authorities arrive. Completion of a visa tracking system – required by law but blocked by lobbyists – will be necessary as well.Cooperate with local gang task forces. ICE officers should accompany local police departments conducting raids of violent street gangs like MS-13 and the 18th street gang, which have terrorized the country. All illegal aliens in gangs should be apprehended and deported. Again, quoting Chris Crane: “ICE Officers and Agents are forced to apply the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Directive, not to children in schools, but to adult inmates in jails. If an illegal-alien inmate simply claims eligibility, ICE is forced to release the alien back into the community. This includes serious criminals who have committed felonies, who have assaulted officers, and who prey on children…ICE officers should be required to place detainers on every illegal alien they encounter in jails and prisons, since these aliens not only violated immigration laws, but then went on to engage in activities that led to their arrest by police; ICE officers should be required to issue Notices to Appear to all illegal aliens with criminal convictions, DUI convictions, or a gang affiliation; ICE should be working with any state or local drug or gang task force that asks for such assistance.”End birthright citizenship. This remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration. By a 2:1 margin, voters say it’s the wrong policy, including Harry Reid who said “no sane country” would give automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants.Put American Workers FirstDecades of disastrous trade deals and immigration policies have destroyed our middle class. Today, nearly 40% of black teenagers are unemployed. Nearly 30% of Hispanic teenagers are unemployed. For black Americans without high school diplomas, the bottom has fallen out: more than 70% were employed in 1960, compared to less than 40% in 2000. Across the economy, the percentage of adults in the labor force has collapsed to a level not experienced in generations. As CBS news wrote in a piece entitled “America’s incredible shrinking middle class”: “If the middle-class is the economic backbone of America, then the country is developing osteoporosis.”The influx of foreign workers holds down salaries, keeps unemployment high, and makes it difficult for poor and working class Americans – including immigrants themselves and their children – to earn a middle class wage. Nearly half of all immigrants and their US-born children currently live in or near poverty, including more than 60 percent of Hispanic immigrants. Every year, we voluntarily admit another 2 million new immigrants, guest workers, refugees, and dependents, growing our existing all-time historic record population of 42 million immigrants. We need to control the admission of new low-earning workers in order to: help wages grow, get teenagers back to work, aid minorities’ rise into the middle class, help schools and communities falling behind, and to ensure our immigrant members of the national family become part of the American dream.Additionally, we need to stop giving legal immigrant visas to people bent on causing us harm. From the 9/11 hijackers, to the Boston Bombers, and many others, our immigration system is being used to attack us. The President of the immigration caseworkers union declared in a statement on ISIS: “We've become the visa clearinghouse for the world.”Here are some additional specific policy proposals for long-term reform:Increase prevailing wage for H-1Bs. We graduate two times more Americans with STEM degrees each year than find STEM jobs, yet as much as two-thirds of entry-level hiring for IT jobs is accomplished through the H-1B program. More than half of H-1B visas are issued for the program's lowest allowable wage level, and more than eighty percent for its bottom two. Raising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg’s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.Requirement to hire American workers first. Too many visas, like the H-1B, have no such requirement. In the year 2015, with 92 million Americans outside the workforce and incomes collapsing, we need companies to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed. Petitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not USCIS.End welfare abuse. Applicants for entry to the United States should be required to certify that they can pay for their own housing, healthcare and other needs before coming to the U.S.Jobs program for inner city youth. The J-1 visa jobs program for foreign youth will be terminated and replaced with a resume bank for inner city youth provided to all corporate subscribers to the J-1 visa program.Refugee program for American children. Increase standards for the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers to crack down on abuses. Use the monies saved on expensive refugee programs to help place American children without parents in safer homes and communities, and to improve community safety in high crime neighborhoods in the United States.Immigration moderation. Before any new green cards are issued to foreign workers abroad, there will be a pause where employers will have to hire from the domestic pool of unemployed immigrant and native workers. This will help reverse women's plummeting workplace participation rate, grow wages, and allow record immigration levels to subside to more moderate historical averages.</comment>

<comment>Do you work for Hillary or America's Voice or something similar?I've already explained in great detail that Trump's grand plans will not work. They're completely unrealistic:24ahead.com/s/donald-trumpTrump could have come up with smart, realistic plans that would have helped stop Obama's immigration agenda right now. Instead, he proposed fantasy plans that make those like you happy but will never happen.</comment>

<comment>Who the F are you?</comment>

<comment>Thank you again for illustrating my point that conservatives - or OFA employees that play them on the internet - have no integrity, no ethics, no morals, no nothing. Completely dumb and worthless people, they live only to help Obama and Hillary.For everyone else, even a five second glance at my site will show that I've been opposing mass/illegal immigration over thousands of posts since 2002. Conservatives could have helped me with that and we would have stopped Obama's agenda. Their lack of mental abilities and their intense emotional issues have prevented them from doing that. Helping Obama and Hillary is all they know how to do.</comment>

<comment>it is not hard to stop it. End the welfare state and put the military on the border with orders shoot to kill the invaders. Problem solved</comment>

<comment>I'd point out those are wishes not plans, if only your "orders to shoot" didn't give the game away.</comment>

<comment>You beer-drunk fifteen year-olds are adorable.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, clown.</comment>

<comment>Just let the US lose its status of global superpower?</comment>

<comment>Obama has deported more "illegals" than any other Presiedent. Of course that doesn't matter to the xenophobes because it's never been about actual immigration policy.And if ANY Democrat ever suggested closing a military base you'd accuse them of hating America. </comment>

<comment>http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&...There you go sweetheart, and not just anydem/socialist/lib/prog/islamic, but THE dumbazz himself.  We already know he hates America, so it's not an accusation.</comment>

<comment>That's not true at all. Obama's deportations are all smoke and mirrors. What his Administration did was change how they count deportations. Now someone who is stopped at the border and never allowed entry is considered a "deportation."</comment>

<comment>Wrong. https://newrepublic.com/articl...The policy you're talking about started under Bush and the Right loved it then.Besides, you still haven't addressed how radically limiting immigration like they tried in Japan will sharing the economy and cause many vital industries to collapse. There's a reason even Japan has upped its immigration numbers in recent years</comment>

<comment>Trump wants Smoot-Hawley style tariffs that will result in another Great Depression. Google Smoot Hawley if you don't know what it is, but it helped a recession turn into a depression.

<comment>The term “cognitive consistency" is the bedrock of the progressive belief system</comment>

<comment>Care to expand on that a bit?</comment>

<comment>Let me find my crayons.  That's all you understand.</comment>

<comment>This is a weird tactic I keep seeing people use.Make an unspecific but negative comment about whoever you deem to be The Other. Once people ask you to clarify, refuse to answer, but imply that it's so obvious that you'd be stupid not to agree.It's ingenious, I'll give you that.</comment>

<comment>Trump style rhetoric.It's like an intelligent debate, but where all of the intelligent parts are replaced with variants of "f**k you!"</comment>

<comment>What do you want me to clarify.</comment>

<comment>I'm not S0mePers0n, but if I had to guess, I'd suppose it's why you've decided that a concept applicable to everyone is somehow at the heart of only a third of the population's politics, and apparently has nothing to do with the pure light of reason that you seem to imagine as the source of another third's politics.</comment>

<comment>Progressives never have facts on their side.</comment>

<comment>I envy some folks' easy mental life, where one can tell what is and what is not factual on the basis of who says something.  I find life more complicated - sometimes people are right for wrong reasons, or wrong for good reasons, or unexpectedly right or wrong on a particular issue.  Thinking in absolutes really does seem a lot simpler for some people, though.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you toss about a fact, and we can debate it.</comment>

<comment>I'm here a bunch, I'm sure you'll get a chance to chime in eventually.  Best of luck!</comment>

<comment>Indeed.To paraphrase JFK - “The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie--deliberate, contrived and dishonest--but the myth--persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.  We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.“</comment>

<comment>I think those things are closer together than JFK suggested. Propaganda covers both. Trump can do both. Hard to keep up over time. You need the message discipline of Josef Goebbels to be a really good liar over a long period.</comment>

<comment>>I envy some folks' easy mental life, where one can tell what is and what is not factual on the basis of who says something.Right?!  Man.  That would take all the guesswork outta living.  Too bad I'm not smart enough to know which political positions / religions / races / preferred breakfast meats indicate that someone is either a genius or abjectly ignorant.</comment>

<comment>You'd think someone with that power would avoid discussion boards like this one.  I mean, if you already know that you're always correct, and that your adversaries are too incompetent and/or evil to understand your righteousness, what's the appeal of conversation?</comment>

<comment>to make fun of low IQ dumb progs like you.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that totally sounds like something that a bunch of political geniuses would spend their time doing.</comment>

<comment>"The term “cognitive consistency" is the bedrock of the progressive belief system"</comment>

<comment>It true. All your polices fail.</comment>

<comment>Your Trotskyist posturings will not assure your place in history.</comment>

<comment>Not to sound like I'm bragging or anything, but I get into a lot of fights online. I've concluded that this tactic is always, always used by someone whose real goal is to reassure themselves of how good/smart/moral they are.</comment>

<comment>We learned it reading lib/socialist rebuttals.  We thought this way, at least you'd understand what we thought of your opinions.</comment>

<comment>It's the "playing chess with a pigeon" scenario. Usually ends with "thanks for proving my point for me"</comment>

<comment>Well, no one likes to admit that their "facts" were actually extracted from their hind quarters.</comment>

<comment>Also childish</comment>

<comment>Here, I have some chalk!</comment>

<comment>I understand joined-up handwriting.

<comment>Nice try, sad little clown.Sorry to hurt your feelings, but Trump is toast. Better get used to saying "Madam President".</comment>

<comment>I confess, I don't know what the point is of saying something like this.  It doesn't make what Harvey Max or his quote said untrue or less true.</comment>

<comment>Don´t get him confused. He´ll have a stroke.</comment>

<comment>Promise?</comment>

<comment>I find your "cognitive consistency" dissonant.</comment>

<comment>That does not change the fact you are dumb.</comment>

<comment>Seriously, is that the best you've got?It kills me that when I read comment sections like this, the cons can never muster up any kind of actual argument and instead rely on playground insults of the kind that most people grow out of by the age of 14.I mean, come on.  You made a strange blanket statement about liberals without explaining what you meant or supporting your statement in any way, and when called out on it your response is basically "if you don't know you're stupid."  Which transparently means that you can't explain what you mean because you lack clue one on what you are talking about.This is ironic on a number of levels.  The greatest irony being that by being unable to come up with an appropriate response and resorting to childish dialog you show us who really is, in fact, not so smart.BTW, the guy you're calling "dumb" was referencing cognitive dissonance, and I seriously doubt that you even know what that is.  Which also means that you are oblivious to what he's saying about you.  There is so much fail in what you are trying to do here.</comment>

<comment>Let me see you make one smart post.</comment>

<comment>It has become pretty clear that the only smart, logical, reasoned... post you would acknowledge as such would be something repeated from the big box of Bircher talking points.  Nothing to see here.</comment>

<comment>You can't make a logical, reasoned, post.</comment>

<comment>I know, I am from the wrong tribe, therefore nothing I say can be logical.  Is it comforting or horrifying to live that way?</comment>

<comment>In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. If horror is in the eye of the beholder, then. . . . </comment>

<comment>One fact does not make truth</comment>

<comment>let me see you make one smart post.</comment>

<comment>Your lack of perspicacity is its own indictment. </comment>

<comment>Ah, you're not going to include loser too? Just one insult? Feeling a little under the weather, are we?</comment>

<comment>Yes, you are a loser.</comment>

<comment>"Cognitive Chaos."</comment>

<comment>Sorry to disagree.  Cogniphobia is the bedrock of the progressive beliefsystem.  </comment>

<comment>What the hell is a "Progressive?" Some 'newspeak' for what we used to call liberals?  Can't keep up with the Newspeak dictionaries here.</comment>

<comment>Have no fear, it is a two step process to wean them from a Republican party that has been reaming them up the back way for the past 35 years.  Jumping to a Hilary would be way too much cognitive dissonance at this point, but they will listen when a Trump explains how they have been getting screwed over by the Republican establishment.  It will eventually transpire that Trump is a lot of hot air, but the coalition will be broken.</comment>

<comment>Happened in 2008 with Obama.  After everything negative about Obama (his lack of experience in just about everything, his corruption, etc) was brought to light they still voted for him simply because it was time for "The First Black President Ever".  Come 2012 it was because Mitt Romney is rich and therefore evil and something about a war on women, so vote Obama!  Heh.Its going into overdrive now between Clinton and Sanders.  I mean, how else can you explain a good portion of the democrats who back Clinton (super delegates or otherwise)?  Can any other candidate for the Presidential Nomination claim to be under FBI investigation for 3 separate incidents at the same time?  Oh but she's a woman and she's so experienced just look at her tenure as Secretary of State... she was Secretary of State!  She cares about the blacks, the immigrants, the LGBTQs, she's a lethal mix of wit and charm and all of those accusations regarding her e-mails are nothing more then a Republican conspiracy.Or what about Sanders?  Oh he's an outsider they claim.  Yeah, some outsider whose been a career politician since he ascended to his current position some 30 years ago.  His economic policies just make sense they claim, they just work (which is why Vermont has enacted all of them, right?).  Or he was a civil rights activist and got arrested 50 years ago, wow he's so amazing!  Heh.  Feel the Bern because he wants to reinstitute Glass Stegal (of which everyone is now an expert on, curiously enough).I'm getting too lazy to go on, but I hope you get the point.</comment>

<comment>You forget Mitt's disdain for the 47%, methinks.</comment>

<comment>prog article needs to replace Trump with Hillapottomus.</comment>

<comment>It has its limits. I'd be interested to see what would happen if he got up at rallies saying (as he has in the past) that he is "absolutely pro-choice." Abortion is anathema to the right wing participants. What happens? Do they come up with a theory that he knows something they don't or do people just deny it? In WW II Germany, when people heard of atrocities, their reaction was the the Furhrer would not do that. Yes, I think Hitler comparisons are fair at this point.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but has Trump hit the upper limit of his support? Can he get over 35-40% If he can't, can he win?I wonder.</comment>

<comment>I think that Trump is a lose-lose for the Republicans. If he goes up against Clinton in the general, he will lose. If the RNC manages to turn things against him and he doesn´t get the nomination, being the thin-skinned, childish, spiteful jackass that he is he just might decide to run as an independent and take a large chunk of the Conservative base with him.</comment>

<comment>spiteful jackass, phew for a minute there I thought you were talking about Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Nope. That was in reference to the Clown Messiah. He of the Yellow Skull Rug. The Reality TV King. The Baron of Bankruptsy.</comment>

<comment>Not a Trump guy. Just humorous the similarities to Hillary. You're quite the cult follower aren't you?</comment>

<comment>Please cite a single time Hillary has threatened to run as an independent, which Trump has done multiple times.</comment>

<comment>I think the latter scenario hurts the GOP less.  If he runs as our nominee, the party will forever be associated with embracing his stupidity.  If he runs independent, at least we can say we rejected him.</comment>

<comment>Either way, it would cause a shake-up in the Republican party. Trump is the embodiment of what happens when the nutters, who were welcomed in as part of the Big Tent strategy, start taking over.</comment>

<comment>What if Sanders wins, and Trump loses, and Cruz wins in the primaries. Does Trump jump in as an independent? Does Bloomberg jump in too? Could be interesting! Maybe Lyndon LaRouche,  Stephen Colbert, and Oprah will jump in too!</comment>

<comment>Original reply got censored because I wrote what Trump actually said. Note to censors: Profanity isn't the threat. Regardless I change F, S, S and P.Taking your post seriously for the sake of discussion, I'm pretty confident that Trump would not make a real run as an Independent for financial reasons. Mike Bloomberg might run if Cruz and Sanders are the candidates, and if he did he could and probably would spend hundreds of millions, perhaps a billion, of his own money. Trump would never spend that much of his money and couldn't. He's not that liquid; 3 billion dollars of his supposed net worth for his brand translates into zero actual cash dollars.If he did run just for spite, that would last as long as he could draw a crowd that didn't coast him real money. And sleazy sensationalism only goes so far. After $hit, schl0ng, pu$$y and fuhk what else is there for him to say on the record on the stump? And over the top positions? What shocks at this point? Abolish the Fed? Nope. Gold standard? Nope. Nuke the Iranians? Really? Time to put this one trick pony out to pasture, or better yet to the pet food factory.In any case, who do you think Trump would hurt more in a Sanders-Cruz-Bloomberg matchup? IMO I don't think it makes any clear difference one way or the other if he runs or not. But I do agree with you that it would be interesting.PS Colbert and Oprah would make interesting candidates. Lyndon LaRouche not so much.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, he can.  In New Hampshire, the establishment candidates together had him beat by more than 10% and yet he walked away with all the delegates and they got nothing.  Now if one of them pulled away from the pack, everyone would gather around that person.  But no one has, so the votes continue to get divided and Trump can continue to grab all the delegates while the majority of Republicans are against him.  Eventually, Republicans may start looking at the establishment candidates as inherently weak and unable therefore to win the presidency.  More and more they may stat seeing him as the least evil and reluctantly get on board.  Similar type of workings can actually see him all the way to the Presidency with even the majority of Americans against him.  Granted, this isn't a done deal yet.  But it is definitely a possible outcome.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a great performer. He reads a crowd well and dances to their music. He is laser focused on polls and driven by them. His is also rude, crude, arrogant, condescending and dismissive... just right for a 'realty' show that today's politics too often mimics. He is far from stupid but more sharp or wiley than smart. And he has no ethical or moral core; a gonif rather than a mensch. Interestingly his policy positions stripped of profanity, silliness and hyperbole are some reasonable combination of populist and centrist. But bottom line this narcissist is not trustworthy. This article correctly points out that no one should doubt the likelihood that Trump would change any position if it seemed advantageous while vociferously denying he had done so. Who are you going to believe Trump or his lying words?</comment>

<comment>He is a master of self-promotion - always has been - and very little else.As to his policy ideas, they all seem to consist of nothing more than one-liners and rehashed conservative slogans. I don´t see any substance in the man.</comment>

<comment>Enforcing existing immigration laws is not really conservative and building a wall was something even Clinton used to support (or claimed to anyway).  There are liberals who want open borders but there are many liberals who do not.   67% of Americans are in step with Trump on jihadi exclusion.</comment>

<comment>I'm against letting jihadis in the country but I'm pro allowing Syrian refugees and Muslims in general in. Which is the question they asked to get 67%?</comment>

<comment>67% were opposed to letting in Syrian refugees.  Even if you just strictly vet people based on their religion, it is a form of discrimination.  Republicans will always be branded as bigots and racists by the liberal media.  Trump has explained his position in more detail numerous times but of course the media will never acknowledge that.  The "white people are racist" line is too irresistible.  Left-wing Bill Maher (to his liberal audience) says (and they cheer for) anti-Muslim rhetoric every Friday night going on two decades now.   Trump says nothing like what Maher says about Muslims. No one is being fooled by this line of attack</comment>

<comment>Do you realize this is exactly the kind of thing they're talking about? I asked a very specific question about disingenuous phrasing ("jihadis") and you come back complaining about the media because a criticism of you is as good as a criticism of Trump and vice versa, and the sun doesn't come up in the Iggyverse until you're both being victimized.</comment>

<comment>You and the media are the ones being disingenuous.  And, you are race baiting (even though Islam is not a race).</comment>

<comment>There you go again.</comment>

<comment>BTW, this is the last time I am responding to you. You have race-baited and argued in bad faith enough.</comment>

<comment>That´s strange. Harvey never said anything about race. You brought up race in a half-assed attempt at evasion.</comment>

<comment>The law is to get in you must apply for a visa and you must have a reason to be here, e.g. school or work.Just follow the law</comment>

<comment>The ones with the best interest in skirting those rules are big business and the rich. And then every citizen who had either hired a cleaning lady, stayed at a hotel, eaten at a restaurant, bought fruit, entered a building made in the last few decades..,</comment>

<comment>True. And that is what kills the substandard wages-based argument that some people use. Legalizing people who have been here for a certain time means that they can no longer work for half (or less) of what a legal resident or citizen makes by law. There´s also the matter of having to pay taxes, just like everyone else.</comment>

<comment>They do pay taxes. Sales tax. And property tax. Even if they rent the cost of property tax is passed onto them. Etc. </comment>

<comment>Many also pay payroll taxes using someone else's SSN.</comment>

<comment>The ones who are against supporting immigration laws are big business, aka the GOP (well it's bipartisan technically). Because much of the economic growth in general depends on increasing the population generally and it's big business that depends on undocumented workers they don't have to pay fair wages, provide benefits to, or have safety standards for. Trump himself has benefitted hugely from this population, since he owns resorts.Until the GOP actually addresses this contradiction, their so-called anti immigration stance is just racism. </comment>

<comment>You started off OK.  Sure, the elites are the ones who want the cheap slave labor.  They want to enslave the illegals with impunity.  At the same time they get the added benefits of posing as humanitarians who can wag their fingers at the common workers who pay the price in terms of suppressed wages and a deteriorating community.  At the end, like a good liberal, you played the race card.  Thanks.  I actually WANT you to keep doing this.  It raises awareness to this disgusting aspect of liberalism.</comment>

<comment>We enforce the immigration laws.There are no laws where we catch and prosecute 100% of perps.  That's the nature of limited resources and opportunity costs.If you want to apply your logic to other laws, we'd have to say that all of the candidates are pro-shoplifting, because they're not yacking endlessly about shoplifting and willing to spend insane resources finding and prosecuting every single shoplifter.  Did you know that shoplifters are caught only 1 out of 48 times, and handed over to the police only half of that time.  http://www.shopliftingpreventi....  Even among that tiny group, many are never prosecuted.   WHY IS TRUMP PRO-SHOPLIFTING?</comment>

<comment>This is a good argument.  I agree with you.  I just do not believe many liberals want to actually enforce the immigration laws.  A great many really do want open borders.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with someone holding this position.  I just fundamentally disagree with it.  I agree many liberals do not want open borders, but if they are not interested in really taking action to do something about it, then it amounts to tacit support.  This is one issue where positive action is required.  Closing the border and cracking down on businesses that hire illegal immigrants is not a difficult thing to do.  It just requires the political will.  The people want this, we just need the right people in office.</comment>

<comment>But these "exit polls" leave little alternative to the conclusion that public tolerance of uncontrolled immigration is rapidly eroding.  Even if Trump falls by the wayside, that reality will remain.The catchphrase "comprehensive immigration reform" has fallen into disfavor.  Everyone knows what is meant by it:  Border security will be held hostage until a path to voting the straight Democratic ticket is created for the "undocumented" already here.  Despite extraordinary levels of Black unemployment, Blacks make no complaint about the jobs being hoovered up by migrants, because of Democratic support for welfare programs.  They even dream of "reparations."   Here we see the Big Red Vote Harvesting Combine at work.  Conflicts do not clog its gears.Now Obama promises to bring multitudes of Middle Eastern Muslims here.  The recent orgy of lewd and violent sexual misconduct visited on the women of Germany by Muslim males will make it very difficult for my "progressive" brethren to "sell" this program to the broader public.  Not to put too fine a point on it, they have more than Trump to be concerned about.</comment>

<comment>You are right, everyone knows what this means. The catchphrase "comprehensive immigration reform" is code for amnesty, and opening up the floodgates.</comment>

<comment>Must...warn...others...</comment>

<comment>Um, not really because "everyone knows"</comment>

<comment>Really, we just want to annex Mexico.</comment>

<comment>So no one remembers how for all of the 2000s we were told that Latinos were natural Republicans. How happy the GOP was when Sandoval and Martinez ( and Haley and Jindal) became governors?Or how welfare was slashed under Clinton and Obama has never done anything to restore it? Or how the people who get the most from the government are retirees, the military and the red states? </comment>

<comment>Still amazes me His two statements are absolutely correct.The illegal alien business is totally run by the Mexican gangs. They run people and drugs. DUHBlocking Muslims is a matter of national security. Its obvious. Were we letting Nazis in during WWII</comment>

<comment>Yes Nazis were allowed in   before the war started and the US turned away Jewish refugees (http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/ar...</comment>

<comment>And don´t forget what happened after the war. Plenty of Nazis secretly got in with the blessing of the U.S. gov, as long as they were of some use. I believe it was known as Operation Paperclip.</comment>

<comment>what has that got to do with muslimes ?why doesn't israel take them in ?????</comment>

<comment>why don't you move to Syria - where you BELONGI owe them NOTHING.  You have nothing to say - so YOU can pay for them.You pay for their expenses, and spending money, and housing and doctor bills and YOU can put up with the criminality.</comment>

<comment>> The illegal alien business is totally run by the Mexican gangs. They run people and drugs. DUHDUH not really. Illegal drug trafficking within the US borders is mostly done by our very own gangs.> Blocking Muslims is a matter of national security. Its obvious.Not obvious to me.</comment>

<comment>So we just ignore the large scale drug trafficking on the southern border by the Mexican gangs? DumbIts not obvious to block those who wish to harm us from entering the country? DumberCare to try for dumbest?</comment>

<comment>> So we just ignore the large scale drug trafficking on the southern border by the Mexican gangs? DumbHow about we resolve the gang problem within our borders first? Or what, is that concept too novelty for you?> Its not obvious to block those who wish to harm us from entering the country? DumberIt's not obvious that those who wish to enter the country are the ones who wish to harm us. Seems like so far, our own home-grown nutjobs with guns are much more dangerous.</comment>

<comment>I'm curious to know why so many people in the USA need to take all those drugs.Is it really so horrible that you have to be whacked off your face to make it tolerable?</comment>

<comment>In reality, the US drugs consumption is not high, in comparison with, say, France, UK and Iran:http://www.therichest.com/rich...So... Is it really so horrible there that they have to be whacked off their face to make it tolerable?:)</comment>

<comment>i suppose the defensive outburst boils down to a "yes", then.</comment>

<comment>You're equating over 1.6 billion people, from dozens of countries, to ISIS. Do you not see how messed up that is?That would be like saying that every German citizen (or person of Germany descent) is also a Nazi by definition.</comment>

<comment>we don't need to import the muslimeslet them stew in their own juices over there</comment>

<comment>You're probably conflating nationality, ethnicity, and religious ideology.  Every German was not someone that claimed to believe in Nazi ideas.  Every Muslim does claim a belief in the Quran, which in parts is very consistent with what ISIS supports.   Claiming to be a Quran follower is not an innocent claim.  It's support for a book that promotes quite a bit of violence and intolerance, more so than any other major religious text.  Almost all Muslims are mainly in it by birth or socially/culturally, and so are not really followers of the more violent aspects, but you can't trivialize the significance of how problematic the ideology is.</comment>

<comment>Those 1.6 billion people widely support a huge variety of ideas that are being implemented by ISIS right now as we speak.Killing people for homosexuality?  That's in the hudood, it's unanimously agreed upon by the four largest Sunni schools of jurisprudence, the authority for 90% of those 1.6 billion.Killing people for apostasy?  Same exact thing - unanimously agreed upon by the people who claim they're nothing like ISIS.  Adultery?  Same thing.I think the Nazi parallel is not useful because religious ideology and political / nationalist ideology operate according to different principles.  Islam in and of itself is a very dangerous ideology, and the ideas that ISIS actually puts into practice are included in mainstream, accepted Islamic law.</comment>

<comment>The relevant question isn't about letting in Nazis (although homegrown fascism was quite popular among nativeborns) but letting in Germans. Which they did. In huge numbers. And almost none of them were Nazi sympathizers or more anti Semitic than the general population. And now Germans are considered unhyphenated Americans.I leave you to draw your own conclusions. </comment>

<comment>Also humorous.Being for Bernie, a socialist nut job is somehow sane? Yet being for Trump is nuts , sure thing.And is there anything more ridiculous than Hillary supporters. One just said any woman who doesn't vote for Hillary should go to hell. And Hillary laughed and applauded and so did the crowd.Now that's really nuts</comment>

<comment>The scariest part of all is that  Trump's followers are so gullible and believe that he is the man that can restore the US.The sad thing is that most of the people who support Trump are not well educated and have themselves suffered from the decline of middle class opportunities disproportionately. Look at the statistics for the percentage of post-secondary  educational attainment from the Trump base and other statistics, such as the number of grammatical mistakes.I hate to say it, but the numbers show that Trump has a base of people who are not well educated and gullible. I do not mean to disparage people without a university degree, but I do want to draw attention to the demographic that supports Trump.They support him because of the xenophobic ideology that he peddles. They also support him out of despair, because of how much the Establishment has failed the American people.They are in for a rude awakening. Trump has no miracle solutions for the problems that Americans face and will make things worse. Once again, the Republican base will be played for fools. I just hope that we get a Bernie Sanders win so that we won't have to learn this one the hard way. </comment>

<comment>Are you voting for Hillary or are you going to hell?I mean that rhetoric is not scary at all.</comment>

<comment>i hate to say it but your drivel reveals your lack of education.</comment>

<comment>Hillary and Bernie seem to be almost one now. The difference is that Bernie sincerely believes in his flawed ideas. Hillary believes in anything that will get her elected which right now is being Bernie light, maybe?, who can tell. She will remind you daily that she is a woman and a grandma and what the heck else is there? right?The basic premise that all we need is Bernie-Hillary deciding who to extract additional $$s from the private sector will resurrect the economy and promote economic growth is what's truly scary.The supporters of that theory are the nut jobs.</comment>

<comment>You seem confused about the topic of this article.</comment>

<comment>Being male will I escape hell if I don't vote for Hillary? Its unclear. Maybe just purgatory.</comment>

<comment>Here on the Atlantic racial, gender identity and supposed social justice is all that matters.I mean they support two candidates who actually think that more taxation will promote economic growth. Not too smart.</comment>

<comment>Taxes (and the use thereof) promoting economic growth is something widely proven across many different nations, and is covered in many different schools of capitalismFor example, in Keynesian - which was the dominant philosophy during the post-war period up until the 80s or so.</comment>

<comment>Keynesianism dominated U.S. Economic policy until pissing on your head theory took its place around the late seventies. That time corresponds almost exactly with the stagnation in median wages. Bush 1 had it right when he called it Voodoo economics. He should have listened to himself.</comment>

<comment>You believe that immigration will literally destroy your country, but at the same time you do not believe immigration to be a social issue?</comment>

<comment>mostly a MONEY issue - or  undocumented democrat voter issue</comment>

<comment>Most of Trump is anathema to those of us conservatives who are still in possession of a functioning brain and one dose of realism. Even if he signed off on every single personal conviction I hold, I couldn't respect or trust him.</comment>

<comment>You sound like a Hillary conservative.</comment>

<comment>He's crass, rude, and has a history of supporting positions that most any conservative strongly opposes. What am I supposed to like about him? That he's a "dealmaker" who shorts business partners? A "winner" who runs casinos to bankruptcy for his own gain? A "self-made man" who started from daddy's fortune? A "man of the people" who likes eminent domain at the people's expense?If my choice is between him and Hillary, I'm doing a write-in.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, sure - just talk about casinos and ignore the fact that he was the first to give a voice to Americans who don't want to be flooded with Muslim "refugees" who support terrorism and oppose American values.2/3rds of Republicans support the Trump position on that- according to exit polls.  Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Actually, seeing as this is a democracy, I think that I'll express my opinion and supporting evidences as loudly and as often as I'd like. I strongly believe that people supporting Trump are in the wrong, and I'll freely share the many points that buttress that argument with both frequency and gusto. I won't be muzzled by a bellicose billionaire and the many people happily dancing in his wake. Thanks, though.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is telling you not to speak your mind. By contrast, your Wall Street puppet candidate, HRC,  is blackmailing the press into printing her propagandahttp://gawker.com/this-is-how-...</comment>

<comment>I really like that false dichotomy that because I think Trump is unqualified and boorish, I'm somehow for one of the few people in the race that's less trustworthy than him.</comment>

<comment>2/3rds of Republicans support the Trump position on that- according to exit polls.  Deal with it.And somewhere between 26-29% of voters identify as Republicans, so I'm not quite sure why the rest of us should really care what 16-18% of the electorate thinks on this issue.Add in independents and Democrats who are equally silly, and you're looking at maybe a quarter of the electorate.  You know, about the same number of people who believe in ghosts and angels.  I fail to see why, in a democracy, giving credence to the plainly ridiculous notion that 1.6 billion Muslims are "supporting terrorism" and "oppose American values" should be a priority.</comment>

<comment>You are a plainly ridiculous and ignorant idiot since you fail to understand the simple fact that the (liberal) Pew Research Polls back up the fact that Muslims want Shariah Law and not the US Constitution.You must be ignorant of American values such as free speech - since the Muslims who you want to come in the country want none of that, except for themselves.</comment>

<comment>You are a plainly ridiculous and ignorant idiot since you fail to understand the simple fact that the (liberal) Pew Research Polls back up the fact that Muslims want Shariah Law and not the US Constitution.http://www.pewforum.org/2013/0...The survey you're referencing makes you look really dumb for talking about "Muslims" instead of "Many Muslims, to varying degrees and in different countries."  Then again, nobody's expecting anything other than the simplest of thought from a Trumpist.  I'm sure you think that we should keep out folks like the Turks and Lebanese on the basis of what (most, not all) Pakistanis and Saudis think.  Then again, like I said, why should our policy reflect the idiot views of a quarter of voters?You must be ignorant of American values such as free speech - since the Muslims who you want to come in the country want none of that, except for themselves.Translation: "Why would I bother to actually talk to American Muslims about their political beliefs, when I have the right-wing media to do my thinking and inquiry for me?"What's next, are you going to cite the CSP online opt-in survey of 600 people as proof of creeping Sharia?  Go home, spud, you're drunk.</comment>

<comment>You are not bright enough to understand that the opinions of Pakistanis matter more than the opinions of Turks because the number of Pakistani immigrants dwarf the number of Turkish immigrants.You are a f*cking tool.</comment>

<comment>It's funny you should say that, because your preferred TV star...sorry, serious presidential candidate is not suggesting that we differentiate between immigrants from different countries, preferring instead to just ban "Muslims," a call that his supporters (like yourself) have rallied behind.It's at least nice to see that you've become capable of drawing at least some distinctions between different groups of foreigners, and I look forward to you correcting the next "BAN ALL MUSLIMZ" Trumpist with, "Well, maybe we could give the Turkish, Lebanese, Eastern European, Central Asian Muslims a pass."</comment>

<comment>Again showing your ignorance. First of all - did you think that I was unaware that Lebanon differs from the other countries in having a significant Christian population, to dilute the results of any survey on subjects such as support for suicide bombing?Even with this factor, Pew still found tolerance for suicide bombing at 82 % in Lebanon in 2002.</comment>

<comment>Again showing your ignorance. First of all - did you think that I was unaware that Lebanon differs from the other countries in having a significant Christian population, to dilute the results of any survey on subjects such as support for suicide bombing?Except that the survey clearly states that it was a survey of Muslims.  You've got a lot of chutzpah calling someone out for ignorance when you obviously don't understand a simple caption explaining a basic methodological fact of a survey you referenced.Even with this factor, Pew still found tolerance for suicide bombing at 82 % in Lebanon in 2002.Oh, OK.  I'll take your un-cited figure from 2002 over an actual document we can both read from 2013.</comment>

<comment>That was in small print.More importantly, the American people is no longer going to tolerate assurances from progressives like YOU that unlimited, unvetted Muslim immigration is to be allowed without question.Whether the exact number who support suicide bombing fluctuates up or down a bit year to year does not matter. It is unacceptable. PERIOD.Even more important is their preference for Shariah law- which cannot co-exist with the US Constitution.</comment>

<comment>That was in small print.Ah, so now you're just straight-up lying, because the phrase "% of Muslims who favor making sharia the official law in their country" is larger than any other text in the chart except for the title, and appears directly under the title, not at the bottom with the small print.You don't need to explain that you have a very simple understanding of the world's Muslims as monolithic in thought and behavior, and believe that it is perfectly acceptable to discriminate against people on the basis of religion.  Indeed, that's the lazy bigotry for which I'm calling you out.  I get it, you don't have any personal or professional relationships with any American Muslims who could correct your ignorance, and probably would just repeatedly think "Stop with the taqiyya, you devil!" the whole time one might speak with you.But if you can't be bothered to read simple English on something that you yourself are citing and then must resort to lying about your failure - or perhaps inability - to read, I'm done here.  See you next time you post something really plainly stupid...say, tomorrow morning?</comment>

<comment>1. No,  -you are looking at something different.  The chart is right here and is consistent with my comment. It has the caption in small print.http://www.pewglobal.org/2006/...2. I probably know more Muslims than you do.</comment>

<comment>1.  In response to your claim that "Muslims want Sharia law," I posted the 2013 Pew survey expressing the attitudes of the world's Muslims toward Sharia law, that you then tried to undermine without even bothering to read.My apologies for not psychically divining that you were referring to the study you're just now linking...which shows that a large majority of Muslims outside of the most war-torn Middle Eastern countries say violence against civilian targets is never justified (Table 1.)  Which is weird, because I'm repeatedly assured by Internet paranoids like yourself that all Muslims support terrorism and violent extremism against non-Muslims.2.  Oh, bullsh*t.  And if you're not just being full of it, you must have some real cognitive dissonance going on, unless you carry a weapon at all times and are constantly ready for one of them to attack you.  After all, you spend a lot of time on here acting as though all Muslims are a threat to you, to the point that you endorse a bigoted and counterproductive idea like applying a religious test to immigrants.</comment>

<comment>http://www.pewresearch.org/fac...The fact is that large majorities of Muslim-majority countries that typically send immigrants to the USA want Shariah law at between 50 to 100 percent :Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Iraq, Palestine, Morocco, Egypt,Jordan, Malaysia, most of the African Countries.Shariah Law is incompatible with Western values and the US Constitution.The more of them you let into the country, the more cartoonists who offend them will have have to go into the witness protection program.  The more Fort Hood, San Bernadino and Times Square bomber incidents will occur.The more Americans will lose their freedom to free expression.If you are not concerned - you are simply a fool.</comment>

<comment>First off, you're building an argument for restricting immigration from certain countries, not a particular religion.  Except that's not what you or your preferred candidate are advocating.Second, you're ignoring the fact that most Muslim immigrants don't want the U.S. to resemble their homelands, which you'd know if you read more about American Muslims and maybe even talked with some about this country.Third, and this is key: If even five percent of the Muslims in America were the caricatures that you tar one hundred percent of them with, we wouldn't be talking about any of this in the future tense, but in the present.  There should be a lesson for you in this somewhere.</comment>

<comment>If there is every any doubt or question - the public is OK with resolving it by having less immigration especially from those countries.   Having fewer Muslims will be a nice side effect.What you do not understand is that most Muslims have no sense of logic.They will tell you that they don't want the US to resemble their homeland, but once they get to a Western country - they start doing the only things that they know how to do - Islamically cultural things like burn cars, threaten cartoonists, attack synagogues and sexually assault thousands ofwomen. Oh, and also support Shariah law and a little terrorism too.You are also either not bright enough or informed enough to understand that the amount of trouble that they cause is a direct function of their percentage in the population.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I get it, you're a garden-variety bigot who is comfortable making blanket statements about an enormous group of people.  Again, if "most Muslims" supported what you suggest, there would currently be war in the streets of America, instead of random self-radicalized shooters every couple of years.  You chose to ignore this, and plow on through making statements about a group of people with whom you obviously have no personal experience.At least there are few enough of you Trumpoids that, in a democracy, the threat of your policy "ideas" can be safely ignored.</comment>

<comment>Quite a b*llsh*t strawman you have constructed - anybody with common sense can look at the percentages of Muslims in various countries such as England, France, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Germany and note that the number of serious problems of all types rises as a function of the number of Muslims.Again, it speaks to your low intelligence that you would presume to know my degree of acquaintence with Muslims on the basis of nothing.</comment>

<comment>Quite a b*llsh*t strawman you have constructed - anybody with common sense can look at the percentages of Muslims in various countries such as England, France, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Germany and note that the number of serious problems of all types rises as a function of the number of Muslims.And in those countries you mention, it is a minority of the Muslim population committing violent acts and demanding sharia courts.  I know you don't seem to understand this, but one can address a serious problem without immediately reaching for the "EJECT" handle, without using guilt by religious association as a practical concept.Again, it speaks to your low intelligence that you would presume to know my degree of acquaintence with Muslims on the basis of nothing.I "presume" based on the fact that you invariably depict them as secret savages waiting to overthrow the West.Imagine that I said, "White people are all really into ballet and Greek poetry.  If you don't think this is true, you're just an idiot who doesn't understand their secret desires and motives."  You would know this is bull, because you know a bunch of white people to whom none of this applies, even though you also know that there certainly are some white people who are into those things.Your problem - and it's not exclusive to you - is that you somehow exempt Muslims from the "cultural," "lapsed" or "cafeteria" categories that we are generally comfortable applying to Christians.  The Muslim guy working a counter twenty feet away from me as I type attends his mosque a few times a year, drinks the occasional beer, doesn't pick the pepperoni off his pizza, and left his former country because it was run by religious crazies.  I live and work in an area with a high population of American Muslims, they comprise about a fifth of my client base, and almost all of them resemble my co-worker far more than they resemble the pious, angry people one sees leading protests in England.  You know, just like most non-Orthodox Jewish folks might have the occasional cheeseburger and watch TV on Shabbos, or how most Catholics use some form of birth control against their religion's dogma.You, and people like you, lumping these people in with radical Islamists is...well, exactly what radical Islamists want, as they explicitly state in their internal writings and public journals.  And yet my side is supposed to be the "useful idiots?"</comment>

<comment>Unlimited unvented?? Who is spouting that nonsense. Refugees seeking admission undergo the most vigorous vetting in the world to be accepted into America. The process takes up to two years. Any terrorist who is willing to sit in a some squalid refugee camp for at least that long has got to be very very determined to do us harm. So determined that denied entrance he/she will doubtless find another way to accomplish that. People entering on visas are another story and that process is already being tightened. The only way to be 100% safe from imported rather than home grown terrorism is to completely seal the borders. No one in or out from anywhere ever. Would we like that?Edit "unvetted"Darn auto</comment>

<comment>You are 100% full of krappe.  The San Berdino Pakistani bride was "vetted" - how did that work out?  She lied on her forms. Who verified her false answers? Nobody.Non-Muslim immigration is not a problem, and you know it but are too mentally ill from your liberal indoctrination to admit it.</comment>

<comment>The Pakastani bride was not a refugee. Whole different vetting system not the method being discussed here. She was admitted as a fiancee of An American born man.Glad to see that you think all non-Muslim immigration is not a problem.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say she was a refugee - you have no point to make. Whether it is vetting of refugees or visas - the vetting doesn't work and is a failure.</comment>

<comment>Hell, I bet that proportion of people still think Elvis is alive.</comment>

<comment>I'd be surprised if it were that low.</comment>

<comment>Or the proportion that believe Hillary Clinton killed him.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for being sane.I don't get an opportunity to meet many real conservatives these days, since waterheads like Trump supporters have hijacked the term. </comment>

<comment>I keep hoping that all the polls and nasty comment boards are paid to be as inane and fallacious as they are in supporting Trump. It's the sole delusion keeping me sane at this point in primary season. It's looking like a long one...</comment>

<comment>Take heart. Roughly 70% of New Hampshire Republican Primary voters rejected the classless cretin Donald Trump.When the Primaries narrow down to two candidates, Trump will fade away.The only thing you have to worry about if you care about a Republican being President is Donald Trump throwing a fit and running as an Independent.</comment>

<comment>I truly hope you're right.</comment>

<comment>Right about Trump fading, or right about Trump throwing a fit and running as an Independent?</comment>

<comment>Him fading. I already fear him running as an Independent.</comment>

<comment>You sound like Marco Rubio reciting talking points.</comment>

<comment>Trump has a lot more details in his policies than most of the candidates running. If the low-info Trump haters like you bothered to listen to his Sunday morning interviews, read his webpage, and read more than the liberal media Soundbite news, you might learn more. The Trump low-infos are so easy to detect. It's the same old line- "he's rude, his daddy....,bankruptcy- blah blah blah". The details and background information give a much different picture. Try doing your own research for a change and gaining some insight on successful, winning  people.</comment>

<comment>I've read each and every policy position paper he's published. His Second Amendment brief was phenomenal. It's not even that I oppose his every position (I do oppose some). I think he's objectively a rude person, he's objectively flip-flopped on major policy objectives, and I don't think he would make a good president.</comment>

<comment>Then you have little insight. Who cares about vintage 80s/90s Trump when the whole Dem party flip flopped by becoming a whining social party who's main purpose is to use 'victims' as pawns. Bill Clinton seems like a Repub compared to the progressives.And only low-infos care that someone is slightly crass taking priority over the heavier, stronger issues. Especially the men. </comment>

<comment>Is it so possible that I've both read and understood and just disagree with the man as the whole? You act like it's impossible to "get" Trump and both dislike and not trust him afterwards. I can intellectually understand lots of things I disagree with, personally.I even get Trump's appeal - he speaks reassuringly and with great power and authority. My research and principles just don't lead me to believe some of his promises, nor do they lend me to agreeing with some of his demagoguery and principles.</comment>

<comment>Ok I understand. I just feel Trump will get so much more of what he wants than the lazy, spineless other candidates. They will all cave because it's all they know as a groomed politician. Trump's ego and DNA will not allow him to lose. Who's your candidate? </comment>

<comment>I prefer Rubio and Cruz - neither emphatically. I liked Rand. Doesn't it concern you that Trump can be rude to the point of putting people off, and that he has no political knowledge? I see how powerful the administrative quirks of Congress can be - there is great power in an "establishment" politician who knows how to work the system to get things done. President is a job with a steep learning curve.</comment>

<comment>sounds like some jerk from National REview</comment>

<comment>National Review is all racists.</comment>

<comment>Most of you conservative racists are anathema to black people. Meanwhile Trump is going to make America great again. And America is black people too. And you just hate that you racist.</comment>

<comment>So opposing Trump = racism?</comment>

<comment>Trump is the only Republican who's policies aren't racist.</comment>

<comment>Poor Ben Carson.</comment>

<comment>LMBAO Ben Carson. He's cool. You can tell he a real n--- deep down, but still LMBAO!</comment>

<comment>I hope no one sicks their lawyers on you for using a stock photo of a black male nurse to give the (mis?)impression that you're a black Trump supporter.Next time, be careful your choice of avatar. Google reverse image search is very easy to use.</comment>

<comment>I hope no one was stupid enough to think that was my real picture. Who you think you foolin?</comment>

<comment>No one uses their real pic. But very few use stock photos from websites.</comment>

<comment>Why not?</comment>

<comment>You know, National Review bans all Trump supporters now.  I don't think anyone is buying this "conservative" act.  Truly.</comment>

<comment>I don't know that they actively ban them, but they seem to get voted down into oblivion (as is often merited). NR has taken a strong, justified stance - amazing to me that people act like they're just publishing hit pieces when they're put reasoned criticism of every candidate out there. Trump has deservedly gotten more of their ire for being the buffoonish spectacle that he is.</comment>

<comment>No, they have a whole system. I was there only on two occasions before getting banned. They allow you to say whatever vile lies against Trump and his supporters, but you cannot push back.  They flag you right away.  I have seen numerous people get banned right before my eyes after spending less than a few hours on their comment boards.  They don't even give you a warning.  Any pro Trump comment is a @Troll or @spam.   These are the "conservatives" that are fighting for us?  Laughable.</comment>

<comment>That's a shame - not at all a healthy course. I'm no Trump fan, but I'll gladly discourse with the people I disagree with.</comment>

<comment>I can totally understand not being a Trump fan.  I am not a fan of any of the others.  Who are you a fan of?  Usually I don't encounter very many commenters who are following anyone (except Sanders).     This is why I am here.  I want to know what real people think.   Not much excitement for Cruz.  I get mostly anti-Trump.  Nothing wrong with that.</comment>

<comment>I am leaning towards Rubio and Cruz in that order. Neither emphatically - both have their warts and I wouldn't pretend otherwise. I liked Rand Paul a lot, and I'd love to see him get a VP or high Cabinet nod.</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul makes a great deal of sense on many issues. I will miss him in the debates. A breath of fresh air.</comment>

<comment>It's true. I got banned at NRO for supporting Trump. Meanwhile there were all these open racists posting swastikas and stuff. That place is a gutter.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  Total hypocrisy and double standards.  They really just want to ban any pro Trump supporters.  These are the "conservatives" looking out for our constitutional rights.   Irony.</comment>

<comment>It's difficult to forecast how different Trump the President might be from Trump the candidate.The United States with its history of racism and slavery will be taking a huge step backwards by putting a man in charge, who is effectively a white supremacist. The damage could be irreparable.  One only has to look at the rioting that we've seen recently, under a moderate black president, to imagine what might happen should racial incidents occur under an inflammatory president like Trump.  I would fully expect that under a Trump Presidency, there will be nationwide rioting and several cities under lock-down.In foreign policy, Trump is an absolute fool.  His comments on the Quds Force and their leader Qasem Soleimani is but one example of his stupidity.  Soleimani almost certainly convinced Putin to join the struggle in Syria, an event that will forever change Middle Eastern politics and undermine decades of US activity in the region.  It's something that will be analysed and studied for decades by academics.  Trump, who apparently has no idea who the Quds Force is, started talking about the Kurds and how they are our friends.  Trump wouldn't know the PKK from the KKK.Economically, it's best to say that Trump's comments have been reckless.  Two of the US's largest trading partners, China and Mexico, have been threatened.  One can only hope that as president, others around him will moderate his opinions, but Trump's astounding arrogance might prevail.  A full scale trade war seems highly likely, and it's almost a certainty that by the end of this, China will emerge as the dominant world economy as the world economy shifts to China as THE great trading power.</comment>

<comment>Yep. A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for making China great again. </comment>

<comment>good - learn to embrace it.in foreign policy - obama and his staff of nitwits have screwed up europe  - see Stephen Cohen's remarks about policy toward NATO-RUSSIA</comment>

<comment>I am certainly not an apologist for US foreign policy, which for decades has been a disaster.  One only has to look at present day Iran and realise that the US largely caused this by their meddling.   I agree that US pressure caused Putin to react in Ukraine and that Obama (and that idiot Nuland) can be blamed.However, the fact is that Obama knew where Ukraine was before he became president, he likely knew something about Crimea.  He made an informed decision, right or wrong.  One only has to look at the George W. Bush years to see what can go wrong when the president has absolutely no clue.But the other special thing that Trump would bring with him would be the intense dislike of US allies.  Britain, Canada, Australia and many others view Trump as a moron.  While diplomacy would still prevail, it would be a thin curtain and the US absolutely could not count on their allies as they have in the past.</comment>

<comment>This white supremacist charge is some bull. Trump will make America great again. And America is black people too.</comment>

<comment>Are you trolling?  What is your angle?</comment>

<comment>I support Donald Trump because he will make America great again. He is not a racist. He will bring jobs to the black community.</comment>

<comment>Are you being serious?  I mean, you seem to be here with an agenda.  He is not a racist, of course.  It does appear though that you are mocking him.</comment>

<comment>I am not mocking Trump. He is a dealmaker and he will be good for America.</comment>

<comment>You want a president who said "Laziness is a trait in blacks”, because he will bring jobs to the black community?</comment>

<comment>Trump is trying to inspire and motivate people. He is giving us hope. He will bring jobs to the black community. You just want to tear him down. But most of us ain't buying it. We know Trump. Trump is New York. Deep down he's cool with us.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't even know what the frickin' nuclear triad is, so it's not surprising he's ignorant here as well.</comment>

<comment>He has a great relationship with "the blacks".</comment>

<comment>He can't give any details, but everything is going to be GREAT!  Just SUPER!  You will be so tired of WINNING that you won't be able to take anymore.  Polices?  They'll be GREAT, too!  So, so GREAT.</comment>

<comment>Make America Yooge Again!</comment>

<comment>The Rubes guzzle the snake oil and beg for more. </comment>

<comment>Every time he talks about WINNING all I can see is poor crazy Charlie Sheenhttps://media.giphy.com/media/...</comment>

<comment>LOL ... Good one. I haven't thought of Trump that way. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You´re his speech writer, aren´t you.</comment>

<comment>What additional details do you need for closing the border?  The immigration laws are all already on the books.  He will build a wall.  Is this a difficult concept for you?</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha!  Poof!  Magic wand time!</comment>

<comment>How much will building a wall cost?  How many jackbooted thugs will need be hired by the federal government to deport 11 million people?  How much will that cost?</comment>

<comment>This is just a deflection.  When someone mentions jack-booted thugs, how do you expect me to have a discussion or engage with you?</comment>

<comment>OK, I was trying to put it in terms that folks on the right seem to like, but how about this instead: How much will the size of government have to increase to address the enforcement of deporting 11 million people?And, speaking of deflecting, I notice you didn't put a price on the wall.  (I'm also curious if it will run through private property, and if such property will therefore have to be appropriated.)</comment>

<comment>Every person is entitled to due process and it is not easy to deport someone unless you catch them crossing the border.  We just need to enforce our laws.  There is no controversy here.  Going after businesses and employers is by far the most effective method.  It would be quite easy and painless and it would work beyond any doubt.   I don't know what the wall would cost.  I support a lot of things and I do not know what the exact cost is.  Do you know what every single thing in the military costs?  No?  Does this mean you are not for the military?</comment>

<comment>Illegals are not entitled to the same due process rights as Americans.</comment>

<comment>Yes they are.</comment>

<comment>no.</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court disagrees</comment>

<comment>Right, so you are pour 11 million people into our court system.  And that is after you have arrested and jailed all those 11 million people."Going after" in what way?  I agree that preventing businesses from hiring non-documented workers is the best way to go, as it removes the incentive for illegal immigration in the first place.  I have absolutely no problem with that.But that's not what Trump is suggesting -- he's suggesting that he will "round up" all illegal immigrants and deport them as soon as possible.   And that is simply not physically possible, at least not without a huge expansion of the INS and court system, one that I would think would boggle most true small-government conservatives.</comment>

<comment>When I discuss this with people, I usually like to know first where they are coming from.  Our laws say clearly that we must deport illegal aliens.  If you do not support these laws, then obviously it follows you do not support Trump or his policies.  I support the laws.  I assume you do not.  Trump is not proposing new laws.  He is proposing to enforce existing ones.  When I say people support open borders, I mean they support new laws to make it easier for illegal aliens to remain.  It is shorthand.  Trump is saying, shorthand, that he is opposed to open borders.  He is in favor of deportations, enforcing the laws. If you are with me and Trump, then the next question is how to go about doing it.  Where does "mass round-ups" come into play?  We could just enforce the laws with the people already working in the government.  Why do you think we'd need to "deport 11 million people" all at once? The policy is simply to deport people who are here illegally.  Just because we cannot prevent ALL crime in the USA does not mean we stop policing, does it?</comment>

<comment>Iggy, I agree that, in an ideal world, those who are in the US illegally should be deported, and that the US should be able to control who enters its borders.  So yes, I think immigration laws, and all other laws, should be enforced when possible.  But Trump really is talking about "rounding up" illegal aliens (that's the phrase he used in his 60 Minutes interview).  That's simply not possible with the current resources devoted to immigration law.  You would have to vastly expand the INS and the courts if you wanted to put 11 million people through the system.  Just for comparison, the US deports about 400,000 people every year.  So to deal with 11 million under current resources would take over 25 years.  Is that timeframe what you were expecting from Trump?</comment>

<comment>I don't expect him to deport all 11 million people.  The president is not a dictator.  I expect him to enforce our laws.  It is not an all or nothing thing.  I agree they must go home.  No one supports any type of "mass round-up", but yes, if it means going to places of work and doing raids, I am for it.  If it means getting warrants and knocking on doors and making arrests, then I am for it.  We should be doing it now.  It is a very strange argument to say since all 11 million cannot be deported, I should support an open borders candidate like Rubio or a Democrat.  Trump is using shorthand.  He should.  He is telling people what he supports.  No one thinks there will be mass round ups.  It won't happen.</comment>

<comment>If you take Trump at his word, he does.And no candidate is advocating for "open borders".  There are some candidates who are suggesting that there are people who have been in the US a long time and have put down roots and made families, and we should not make those people the priority of our enforcement measures, and perhaps consider finding some way to give them legal status after meeting appropriate criteria.  That's not "open borders".</comment>

<comment>I am not impressed with your argument.  Again, I am 100% in support of deportations.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.</comment>

<comment>We are doing it now. President Obama is just exercising his Constitutional right to decide who is the lowest in priority on the deportation lists. If you are admitting That it is not possible to deport all the undocumented then what is wrong with that?</comment>

<comment>Has Trump ever specifically mentioned penalizing the employers? I haven't heard him do so although admittedly I try to tune him out.</comment>

<comment>What..."he will build a wall" isn't a sufficient level detail coming from a presidential candidate?!?!</comment>

<comment>you don't give a fũck about the size of government, or you'd care about what importing tens of millions of low skilled socialists does to the government. you're just terrified that the majority is realizing they can look out for their own interests.</comment>

<comment>And you merely avoided the question with that rant.</comment>

<comment>how so</comment>

<comment>The question was how much would the size of government have to increase to deport 11 million people?  For comparison, the government currently deports around 400,000 people per year, which would mean that, presuming no new illegal immigrants, it would take over 25 years with current resources.  How quickly do you want to get rid of the illegal immigrants currently in the US? Two years?  Then you would need to increase resources by over 10 times.As well, I want to know how much Trump's wall will cost (and let's dispense with the fantasy that Mexico will somehow pay for it out of the goodness of their hearts).</comment>

<comment>deport criminals, others will self deport when you take away their ability to work and collect benefits. the resources required are a hell of a lot less than the burden of them being here.mexico will pay for the wall not out of any mythical goodness of their hearts but from taxing remittances and putting pressure on their government.you're a fool if you think government will be smaller after we're finished being replaced by mestizos</comment>

<comment>That should be "dispel" the fantasy and you have to repeat it at least 4 times....</comment>

<comment>I am also thinking that aside from being really expensive it will require deploying some really cutting-edge construction techniques. The whole economy dedicated to a task that will ultimately weaken it. What a novel concept.</comment>

<comment>Trump claims the wall will cost $8,000,000,000, whereas experts are claiming it will cost $15,000,000,000 or more.  He's also stated that it will be 35 to 40 feet high.  I find it fascinating that a President of the USA would decide how high the wall is, but that aside:I just checked and you can buy a 40 foot ladder at Home Depot for $354.28.  You can buy a shovel for $15.97 ($2.00 off, it's on special).  So, I'm guessing we're going to need a few people to patrol this wall or we're not going to get a good return on it.  I wonder how much it will cost to patrol a 2000 mile wall 24 hours a day?</comment>

<comment>You are opposed to the wall in principle, whatever it costs and whether it works or does not work (there is no doubt they work, BTW).  It is not worth my time to debate the cost or effectiveness of the wall with someone who is opposed to it in principle.</comment>

<comment>Wait, what?No, that's exactly the opposite of how it's work.  You debate your ideas with people who don't like them because they're more likely to find holes and problems.  If you only debate with people that already like your ideas, it's not a debate, it's an affirmation, and you're likely to succumb to group think.</comment>

<comment>If you are opposed to the wall in principle, then what is the point of debating the cost?</comment>

<comment>To refine abstract objectives to realistic and workable plans.</comment>

<comment>It would be impossible to win such an argument.  It is a fools errand. If you are against building a wall in principle, then even if it is 100% effective and costs $10 you will argue against it.  This is the world we live in.  I have yet to encounter anyone different.  Are you opposed to a wall in principle?</comment>

<comment>If your only objective in a debate is to persuade the other person you're directly engaged with, then yes, it's a fools errand.  But if that's your only objective, then you have no business talking to anyone that doesn't already agree with you.But there are two other reasonable objectives.  The first is to persuade people who are undecided.  After all, far more people will read the discussion then engage in it.  And having a discussion that talks about ideas on their merits, rather then blindly asserts them, is much more persuasive.The second is to refine the idea, improve it.  By having the weaknesses and holes pointed out, you can address and fix them, producing a better, stronger, more workable idea.</comment>

<comment>I would be for it if it cost $10 and was 100% effective. I think most people would be. </comment>

<comment>What basis are you using for saying walls work? The successful ones are much shorter in length and very heavily patrolled.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump doesn't have to do a damned thing to erase his past. Donald Trump is a Godless, Elitist, Liberal Democrat.Donald Trump's window licking waterhead supporters KNOW Trump is a Godless, Elitist, Liberal Democrat.Either that, or Donald Trump's window licking waterhead supporters are in denial about Trump being a Godless, Elitist, Liberal Democrat.It's all irrelevant.
