<comment>For better or worse, no justice* follows their stated philosophy reliably. They are human beings, and while human being can philosophize, only a robot could adhere to a philosophy perfectly. It's simply too hard, with too many conflicts between philosophy and reality.The best hope for understanding a justice is the same as for understanding the rest of us: what does one value? It's not the same thing as one's stated philosophy; it's whatever things or ideas one cares about the most, and therefore it's what one will do the most to protect.I think John Roberts values the Supreme Court more than the law or any judicial philosophy. His votes are consistently cast to preserve public respect for the Court.*or President—see Jefferson, Reagan, et al.</comment>

<comment>The problem arises when 2 of your philosophies butt heads. The controdict each other.</comment>

<comment>I already figured Kennedy would flip on ACA.  His questions to the plaintiffs were sharp and somewhat confrontational.Roberts is biddable and may already have voted to side with his earlier decision on the subject in 2012 simply because he doesn't want to appear indecisive.3-5 the plaintiffs lose and the ACA trundles on.  Of course, the whole scheme is a giant Ponzi scheme that's headed for actuarial disaster and will require the "reinsurance corridor" (euphemism for massive taxpayer bailout) just to stay afloat.  Score another one for Big Government.</comment>

<comment>BUT BUT BUT the Supreme Court is activist and conservative!!!Everything is political!</comment>

<comment>Its no more activist than any other Court. All courts are activists inherently.But they are very conservative. And its not as much political as it is a sustained and concerted push from business interests over the last 30 years to fundamentally shift academic economics, scholarly legal work, and the judiciary in their favor, all starting with Justice Powell's infamous memo to the US Chamber of Congress.</comment>

<comment>I agree that all courts are inherently activist.  They do, after all, interpret and apply statutory and constitutional law to specific fact patterns that legislation is not capable of contemplating.HOWEVER, conservatives, including the five conservative Supreme Court justices, constantly whine about "activist" progressive judges, and claim to be strict constructionists.  Scalia is likely the the most vocal advocate of strict construction, yet he never hesitates to bend the Constitution in order to fit it to the outcome he prefers for any individual case.</comment>

<comment>Prove it.</comment>

<comment>The easiest example is that, under his own construction principles, the Supreme Court is not permitted by the constitution to strike down democratically enacted legislation, even if there are really bad flaws int hat legislation (see US v. Windsor aka the upholding of DOMA). But then, he struck down a democratically enacted legislation because he felt there were really bad flaws in it (see Shelby Country v. Holder, or the VRA case).But there are many other examples. He tends to be a strict constructionist when it comes to fiscal and economic policy as well as criminal law. He tends to be interpretive when it comes to social legislation.</comment>

<comment>"under his own construction principles, the Supreme Court is not permitted by the constitution to strike down democratically enacted legislation,"I don't think so. This would mean repudiating judicial review itself. You are conflating, as liberals are apt to do, strict construction, and anti-activism. It is only in a specific sense that conservatives support the latter. It does not mean throwing out any opposition in the judiciary to existing statutes. It means opposition to existing statutes only on the basis of the original function of the constitution: chiefly, limiting and circumscribing the power of the state.</comment>

<comment>You can read the two cited opinions. Scalia clearly contradicts himself. He strikes down the VRA even though it has been held constitutional, and does so on the grounds that  the coverage formula is not wise, not because the coverage formula is unconstitutional. Meanwhile, DOMA is upheld based on the theory that, while it might not be wise, it is constitutional, so the Court's hands are tied. Those two approaches are clearly contradictory.What you are arguing isn't that Conservative judges don't engage in activism, you instead define "activism" in a way that means that the conservative version of activism is "right" and all other versions of activism are "wrong." But even if you believe it is right, its still activism. Its still interpreting something based on your own subjective beliefs, which is what "judicial activism" is.  This is engendered by the conservative obsession with what the founding fathers were thinking. You think of all the people in all the history of the world those dudes in 1781 figured out literally the best way for us to organize society for all eternity. (And this phenomenon of the firm believe in eternal and universal correctness explains a lot of conservative world views, IMO)(and when I said "the SC is not permitted by the constitution to strike down democratically enacted legislation", that was (1) a quote from the opinion and (2) based on the assumption that, of course, judicial review is still available, under Scalia's rules, to strike down unconstitutional laws. His view is that's the only reason you can strike down a law.)</comment>

<comment>I don't understand your last paragraph. In addition to blatant unconstitutionality of a statute, there is also contradiction among several as a condition for striking down.For the specifics of what you take to be Scalia's contradiction on the VRA, send me a link. Scalia has sounded positivist as well as natural law notes in the past, so some context is needed. DOMA seems to me not a problem.As to the rest, yes of course I am arguing that when conservatives use the term "activism" they do not mean what you say. And yes, this supposes that the judge's role is to hew to the meaning of the constitution. This is not an "obsession," but the first condition of there being constitutional jurisprudence as distinct from politics. Under your definition, everything is activism, everything is politics.Your middle paragraph demonstrates that you do not understand this, and that you probably have not spent much time reading eighteenth century thought. The "dudes" in question quite consciously made the point of not assuming that they "had figured out literally the best way for us to organize society" And in fact, they come closer to maintaining the position that there is no such thing. The constitution is meant to provide a bulwark against the worst aspects of human fallibility, not to dictate what might count as the best. This is precisely why the constitution in silent on matters like marriage, and in the original text, uses the word "right" exactly once, and in a very limited way.So if you want to define "activism" so broadly, then it simply means opposing current statues. That is a vacuous definition, failing to take your opponents' position seriously. But then, if you sincerely believe that there can be no distinction between politics and law, then you will always see the other side in this question as duplicitous. But you will also, I'd argue, lose any distinction between a free state and an administrative tryanny: vae victis!</comment>

<comment>Everything is activism and everything is politics, at least as you are defining politics. What I mean by this is, humans are incapable of being objective. We are only capable of applying our subjective knowledge (and understanding of that knowledge) to any given inquiry. I define activism broadly because everyone else does. People bandy that term about to mean all sorts of things, but usually its to imply that the judge is doing what he wants to do, as opposed to what the text or law or precedent says. But my point is that, even if you purport to follow the text, your are still interpreting that text through your own subjective views and knowledge (or if you care about legislative intent, through your own subjective view of what legislative intent was). There is no other way to interpret because there is no way to ascertain true objectivity. What we do instead is ascribe widely held subjective beliefs as objectivity, but they are not the same, (and in arriving at what is a widely held view, a judge would once again have to apply his subjective knowledge and views to determine that; whether they rely on anecdotal or statistical evidence, its all interpreted.)As to my comments about the constitution: I've read quite a bit of historical political philosophy, but you can't know if I'm full of shit or not, so that's a moot point. However, I do know that the drafters (at least a lot of them) were aware of their inability to predict the future and their beliefs about the importance of limiting governance. My point isn't that they didn't foresee that. Its that, today, a lot of folks ignore just that foreseen limitation! They assume  that the 1781 document is the best for-all-eternity way to deal with the reality that there is no perfect way to govern.  While the drafters were able to craft a good document that was able to conform to many of our problems over the first 100 years, starting with the civil war we have been continually faced with issues that they did not foresee and that the constitution was incapable of dealing with. One of the huge ones being when unregulated capitalism resulted in such a huge disparity in bargaining power that the government was forced to intervene, without constitutional authority, to address monopolies. Or having a standing army for longer than two years. Or firmly delineating when the sovereignty of a state is trumped. Or how to regulate mass communication. Or how to deal with security in a world wherein non-state actors commit acts of war.Look, I'm not saying it was a shitty document. It wasn't. It was pretty remarkably prescient and insightful. But that doesn't mean its perfect and that especially doesn't mean that we shouldn't be able to better adjust it to current realities. They did foresee that they couldn't foresee everything, but by assuming their method for dealing with that is infallible, one is falling into the exact pitfall they they were trying to avoid.Law is what the majority agrees on. Politics deals with interests of particular groups. I get that. But Law is still just a conglomeration of subjective beliefs, so it can be wrong in the sense that a minority could have a different subjective belief, and that minority subjective belief could be better for society. Really, Law is the tyranny of the majority (which is usually just fine!). Its politics on a bigger scale. By assuming the constitution is infallible, what we are really doing is letting the majority of 1781 have tyranny over us all  (which, again, isn't horrible, they were right about plenty of stuff. But they weren't right about everything.)</comment>

<comment>I think you are failing to appreciate the distinction between constitutional and statutory questions. Additionally, you are jumping from fallibility and uncertainty to relativism, and deriving from that several conclusions that conflict with your progressive historical narrative.The constitution does not purport to solve political or moral problems. It gives us a framework in which we can work those problems out, short of violence. In this, it is crucial that for some basic rules, there remains comity and tacit agreement. One of these is that there is a difference between constitutional prerogatives and the will of the majority; without this, there can be no states, no local governance, and I will point out to you, no minority rights. On your thoroughgoing relativism, there is no distinction between constitutional and statutory, and statutory becomes legitimate no matter what. On this basis, the constitution would mean nothing other than certifying the majority vote of the moment, be that to eliminate state boundaries, deny due process to foreigners, or keep slaves.In short, it would be to support an elective tyranny. If judges just do what politics dictates and all is hopelessly relative, why would we need judges at all? Why not simply put everything up for popular vote? Why should a guy in a black robe have more say-so than you or me? The implication of out-and-out relativism is that there is no reason for a constitution at all. Fair enough, just don't complain when a future president imprisons you.</comment>

<comment>Saying that the chief function of the Constitution is to limit the power of the state is at best a gross oversimplification. Congress has power to regulate interstate commerce and very broad powers to tax and spend, for example. True, the Bill of Rights explicitly limits the government, and practically everyone approves. Much of the body of the Constitution, however, grants powers to the government.</comment>

<comment>"Delimits" is a better description here than "grants." Remember, the federalist case had to be built and was by no means a forgone conclusion. At issue was the very question of who or what could be considered as doing the "granting."Yes of course the commerce clause is the most beloved by liberals, as they read it to negate the rest of the text. "Much of the body of the text" can be seen as expansive in its permissions only if if you 1) assume the other articles were meant as adjuncts of the commerce clause, and 2) that "regulate" can be understood so expansively as to be interchangeable with "constitute." Of course we (conservatives) are not believers in taking such hermeneutic license.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution, when ratified, created a government and granted it powers. The simple answer to who created and granted is the people eligible to decide whether to ratify through their representatives.I cited the Commerce Clause as an example of a power granted to the Congress in the Constitution. I also cited the power to tax and spend. I might add the power to borrow on the credit of the United States. Those powers are very broad as written. They cannot be legitimately interpreted away. No license is required to read them as written.</comment>

<comment>Your first paragraph elides the central difficulty: principles of representation. Had there been an obvious meaning to "the people eligible to decide," there could have arisen no need for a constitutional convention, and we'd still have the articles of confederation today... or perhaps some smattering of separate regional nations.Your failure to see that this point of legitimation was at issue allows you to import your own, anachronistic preferences into the text, re: taxes. The word is used six times. Five of those six clearly have in mind to prevent the federal government's alteration of state power and legitimacy by means of taxes: proportionality of levy by census population, maintenance of state balance for at least a period by means of stipulating particular taxes on immigration, Indians are not to be counted since they are not taxed, particular exports of states cannot be taxed, etc.The only mention of "tax" which grants a power with some leeway is the mention of "general welfare" in section 8. Note that it is preceded by paying debts and common defense. True, this does not prevent the state from instituting a particular program, but nor does it stipulate any. Such is to be left to politics, subject to the constraints laid down elsewhere in the document. It takes some imagination to read the thing and say these powers are "broad as written," or that "much of the body of the text" grants powers.</comment>

<comment>Maybe a license is necessary to interpret the Constitution: a license to practice law. You interpret by looking backward from the time of drafting and ratification. But lawyers know that the Constitution must not only guide us but decide questions on the powers of the government, including its three branches -- now.You understand that "taxes on immigration" referred to slaves, right? And proportionality of levy referred to head taxes? The Supreme Court's interpretation of the latter as applying to income taxes was reversed by amendment.Power to tax "for the general welfare" is broad on its face, and Supreme Court cases as recent as the Constitutional challenge to Obamacare have so read it.</comment>

<comment>The discussion here was not about current law, which any serious conservative will tell you is askew. Hence, my exchange with "guest" above, where I'm trying to get him/her to see that the definition of "activism"" he ascribed to the other side was vacuous and false."Taxes on immigration" involved runaway slaves and actual immigrants both, yes. This underscores my point: that the document itself was meant to settle issues of representation and sovereignty. You (or even I) might not like the particulars of how such issues were settled, but this does not establish that this was not what they were doing, and that instead they were seeking federal empowerment and latitude.That was the question here, not what current lawyers do. What current lawyers do bears scant resemblance to the workings of a free society.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure taxes on immigration referred to the international slave trade.There are many lawyers in this country, who do greatly varied work. But they all work with the law. To say that what lawyers do bears scant resemblance to the workings of a free society is to say that law has a scant relation to a free society, a statement that, I think, makes no sense.</comment>

<comment>Again, yes on slaves, but you are avoiding the point. Why do you suppose numbers (free, immigrant, slaves whether runaway or new -- note that the same article deals with the infamous 3/5) were at issue every time they spoke of taxes? Because the underlying concerns were sovereignty and representation, and whether/how a federal arrangement would change these things. This is not a mystery.Look, you aren't going to agree with me of these matters, but I implore you -- for the sake of intellectual honesty -- to consider the beginning of this exchange. It was initiated because the charge was made that Scalia and conservatives in general are simply playing politics and have no consistent juridical view. My interlocutor then went further and conceded that his view was in fact that all judicial decision making is political. Aside from the obvious absurdity to which one is pushed by this view (as  it undermines one's own complaints), there is the patent falsehood and dishonesty that it involves concerning the opposition. It represents a refusal to take part in debate, or even to acknowledge the possibility of honest disagreement.So on the issue of limitation coming before allowance re: taxation, I have cited for you the actual text, noting that only one mention of taxing could even begin to hint at powers not explicitly stipulated. If this is not good enough for you, then I'd suggest you go have a look at Federalist 30-35 or so, if memory serves. Hamilton makes a repeated point of arguing that a federal scheme of taxation is preferable to the one under the articles precisely on the grounds that it would be more regular, and hence more limited and less arbitrary. The fear was that confederative taxation subjected the various states, and the country as a whole, to the possibility of predatory and irregular use of taxes each time an emergency hit. Yes, an Emergency.On your last point, I meant the law under which lawyers currently operate. That said, yes I would agree with the classical view that too many lawyers and too-complex laws are signs of social decay.</comment>

<comment>You will have to connect the dots for me from slaves to taxes to sovereignty to representation to a federal government.Not all judicial decisions are politically based, but the recent big decisions at the Supreme Court (Bush v. Gore, constitutional challenge to Obamacare, Hobby Lobby, Citizens United, same sex marriage cases, etc. obviously have a political dimension. The conservatives on the Supreme Court ignored precedent in these cases and invented new doctrines on which to base their opinions, even going so far as to explicitly say (in Bush v. Gore) that no court should regard the decision as precedent. Not very intellectually honest, that.If it makes you feel better (or not), the number of lawyers is stagnating. In any case, law and lawyers are essential to a free society.</comment>

<comment>Were slaves to be counted or not? Were taxes to be levied, and by whom? According to which numerical rules would taxes be levied, and in what way over time? Could the federal government tax certain things crucial to some regions while others were left untouched?These all go to the relative political power of the various states and whether they'd be able to maintain that power over time. They all touched on presuppositions on who was to be represented and to what extent and in which way. People today are so accustomed to think in terms of pure popular sovereignty that they miss that the constitution was never intended to establish this. (Just consider the initial rules for senate elections, or say, the electoral college).You are failing to distinguish "political" in three different senses. There is "political" in the more trivial sense that a judge's decision has an outcome politically favorable or unfavorable to a person or group. There is then "political" as a rationale. Finally, there is "political" as a motivation.  In the cases you mention, you are jumping from the first to the third without ever establishing a rationale for your charge on the second. Of course as long as we remain a society of some human beings, the first will always be present.You're assuming that stare decisis is  the whole of jurisprudence, something which neither side accepts, but that liberals like to attribute to conservatives for the sake of their rhetoric, and to save them from having to make a case. This is precisely what generated the argument: "activism" for conservatives is not equivalent to setting aside stare decisis, no matter how many times liberals say so. You may have your position, sir, but you are not entitled to tell me what mine is.On Bush v. Gore, therefore, there should be no problem (at least on its face) with saying "this is not precedent"; we should expect that there would be many such cases.The number of lawyers going down may be a small bit of good news, but at this point, the law itself is the bigger problem. Of course all societies need law; human beings are imperfect. But in a good society -- a society capable of self-rule -- those laws should be simple and few in number. A complex scheme of law goes hand-in-hand with the notion that society is in a state of sickness or incapacity, and needs assistance from a secular priesthood. This is what liberal politics, at bottom, is all about.</comment>

<comment>Prove it is SUCH a inane response.  I'm an attorney and I regularly read significant Supreme Court decisions.  If you can come anywhere near claiming such expertise, I'll be glad to debate you.  However, YOU must begin with a Socratic argumentative hypothesis, as I did.  "Prove it" is a second grader response.</comment>

<comment>That you need to repat the exact same response with a minor change to avoid the disqus duplicate test, shows you a troll..FLUSH !</comment>

<comment>Activism is writing law not interpreting it, simple definition, and no court does this more then the liberal Federal 9th Circuit</comment>

<comment>Interpreting is deciding what something means in a given situation. You try and tell me what a rule means in a given situation without being influenced by your own perspective and values. Its impossible. All "activist judge" really means is "human judge." No matter how you write your opinion, there are subjective choices that are made to arrive at your conclusion.Take claims of self defense to murder charges. The judge has to decide if something was in self-defense. Now there are precedent definitions of what "self-defense" is, but they all revolve around reasonableness. Reasonableness is defined as what most people would think. Its impossible for judges to survey most people and get a definitive answer as to what is reasonable, so they are forced to  import what they THINK an average person would do. And the only faculty they have for doing this to rely on their only subjective opinions. So, what constitute self-defense can at times vary wildly.Even a strict constructionist is an activists. For one, they flat out are often just activists in that they pick and chose when to be constructionist. But even an imaginary actual strict constructionist would be inserting his opinion that the exact text should be adhered to, regardless of the resulting absurdity, which is far from a universally held opinion.There is simply no way to separate interpretation and activism. Unless you want to entrust it to an algorithm, which introduces a host of other issues.</comment>

<comment>I understand interpretation but when for example the 9th uses a case that has no law to support a decision that fits a political opinion isn't that wrong? Law, president interpretation, common social good should all be part of the considerations... What the 9th continues to do is create where there was no law and imply individual good is superior to social good if considered at all... this is a recipe for law that will damn you if your do and damn you if you don't to be selectively applied by the whim of the judge... that is the danger</comment>

<comment>Activist conservatives are just doing what comes naturally, like a dog chasing cars. There's nothing political about it.</comment>

<comment>"Activist cobservative" is an oxynoron.By definition a conservative is more laissez-faire to see where things will progress over time.It is the so-called progressives who want to bring about change NOW !</comment>

<comment>Technically, "activist conservative" is an oxymoron, and cannot exist.  But there are at least four Supreme Court justices who author and join in activist opinions in order to produce conservative if not reactionary judicial decisions.</comment>

<comment>So is that why you troll so much?  To "let" us all talk things over and make up our own minds.</comment>

<comment>There's no such thing as a 'strict constructionist.' The whole concept is laughable. Unless you lived in 18th century America or lived in the heads of the framers, you can't be a 'strict constructionist.' Pretending to follow the letter of Constitution just gives (false) legitimacy to an abhorrent (and thoughtless and convenient) version of conservatism. Like the halfwits who claim to be libertarians. It falls apart as soon as you take a hard look at it. That's the reason Scalia appears to be so inconsistent. He's not following any such ideology.</comment>

<comment>The very definition of "strict construtionist is false because interpretation is reserved SOLELY to the literal text, and ignores meaning AT THE TIME OF WRITING.An originalst takes into consideration the meanning of the terminology AT THE TIME of writing.A constructionist would ignore that the meaning of "well-regulated" has morphed in 200+ years.The originalist goes back and read the law while keeping in mind the common usage of a term like 'well-regulated" AT THE TIME>Scalia is an originalist NOT a strict constructionist.Your claim and argument are both false.</comment>

<comment>Well, now he's dead.</comment>

<comment>"Instead, in the spirit of his hero, John Marshall, he proved willing to cast a tie-breaking, strategic vote, to avoid making the Court appear partisan in one of the most closely watched cases of the decade. "Agree.  It was a political decision - the legal "logic" was tortured.The author is basically arguing for a results-based SCOTUS.  Which is how we ended up torturing the words of the Constitution to find a right to privacy where one didn't exist.</comment>

<comment>So there should be no constitutional right to privacy in your mind?</comment>

<comment>What's up with calling me reactionary names?The right to bear arms is clearly TEXTUALLY plainly stated as conditioned by a well-regulated militia.That makes perfect sense, if they are organized into a militia.The gun cult killed our 2nd by interpretation alone.</comment>

<comment>No, it is not a condition of a well regulated militia.  That clause describes the independent clause; you are pretending the independent clause is the militia.  You fail at basic english.</comment>

<comment>NOPE.Not even close..By the way, are you claiming that in Dredd Scott, when Chief Justice Tanney was arguing that making Scott a free man, he would have to join a militia to be able to exercise his right to be armed ?The answer is NO..There is NO NEED to be part of a militia to exercise the right held by the people.</comment>

<comment>The SCOTUS disagrees with you.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is arguing for an unrestrained right.  That is a liberal strawman.  See the USSC decision.</comment>

<comment>You need to go back to school and actually learn to read for comprehension.</comment>

<comment>Actually, we settled this argument.  The supreme court decided that citizens do have an individual right to keep and bear arms.  Reasonable restraints have always been understood, but if your intent by your gun regulations is to so encumber and hinder the gun owner from exercising his or her rights, then those regulations would be unconstitutional. For example, trying to ban the ammunition needed for the gun to operate as intended.</comment>

<comment>Feel free to show us where the restraints exist in the text of the 2nd Amendment."shall not be infringed" is pretty dictatorial in it's restraint of what the government can do.And considerng that ONE intent was to insure that people who posess and be qualified to use arms that would be used by a militia, then and now, it appears that the government is in actual fact infringing when it is attempting to cut off access to the very arms that a member of militia would use today.</comment>

<comment>You should read these things you post.  "Unstructured" home schooling appears to be a nice way of saying not bothering to teach them anything at all.  Some parents work hard to create good outcomes.  Others, not so much.</comment>

<comment>Oh - I was busy - but there is lots of research out there.  Home schooled kids do better than kids in public schools.  Here is another link:The  home-educated typically score 15 to 30 percentile points above     public-school students on standardized academic achievement tests.

I know that the public school unions hate home-schoolers, but I didn't think the results were in question.</comment>

<comment>"I didn't think the results were in question."Of course, it is.  It's a fairly recent phenomenon to have large numbers of children home schooled who have the option of a public school education.</comment>

<comment>Put it this way - I haven't seen any research to the contrary.I don't understand the objection to it: these parents also pay taxes.  And - I would assume that fewer students mean less strain on resources, etc.The ONLY reason I can see is either 1) cultural (the horror of making common cause with mouth-breathing fundies for ANY reason whatsover); or 2) defensive (these "amateurs" are doing a better job than the "professionals."But #2 flies in the face of various local efforts  to limit class sizes (which, of course, was just a sop to the teacher's union).  Isn't this the ultimate small class?I think it's pretty simple.  Most parents willing to devote the time to this are going to be plenty motivated.  They are invested in the outcome, and it's very tough work (my wife did it for a year).</comment>

<comment>"Most parents willing to devote the time to this are going to be plenty motivated."Many of the people that don't want their kids in public schools do so for ideological reasons not because they want to school their children themselves.  They do not necessarily have the skills, time or resources to create a structured environment that will ensure good outcomes.  The first report you cited said as much.  I'm not saying people shouldn't be allowed to home school.   I'm saying it is not uncontroversial.</comment>

<comment>I repeat: THE OUTCOMES ARE BETTER.And - since you are making stuff up today - link to research showing why parents choose to home school.  In my anecdotal experience (we knew/know around 20 couples who do it), they are highly educated, strong religious families.</comment>

<comment>I said that home schooling is not uncontroversial while conceding it is the parents' right to do so, and that dedicated parents get good outcomes.  Don't you think you're overreacting a bit?</comment>

<comment>" They do not necessarily have the skills, time or resources to create a structured environment that will ensure good outcomes."You made this assertion and ignored research showing superior outcomes.  That is what I am reacting to.Truth does not always have a liberal bias.</comment>

<comment>You keep acting as if I'm biased against home schooling.  I'm not.  It's not for everyone, but for some it works quite well.   I'm also well aware that success in education is highly dependent on dedicated parents whether it is home schooling or a public education.  It's the dedication of parents that achieves consistently superior outcomes not the place where education is offered.</comment>

<comment>I always find it funny when liberals claim parents are incapable of home schooling despite the fact that on average teachers have below average college entrance scores in both grades and standardized tests.  Most teachers are BELOW AVERAGE.  Yet they are more qualified to teach?</comment>

<comment>EXCEPT public school something no home school can. It socializes children. I exposes children to other children of different backgrounds and thoughts. It forces children to get along with each other because they are lumped together. It prepares them for a diverse world and teaches them to respect other.</comment>

<comment>It can also argued that suburban public schools often lack diversity in their student bodies so they do not always achieve a goal of exposing children to a board diversity of background/thought.  Also, dedicated home schooling parents often have their children enrolled in activities like sports and other after school programs that can achieve similar goals.  A well rounded experience for a student being home schooled can be achieved, but it requires a great deal of effort on the part of the parents.</comment>

<comment>I hear their Prom is awesome.!</comment>

<comment>Suburban households are comprised of various diversities. Work experience, life experiences, financial experiences, and beliefs. Yes some may not be as ethnically diverse....BUT they are VASTLY more diverse than any home school.</comment>

<comment>As I said, home schooling parents that are dedicated  frequently have their children in the same after school activities as public school children which serves the purpose of exposure to the community.  I'm no home schooling advocate (I just don't think it can be dismissed out of hand), but I believe dedication by parents gets a great outcome in both a home school or public school setting.</comment>

<comment>Urban schools are the ones that lack diversity, which is nothing but a failed fringe liberal go-to dog whistle. Suburban schools have for decades been much more multicultural.However, there are tons of social opps for homeschooled kids, even co-ops that offer fields trips to events and museums that cater to groups of homeschooled kids. Plenty of homeschooled kids participate in Scouts, local organized sports teams, summer camp, church holidays and events, along with a buffet of other social and cultural outlets - the same ones, if not more, than what public school kids experience. Homeschooling for the past 2 decades has been much more like a hybrid of private tutoring and public school, without all the drugs, violence, bullying, teen pregnancy, and juvie sneaking around behind parents' backs. Homeschool kids are the ones elite colleges now seek out, as they have the most involved, educated parents who've instilled good values and mature behaviors in their offspring as part of that close home environment. I've several friends whose parents gave their kids a choice of public, private and homeschool. One chose homeschooling for elementary grades and then chose to go to public high school, while her sister chose just the opposite. Another asked to go to private school after elementary homeschooling. All scored in the upper percentiles on tests and went on to elite colleges. One even met her husband to be at a social event for homeschooled kids while they were in 8th grade. My experience is the homeschooled take their academics both more seriously and more enjoyably, often are given the latitude and incentive to find and strengthen an artistic bent or musical talent or science interest that serves them well as adults. The homeschool kids I know around my neighborhood are very grounded, articulate and polite - the interesting ones parents don't mind having over to play. Whereas, the other neighborhood kids that go to public school are rude, scream a lot and already seem to be exhibiting that mean girl or oddball boy behaviors that public schools sometimes foster.</comment>

<comment>You have no idea what you are talking about. Homeschool families go to joint coops, have access to public school sports (they pay taxes remember), ... heck ... they have more and diverse socialization opportunities and skills for that matter. Your concept of what homeschooling is reeks of malice not knowledge. Oh, and I wanted my kids to go to school to LEARN the topics being taught not socialize so they will be good little Marxists when they grow up.</comment>

<comment>Very few "functioning" schools really teach science, especially prior to high school.  They generally teach facts and definitions from an authoritarian basis.  It's not all bad, but we don't teach students that they're just learning facts about the most current models that inevitably will be revised/replaced in the future.</comment>

<comment>I was making a point about privacy not about the efficacy of public schools</comment>

<comment>Well, you took the opportunity to take a very misinformed cheap shot.  Should that not be questioned?</comment>

<comment>As you wish and I bet your estimate of the quality of the child's home education is inversely proportional to the amount of religious training the get at their "home school"</comment>

<comment>If I'm interpreting your poorly constructed sentence correctly, you are saying that I think that more religious "training" would lead to a lower quality home education.  Is that what you think my view is, or are you saying that that is what you think?  Did you accidentally include the word "inversely"?</comment>

<comment>Sorry,I was home schooled. Yes religious families will not provide the training in science needed for a child to get a complete education. They also tend to shield their children from other points of view which to me is essential in developing the ability to analyze and process information</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry your parents didn't take your education seriously, but that doesn't give you the ability to use a broad brush to paint all homeschool kids' experience to be the same as yours.  I do think some homeschool situations can be isolationist, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.Also, don't think public schools are a panacea of critical thought.  School science, especially in early grades, are all about transmitting "facts" designed to support an approved position (sounds like your experience). They hardly even pretend to take on the serious work of understanding physical models and reconciling them with measurement and observations.  Overall, they tend to just substitute a more useful and publicly palatable dogma, without the history of the development of that dogma.</comment>

<comment>Again the original post was not meant as an all out attack on home schooling and you have very good points. I am concerned and skeptical about those that home school because of religious beliefs. Education is not something that should be based of faith and often religious house holds tend to reject critical thinking as relates to the sciences and  social issues. I am sure there are many home schooling families that are doing an excellent job getting their kids prepared for a higher education. I really am not familiar with any studies on the issue and maybe biased about religious households after seeing a special on one of the nightly news programs that focused on religious families and home schooling</comment>

<comment>You are delusional if you believe that the founding fathers made the individual right to keep and bear arms dependent upon one's membership of a militia.  Perhaps your college professor successfully convinced you of that interpretation, and you are upset that it wasn't proven upon the latest test and direct question, but the law of the land does not support your weak argument.Sorry, but your supposition is unsupported and has been proven false.</comment>

<comment>Richard, do us all a favor and learn what a descriptive clause is and how it has now power to limit the independent clause.</comment>

<comment>A dependent clause, or subordinate clause, is a clause in a complex sentence that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and that functions within the sentence as a noun or adjective or adverb.The second amendment says: "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."By itself ,"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State" cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Therefore it is a dependent clause.However, a dependent clause can be either; a restrictive clause that limits or restricts the meaning of the noun phrase it modifies descriptive clause or, a nonrestrictive clause that does not limit or restrict the meaning of the noun phrase it modifies.You have not shown that "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State" is descriptive rather than restrictive. I tend to think it is restrictive. For example, read these sentences:“Their project being complete, the team disbanded.”  “Stern discipline being called for, the offending student was expelled.”In both cases, the initial dependent clause is not superfluous to the meaning of the entire sentence: it is integral.  The team disbanded because the project was complete; the student was expelled because his offense called for stern discipline.  This causal relationship cannot be ignored.Reading the Second Amendment as “A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right to bear arms shall not be infringed,” clearly shows the same causal relationship as the example sentences; in this case, that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed because it is essential to maintaining a well-regulated militia.However, I am not ideologically committed to one reading or the other, so have an open mind and would be interested in any examples of sentences with the same format/structure that illustrate your case for a different interpretation.</comment>

<comment>Not only do you have it backwards, but your logic is also flawed.One always argues logic from the main and not the secondary argument.In the 2nd Amendment,the main argument is:".. the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."The secondary argument is:"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State,.."Also it is subordinate to the main argument:".. the right of the people .. shall not be infringed."In the Constitution, the term "the people" does NOT have a restriction to members of the militia.Also, claiming that there is a restriction to members of the militia in effect constitutes an infringement to that right.It should also be noted that in your 2 examples, the justifications:“Their project being complete,..”“Stern discipline being called for,.."Do NOT constitute ANY kind of restriction on the respective principal arguments, NOR do they modifiy in any way the actions of the principal arguments.</comment>

<comment>"One always argues logic from the main and not the secondary argument."The second amendment is not an argument of logic. It is a simply a statement.</comment>

<comment>Nor did I claim that the 2nd Amendment was 'an argument of logic"...(Whatever that means)Clearly you are impaired both in reading skills and logical thinking..1) To analyze something logically, one uses the rules of logic2) The term argument in logic, is often used interchangeable with words like phrase, clause, element. But traditionally "argument" is used.My phrase:"One always argues logic from the main and not the secondary argument."stands..Instead of trying to split hairs to redirect, address the issue if you can.If you can't, I'll take that as your acceptance.</comment>

<comment>As far as trolling, I agree with the article.  I read it, I would have talked about it with reasonable people, but trolls like you do all you can to drown out the Constitutional rights of others.  Yeah, that thing you call a doormat.  So, if you are gone, then peace will again reign.Why are you over in Freitfart where you would be a good blend for the aroma.</comment>

<comment>Richard, historically speaking, there was no standing militia at the time the constitution was written. When needed, the militia was formed from the citizenry who brought their own equipment and weapons.  There wasn't the funds to equip a standing militia.  Also, the two clauses have always been interpreted as independent of one another and has been upheld recently by the supreme court.</comment>

<comment>LOLAnother progressive whose education makes him unable to read..The 2nd does NOT say, "the right of the militia to keep and bear arms", dummy.It's says ".. the right of the people to keep and bear arms.."And there is NOTHING there that says ".. the right of the people IN THE MILITIA to keep and bear arms.."</comment>

<comment>Correct me if I'm wrong as I'm not well versed in different methods of interpretation.Orginalist interpretation: Everyone has the right to bear muskets ("arms", at the time)Textualist interpretation: Everyone has the right to bear automatic weapons, RPG's, plain non-propelled grenades, armor piercing bullets, etc... ("arms" is not unambiguously defined as muskets)My (rhetorical) questions to you,Do you believe Madison predicted the brutal efficiency of modern "arms" when he chose to restrict their control from government and-effectively- grant them to everyone?If the intent of the amendment was to grant protections from government, namely not to limit the ability to rise up against a tyrannical federal government, why can't I have a tank parked out front while chilling with a stinger missile on my porch?Violence proliferates a lot faster now than when it usually required priming and loading a musket.Do you believe the constitution protects these technological advancements?If you do, please explain to me why. I'd want to try and understand your-and many Americans'- POV</comment>

<comment>Modern arms are no less brutal or efficient than arms at the time of the founders.Look up grape-shot.Look up grazing shot.And frankly, I consider going at each other with swords and bayonets, slicing and dicing to be just as brutal.Madison did NOT need to predict your so-called bruatl efficience of modern weapons, since after all the weapons at the time were themselves "brutally efficient"The tools used may differ. But the objective of the tools does NOT !War has ALWAYS been a brutal thing.And the carnage of war has always been achieved by the most efficient weapons of the time.Nothing has changed.The 2nd amendment serves MULTIPLE purposes, contrary to the hoplophobe argumentsFirst and FOREMOST, it's a recognition of the INDIVIDUAL right to self-defense.But how does an individual defend against a state that decides to butcher it's own people and is able to afford a more brutal tool to make people submit to superior force,The ONLY way possible is to have the SAME arms as the state, and to OUTNUMBER the minions of the state.And that is the second intent of the 2nd Amendment.To insure that the citizens have the very same weapons that the state could use against the citizens. Thus discouraging the state from trying unless it's willing to pay a high price.So all this nonsense about which arms are more or less brutal are COMPLETELY irrelevant. Not to mention beside the point.I would suggest that the carnage of Waterloo, the trenches of WWI, the Islands of the Pacific were equally brutal and horrific.But I consider the democide that occured in (Nazi) Germany, the Soviet, China, the Soviet (Warsaw Pact) Satraps, Vietnam, Cambodia, Cuba, etc. were far more horrific and brutal, because one side was completely disarmed and unable to defend itself at all.Now the Feds have been downloading military arms to the local police, include MRAPs, what do you think a shotgun or rifle can do against such over-powering weapons in the face of the intent of the framers NOT TO ALLOW such an advantage to the state ?The framers were quite right to use "arms" instead of muskets, after all people were still fighting close quarters with swords, spears and clubs. The understood the concept that1) Arms would change and improve2) The state would be at the forefront of obtaining such arms3) Letting only the state have access, would change the balance of power.And the 2nd Amendment is ALL about keeping power in the hands of the citizens, and not the state.The Constitution and declaration of independence clearly says so.And the ONLY way to insure that the balance of power remains in the hands of the general population and NOT the state, is to make sure that the arms issued ot the minions of the state, are also in the hands of the general population.--Oh and your claim that:"Violence proliferates a lot faster now than when it usually required priming and loading a musket."is false.US citizens have been on a weapons buying binge for the last 8+ years.And yet, during that same time Violence has fallen as more and more people are arming themselves.--You really rethink your basic premises.Even the British are waking up.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Same for Australiahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>All your correlations and false equivalences aside... Your argument in theory states that Citizens should own nukes to be on par with the feds.I'm not even going to address the lethality issue. To say that weapons in the 18th century are on par with modern arms, including swords and bayonets (lol) is absolutely ludicrous. As is to say that the founders predicted the trajectory arms would take in development. Can anyone today predict what warfare will look like 3.5 centuries from now?</comment>

<comment>Why do you numbnuts ignore what is written to pull out of (your asses) the hoary old cliche about nukesI very CLEARLY stated that the most important objective was to insure that people had the arms for PERSONAL DEFENSEWhen was the last time ANYONE, except for you ignorant morons EVERY consider a nuke to be usable for "personal defense" ??---------If you're not going to address something then don't bring it upAnd if you're going to claim not to address something, then don't prove yourself a liar by doing exactly that in the sentences to follow.But your non-address of the lehatlity issue, is a false one anyway.The framers were in the period where guns were just becoming the primary weapon for personal and military use.At the time, the Indians were still using spears, and bows and arrows.It is why, unlike such as you, being the well-educated men that they were, they used the term "arms" instead of "firearms" or even more specifically terms like "gun" or "musket" or "rifle".They knew very well, that evolution would follow, INCLUDING in personal and military arms.That is ALSO why they included the militia clause as a justificatory (and not restrictive) clause, in the 2nd Amendment. To insure that people understood that the arms MOST PROTECTED would be lthose that men would need for militia duty.It is NOT possible to have a "well regulated militia" showing up under-equipped to face whatever would be a modern army in the future..So they did NOT need to predict what arms would be used in the future.They KNEW that arms would evolve. And therefore, a "well regulated militia" would need to have members who had access to those arms that would be standard military issue to soldiers, that those militias would be facing.And that is why today, the weapons that are standard issue to government minions, are also the most protected by the 2nd Amendment.Which is also why current gun control laws restricting such access are unconstitutional because they infringe.</comment>

<comment>1)Ok so... no nukes... but where's the cutoff according to you or personal protection? Yea your right, its ludicrous to need a nuke for personal protection... unless you deal in absolutes. That was my point.If nukes existed back then, they would certainly have a problem with the feds having a monopoly on them. However, "government minions" (are you referring to police, fbi, etc...?) have way more firepower (standard issue) than the craziest law-abiding gun nut.What should citizens be allowed to possess if not nukes?Tanks? Machine guns? Remember your argument :'a "well regulated militia" would need to have members who had access to those arms that would be standard military issue to soldiers, that those militias would be facing.'2) The bill of Rights was to protect the rights of the states. Show me a legal argument that "that the most important objective was to insure that people had the arms for PERSONAL DEFENSE". Furthermore, I agree they meant the second amendment to afford personal defense, they may even had considered it more important (i don't see that)... How does that negate the purpose of the other clause?? (protection from the federal government)3) Your factually wrong that they were jut switching to gunpowder then. Look up "early modern warfare". It happened centuries earlier.4) I'm not going to engage in a debate on the trajectory of arms lethality with someone who posits that "Modern arms are no less brutal or efficient than arms at the time of the founders." That is factually incorrect. There have been many studies commissioned over the years on weapon systems efficiency. Go ahead, equivocate. Yes, surely grapeshot is as lethal and efficient as automatics loaded with fmjs. You realize barrels didn't even have rifling back then? That's where the expression "don't shoot till you see the whites of their eyes comes from"5) Did the founders predict that technology would evolve? Of course they did. That's not my argument.</comment>

<comment>Read what I wrote a month agoI'm not going to repeat myself</comment>

<comment>Ok. Don't.Can you please explain what arms citizens should own then?</comment>

<comment>Asked and answeredGo back to the top of this threadRead ALL my comments CAREFULLYParticularly the one from a month ago and the one from yesterday</comment>

<comment>I looked, am having trouble finding where you stated what the cutoff for personal arms should be. If you could please copy and paste what your asking me to find it would be quite helpful.</comment>

<comment><sigh>Do you people even bother thinking ?Do you even understand the meaning of the words you bandy around without actually stopping and thinking about their meaning ?Do you ever take those terms and apply them to civilian, police and military usage ?Let's have a random list..Abrams tank........ NoSidearm................YesRifle......................YesStinger Missile......NoShotgun................YesRPG......................YesNuclear bomb.......NoGo back a day and read what I wrote about the militia clause and it's implication of what arms should be protected to satisfy that requirementNote also that 1+ year ago, DHS (Homeland Security) put out an RFP defining "select-fire AR pattern rifles" as PDWs (Personal Defense Weapons).If it's good enough for DHS, it's good enough for "the people"Because one side of the 2nd Amendment is defense against a government going rogue and forgetting who it works for.</comment>

<comment>Ok cool, so at least we agree that regulation should exist regarding arms for individuals. How anything beyond a low capacity handgun/shotgun is necessary for self-defense is beyond me.I fail to see how that withstands constitutional scrutiny though.How do you manage to interpret that some arms should be afforded to militias but restricted for civilians when the militia is composed of citizens?Also, not that it concerns me personally, but I just wonder with all the restrictions your placing, how does one rebel against a tyrannical government that has no restrictions...?</comment>

<comment>Also, realize that your arguing that non-convicted urban gang members can wield assault weapons and rpgs. If that were the case we'd look a lot more like Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Stop with the ignorant boogieman arguments.They are ONLY TRUE if you are stupid enough to believe that criminals have no problems getting guns on the black market, if they are willing to spend the money.Just look to Mexico, with it's strict gun laws, and cartels better armed than their police and military, terrorizing the general population.Hell we even have the Obama adminstration providing them with guns bought illegally in the US.And again, just because YOU piss your pants at that boogieman fantasy, is NO EXCUSE to infringe on the RIGHTS of everyone else to be able to defend themselves while you fill your shortsFinally, do a bit of web searching about how to build your own guns, you will find that building an open bold machine pistol is easier than building a semi-automatic rifle.So that whole fear-mongering about assault rifles and RPGs" is just that fear mongeringTry something else.</comment>

<comment>Please don't devolve to insults, I've been nothing but patient with you, but accusing me of not being concerned about humans self defense is simply wrong. It's the FIRST and possibly MOST NATURAL human right in human history when you think about it.How are people unable to reasonably defend themselves with pistols/shotguns? You realize the VAST majority of successful self defense involving guns happens when you draw the firearm, not pull the trigger(and even then, most successful acts of self defense involving discharge are warning shots). ITS THE THREAT THAT'S THE DETTERENT. Your fantasy of shooting the bad guy dead is just that- a fantasy.You honestly believe that someone gearing up to harm you will be any less/more deterred by the deadliness of the weapon behind the barrel they are staring down- Have you ever had a loaded gun pointed at you? Or that the grade of weaponry you own will matter at all if they have the jump on you?Of course this all irrelevant, because if we are being honest with ourselves, the founders intent of the second amendment for EVERY PURPOSE (my original point- not sure how we got here) was for CITIZENS TO HAVE POWER MORE OR LESS EQUAL TO THE MILITARY. This was in fear of an autocratic government denying individuals rights. Fortunately, because of the rest of the constitution, this is extremely unlikely to ever occur.They did not and could not predict the collateral damage and lethal potential of modern arms. Hence the need for an additional amendment defining (regulating) which arms are appropriate for whom.And somehow I doubt a Tyranny invested enough to destroy democracy in America would bother to engage the gun wielding populace in urban warfare. Think of how shitty things would be at that point. They'd just drop chemical bombs on their malcontents like every other modern dictatorship.</comment>

<comment>Don't expect people to appreciate you insulting their intelligence with stupid boogieman arguments.If you don't want to be called on them, don't spew themAnd there is a difference between saying:"your argument is stupid"and"you are stupid"The first denigrates your argument, not you---------------When you argue that contrary to all the historical data, the 2nd Amendment is about arming the militia, when it is about the right of "the people" and not "the militia"You are in no position to claim being about the right of self-That's like someone who keeps saying "I get it" and then demonstrates repeatedly that they are cluelessAfter a while, they don't get taken seriously------------Did you have a point to make about your paragraph on deterrence ?With 2,500,000 DGUS. and about 100,000 people being shot, it doesn't take a lot of brains to know that most DGUs are not "shots fired" situations.-------------There are TONS of DGUs where the Bad guys had their guns out, and the intended victim was able to draw and scare them off. In some instantes with shots fired, in many more without.Most criminals REALLY, REALLY do NOT want to get into a shooting match.They'd much ratherr run away and find an easier mark.So again what was your point ?-----------------You need to re-write that last paragraph so that it makes sense.Muddled thinking leads to muddles sentences.</comment>

<comment>"When you argue that contrary to all the historical data, the 2nd Amendment is about arming the militia, when it is about the right of "the people" and not "the militia"I'm arguing the same point as you silly, except with more honest implications, especially when viewed from a textualist position.

<comment>As for the Mexico-US comparison,You don't see the difference between Mexico and the U.S.?The answer is poor economic development, endemic government corruption, and most importantly the wealth generated by controlling the US supply for drugs and the requirement of violence to maintain control. If cartels didn't have money, could they afford the level of violence they propagate and the amount of officials they corrupt? A vicious cycle indeed.Yea fast and furious was shameful but that's besides the point- its not statistically significant to the method of Mexican gangs procuring arms illegally.Almost all illegal guns in Mexico come from the US.Yes. I completely agree that determined criminals will go to no ends to get their hands on what they want... but would you agree that its much harder(not impossible).. for say gangs to get their hands on illegal weapons with national regulation?The relevant difference between those societies and the US is our ability to enforce legislation, primarily through the government having a monopoly on military power (the lacking characteristic of every failed state today). Look up "Peace of Westphalia" and see how Europe fared before hand.</comment>

<comment>When idiots trot out the gun control does not work wihere there is no economic development, they in effect admit that gun control does not workThere are a whole bunch of places where the lack of "economic development"  is far greater than places like Mexico, and yet do NOT have the crime rate that Mexico or Jamaica have.It's a weasel argument.There is a DIRECT correlation between a disarmed population and an abusive and corrupt government, and rampant crime.If Mexicans could exercise their RKBA as outlined in their constitution WITHOUT the over-lapping that have been imposed by their government, whose ONLY purpose is to disarm them, they would no be defenseless against criminals and corrupt government officials.And in Mexico, you are COMPLETELY wrong, the government has NO PROBLEMS  "enforcing their regulations" against the law-abiding.That's why Mexicans are disarmed.Funny that.</comment>

Your'e considering two variables in a vacuum."There is a DIRECT correlation between a disarmed population and an abusive and corrupt government, and rampant crime."- I'm not familiar how a disarmed population = rampant crime.. example? Also notice this is a correlation, not a causation. An important distinction considering abusive governments are the cause of a disarmed population, not vice-versa."If Mexicans could exercise their RKBA as outlined in their constitution WITHOUT the over-lapping that have been imposed by their government, whose ONLY purpose is to disarm them, they would no be defenseless against criminals and corrupt government officials."-Mexican army just allegedly executed over 40 cartel members. This isn't a one time occurence either."And in Mexico, you are COMPLETELY wrong, the government has NO PROBLEMS "enforcing their regulations" against the law-abiding.That's why Mexicans are disarmed."Which government has trouble enforcing regulations against citizens who obey them...? lol. Law abiding Mexicans aren't the problem in Mexico.</comment>

<comment>Also,Please don't devolve to insults, I've been nothing but patient with you, but accusing me of not being concerned about humans self defense is simply wrong. It's the FIRST and possibly MOST NATURAL human right in human history when you think about it.How are people unable to reasonably defend themselves with pistols/shotguns? You realize the VAST majority of successful self defense involving guns happens when you draw the firearm, not pull the trigger(and even then, most successful acts of self defense involving discharge are warning shots). ITS THE THREAT THAT'S THE DETTERENT. Your fantasy of shooting the bad guy dead is just that- a fantasy.You honestly believe that someone gearing up to harm you will be any less/more deterred by the deadliness of the weapon behind the barrel they are staring down- Have you ever had a loaded gun pointed at you?Or that the grade of weaponry you own will matter at all if they have the jump on you?Of course this all irrelevant, because if we are being honest with ourselves, the founders intent of the second amendment for EVERY PURPOSE (my original point- not sure how we got here) was for CITIZENS TO HAVE POWER MORE OR LESS EQUAL TO THE MILITARY. This was in fear of an autocratic government denying individuals rights. Fortunately, because of the rest of the constitution, this is extremely unlikely to ever occur.They did not and could not predict the collateral damage and lethal potential of modern arms. Hence the need for an additional amendment defining (regulating) which arms are appropriate for whom.And somehow I doubt a Tyranny invested enough to destroy democracy in America would bother to engage the gun wielding populace in urban warfare. Think of how shitty things would be at that point. They'd just drop chemical bombs on their malcontents like every other modern dictatorship.</comment>

<comment>Your claim that I am " considering two variables in a vacuum", because of "the other dynamics in place", is patently false.Were it true, we would NOT have all cases of:-- More guns, More crime,-- More guns, Less crime,-- Less guns, More crime,-- Less guns, Less crime,That fact that ALL 4 conditions exist IRRESPECTIVE of "other dynamics", proves that notion completely false.Because in effect it means it is COMPLETELY independent of those "other dynamics"This is simple logic..And this basically shoots down the rest of your spiel..</comment>

<comment>Buddy, where do those 4 conditions exist irrespective of other dynamics?Your proving my point for me by stating that one variable is not dependent on the other.C'mon nowTalk about simple logic.</comment>

<comment>1) Now where did I write that I support regulation regarding arms for individuals.Still haven't read what I wrote..Or understood it for that matter.Do NOT try to put words in my mouth2) The stupid argument that you don't need limited capacity for self-defense is one of the most stupid of the hoplophobe arguments.Why do you think the police and military use large capacity magazines for self-defenseWhat makes you naive enough to imagine that the same standards and need don't apply to civilians ?Transfer that stupid argument to let's say, fire extinguishers.Although firefigters have access to unlimited size fire extinguishers, civilians don't need</n> anything bigger than a 1 gallon one, nor do they need more than one..Hello ?Who decides arbitrarily that one gallon is enough to do the job.Having been a volunteer firefighter/EMT, I can tell you that my advice to homeowners, is to have many as they want, and as big as they want.I use the same logic to magazine capacity.And you might want to watch this to see how really ignorant3) And even more important, is the basic premise behind the magazine capacity restriction. It is allegedly to stop criminals from using such magazine.And that raises 3 problems:a) What evidence is there that such a ban would work ?b) How would such a ban protected the homeowner in this situation ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?...c) Why should the ability of the law-abiding be restricted based on a fear of a very small minority abusing that ability ?Would anyone try to argue to limit free speech, because some people swear offensively in public ?4) Finally.To maintain control of a population, you need boots on the ground to enforce power against individuals.In ALL such cases the population largely outnumbers the minions of the government by a large rationThe ONLY advantage those minions have is that they usually can bring greater force to bear against individuals.You should learn the lesson of Solzhenitsynhttp://www.goodreads.com/quote..."And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.”</comment>

<comment>You believe the rights of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed, I get that's your position. I mentioned that I get that.Where's the cutoff for you? What form do "arms" take when they become irrelevant for personal protection (for instance, is it anything but WMD's)?I'm sincerely trying to understand your position.</comment>

<comment>There is no "should."It is either there or it's not there.And - it is not there.   They found it using words like "penumbra" and "emanation."But - the good news is that there is a process to amend the constitution.  But, I realize it's easier to make shit up.</comment>

<comment>Liberal hero Ruth Bader Ginsburg thinks that Roe was a poor decision:“Roe, I believe, would have been more acceptable as a judicial decision if it had not gone beyond a ruling on the extreme statute before the Court. … Heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.” — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Courthttp://www.nationalrighttolife...Do you know more than her?  If so, you are admitting she's incompetent.  If not, then you have to concede she agrees with me on Roe, NOT you.</comment>

<comment>Problem here is that the word "privacy" in the 1780s meant something rather drastically different than it does today...something that it would be silly to include in the constitution.</comment>

<comment>“Roe, I believe, would have been more acceptable as a judicial decision if it had not gone beyond a ruling on the extreme statute before the Court. … Heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.” — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme CourtDo you disagree with Ruth?</comment>

<comment>I don't. Sorry. I misread your question initially.And I probably wouldn't have directly responded to my assertion, either.</comment>

<comment>It meant probably the very same thing when British troops could simply kick down your door and ransack your home and place of business.The concept hasn't changed that much.Just the means of invading it have.</comment>

<comment>The concept of  what we call "privacy" nowadays may not have changed, but the meaning of the word sure has. In the 1770s/80s (and probably before and after, too, but those times are to a certain extent irrelevant,) "privacy" referred (colloquially) to using the bathroom and/or keeping secrets (depending on locale.) The word didn't come into the vernacular to mean what we now use it to mean for another 40 or so years.</comment>

<comment>Cool then your state can pass laws on how many children you have and how they are educated. Might help bring the south and Midwest into the 21rst century</comment>

<comment>You do know that the Constitution doesn't grant rights but instead infers powers on the Federal branch... right?</comment>

<comment>Then what would you call the bill of rights?</comment>

<comment>A statement of what rigths the government can NOT abuse and step on.</comment>

<comment>We could amend the constitution to protect our privacy. Funny thing about the constitution is the built-in mechanism for updates. The Supreme Court was not designed to create rights. Congress can do so, but it takes lots of persuasion. That's why libs prefer having unaccountable, unelected judges do it. </comment>

<comment>The government does not "create rights".  Rights are a given.  The Constitution was intended to set limits on governmental powers.  How far we have strayed.</comment>

<comment>Of course you are correct. The point is that we can do these things without unelected justices dismantling our constitution bit by bit and abandoning any remaining notion of the rule of laws instead of the rule of men</comment>

<comment>Not if one doesn't exist. It's not a matter of "should" so much as "is there?"</comment>

<comment>You and Scalia would agree</comment>

<comment>I guess so?</comment>

<comment>And apparently that is a problem ??</comment>

<comment>Yeah, right.  It's entirely "tortured" to interpret a right to privacy in a constitution that also includes requirements for search warrants.</comment>

<comment>"...to find a right to privacy where one didn't exist."So you have no expectation of privacy whatsoever? The gov't can legitimately access any information about you for any reason or no reason.  Interesting. So what's all that stuff about search warrants about?</comment>

<comment>That's a straw man.   I am actually a supporter of legal abortion; I just hate it when judges short-circuit the process.  It's really OK to say that you liked the outcome of Roe while conceding that the legal logic was tortured.The notion that the "judges made it up" is a big problem.  The reason that oppostion to gay marriage is fading is that the states are actually passing laws and debating the issues.  This should have happened with abortion.Read and learn:In the Yale Law Journal, eminent legal scholar John Hart Ely, a supporter of legal abortion, complained that Roe is “bad constitutional law, or rather … it is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.” He wrote:“What is unusual about Roe is that the liberty involved is accorded … a protection more stringent, I think it is fair to say, than that the present Court accords the freedom of the press explicitly guaranteed by the First Amendment. What is frightening about Roe is that this super-protected right is not inferable from the language of the Constitution, the framers’ thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the nation’s governmental structure. Nor is it explainable in terms of the unusual political impotence of the group judicially protected vis-a-vis the interests that legislatively prevailed over it. And that, I believe … is a charge that can responsibly be leveled at no other decision of the past twenty years. At times the inferences the Court has drawn from the values the Constitution marks for special protection have been controversial, even shaky, but never before has its sense of an obligation to draw one been so obviously lacking.”Below are criticisms of Roe from other supporters of legal abortion.“One of the most curious things about Roe is that, behind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found.” — Laurence H. Tribe, Harvard law professor“As a matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, Roe borders on the indefensible. I say this as someone utterly committed to the right to choose. … Justice Blackmun’s opinion provides essentially no reasoning in support of its holding. And in the … years since Roe’s announcement, no one has produced a convincing defense of Roe on its own terms.” — Edward Lazarus, former clerk to Justice Harry Blackmun“The failure to confront the issue in principled terms leaves the opinion to read like a set of hospital rules and regulations. … Neither historian, nor layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded that all the prescriptions of Justice Blackmun are part of the Constitution.” — Archibald Cox, Harvard law professor, former U.S. Solicitor General“[I]t is time to admit in public that, as an example of the practice of constitutional opinion writing, Roe is a serious disappointment. You will be hard-pressed to find a constitutional law professor, even among those who support the idea of constitutional protection for the right to choose, who will embrace the opinion itself rather than the result. This is not surprising. As a constitutional argument, Roe is barely coherent. The court pulled its fundamental right to choose more or less from the constitutional ether.” — Kermit Roosevelt, University of Pennsylvania law professor“Roe, I believe, would have been more acceptable as a judicial decision if it had not gone beyond a ruling on the extreme statute before the Court. … Heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.” — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court“In the Court’s first confrontation with the abortion issue, it laid down a set of rules for legislatures to follow. The Court decided too many issues too quickly. The Court should have allowed the democratic processes of the states to adapt and to generate sensible solutions that might not occur to a set of judges.” — Cass Sunstein, University of Chicago law professor“Judges have no special competence, qualifications, or mandate to decide between equally compelling moral claims (as in the abortion controversy). … [C]lear governing constitutional principles … are not present [in Roe].” — Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor“[O]verturning [Roe] would be the best thing that could happen to the federal judiciary. … Thirty years after Roe, the finest constitutional minds in the country still have not been able to produce a constitutional justification for striking down restrictions on early-term abortions that is substantially more convincing than Justice Harry Blackmun’s famously artless opinion itself.” — Jeffrey Rosen, legal commentator, George Washington University law professor“Blackmun’s [Supreme Court] papers vindicate every indictment of Roe: invention, overreach, arbitrariness, textual indifference.” — William Saletan, Slate columnist, writing in Legal Affairs“In the years since the decision an enormous body of academic literature has tried to put the right to an abortion on firmer legal ground. But thousands of pages of scholarship notwithstanding, the right to abortion remains constitutionally shaky. … [Roe] is a lousy opinion that disenfranchised millions of conservatives on an issue about which they care deeply.” — Benjamin Wittes, Brookings Institution fellow“Although I am pro-choice, I was taught in law school, and still believe, that Roe v. Wade is a muddle of bad reasoning and an authentic example of judicial overreaching.” — Michael Kinsley, columnist, writing in the Washington Post.http://www.nationalrighttolife...</comment>

<comment>It is not a straw man.  It is a fact.  You believe privacy is constitutionally protected so long as it is the privacy that is meaningful to you.</comment>

<comment>You just ignored all of those quotes didn't you?You like Roe v. Wade and don't care about the legalities. That's fine - just say that.</comment>

<comment>It's cherry picked quotes pulled from the National Right to Life site.  So, there's some legal dissent.  That true of a lot of SCOTUS decisions.  It doesn't change the fact that the court established that constitutionally a woman's right to privacy and bodily autonomy related to medical decisions is superior to that of the interests of the gov't.  It is uncontroversial when the same constitutional protections are applied to matters of criminal justice.</comment>

<comment>"Roberts made a brave decision to choose judicial legitimacy over ideological purity"Changing the law to make it constitutional is not judicial legitimacy -- that's judicial activism at minimum. I guess that's an accepted practice in liberal circles.</comment>

<comment>Its impossible to not be a judicial activist. Its impossible to draft laws (or a constitution) that can account for every situation, so the judiciary is around to interpret laws and the constitution. The very notion of interpretation implies subjectivity, because even if you are following strict precedence guidelines, every case has at least one or two instances wherein the judge must make a factual determination, and factual determinations are entirely subjective. So every judge that interprets a law or constitution relies on his own personal experiences or points of view at least part of the time when adjudicating disputes. And relying on your own views is essentially what judicial activism is (whether you pretend to be an activist or not.)If you don't want judges making subjective decisions or interpreting laws, than you don't want a judiciary.</comment>

<comment>I'm no fan of the PPACA as I think it's a huge tax give away to insurance agencies and does nothing to better healthcare for Americans. However, your logic is flawed in that a penalty is not a tax. If you don't believe the Federal Government can levy penalties then why can the EPA, ATF, IRS, SEC, and a myriad of other alphabet soup agencies fine people/corporations for violation of regulations established based on laws (like the HHS/IRS with the PPACA)?</comment>

<comment>Oh, and yes we were Grubered about "taxes" in the PPACA. Go figure.</comment>

<comment>Maybe I should have been clearer. Of course govt can fine for breaking law, but they can't fine for not engaging in commerce per US constitution. There is no federal precedence for this. </comment>

<comment>The very title of the article brings us to the issue of whether John Roberts was qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice in the first place.  The trials of John Roberts?  Did he have any?   Has he ever tried a civil or criminal case as a trial lawyer?  Was he even ever a trial court level judge?   Has he never picked a jury?  Has he never represented a defendant in a criminal death penalty case, or the state?   I think the answer to the above is no.  He is unfit.  So are the rest of the bench.</comment>

<comment>Stealing a columnist's line I read months ago. Are the Justices simply politicians in robes? I would argue largely, yes.</comment>

<comment>I would stipulate it is the REPUBLICAN justices that are so inclined.</comment>

<comment>You would stipulate your own partisan ignorance?</comment>

<comment>Agreed Jesse. The major judicial activists decisions come from the non-textualists which are, of course, the emotion-based liberal side of the court.</comment>

<comment>The major judicial activists are the emotion based reactionaries.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, child..No need to rephrase what others write..The reactionaries react with emotion instead of thought..</comment>

<comment>There are none so blind as those who will not see (Richard).</comment>

<comment>I tend to hold the Chief Justice in a very dim light. I don't like his political convictions and especially don't like his leadership failures in letting the court turn into a political mechanism (again).However, he does have Harvard Law Degree, and was Editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then spent several years in presidential administrations, culminating as white house counsel. Then he went into corporate private practice for 15 years. Then he was appointed to the DC circuit for a couple of years.He doesn't have a ton of judicial experience, but some people (not me) view that as a good quality in a Supreme Court justice. Either way its hard to argue he's unqualified. But plenty of qualified people are inept at or unsuited for their job.</comment>

<comment>His "leadership failures" are because the four liberal Justices will side with the Executive Branch every time on Constitutional issues, lock step.  They believe in making up the Constitution as you go along.</comment>

<comment>"they believe in making up the Constitution as you go along"So did the drafters. That's why they left it intentionally vague and open to interpretation.</comment>

<comment>No they didn't.  If you care to look less ignorant read the Federalist Papers.</comment>

<comment>I have. The idea behind much of it was flexibility because the drafters couldn't agree on anything. Madison wasn't writing for all the drafters, he was writing for the federalist drafters. And the federalist drafters didn't draft the thing independently, they had to cooperate with the Jeffersonians.</comment>

<comment>I've read most of them. They were written in an attempt to convince non-federalists to approve the constitution. But the federalists didn't write the thing independently, they did it in cooperation with the Jeffersonian democrats. It was left flexible because those two groups couldn't actually agree on that much. Folks back then really weren't all that much different than folks today in that regard, and just like it does today, it leads to vague measures that are arrived at through compromise. Maybe "intentionally" vague is a bit misleading, but vaugue it is none the less. (and 1000 times more if we are talking about bill of rights and other amendments. You think they didn't know people would dispute what "abridging the freedom of speech" exactly means?)The very nature of rules implies interpretation because they can't possibly be written in a way that foresees all the factual scenarios that will be implicated by those rules. </comment>

<comment>There are no requirements to being a USSC Justice aside from being a citizen....</comment>

<comment>Jeffrey Rosen on the other hand is one of the best commenters on Supreme Court issues that one can find on TV, the magazines or the web.</comment>

<comment>I cannot understand why commentators persist in casting the mantle of seriousness over this whole debate.  There is no way to seriously read the ACA as having prohibited tax subsidies to residents of states where the federal government set up exchanges.   The fact that several of the justices are likely to draw that conclusion indicates that they are no more than political hacks who decide their cases on purely ideological grounds.  As such they have no business being justices, much less judges.   I would fairly say that anyone who votes against the ACA in King v. Burwell should lose his seat on the court and should be forced to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>What happens if this case destroys America's healthcare system?Would you call that a "good" thing?Is your Republican "plan" ready to go?This case has no merit beyond reactionary tactics.</comment>

<comment>The US Healthcare System has already been destroyed.  A proper ruling on this matter could and should provide time for Congress to address and correct the system.</comment>

<comment>hahahahhahaahahah! Good one.</comment>

<comment>Ruling in favor of Burwell wouldn't destroy the healthcare system.  Do you think it was a 3rd world nightmare prior ot 2010?  What an ignorant assertion you make.</comment>

<comment>So again you are calling for judicial activism through emotionalism instead of what a law actually says. It is not a courts job to keep a law from being good or bad for the country. That is the job of the legislature. If the Congress hadn't passed the stupid Senate version of the PPACA just to get it through by legal finagling then we wouldn't have this problem as the House version called for subsidies for both State and Federal exchanges. You are clueless about how this all works based on your emotional diatribes here.</comment>

<comment>I've read the opinions and they display a breathtaking lack of understanding of context, which as anyone who uses language to communicate realizes, is quite important.  To read the law without context is simply partisan hackery and not worthy of anyone involved in the judicial process, your ignorant bleating notwithstanding.</comment>

<comment>Which context are you referring to?  The legislation included language to disallow exchanges or subsidies to the protected territories.  The law sought to end all Medicaid subsidies (saved by Roberts in a 6-3 decision) if a state didn't comply.  Is your assertion that the law was to maximize coverage when it would have seriously destroyed coverage based on the Medicaid language?</comment>

<comment>My assertion is that the law allowed for subsidies in states where the federal government was operating the exchange.   My basis for this assertion beyond the language in the law as a whole, is the obvious and well documented intent of congress in drafting the law.</comment>

<comment>It did no such thing.  The language was added intentionally in later drafts of the bill.  Saying it allowed for subsidies in states is totally ignoring the draft history of the bill.As for your law as a whole, how does it coincide with the two parts of the law the lowered the coverage?  You seemed to have ignored that completely.  I wonder why....As for the "well documented intent", I am sure you would love to provide the contemporary quotes supporting that idea... the DoJ forgot to include those in any of their briefs to the USSC.</comment>

<comment>wishful thinking does not constitute a refutation of facts.   So either you live on a different planet or are willingly ignoring facts.  Either way it's quite pathetic.</comment>

<comment>You haven't presented a single fact.  I brought up two instances in the bill that would reduce coverage.  Try again.</comment>

<comment>You're the one trying to overturn the law.  The proof is up to you and so far I'm singularly unimpressed by your blatherings.</comment>

<comment>That's not how statutory construction works.. Wow it's like arguing with a child.  Statutory construction does not require the defendant nor the plaintiff to prove construction.  They both argue their sides and the judicial decides on the more likely construction.You really aren't a smart person... are you.</comment>

<comment>Jesse,With all due respect, you have no idea what you are talking about.  There is simply no way from reading the statute or studying the history of the legislation to arrive at the conclusion that the law's intent is that the subsidies only applied to states which operate their own exchanges except through willful ignorance or malice.  You are obviously a numbskull so I'm going with willful ignorance in your case.</comment>

<comment>King, can you provide just one simple fact.  Just one?  You honestly keep making generalized arguments without any actual items to back you up.  You have incorrectly stated more than one item that not even the Federal Government argued in their briefs.  You claim I don't know what I am talking about but have presented actual facts that are easily verifiable.You keep claiming the law's intent yet have no actual citations to back up your assertion.If the intent was to provide subsidies on the Federal exchanges, provide contemporary statements regarding it.  Here's a hint:  There are none.  The Federal briefs didn't include any.  Your assertion is baseless and false.  The original draft IRS rule even only allowed subsidies on the STATE exchanges and only changed it after states refused to set up their exchanges.If your assertion is that the law intended to cover as many as possible, once again you ignore the fact that the original law took away Medicaid dollars form non compliant states as well as disallowing subsidies to the protected territories.  So once again, your assertion is baseless.Look, King... provide one actual citation of fact and I'll believe you have even an inkling of what the argument actually is.You have a lot of posts with actual no base for your assertions.  It is ironic that you call me the willfully ignorant when EVERY single one of your assertions is baseless.</comment>

<comment>I've provided all the facts that I need to provide.  The law is in fact law.  It's been interpreted in my way by a majority of the courts taking a look at this issue as well as the IRS which according to SCOTUS doctrine, deserves deference.  The law itself but for 4 unfortunate words taken out of context provides for the payment of subsidies to all qualifying citizens no matter where they reside. Surely you cannot believe as you seem to suggest that Congress didn't intend for the subsidies to be limited to state run exchanges because noone at the time suggested that that was a desirable outcome.  Your discussion is simply wishful thinking; akin to a belief in mermaids and unicorns.   I suggest you get your head out of the clouds (or your ass where it is more likely lodged) and face the music.</comment>

<comment>Read section 1311 and section 1321. You are correct the law is the law and the law says EXPLICITLY that subsidies are for exchanges established by the state under section 1311. Don't cry now because the Senate version of the bill (which was NOT debated or discussed, that was the House version) sucks even worse than the House version.</comment>

<comment>That's an idiotic interpretation taken out of context of the rest of the law.   You obviously didn't read any further but context does matter and simply cannot be wished away because you'd prefer it so.</comment>

<comment>You have to prove that no reasonable person could interpret the law the way the administration and the drafters intended. Only liars or stupid people can claim they can prove that.</comment>

<comment>There is no language in the ACA disallowing exchanges or subsidies in the protected(sic) territories. Quite the opposite - there is specific language in the ACA requiring subsidies in Territorial Exchanges, funded from a speicial pot of money allocated for that purpose. This language was necessary for the same reason that the Exchanges were made optional in Territories - there is no income tax there, so tax credits were impossible.</comment>

<comment>I can't wait till the IRS is ordered to lower tax rates by the next president.  He is going to point out that the "context" of the selection of all tax rates CLEARLY indicated that every congressman and senator who voted in the affirmative "wished" taxes were lower.  Therefore, since the context of the law was such that the intent was to be lower, the president will order the IRS to lower the rate from say 36% to 26% citing the ONE character, in ONE law as ultimately NOT the right context to read the law.And then all hell will break loose.</comment>

<comment>"Can't possibly" is your opinion.Someone else can have an "absolutely probable" opinion.Therein lies the problem.Once a court decides that it can assign its own judgement on what the Congress intended, when the Congress is designed to amend and clarify its own laws, we cross a line that allows any court and any executive to decide for themselves what they think the "intent" really, secretly is.The proper thing for a court to do is say:  "The words in the law say X.  If the Congress wants the words to say something else, the Congress knows how, and is REQUIRED, to amend their own law by changing the language.  The courts refuse to do what the Congress is charged with doing."</comment>

<comment>No, your opinion and the justices you cite -- all disagree with other justices opinions and other people's opinions and THAT is exactly the point.  PS: The evidence you seek is the language of the Obamacare law which is absolutely NOT in question and which every justice agrees says exactly what it says.  No judge has magically found a new word in any sentence.  That's as powerful of evidence as could ever be had.Once you allow any/all justices or administrators to let THEIR opinion replace actual congressional language and legislation, then you have eviscerated the legislative process.  The day our country let's that happen we become modern day Brazil -- where any law means exactly what the dictator says, because he simply says that's what he thinks the law means.At least we agree that Congress can and should amend the law.  Our only disagreement on this front is that the court should kick it back to congress and say: "You wrote these words in the law.  If you want them changed, you change them.  We will not "interpret" the plain language of the law to mean something other than what it says because that is NOT our role as the judiciary.  Fix your problem congress.  You write the laws, we don't."That is the proper role for the judiciary.  Settling disputes that need congressional authority to settle should be settled by congressional authority.</comment>

<comment>NOW YOU GET IT!  Only WHEN the intent of Congress is obvious.  Yet here the record is excruciatingly clear that the intent is not obvious.  And here we have unobvious and controversial and opposite intents and opinions and we have a record of that.And that is NOT something the Justices fix.  That is something the Congress fixes.</comment>

<comment>Only one appeals court has agreed with plaintiffs - the DCCC. Of the nine judges who have ruled on this issue, three have agreed wth plaintiffs - two on the DCCC and one district court judge in Oklahoma.</comment>

<comment>Both opinions who agreed with the Federal prosecutor stated in their opinions that their decision was on a very fine line.  Not exactly a stellar declaration.</comment>

<comment>That is incorrect. There have been seven written opinions to date representing nine judges. Three judges ruled that the IRS reading of the ACA is unambiguously correct. Three judges ruled that the challengers' reading is unambiguously correct. One judge called the IRS reading "obviously"  better than the challengers'.Finally, two judges - the ones you have in mind - joined an opinion saying that the challengers' reading is plausible, but that the IRS reading is a little stronger. Under Chevron, however, that is not a "fine line" - the IRS reading only has to be permissable, not better, in order to be upheld by the court under Chevron deference.No one thinks this case is a close call - on either side!</comment>

<comment>Partisan hack appellate judges. Logic, facts and precedent says the plaintiffs lose 9 to 0. There are at least 4 votes for partisan hackery.</comment>

<comment>Even the initial IRS draft rule only allowed subsidies to state exchanges.  It was only changed after political pressure and the knowledge of half the states not complying with setting up their own exchanges.</comment>

<comment>That is nonsense.   The law was designed to allow the federal government to run exchanges and apply subsidies in states which did not run their own exchange.  If you believe the opposite you are mentally challenged.</comment>

<comment>I remember thinking back at the time that some of my friends' kids would be screwed (no subsidy) because our state was not going to build an exchange.Gruber just reinforced my memories since the intent to force states to build their own has long since been lost down the memory hole with a big assist from the elite leftist MSM drones.</comment>

<comment>That's simply a ridiculous statement.  Noone believed that at the time. This is a manufactured issue.  They couldn't even find someone who'd be negatively impacted by the subsidies.  It's just a joke....as are you.</comment>

<comment>The early drafts of the IRS rule used the language of the ACA verbatim, but the IRS working group always assumed that the phrase "established by the State" encompassed the backup Exchanges established by HHS on behalf of the non-electing States. According to their testimony to the House joint committee, it didn't occur to anyone there that the ACA might be interpreted differently until March 2011, when someone saw  a report of Tom Christina's AEI presentation from Dec 2010.</comment>

<comment>"Forget what the text of the law actually says. The people who disagree with me are just bad and should be punished for disagreeing with me."</comment>

<comment>Forget the text of the entire law and it's context and just focus on one line, which is contradicted by said context and the rest of the law.    You are simply cherry picking one unfortunately worded line in a nearly 1000 page bill and cannot stand the fact that my interpretation is really the only legitimate interpretation.</comment>

<comment>Not their fault that Congress wrote an incoherent law. The Courts are meant to interpret what is given, not to rewrite the laws themselves. That's called separation of powers.How unaware can you be to say with a straight face that only your interpretation is legitimate? Evidently many well-educated and prominent lawyers and judges disagree with you.</comment>

<comment>Without context one can find such idiosyncrasies in any law.  The only reason why this became an issue is that one party is looking for any reason to overturn the law, no matter how far fetched, along with a judiciary which was picked based upon ideological purity rather than competence.  Put those things together and we have a SCOTUS which is reviewing a case which should have been laughed out of court.</comment>

<comment>Can you prove that? If any law has such an "idiosyncrasy", why aren't they being found and challenged in court?</comment>

<comment>Let's use a famous example...the second amendment...which is admittedly not a law but does illustrate my point.It reads:"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." One can easily read the amendment in a number of ways and of course there are various interpretations of what they mean, including the SCOTUS own ideologically based (and I would say wrong) interpretation.  That said, there is at least some ambiguity associated with the context which does not exist with respect to the ACA.  Everyone at the time knew that Congress and the Executive wanted subsidies for all the states and with the exception of this one sentence, the law can only be read that way.</comment>

<comment>The Heller decision documents very clearly that your claims about the 2nd Amendment and it's interpretation, are COMPLETELY BOGUS.You can read it here.https://www.law.cornell.edu/su...I suggest you read it before you come back and prove your abyssal ignoranceYou are a classic example of the Ronald Reagan aphorism."It's not that our liberal friends are ignorant..It's just that so much of what they know isn't so.."</comment>

<comment>Please explain why a supposed right would be prefaced with a statement about a a militia and its necessity to the state.  Heller conveniently elides this point.  Read the decision yourself and you'll note that the argument is singularly unconvincing unless you happen to believe that people should have a right to own guns. Sent from my mobile device.  Expect typos.</comment>

<comment>I have read the decision MULTIPLE times..You lie when you claim that the Heller elides the issue of the justificatory clause.Because that is what it is.The Framers believed that you had a natural right to self-defense. From that right, you also had the right to the best tool for your personal defense.They were also careful to use "arms" instead of specific weapons, knowing full well that types of weapons used changed over timeIf the argument is 'singularly unconvincing", then it's because your mind is closed and you don't want to be convinced.And yes, I do believe that people have a RIGHT to be armed for their own protection..That is even more true, since courts ALL the way to the Supreme Court (Rock Island) have clearly stated that there is NOT duty for the police to protect you.So if the police are not supposed to and not to be counted on to protect you, then who is responsible for your own protection ?The ONLY answer is that YOU are responseible for YOUR protection..And if YOU are responsible for YOUR protection, then YOU are also responsible to prepare yourself with the BEST TOOL for the job.And according the the FBI, the BEST TOOL to avoid death or serious injury in a criminal attack is a gun.Frankly, it does NOT sound like you have in fact read the Heller decision.Part 1 of the held COVERS t the subject in depth.</comment>

<comment>They believed that people should be able to carry weapons when they were enlisted in a well regulated militia.  If they didn't mean for there to be any prohibition on owning guns why would they have mentioned a militia at all?  I've been down this arguments many times and have yet to hear a plausible answer to that question and I don't expect you'll do any better. Sent from my mobile device.  Expect typos.</comment>

<comment>Do like a fly..Eat shit and die, you ignorant turd.From https://www.law.cornell.edu/su...Held:    1. The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2–53.        (a) The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2–22.        (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved. Pp. 22–28.         (c) The Court’s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment . Pp. 28–30.        (d) The Second Amendment ’s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendmentproposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30–32.        (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court’s conclusion. Pp. 32–47.        (f) None of the Court’s precedents forecloses the Court’s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542 , nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 , refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174 , does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes. Pp. 47–54.</comment>

<comment>Richard, please learn what a descriptive clause is. Here is an example:  "I prefer the color blue, such as that of the sky, to all other primary colors."

<comment>No. Not even close. What the hell are you talking about? Unions are lobbying groups. A corporation is a business entity owned by shareholders.</comment>

<comment>A bayonet and a kitchen knife are BOTH bladed toolsQ: By what means is a union created ?A: A legal document nearly identical to that of a corporationQ: Who controls a union ?A: It's members - no different from the "owners" of a corporation.Just because unions and corporations have different purpose, does not make them otherwise different.They BOTH act as a corporate body for their "members".</comment>

<comment>You missed something essential in your understanding.</comment>

<comment>Go ahead and point out what I missed..(Should be worth a giggle)</comment>

<comment>Nope. Corporations can exist without humans. They can have 0 employees, 0 board members and 0 shareholders. They can be nothing more than words on a legal document. A union can't. They're literally nothing alike at all.</comment>

<comment>Wow..Do explain the purpose of a corporation that has, "0 employees, 0 board members and 0 shareholders", and whose only purpose is for you to make a stupid argument ?Don't forget to explain to us how that can happen under current corporate law.Oh and by the way, there are a whole bunch of unions that have "0 employees, 0 board members and 0 shareholders ". They're also just about as useful as your fictional corporate empty shell.</comment>

<comment>Duh, because unions don't have employees or shareholders. You just helped me make your argument that they're somehow similar even dumber. And by the way, tons of corporations have 0 of them. They exist to hold assets.</comment>

<comment>DOH !The unions have:- members (shareholders) who vote policy- a board of directors- staff (employees)Would you like to try again ??And by the way, corporations have owners, a a board of directors.

<comment>The real problem in the King case is that if the plaintiff prevails, the GOP will have to fix the problem at the federal level, or see the GOP governors scramble to implement exchanges before their individual insurance markets collapses.  Which would cause Hospitals to fail and medical costs to skyrocket in their states.Also, have they dismissed the 'standing' issue?  That didn't seem to be mentioned in this article.</comment>

<comment>The civilized states already have exchanges set up so it will only be the obstinate red states that suffer.</comment>

<comment>A couple of states use the federal exchange because the didn't want to/couldn't build their own and are otherwise 'on board' with it, even if forced to fix, it would be easy for them.</comment>
