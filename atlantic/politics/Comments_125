<comment>Following the Paris attacks, there were threads wherein the resident Atlantic progressives were carrying on about how doubts about the Syrian refugee program in the USA were misplaced."Oh the vetting" - they told us about."Oh, the background checks. Why -- it takes years and years of continuous vetting to get them into the country!"You would think they were talking about screening for CIA or astronaut jobs.</comment>

<comment>The U.S. can't even solve the big city homeless problem - there are THOUSANDS of U.S. citizens living in tents in L.A. ... The SJW PC crowd is turning their backs on fellow Americans to bring in hordes of immigrants, legal, illegal and "refugee." Will we finally have a socialist utopia when the population triples and 90% of Americans are living in tents riding bicycles and the upper crust socialist bourgeoisie live in ivory towers eating cake, not bread?</comment>

<comment>SJW! PC! Socialism! Illegals! Bougies! Bicycles!C'mon, I'm sure you can find a few other boogie men to toss in there. You forgot something about how liberals hate America and/or "welfare". And don't forget about how we're going to make you get gay married, too! Right before we allow Sharia law to take hold, of course.</comment>

<comment>Hi troll. I'm not GOP and loathe country club Republicans - I'm all for gay rights ... and I'm also for the American working class - back in the 60s, the Democrats were too - if you were as old as me, you would have an unbrainwashed memory of an America that was far different where working people were far better off ...</comment>

<comment>Accepting all this at face value: even if you manage to stop all immigration to this country - hell, even if you manage to stop immigration AND remove all illegal immigrants - it won't fix the economy or rescue the working class. All it would do is free up some (a lot?) of very-low-paying jobs, but the underlying structural problems in our economy (and the dearth of decent middle-class/middle-wage jobs) would still be there. Scapegoating immigrants and refugees doesn't change any of that.</comment>

<comment>The solution is deporting all of the illegal immigrants - wages go up with no government interference - low paid workers can once again afford to live indoors. There would no longer be so many Americans living in tents ... A "solution" troll.</comment>

<comment>I know illegal immigrants who run their own their own construction businesses in Colorado - they hire all illegals and send their money back to Mexico - if the IRS catches up ... they go back to Mexico too - You've been brainwashed - it's way more than the very low paying jobs - construction trades were once honorable occupations in America.</comment>

<comment>Reader - my experiences are the same.  I have seen how uncontrolled immigration has undermined working class wages, especially in the building trades (though almost everyone is at risk).In the words of a patient of mine, "Roofing is hard work, but at least it paid well - $15 per hour, with benefits.  Now it is minimum wage, no bennies."Thanks for sticking up for the working guys.  I am wondering if the real fault line in the US now is not Republican vs Democrat or even Liberal vs Conservative, but the Ruling Class versus the ruled.</comment>

<comment>"I am wondering if the real fault line in the US now is not Republican vs Democrat or even Liberal vs Conservative, but the Ruling Class versus the ruled."I wonder that myself sometimes.  I'm a lifelong liberal who recently switched to Republican because liberals have morphed too much from what they used to be.  They once stood for equal women's rights, rather than Shariah, and the rights of American workers to have jobs, rather than filling this country with immigrants from everywhere.</comment>

<comment>But why would I pay an American $30./hr if a Mexican will work for $7? Neither Republicans nor Democrats seem to be very interested in doing anything but posturing about that. They may be illegal when they cross the border but they look okay while they're reroofing your house.</comment>

<comment>Solution is simple, starting with big companies fine the help out of them for hiring illegals, once you stop employment with major companies, go down the food chain until you hit the family run local businesses... But start with the big guys first</comment>

<comment>That may be too simple since you and I seem to be the only people in the country that have thought of it.</comment>

<comment>The illegal immigration problem could be solved simply and cheaply:1. It's illegal to hire undocumented workers. Send some of those employers to jail. Not fines, jail.2. Illegal aliens should also not receive and public assistance. Deport those on the rolls. A bus ticket to Nuevo Laredo or TJ is cheaper than paying benefits.3. Illegal aliens who commit other crimes should be deported once they have served their sentences.4. Aliens who have been deported should face jailtime if they are caught again inside US illegally.Those 4 simple steps will cause most illegal aliens to self-deport. If they wish to return, they can get in line with legal immigrants. The illegals who remain will be a much simpler and smaller problem to solve.</comment>

<comment>They've convinced themselves that letting these people in while attempting to disarm Americans in the face of terrorist attacks somehow both makes sense and are winning issues.</comment>

<comment>The "I am Charlie" movement may have been one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen.  It started right, a declaration that the speaker, like Charlie, is committed to free expression above all else.  It took about a week before it became "I am Charlie unless what I say offends someone in which case I am in the wrong and should be punished for saying it."Even the craven media didn't actually stand up for expression.  The people who would be up against the wall are defending the people who would put them there.</comment>

<comment>Regressive left? Cute, you're like Bill Maher where every liberal who doesn't hate Islam isn't a liberal.</comment>

<comment>Liberals hate homophobia, misogyny, and death sentences for atheists.Right?  They used to, maybe something has changed.</comment>

<comment>I'm glad you're a good human being, but again if I agreed with those and then hated black people, am I a liberal?You can't be a liberal if you despise a group of people based on their religion.</comment>

<comment>One can be a liberal and hate the bad ideas that stem from religion and the people who act on them regardless of their skin color.It does not disqualify a person from being a genuine liberal when they object to or even despise people who stone those accused of adultery (stoned to death too often because they are victims of rape), condemn females for wearing bad hijabs, terrorize gay people (or hang them from cranes, etc).Those are tenants within Islam which is a destructive and intolerant "religion."  Fortunately, there are brave and intelligent Muslims who have reconciled the hateful and discriminatory nature of their religion and speak for genuine liberal values - they stand up for humanity at a personal risk (many are writers for the Gatestone Institute).In your question to the other poster, you ask if you are a liberal if you hate black people and then say you can't be liberal if you despise a group of people based on their religion.  Black is a skin color whereas religion poses a set of values.   You need to make distinction. Not all black people share a single ideology and not all of those who share an ideology are of one race.If you are so tolerant that you protect the rights of those who hang or terrorize gay men and women, mutilate girls' genitalia (UK hospitals must deal with 15 cases a day), damage property or kill those who say offensive things about a man "prophet" who indeed slaughtered innocent people just as the Islamic State does today when they emulate him - then are you really liberal?</comment>

<comment>Kudos Nessie. Your comment should be an Atlantic article, not Leftist PC pablum from the likes of Russell Berman (see his article from 2 months ago: "Can Terrorists Really Infiltrate the Syrian Refugee Program?" -- well, yeah).</comment>

<comment>Thank you, jj_dynomite_1 (and thanks for the nostalgic reference in your moniker).I have mixed feelings about allowing refugees from Islamic countries settle in the US, where they overall do better than they are doing in Europe which is becoming Islamizised. I don't necessarily think the number need to be zero - but it needs to be small.I saw a post in talkbacks a while ago from a poster angry at the new en vogue comparisons between comparing the objection to newcomers with the US citizens rejecting the resettlement of Jews fleeing to the US from Na zi territory (something Berman suggested at the end).The poster said that to properly compare Muslims escaping the wrath of other Muslims to the situation in Germany, it would be more accurate to compare with a situation in which people from the Na zi party, who shared the same ideology, but didn't like the current Na zi government and hence were threatened by them so decided to flee from their land to the US importing their ideology.Islam is a frightening religion and those who say it is one of peace are either naively hopeful, disingenuous or under informed.  Muslims practice and adhere to the faith in varying degrees - so many are peaceful.   The contributing writers at the Gatestone Institute know this, one was elite in his country and now lives in exile as he sought asylum in the UK, Mudar Zahran.  There are so many who are like them (though not enough) who are so deserving of a new life in a democratic country and we are deserving of what they will do with their free minds.  I don't know if the US has the proper mechanisms in place to keep us safe.The genuine needs from genuine and good refugees are difficult but not impossible to reconcile with the risks that they bring, even if not outright terrorism, an ideology that uses freedom of religion to inhibit other freedoms is beyond problematic.  We don't need a bombing to bring us down (especially when there are people on this page who proudly fight on behalf of those who would destroy them while trying to destroy those who would protect them - it seems the US has room for stupidity and to still survive.  I'm not sure that is a good thing - but it isn't all that bad;).</comment>

<comment>100% Nessie. The sick reality of the Regressive Leftists on this thread and elsewhere is that they attempt to pigeonhole right-thinking citizens as "racist" and "Islamophobic" when in fact these skeptical "commonfolk" share the same truly Liberal behaviour as Muslims like Zahran, or Hirsi Ali (escapee from Somalia), or Nawaz (UK), or Abu Toameh (Israel), or Fatah (Canada) or Jasser (USA).However, because these brave individuals condemn aspects of the religion in which they were raised, they are pilloried by the Regressive Left as being inauthentic, and physically threatened by the Radical Muslims in positions of power (I could care less whether these Islamists are a minority or a majority; they are in power as either terrorist regimes or non-state terrorist actors who have no place in civilized society). The only unifying feature between Leftists and Radical Muslims is their totalitarianism and moral bankruptcy. And it's going to get worse before it gets better, as can be seen in Europe.</comment>

<comment>If the regressive left were just on this thread, or just on any thread, that would be fine.  They are loud, everywhere and destructive - often not even knowing how destructive they are.  I spend too much time in this time-sink of posting - battling "self destructive" stupidity. It is an addiction;-)I am a fan of the people that you mention (although a couple I didn't hear of and need to look into).  A friend of mine is one of the Muslim contributors of Gatestone and he does receive threats (he writes elsewhere too).  I have seen that Gatestone is vigilant about checking and confirming sources and facts.  It is a great site.  It would be good if they hosted disqus - though would then just take up more of my time;-)You are right about the links between the leftists and radical Muslims.  The FORMER (correction) might just need guidance to the proper information (some - while some like Max Blumenthal is a psychopath who is content to lie and act "left" when he is really just a psychopath).  The latter genuinely think have been told that their moral bank account is full - when they've been drawing on its debt since its creation.</comment>

<comment>I agree that Nessie's article should be an Atlantic article!!</comment>

<comment>Great post!!!</comment>

<comment>Thank you, Sarita.  We all need to keep it up.Hopefully, one day soon, the neo-liberals (not to be confused with genuine liberals) will yank themselves from the clouds before they have us all go up in smoke.</comment>

<comment>As they used to say, "from your mouth to God's ears!"  lol!</comment>

<comment>It's telling that you equate belief systems with skin color.</comment>

<comment>Liberals no longer stand for women's rights.  They seem to believe in the right of Muslim males to enforce Shariah upon females.  Liberals don't really believe in gay rights, though they'd tell you that to your face.  They believe that Muslim perps who are taking gays to roofs and kicking them off roofs are just helpless Muslims, victimized by the West.  Liberals no longer hate religions.  Now they think the Islamic religion rocks their world.And the new one is that liberals are TERRIFIED of atheists, since atheists have called them on the new liberal hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>I loathe Bill Maher. I consult titans of philosophy for my disdain of Islam:"Consider the Koran, for example; this wretched book was sufficient to start a world-religion, to satisfy the metaphysical need for countless millions for twelve hundred years, to become the basis of their morality and ofa remarkable contempt for death, and also to inspire them to bloody wars and the most extensive conquests. In this book we find the saddest and poorest form of theism. Much may be lost in translation, but I have not been able to discover in it one single idea of value. Such things show that the capacity for metaphysics does not go hand in hand with the need for it."Schopenhauer</comment>

<comment>Churchill had a few choice things to say about Islam too, and oh boy, did he hit the nail on the head.  Great post.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry man, a lot of us were very, very against taking in these migrants.  (They aren't refugees, all but a minuscule number don't fit the legal definition.)  The lack of liberal disdain for Islam is bizarre to me, but there are some of us out here who consider ourselves generally liberal and are absolutely opposed to Islamic expansion.</comment>

<comment>It's not liberals. It's really "progressives."Liberalism cleaved in the 70s, with the larger part finding The Third Way, which consisted of pandering to narrow social causes to distract from the fact that it no longer supported the economic concerns of the common man.The smaller part of liberalism is illustrated by Bernie Sanders, me, and probably you. The bigger part of liberalism is now called "progressivism," and those are the elitist sons-of-bitches intent on proving us all racists by imposing a Tower of Babel on us.</comment>

<comment>Yup. And who could be more "elitist sons-of-bitches" than the "community organizer" in the White House and the Secretary of "Failed" State over the past 7 years?If I voted Democrat -- well, if I lived in the States -- Bernie would have my vote. He might not yet have the foreign policy chops, but one can be sure that choosing between Israel and illiberal Muslim thugs like Hamas, Hezbollah and ISIS, Bernie for sure would choose Israel -- which, for all its problems with Palestinian Arabs, respects the rule of law, women, homosexuals, and religious minorities in Israel proper.And for that, the (P)Regressive Left would accuse him of "dual loyalty" (actually, they already have, like NPR's Diane Rehm), and continue to lionize those downtrodden "freedom fighters" of Islam. One of whom HRC has chosen to serve as her chief attache.I really, really hope American voters wake the hell up over the next 6 months.</comment>

<comment>I am,  personally as a liberal,  extremely concerned about the process that let Ted Cruz into America.   Marco Rubio,  him too.Where does this end?   After admitting them,  years later,  we find out that they are part of a pernicious conspiracy to wreck the ACA,  Social Security and Medicare.It's bad enough that we have Paul Ryan,  a guy that grew up and went through school on Social Security SSI after the death of his father calling for seniors to eat cat food to pay for the latest tax cuts for the wealthy,The scariest refugees in America are a couple of nimrods running for President.   True Story! </comment>

<comment>good i hope they get stopped all together we dont want them here!!!</comment>

<comment>Of course, such concerns presuppose that these men -- who are not charged with nor convicted of conspiring, planning,or conducting a terrorist act -- were already radicalized three and six years ago, respectively, when they were 20 and 16.

<comment>You sound like a loud child that doesn't understand math.</comment>

<comment>I am axiomatically disagreeing with you that this is something to worry about; it's not a "negative" to let in refugees, even if one and a half thousandth of a percent of them do end up wanting to do something violent to Americans. We are a resilient and robust country. Or at least used to be.  I'm having a coronary because cowards like you are driving costly and immoral policy out of a sheer panic response. It's like letting someone in the middle of a seizure fly the plane; it cannot possibly end well for anyone except the people who want the plane to crash.</comment>

<comment>The difference with Christian Dominionists is that they really don't win any hearts and minds. Nobody but other Christian Dominionists defends them. When they pop up with their outrageous behaviors, the country largely mocks and jeers at them.For some reason, however, Islam has become a darling in Western culture. Islam has an enormous number of defenders who aren't even Muslim! And these apologists argue that we should not be worried about allowing entry to millions of people who are actively (and in some cases legitimately) hostile to our culture, to our values, to our very ways of life.</comment>

<comment>Except we don't have a global problem of cats eating their owners, but we do have a very obvious global problem of Muslim terrorism.</comment>

<comment>The Tsarnaevs weren't much older when they committed their attack in Boston.Furthermore, even supposing that they weren't radicalized when they came to the US, it's likely that being in an immigrant community makes them more likely to be radicalized later.As you say, the risk of terrorism in the US is ~0.00000001%, so it's not something that most people should worry about, but if people are going to worry about it, I don't think immigration from predominantly Muslim nations is necessarily an irrational continuation of that.For my money, the bigger issue with immigration is that many of the immigrants aren't immersed in American/Western values for long enough, so you get things like Rotherham or the recent attack in Cologne. This isn't to say that supposedly civilized westerners are actually much more civilized, as witnessed by Penn State or the various clergy abuse scandals, to name just two, but the cultural issues aren't zero either.</comment>

<comment>The problem is we don't know which ones, but we do know nineteen is all it takes.</comment>

<comment>For one act forever unrepeatable. More Americans die annually driving their cars in f*cking Mexico than are killed by terrorists. We should have a war on asphalt, by the numbers, long before we even begin to worry about terrorism.</comment>

<comment>9/11 is unrepeatable as carried out, but I don't think that style of attack is necessarily unrepeatable. Depending on the amount of funding and sophistication available to the terrorists, they can either try to repeat something like FedEx 705, or GermanWings, to gain control of a plane. Alternatively, you can buy a used 737 class aircraft for a few million dollars, and a 747 class aircraft for ~$10M, and do it yourself. While setting up your own airline isn't trivial, running it as a ferry flight or something wouldn't be too difficult, comparatively speaking. While getting into the DC no fly zone undetected would probably be quite difficult, an attack on New York would be comparatively easier, to say nothing of the other cities.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you travel to San Bernardino, Boston and Fort Hood and tell this to the faces of the grieving families?</comment>

<comment>Both Fort Hood and one half of San Bernadino were not perpetrated by refugees, but Americans.</comment>

<comment>Really Elliot. You're such a bleeding heart you want to split hairs like that? Well, both these "Americans" (can't forget about the Muslim terrorist "American" kid from Tennessee) all had a unifying feature -- practicing radical Muslims. </comment>

<comment>God, when did Americans become such giant pussies?</comment>

<comment>That's even worse. If it's true that refugees enter non-radicalized, and become radicalized after they enjoy life in the US, then that's basically to argue that none of the should be let in, even if they're not radical.</comment>

<comment>The number of American-born and -raised individuals radicalized and intent on committing such acts exceeds this. By this logic, we should ban reproduction.</comment>

But it is also  common sense and the truth.On the other hand, if the goal is to destroy our national character  and values, then  the  1965 Immigration law still makes sense.But it is becoming clear that good Europeans will  increasingly be in  need of  some better options than they have now.   And we need people who will strenghten our nation   and not cause problems, conflict,  and increased budgetary burdens.  </comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, Western Europeans, I forgot Eastern Europe is a thing but even then they go to France, Germany or the UK before the US.</comment>

<comment>Quotas were destroyed in 1965 amigo.</comment>

<comment>According to this, only 12% of US visas went to Europeans in 2013. That includes tourist visas. Remove those, and you'll probably wind up with 5% immigration visas granted to Europeans.http://www.migrationpolicy.org...I can't find a better source. All the other sources are basically top-10 lists, and no European country is in the top 10 when it comes to immigration to the US. It's all Asian and Latin American countries.</comment>

<comment>Well, I could find no immigration statistics that noted other developed countries as immigration sources. All the figures I found seem to fold European countries into the "Other" category.As for quotas, they don't exist anymore. There are no caps on how many people can immigrate from each country. Moreover, when quotas did exist, they restricted the darker-skinned countries, not Europe. That was precisely why the quota system was ended. It was deemed racist because it opened the door to Europeans but only held it ajar for Latin Americans.</comment>

<comment>Link please supporting your assertions?Don't know where you love but in SoCal where I live, I have a couple of British immigrant coworkers, a family of immigrants from Spain in my neighborhood, and the office below mine is filled with French programmers. </comment>

<comment>No, not really. We get very, very few European immigrants.</comment>

<comment>>no European wants to come to the US...are you joking?</comment>

<comment>In 2013, only 12% of entry visas were granted to Europeans. That includes tourist visas and immigration visas. I can't find a source, but if you remove the tourist visas, I'm sure that number would drop to below 5%.http://www.migrationpolicy.org...It's no joke. In general, Europeans see no reason to move to the US. They have it better there than they would here.</comment>

<comment>It was the absolutism of saying "no European" that made the post so laughable.</comment>

<comment>Well, ok, but that's a figure of speech.</comment>

<comment>Not racist at all, since Europe and Asia and Latin America are countries and not races. It would be sane, practical and beneficial to the U.S.  - as would it be to consider slipping some birth control into the mideast water supply.</comment>

<comment>That's a bit simplistic. People whose values are in line with the West should be allowed to immigrate and contribute. Michio Kaku has a good point about the "genius visa".https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Europeans have no desire to move to the U.S.    We need more diversity, not less.</comment>

<comment>That's a racist lie.</comment>

<comment>77% of rapes in Sweden committed by 2% of population who are Muslim.Oh sorry, that's simply a verifiable fact; which is (due to being factual) racist.Do liberals hate all facts, or just ones they wish weren't true?</comment>

<comment>Please don't confuse genuine liberal with those self-destructive uber leftists who have repurposed the real definition.</comment>

<comment>Nessie is right, your beef is with regressive leftists, not liberals in general.</comment>

<comment>Muslim is not a race - it refers to people affiliated with an ideology and one that is not so homosexual, bi, transgender friendly either.Fortunately - there are secular and liberal Muslims who reject discriminatory and intolerant hadiths or they reconcile the horrible orders within Islamic texts with their personal need to be good and their brave choices to do so.The latest report of coordinated mass rape or molestation was allegedly by Arabs in Germany - Arab is a race.  They were likely Muslim (not a race) as the literal texts in Islam allow for men to believe it is their right to control and abuse women - and their duty to protect them if they are well behaved "believers."So - that poster might have exaggerated - but lie - he did not (I didn't even get into the grooming gangs in the UK).</comment>

<comment>And I challenge you to engage your brain.  But fair warning:  it might hurt a little bit at first.Regurgitating an indoctrination fails to impress. </comment>

<comment>Define "diversity"You mean skin color?</comment>

<comment>Europeans don't want to move to the US for the same reason Americans don't want to move to Detroit.</comment>

<comment>And you are not a serious person,  so let's not waste each other's time.  .</comment>

<comment>Mass rapes and assaults of UK and European young females by north African and Arab islamics is what's threatening the flood of Syrian migrants (who also are mostly young muslim males).</comment>

<comment>There's no actual proof that Muslims or North Africans did any raping.  You are more likely to get attacked by skinhead or any right-wing extremist.</comment>

<comment>You don't know what happened in Germany.   But I know there are right-wing xenophobic elements there.</comment>

<comment>What's so sad about this conversation is that based on your name and avatar, you're a woman who supports gay rights.Do you genuinely not realize what the people you're defending think about gay rights and women?  Are you not aware that homosexuality is literally a capital crime according to unanimous Sunni jurisprudence?  Executions for being gay aren't theoretical, they happen in the Muslim world routinely.How can you defend people who want to subjugate you and literally murder the people you care about?  Don't you have any kind of self-preservation instinct, or are you proud of having lost it?</comment>

<comment>You realize that people can support Muslims, dislike Islamophobia and support same-sex rights right?False choice amigo.</comment>

<comment>No - you really can't."Support"ing Muslims doesn't mean anything.  What does that mean, specifically, to "support Muslims?"  What does "Islamophobia" even mean, other than fear of Islam?  Are gay people wrong to be afraid of Islam?  Seriously, I'm asking, are they?  Why or why not?</comment>

<comment>This is humorous to every gay Muslim or gay person who also identifies with a religion.</comment>

<comment>OK - and for gay Muslims, since their religion says they're to be put to death, do you think they're openly gay?  Do you think there are gay clubs in Riyadh?Are you telling me you see no reason whatsoever that gay people might be opposed to Islam, or people who care about gay people for that matter?  None?</comment>

<comment>Yes, there are openly gays Muslims. Not really, look at the Ottoman Empire, very progressive on same-sex relations. Why? Well the way they interpreted Islam supported it. The religion is nothing unless you want it to be.Now let me ask you this, black Americans tend to be socially conservative and they tend to be against same-sex marriage. Does this give you the right to worry about black people?</comment>

<comment>>Does this give you the right to worry about black people?Do black people have a holy book and a set of scholars who teach as literal divine revelation that gay people deserve to die for being gay, a sentence carried out in countries devoted to...uhh...blackness?  No?  Then no.It's really, really simple.  Islam is a religion.  Black is a race.  Religion is a set of ideas, while race is a personal characteristic.  This is the reason why hating Islam is not bigotry, but hating Muslims is.  I don't hate Muslims, and frankly couldn't possibly care less whether or not you believe me.  I've worked and lived with Muslims for years at a time, in the Middle East for some of it.  I hate, and likely will always hate Islam, because it's a set of horrific ideas that have no place in the modern world.  If you think that makes me the equivalent of a racist, that's your prerogative.</comment>

<comment>The vast majority of black Americans are Christian so somewhat. If we go to Africa, we can see even more non-Muslim examples like Uganda.Religion is a set of ideas good. However, many people identify with their religion on a personal level, saying you hate the religion typically is taken as you hate its followers by extension. Hatred of Islam also correlates highly with anti-Arab racism and orientalism in general.You're ignoring the "modern" Muslim countries that exist.</comment>

<comment>Oh please, Chief, educate me on the "modern" Muslim countries. Is that Malaysia, which just denied visas to Israeli table tennis players for an upcoming international event? Or Indonesia, who have had factions declaring allegiance to ISIS? Or is it Nigeria, whose Boko Haram Islamic terrorist group rapes and slaughters Christian schoolgirls?Since the 22 Arab Muslim nations are utter failed states and/or dictatorships, I think you're down to Turkey now, Jefe. And they're only ISIS supporters.</comment>

<comment>Again - black refers to someone's skin color, not their ideology.Islam is an ideology.  Bad analogy.And yes - people have the "right" to worry about anything (well, in Western society in which free thought isn't punished - yet).  How they act upon it is another thing.  Islamists objecting to people being gay - fine - hanging and arresting and beating people because they are gay - not so fine.  Distinctions.</comment>

<comment>Suddenty this Regressive Leftist is a scholar on sexual proclivities in the Ottoman fucking Empire. The only thing you're "El Jefe" of is the bullshit coming out of your mouth.</comment>

<comment>Not really.  Many gay Muslims living in Islamic lands try to escape the routine harassment and terror put upon them.Is the only way that you can value Islam is through lying to yourself what it is about?  Certainly it has virtues you can honestly agree with . . . .There is no irrational fear of Islam.  There might be an irrational fear of Muslims, especially since many don't follow "Islamic" fatwas literally.  Muslimaphobia would indeed be a bad thing.  IslamaPHOBIA . . . .  its not existent.</comment>

<comment>Well, at some point you'll have to make a choice because Islam and sexual equality cannot coexist.</comment>

<comment>Sexual equality isn't even a reality here and you know that.</comment>

<comment>WhataboutwhataboutwhataboutBy that logic, no one should ever complain about any problem anywhere if that problem also exists anywhere else, regardless of severity.  It's the logic of absolute desperation, when no other defense is available.</comment>

<comment>I never said that, I'm saying its very difficult to set a standard that you don't adhere to yourself.You also didn't answer my question.</comment>

<comment>Exactly - and it's not just that.  Islam and free expression about atheism can't coexist.  Islam and gay rights can't coexist.  The list is long.</comment>

<comment>First, I am Transgender and yes, of course support LGBT rights.What concerns me is the racial and anti-immigrant tone being express here.   Diversity is what keeps our society strong and growing.   It would be a tragedy if immigration was reduced as result of bigoted fear.Here at home I've had to worry about right-wing extremists who want deny might right to health care and to deny my right to marry who I want.    The people who oppose my rights are so-described Christians, not Muslims.</comment>

<comment>If you aren't trolling, you really shouldn't say things like this.  I live in a red state.  A trans person lives down the street from me.  Saying this stuff badly hurts your credibility, you have no idea.</comment>

<comment>I've seen what happens in red states and that's why I don't live in.</comment>

<comment>OK, trolling.  Never mind.  Geez, what a waste of time.</comment>

<comment>How's that?   I live in the bay area which is inclusive and socially progressive and forward-thinking.   Live isn't like that in Texas or Nebraska.</comment>

<comment>You're trans?!  Again, you would be stoned to death in more than a dozen countries for that fact alone!  How does that not make any impression on you?>I've had to worry about right-wing extremists who want deny might right to health care and to deny my right to marry who I want. The people who oppose my rights are so-described Christians, not Muslims.Yes, and that's absolutely horrible.  My point being, if those were Islamic fundamentalists instead of Christian fundamentalists, you would need to worry about being hacked into pieces, not opposed in the courts.  I just can't possibly make this more clear, more than 80% of some countries' populations think that you deserve to die, and 100% of the legal authorities in Islam agree.THAT'S what you're defending!>What concerns me is the racial and anti-immigrant tone being express here. Diversity is what keeps our society strong and growing. It would be a tragedy if immigration was reduced as result of bigoted fear.All immigration is not always good by default.  That's not racist or bigoted to say.  Some cultures aren't compatible and furthermore, that bringing a million of the poorest and least educated members of a culture into the midst of another one with which their values massively conflict is a terrible, destructive idea.  It's not bigotry or racism to say that Islam (a collection of ideas,) includes some terrible, monstrous ideas that have no place in our culture.  The whole "killing you for being who you are" thing being one, for example.  This isn't about prejudice, it's about common sense.</comment>

<comment>Christian Conservatives think I am mentally ill.   I've been threatened by them online and in person.  They actively seek to deny my rights.</comment>

<comment>OK, and again, that is incredibly awful.  Again, it doesn't even begin to compare with the best treatment you could hope for in an Islamic society.They think I'm mentally ill too, but unlike in an Islamic society, they are not literally trying to hack me to death with machetes like has happened multiple times last year in Bangladesh to others who share my viewpoints.</comment>

<comment>We need to consider why Islamic society is mad at America.  If the U.S. didn't attack Afghanistan and Iraq and if we would stop sending weapons and money to Israel things would be a lot better now.</comment>

<comment>OK - so given that, as you put it, "Islamic society is mad at America," (i.e. the West, as they conflate US foreign policy with that of Europe,) can you explain why you think it's a good idea to allow a million people who are mad at our societies to move in?</comment>

<comment>There is a great column that addresses (and then debunks) the theory of that poster.  It is written by a very brave and insightful Turk who was born Muslim (I'm not sure if she still identifies that way).It is called, "Who is Responsible for the Atrocities in the Muslim World?", by Uzay Bulut.</comment>

<comment>Before the United States existed, Islamists were conquering and destroying and oppressing.  There are so many in the bay area who distort reality regarding this - often to try to destroy the one place in the Middle East that is a democracy and that homosexuals try to escape TO.  Seventeen countries on the United Nations Human Rights Council have laws in which it is ILLEGAL to be gay.  I believe all of them are Islamic governments (or the majority).  The counterbalance to Right wing Christian intolerance IS NOT more intolerance.Islam is the newest of the monotheistic religions and yet it is set to be the most populated soon.  It started off with a prophet who sliced the heads off of a tribe of peaceful Jewish men, took the women and sold the children into slavery.  ISIS emulates that prophet who started off where there were Jews and pagans, forcing Arabs to accept him as prophet upon pain of death.  And now - in that very area, it is illegal to be a citizen who is not a Muslim.  It is also illegal to be gay.  The country - Saudi Arabia - the CHAIR of a panel on the United Nations Human Rights Committee.Being transgender, you are part of a vulnerable population.  Don't let ill intentioned Islamists exploit you the way the Christian right would.There are liberal Christians and there are liberal Muslims - but you need to make distinctions on an individual basis.  </comment>

<comment>"Every time the ISIS, Boko Haram, Iran, or any terrorist group in the Muslim world is discussed, many people tend to hold the West responsible for the devastation and murders they commit. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Blaming the failures in the Muslim world on Western nations is simply bigotry and an attempt to shift the blame and to prevent us from understanding the real root cause of the problem."That is the first paragraph in an insightful opinion piece by Uzay Bulut - born Muslim.  The rest can be found by googling the column, "Who is Responsible for the Atrocities in the Muslim World?, by Uzay Bulut"</comment>

<comment>Like many here, I'm an LGBT ally.Yours is a great question. It's true we need to consider why Islamic society is mad at us. We also need to ask ourselves why Islamic society is so mad at Hindus, since Muslims are killing them in India. Or why Islamic society is so mad at Buddhists, since Muslims are killing them in Thailand and Indonesia. Or why Islamic society is so mad at Animists, since Muslims are killing them in South Sudan.In order to answer these questions, let's try a thought exercise. Imagine our lives completely centered around a specific set of ideas we believe to be the inerrant word of our creator, ideas gleaned from books meant to be interpreted literally, which contain extremely specific non-contextual instructions worded thusly:Any religion other than Islam is unacceptable (3:85). Go and make war on the unbelievers living in your neighborhood (9:123). Muslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the unbelievers (8:60). Do not hanker for peace with the unbelievers; behead them when you catch them (47:4). Maim and crucify the unbelievers if they criticize Islam (5:33). Terrorize and behead those who believe in scriptures other than the Qur’an (8:12). Slay the unbelievers wherever you find them (2:191)...If these particular nuggets of Self-Help-From-on-High aren't enough for us, there's no shortage of similarly insightful writ articulated within the central Islamic texts.There's the answer to our question.(By the way, here's Islam's position regarding the LGBT community.) http://www.thereligionofpeace....</comment>

<comment>I used to feel sorry for Transgenders, but their comments on these boards have changed my opinion. </comment>

<comment>Just like any other group you care to name, trans people aren't defined by the fact that some people who aren't very well-informed or sensible are trans.</comment>

<comment>American right-wingers would deny you certain rights. Muslim right-wingers will swing you from a crane if they're merciful. Otherwise, they'll stone you. Like Ahmadinejad said, there are no gays in Iran. He wasn't kidding. The moment they find one, they hang him.</comment>

<comment>Please don't try high school philosophy here. I mean, true, ultimately, we don't know anything. For all we know, all this around us is but an illusion. Perhaps we are just brains in jars in some weirdo's basement. We don't know and we can't know.But within the reality that we can graps and understand, we certainly do know what happened in Germany. We now also know it happened in other European cities at the same time, just on smaller scale (dozens of marauding Muslims instead of hundreds).</comment>

<comment>Christians don't rape or attack anyone?</comment>

<comment>Not really- what is your point? I hope you are not a phony War on Women activist. </comment>

<comment>People from Europe do not commit rape at the same rate as people from the Middle East.  It sounds mean to say, it sounds like it's super racist and awful, but it is the simple truth.  Women are treated like chattel in Muslim countries, ask Lara Logan if you don't believe me.  If you want to see actual rape culture, go to Cairo.</comment>

<comment>Don't look now, but you're letting your dogma trump logic,  reason,  and the evidence.</comment>

<comment>She's saying the victims were liars, that women who reported a sexual assault aren't to be trusted in this case.</comment>

<comment>yep,  She's been conditioned  to instinctively defend the narrative - at all costs and in spite of the contradictions. </comment>

<comment>Wait.  Are you serious?  Have you not read the articles where the police talk about who they caught and what their nationalities were?  Have you not read the witness statements?  You must be kidding that someone is more likely to be attacked by a skinhead in Germany than by a Muslim immigrant.You're calling the victims liars.  That doesn't just beggar belief, it pushes belief into a mob and molests it.</comment>

<comment>Why do you want to believe that so badly that you delude yourself despite the abundance of information around you?The wilding men on New Year's Eve in various cities in various countries (Helsinki, Zurich, Cologne, etc.) have been widely reported to have been dark-skinned. Those cities have virtually zero Africans, Hispanics, and Hindus. It could only have been Muslims.Moreover, there have been zero reports claiming the men were European.I don't understand this defense of Islam and Muslims at all costs. What is it really about?</comment>

<comment>Not according to the women attacked.Or does the Left no longer believe women that say they were assaulted and by whom?</comment>

<comment>So we should disbelieve the LARGE number of women who claim to be attacked?Ok, so the new liberal decision is:Believe victims of rape attacks UNLESS they say there were raped by someone NOT white; then disbelieve them entirely!Is there perhaps a slightly less stupid, racist, and offensive argument you want to replace this with?  or is this what you're going with?</comment>

<comment>Yes apparently rape denial is now OK if it means never having to say anything bad about migrants. I got the memo this morning, I think they sent it out to everyone. Check your spam folder.</comment>

<comment>Way wrong; so everyone is lying? link please? </comment>

<comment>As I suspected (and previously suggested) - you peddle for the Islamists and rag on Israel.  I looked at your blog which accuses the Israeli PM of "cherry picking" a historical account from the region now known as Iran.  Your blog includes a different account that the PM didn't mention.  The PM didn't mention a lot of things and the timing of his speech was relevant.  The PM didn't mention how some Jews in the region were forced to convert to Islam (as it is - Muslims are often descendants of a conquered people - lots of Jewish, Christian and Pagan blood running through their veins), he didn't mention how Jewish schools in Iran (yes, there are still Jews in Iran), must be run by a Muslim and how until recently, those schools were forced to be open on the Sabbath.  He didn't mention the terror attacks that killed many in the Jewish community in Argentina - led by Iran.  He didn't mention how it is illegal to be gay in Iran where they FORCE gender reassignment surgery on gay men - even if the victim doesn't feel as if he should be reassigned to being a women.  It is the only way for a gay man to escape death by the government via public crane hanging - only to often be "honor" killed by family who can't accept the gender change.Go ahead - toot the virtues of a government who has called Israel and America "Satan" and called for our destruction - a government who has already violated  points on the nuclear deal and who has a president whose son committed suicide because his father is an evil lier.  And then criticize the tiny Jewish State in which it is not only legal to be gay or alternative - but there are parades and clubs to accommodate the community.  Condemn Israel for not being perfect and then gloat at how Iran has a spot on the Women's Rights Commission of the United Nations - so burning the faces of those not wearing "proper hijab" really can't be that objectionable - certainly not as objectionable as a bunch of Jews trying to stop jihad from destroying their tiny country.</comment>

<comment>Actually there is proof: the victims' own accounts of who attacked them, corroborated by police who intervened and video. Also it is nothing short of absurd to suggest it is "more likely to get attacked" by racists.  That is totally absurd and crime statistics show violence against women is orders of magnitude more common.Seeing your other posts, I know this is no innocent mistake on your part, but a morally grotesque attempt to whitewash the reality of disproportionate sexual violence among men from the Muslim world.  I really hope you are a troll.</comment>

<comment>I wish she was a troll. I know p/regressives like this. They don't actually care about Muslims as people; they just hate, HATE the West (from ostensibly "white" people to civilization aspects) and thus are aligned with Islam, whose most radical manifestation also hates, HATES the West. It's an alliance of destruction.It frightens me that people like her exist, and as can be seen in Western Europe, they actually serve in the highest levels of government. And voila, now we have New Year's Eve gang rapes in Cologne.</comment>

<comment>That's true.  I know because of the venomous personal hatred I receive as a non-white arguing for egalitarianism, humanism, and liberal democracy.  The problem is not only is 'anti-racism' a cover for cultural relativism, rather than mere opposition to racial bigotry, in most cases, but it carries an ugly notion of racial determinism, as in non-whites are authentic only in our tradition (i.e. inherently oppressive) cultures.</comment>

<comment>Noteworthy insights.</comment>

<comment>It takes a brutal dictator to control these people.  That should be fun.</comment>

<comment>"terror arrests pose new threat to Syrian refugee program"As well it should.This is exactly what the folks opposed to the program have been saying all along.I'd add what is currently happening in Germany to the list.</comment>

<comment>Considering that out of the 11,000 refugees we took that only 2 were arrested I would say these fears are unsubstantiated.</comment>

<comment>That we caught.....so far.....are you going on record as saying those were the only ones?</comment>

<comment>If you have evidence that implicates more, share that with the police. Otherwise you're bluffing.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>They seem to be fine here.</comment>

<comment>So far and except for these 2........and so on.Were not the guys that bombed the Boston marathon refugees as well?</comment>

<comment>No, they were asylum seekers.</comment>

<comment>And the practical difference between the 2?</comment>

<comment>They go through different processes and one is held to a higher and stricter standard.</comment>

<comment>And that is important how?Clearly either process has some holes........</comment>

<comment>The system with less than 1% failure rate must be thrown out? Thank goodness you're not an elected leader.</comment>

<comment>How many lives are you willing to risk? How many were killed and maimed in Boston?How many more like the 2 we caught are out there?</comment>

<comment>The funny thing about most of your post is that it relies on conflating refugees and asylum seekers and then has no numbers to back it up.</comment>

<comment>And you are drawing distinctions with no practical difference and trying to spin the very people that made it thu the net and got the USA were the same people that you Lefties said would never make it thu the net.</comment>

<comment>The problem is not knowing which 1%. Whether it's immigration or a quality control line, if you can't tell which units are failed then you don't have quality control, no matter how thorough your procedures are and no matter how few units fail.By the way, just how many have they caught? If they could say, "Oh, we've caught this list of 2,843 radicals and stopped them from entering, and it's only these 2 we didn't catch," then you'd be on firmer ground with the "only 1% failure rate" argument.</comment>

<comment>They only caught 2.</comment>

<comment>Actually you are.Your stance is that even though we caught 2 there is no reason to fear---on same day we had an ISIS supporter ambush a cop BTW---there is nothing to fear.We didn't have any "evidence" on these 2 until we did.</comment>

<comment>Not a refugee amigo, evidence points he was a recent convert.The data is not on your side.</comment>

<comment>Which means what?If a recent convert can do such things then what exactly is preventing a refugee?And again, we already caught 2 of them who were just like him.How much risk are you prepared to inflict on others?Was not the President just on TV last night saying essentially "if we could save one life?" Well if you could save just one citizens life by stopping the refugee program wouldn't that be worth it?</comment>

<comment>This only makes sense if you see they were of the same religion and then assume it is the religion causing this which is weak logical thinking.Excellent concern troll but I'm not buying it.</comment>

<comment>You don't have to, you clearly are refusing to either look at the facts or see reason.Take religion out of it, we just caught 2 people that lied about their plans  and entered the country so unless those were the only 2--and good luck with that.If it would say even one life...why take a chance?</comment>

<comment>I'm looking at the fact that less than 1% of refugees were arrested which shows the program was a large success.</comment>

<comment>So far.....we didn't have these 2 until we found them.Again, if there is just a "1%" chance to save a human life, why not take it?Or to phrase it another way---you would be ok with taking a "1%" chance that something would kill you or a loved one?Wonderful!!! Please contact the various groups testing high risk experimental drugs, they always need test subjects and you seem perfect for it.....it just a small chance of death or serious injury and it would be so helpful to society and all. ;)</comment>

<comment>1. I said less than 1%, look I'll do the math for you.2/11,000 = 0.00018181818Now, you have a higher chance of dying in a car accident than the likely hood of a refugee succeeding on a terrorist act, should we ban cars as well? If we're using small percentages as a way of dictating our society, I suggest we should.</comment>

<comment>Except that car crashes are seldom deliberate acts--they are "accidents"Kind of difference between those and a deliberate plan to kill people."if we use small percentages as a way of dictating our society......."Well the President and Left do so with gun control.Since you like math divide the number of gun deaths--subtracting about half for the suicide rate---then divide it by the 290 MILLION guns in circulation.</comment>

<comment>Ah but the threat remains under your logic.I'm actually very much in favor of gun rights so please spare me your red herrings.</comment>

<comment>Except again, there is a serious difference between literal "accidents" and deliberate attacks.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  The president said if this new legal gun law change saves just one life, the change is worth it.On the other hand, the president says that we should allow 10,000 refugees into this country.  The implication is that if we lose a few Americans to the refugees, the greater good is that we welcomed the refugees.He does not apply the same logic to gun laws and refugees.In the former case saving one American makes the option worth selecting, in the latter case losing one American does not matter.</comment>

<comment>I think you said that better than I did......esp the last paragraph.</comment>

<comment>Thanks.  I also thought your earlier comment about Germany on NYE was right on the mark.</comment>

<comment>And we don't even know if these two actually did anything wrong.</comment>

<comment>Do you you go swimming in waters infested with great white sharks?   Only a very small percentage of them actually attack humans,  you know.Or how about frolicking with grizzly bears?  Most all  that I have encountered  on the trails  have run away.  So what's there to be concerned about?Your logic stinks.   .</comment>

<comment>"Republicans pounced on the news that two men indicted on terrorism charges had been resettled in the U.S. after fleeing Iraq."Don't you hate the way those evil Republicans pounce on things like this?Oh terrorism?  Naah, that's not bad, not nearly as bad as Republicans who are out there being correct again.Liberals (or Atlantic writers, which seems redundant to clarify):Ok with terrorism; not ok with someone disagreeing with them politically.</comment>

<comment>Yes,  they can be rather fearless when it comes to  embarrassing themselves.  indeed.</comment>

<comment>Ugh.</comment>

<comment>That's the problem. Although I identify more right of center, I absolutely disdain the rhetoric of the GOP on immigration and refugees - but after this it will resonate with the people because Obama will refuse to comment and every other member of the Democratic Party will say nothing.</comment>

<comment>Well actually, just today some Dems are urging action against Iranian belligerence -- specifically their latest BM launch -- that the Obama Administration, in all its Leftist, Islamophilic glory, will likely ignore.However, many of these non-party line Dems have names like Lowey (nee Melnikoff), Engel and Wasserman Schultz, so the rest of the "mainstream" Regressive Leftists will just accuse them of dual loyalty (like they did Schumer) and continue to hail everything the Islamophile Obama says (or doesn't say).</comment>

<comment>We shouldn't stoop to the level of Governor Jerry Brown of California who refused to let Vietnamese refugees settle in California on the 70s. We are better than that. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yup, google it. He refused to let planes of Vietnamese land in Caifornia and demanded the federal government stop them. He said California had too many Hispanics and welfare recipients. Liberal hero Jerry Brown. </comment>

<comment>I had a number of 7th Special Forces Group veterans who the Hmong/Nungs and Vietnamese fought along side as instructors in high school JROTC for 4 years.I am aware of the history of sacrifice the Vietnamese made fighting on our side during our time in Vietnam,  Then I served in the US Army in the 80's with many Vietnam veterans. The problem most Americans do not know and yes it was not widespread but the Vietnamese brought their war to the US. While there were not 1000's of murders by Vietnamese there were murders which the FBI had to investigate which took many man hours according to the FBI agent interviewed in the documentary. But I do understand and believe when we have collaborators in a foreign war and lose or leave we do have a responsibility to them.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't lump the Vietnamese in with the ME refugees...Most are very grateful and HIGHLY functioning additions to this country...</comment>

<comment>I watched a documentary a few months ago about Vietnamese gangs and Vietnamese Nationalist who were brought in to the US as refugees. Apparently there were a number of murders linked to these refugees in the US most unsolved but linked to the Vietnamese refugees. Any time you bring in refugees you bring in problems which are a drain on our resources we do not even take care of our own citizens, When we solve health care, homelessness, and unemployment of our own I would be more inclined to be for taking in refugees.</comment>

<comment>Westboro Baptist Church.  The Tea Party.  Rick Santaorum, Ben Carson etc. refuse to assimilate.</comment>

<comment>None of  the people you mention believe you should be killed because of  your avatar.A rather significant  distinction,  wouldn't you agree?</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't be so sure about that.   They all want to deny my reproductive rights, my right to health care, my right to marry, etc.</comment>

<comment>Please go live in a Muslim majority country.</comment>

<comment>There are Muslims in my area and they don't bother me.</comment>

<comment>Fashionable liberal westernized hijab-wearing hipsters who protest in your quad are not the Muslims that anyone is talking about.</comment>

<comment>So I guess if you personally are ok then that is all that matters?Cause the victims of the Boston bombing and Fort hood or the the cop that was attacked by an ISIS supporter just today etc etc. might have a different POV.</comment>

<comment>Huh?Not your right to heath care in general, nor your right to marry, and your as far reproductive rights--what exactly do you mean?abortion is not only illegal in many Muslim nations those doing it are often executed and or imprisoned. Being gay in any regard is also a death penalty offense in many Islamic nations, most the USA is ok with marriage equality.You seem to engaging in hyperbole and making very broad comparisons that have no real basis for comparison.As an example, a gay couple I know moved back to the USA back in the 90's--when I asked them why they said, my paraphrase "over here they won't let us get married, over there they want to kill us."</comment>

<comment>None of those people you mention --disagreeable as they may be-- have raped or murdered anyone in the name of their religion. Do you really not understand that distinction?</comment>

<comment>Seriously, you see no difference between the Westburo group and the Tea Party or Ben Carson?</comment>

<comment>I dont know?I dont live in the middle east.What if we forced liberals to take responsibility for their own states?World peace?</comment>

<comment>Meanwhile in Philadelphia Muslim shoots cop." Capt. James Clark, homicide unit commander, said suspect Edward Archer, told detectives: “I follow Allah. I pledge my allegiance to the Islamic state. That is why I did what I did.”“He confessed to committing this act in the name of Islam,” Ross said at a news conference Friday afternoon."</comment>

<comment>He's mentally ill, according to his mother, and has been hearing voices.  A devout Muslim, lately his mother says he's been doing poorly.Not valid to use this as an example.</comment>

<comment>Qu'ran 4:89,91" [4.89] They desire that you should disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so that you might be (all) alike; therefore take not from among them friends until they fly (their homes) in Allah’s way; but if they turn back, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and take not from among them a friend or a helper.[4.91] You will find others who desire that they should be safe from you and secure from their own people; as often as they are sent back to the mischief they get thrown into it headlong; therefore if they do not withdraw from you, and (do not) offer you peace and restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them; and against these We have given you a clear authority "You were saying ?</comment>

<comment>"according to his mother"  he was a good boy, just fell in with the wrong drugs.Yes ma'am, they all are good boys to their mother aren't they.</comment>

<comment>His mom would say that...How else do you defend such and act?</comment>

<comment>The mayor, knowing all this - announced that it had "nothing to do with Islam".Maybe the Philly mayor could be the next mayor of Cologne, Germany.By the way, the perp has recently visited Egypt and Saudi Arabia.</comment>

<comment>And thats not even mentioning the gang rapes in Europe we read about the last few weeks.</comment>

<comment>I'll be surprised if some of our American males don't rush over to join in.  Just give some people the idea they can rape with impunity and they're all over it.  (see Tourism in Cambodia).</comment>

<comment>Go stand with Jackie.</comment>

<comment>Nothing like Leftist moral equivalence; as if it is applicable...</comment>

<comment>Moral equivalence?  You mean the guys that run over to Cambodia to get a little very young strange are not the same guys who wouldn't mind being able to grab anything off any street in America?</comment>

<comment>They are. The children of the peace loving Somali "refugees" we took in are joining ISIS in droves. They have been raised to fail in our society and blame us for not catering enough to their special and superior culture.Even if these refugees are peaceful, as we can see they are not, their kids will be fed the same poison every night at the dinner table, and will hate us when they fail as well.</comment>

<comment>We are living in a time of mass insanity.  What is NOW clear is that PC is making America stupid.  I guess to get promoted within the PC culture it is advantageous to actually be a stupid person, otherwise how in the hell could you adapt?  PC promotes stupidity.  It is like a bubble that is going to burst soon and everyone will reorganize under better leaders.</comment>

<comment>I have to admit that I voted for Obama twice and I never really thought political correctness was a real issue.  I thought intelligent people were running the country.  Then, Black Lives Matter and the Cologne rape apologists and then of course the open-door policies to allow in millions of jihadis and then of course the bi-partisan effort to make 30 million illegal aliens citizens woke me up.</comment>

<comment>Wow, unless you just didn't care, you didn't bother to learn about Obama's Far Left radical friends and associates like Ayers, Dohrn, Rev Wright, Khalidi and Davis -- and the fact that Obama was raised as a Muslim in Indonesia -- and STILL voted for him? TWICE -- the second time after his Cairo genuflection speech to the Muslim World, and his abandonment of Western allies?! What did you think would happen?!?</comment>

<comment>Mainstream culture has been largely successful in marginalizing the fact Obama had a Muslim upbringing. To this day, the majority still laughs off suggestions Obama might be Muslim, as if it were all some racist propagandist trope left over from a negative campaign ad back in the day.PC culture, with its wishful-thinking cultural relativism, and Islamic culture, with its compelling false narrative casting Muslims in the role of victim, has been something of a perfect storm, clouding critical thought and blinding Westerners to how fundamentally incompatible today's unreformed Islam is with the entire civilized world.</comment>

<comment>If I could like this a millions times I would Ian. The majority of the Western world are such dupes and we are all paying the price.</comment>

<comment>Iran hangs them. Another favorite is pushing a wall over on them.</comment>

<comment>But why does the acceptance decision have to depend on Left-Right politics, or on what Europe does? I'm not sure bringing folks here accomplishes much with respect to the situation in Syria as only a few of the better-off among displaced Syrians have the resources for the application and trip here. I think the USA should concentrate on assisting the refugee camps in the Syrian border areas, so that Turkey and Jordan don't have to take the entire burden of 2 million people on their own. And so that the Syrians can return home when the war ends.</comment>

<comment>You're right.   If these are truly refugeees,  then the  truly compassionate thing to do is to temporarily  re-settle  them within their own culture  and let them return home after the crisis passes,  rather than subjecting them to a completely new and foreign  culture and society that they are not unprepared for  and never had any  plans to adapt to.It's the height of arrogance  to just assume that they'd be better off here  and then ship them across an ocean.It's almost enough to make one wonder if the UN Refugee resettlement program is really about the refugee's best interests   or if there's some other agenda at work.  </comment>

<comment>The reality is, there is no such thing as a temporary migrant or immigrant...They are going NOWHERE...Our laws do anything but encourage them to go home...Hell, 75,000 Haitians were allowed to stay after the disaster, think they are going anywhere now? They all have gone on with their lives, had anchor babies etc...The whole system is a sham and everybody knows it...</comment>

<comment>I was referring to the camps on the Syrian border in Turkey, where they already are. That's where we would send the food and clothing.</comment>

<comment>Obama tells us the government does NOT  need a more complete  background check for  Muslim refugees  but they DO need a more complete background check for someone to buy a gun.Un fing believable</comment>

<comment>Someone wanting to acquire a gun usually has bad intentions.</comment>

<comment>And the ISIS members wanting to come in the US do not</comment>

<comment>I bought a new gun today.  I have zero intentions of shooting anybody.I have several guns.  Not a single one of them has ever shot anybody.</comment>

<comment>A gun only has one purpose:  to kill.That is a bad intention.</comment>

<comment>What was the purpose of nuclear warheads ?They kept the peace for 40+ years.</comment>

<comment>Do you know that several shooting disciplines are Olympic sports?</comment>

<comment>So the people using guns to stop other people with guns also have "bad intentions?And hunters?or the vast number of people that buy guns for personal protection?Plus, I thought the Left was against profiling?</comment>

<comment>Didn't the KENYAN say that we, the American people, didn't have anything to worry about?</comment>

<comment>I have never seen so much Leftist theory destroyed so quickly...Turns out all you really need to do is let some of their theories play out...Always self destruct.</comment>

<comment>It's just regrettable  that  if takes so many innocent victims of their folly     before the scales start falling  from their eyes.</comment>

<comment>Maybe we should take refugees from Central America instead of the Middle East.  8-)</comment>

<comment>We can take both.</comment>

<comment>There are far more refugees out there than we can possibly take in.  There is nothing wrong with choosing groups that will cause fewer problems here.  In the ME, the difference between a refugee and a terrorist is often that the former ran out of ammunition.</comment>

<comment>There is plenty of empty space in Middle America.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you should ask the people that live there if they want them?You know prior to volunteering their neighborhood and all.</comment>

<comment>Maybe we should consider pushing PAUSE on all immigration, of all types until we get our HOUSE IN ORDER! We are bleeding here....</comment>

<comment>I will take Latinas any day over German women who want to look and smell like men.</comment>

<comment>How is this not Islam?</comment>

<comment>"Progressive" politicians and journalists glory in seeing themselves as Prometheans, descended to guide lesser beings with the flame of moral awareness.  They are so infatuated with "diversity" and "multiculturalism" that they are incapable of admitting that reasonable objection can be made to bringing here multitudes from areas rife with hostility to the US and, as demonstrated by the recent outrages in Cologne, contempt for our values.   Instead, they lash out with slurs like "xenophobia," "racist," "right-wing," "populist," etc.  Essentially, it is an exercise in self-stimulation.</comment>

<comment>Have to vet these refugees properly. It really shouldn't be a matter of debate. Nothing could do worse harm to American Muslims than a series of incidents perpetated by 'refugees'.</comment>

<comment>They need about 100 years of vetting.</comment>

<comment>Won't help.  Try a few eons.</comment>

<comment>Even worse is dumping one million refugees into a country with a history of violent nationalism.</comment>

<comment>The US has a history of violent nationalism?????Better learn some history. There's no place on earth that doesn't. Xenophobia is a universal disease. The United States is actually well ahead of the curve.</comment>

<comment>Germany, brother. The clue was in the one million.</comment>

<comment>I was talking about Germany.</comment>

<comment>Ah, me. Sorry. I am so used to anti-US claptrap that I react reflexively.I will say that thus far the German people seem more victim than victimizers.</comment>
