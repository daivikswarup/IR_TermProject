<comment>To my thinking, those who go out of their way to deny american citizens their right to vote are among the lowest forms of life, and are certainly acting against the very foundation of democracy as advanced by our founding fathers.</comment>

<comment>How are people being denied the right to vote?</comment>

<comment>Those Founding Fathers didn't get upset about having to be a man and to own property before voting.</comment>

<comment>To my thinking, those who go out of their way to deny american citizens their right to vote as many times as they like, are among the lowest forms of life.....what you meant to say</comment>

<comment>So, Mr. Hornbeck, how many cases of multiple voting have been exposed over the last few decades? What I have seen suggests that the phenomenon amounts, nationwide, to a few hundred votes per year. In terms of electoral perfection, the problem is insignificant compared to the MILLIONS of people who are unable to cast their votes due to flaws in the system.</comment>

<comment>If that were remotely true Dems would have no problem with voter ID laws....</comment>

<comment>You overlook the fact that voter ID laws tend to make it harder for citizens to vote -- which makes the real problem even worse.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  Similarly, those who wish to enable illegal voting by those who are not citizens, are as low and acting against the very foundation of democracy as advanced by our founding fathers.</comment>

<comment>Again, how many cases of such voting are there? How does this compare to the reverse, in which legal voters are prevented from voting due to various flaws in the system?</comment>

<comment>According to the Washington Post, 14% of illegal immigrants were registered to vote in both the 2008 presidential election and then the 2010 midterms, with 6% actually voting in 2008 and 2% in 2010. Scary numbers that easily affect American elections and corrupt the process. The significant drop from 2008 and 2010 in percentage of illegal immigrants who actually voted parallels the increased voter ID laws across the nation, now adopted in more than 36 states.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>That study is probably the best actual data that we have -- and its conclusion is based on a grand total of just 21 cases. I'm not saying that the study is wrong, but it doesn't help much. As yet, we simply don't have solid evidence that the problem is significant.</comment>

<comment>I find that an apallingly specious argument</comment>

<comment>Why do you consider my argument to be specious?</comment>

<comment>You asked for evidence refuting your statement, sammybaker  took the time to find it.  You then say that his evidence is insufficent, without providing any counter evidence.In the words of the Great One, The Rock, know your role and shut your mouth.  sammy laid the smackdown on your jabroni "it doesn't exist" lies and your roody-poo, candy ass, response is to repeat the same thing, over and over again.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's evidence. But it doesn't decide the issue. It's too weak to support strong policy responses. You seem rather upset about this.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for finding the WaPo article.  For some reason, every left-winger that I talk to believes there is, in essense, zero electoral fraud in the United States.  Obviously, that isn't true, but I had no idea the scope of the problem until now.</comment>

<comment>Read the article closely.  This was a survey, not identified cases of illegal voting or fraud.  It holds as much water as a polls showing sanders or carson will win the election.</comment>

<comment>It exists.  How much of a crime has to exist, for it to matter?  Is just a little voter fraud ok?  Is just a little prevention of keeping a citizen from voting ok?  My argument is that neither is acceptable.I take exception to people trying to say that one violation of the law "isn't as bad" as the other.As for learning about illegals voting, I would suggest you look.  A quick google produces this, to start...http://www.ojjpac.org/election...Also in 2014, a local NBC news affiliate with only a brief investigation, reported evidence of illegal aliens voting in the Florida elections.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>"How much of a crime has to exist, for it to matter? Is just a little voter fraud ok?"There are lots of crimes that we don't bother with. Take littering, for example. It's done every day, by millions of people, but we seldom enforce the laws against it because a) the damage done by the crime is minor; and b) it costs more to enforce the law than to simply clean up after the crime. But there's a more important factor. You seem to think that it's no problem when millions of people aren't able to exercise their right to vote. I reject this thinking.My belief is that every illegal vote is just as undesirable as every unjustified non-vote. In other words, we need to achieve a balance. We need to make it easier for people to cast legitimate votes, and harder for people to cast illegitimate votes. But right now, there are millions of people who can't cast legitimate votes, and hundreds of people who cast illegitimate votes. Which problem demands more attention?</comment>

<comment>Another specious argument.</comment>

<comment>Why is it specious?</comment>

<comment>Definition of specious --1)  defining illegal voting by non-citizens as being as innocuous as littering.2) Implying I said there was "no problem" with citizens being prevented from voting, which I never said, but which you attempted to use as a form of deflection and discredit of my statement.I will repeat what I said earlier:"It exists. How much of a crime has to exist, for it to matter? Is just a little voter fraud ok? Is just a little prevention of keeping a citizen from voting ok? My argument is that neither is acceptable.I take exception to people trying to say that one violation of the law "isn't as bad" as the other.As for learning about illegals voting, I would suggest you look.

<comment>Perhaps you should re-read my comment. I did NOT define illegal voting to be as innocuous as littering.You acknowledge that citizens being prevented from voting is a problem. Good. Would you agree that one prevented vote is just as much a problem as one illegal vote?Let's establish what we agree upon: that both problems are real. Do you agree that the problem of prevented votes is much greater in magnitude than the problem of illegal votes?</comment>

<comment>According to the Democrats, every ballot cast is by a valid citizen, and evil Republicans do everything in their power to keep citizens from electing their franchise, unless those citizens are listening to Rush Limbaugh on their gun racked pickup truck on the way to the poll.According to the Republicans, piles of ballots are being outsourced to China, while millions and millions of Mexicans sneak over the border and drive Prii with NPR to secret places, where additional ballots are added to the mess of voting in urban areas.</comment>

<comment>And like every story, there are three sides -- the Democrats' side, the Republicans' side, and the truth.</comment>

<comment>One of the greatest strengths of the US federal system is the role that states can play as experimental laboratories for new legislation. Many ideas are first tried out in states: restrictions on property tax growth, marijuana, gay rights, euthanasia. If they work out well, the ideas spread.</comment>

<comment>According to estimates made by the federal government illegal voting by foreigners is not rare" 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010."http://www.nationalreview.com/...</comment>

<comment>Another commentator has already cited that study. It is not from the federal government, it is from an academic study. I deem it the best that we have got, but its conclusion is based on just 21 cases. It is an indicator -- not conclusive evidence. That shouldn't prevent us from taking action. But we should be circumspect in making decisions based on 21 cases.</comment>

<comment>It is the Cooperative Congressional Election StudyIt has federal backingIt is conclusive evidence that a noticeable percent of foreigners illegally vote in our election.  The exact number is not important</comment>

<comment>Yes, it was funded by the feds, but carried out by an academic, who bears responsibility for its content. But the important thing is that we need a much larger study, and I for one would be happy to see a much greater funding effort here.</comment>

<comment>Right. Because it doesn't support your -- again -- specious arguments</comment>

<comment>You make assertions but offer no evidence.</comment>

<comment>I have.  Others have.  Your responses are evidence of this:http://cdn.business2community....</comment>

<comment>Then back up your claims with an actual statement of where the evidence to support your specific claim is. The only evidence we have seen is to the effect that illegal voting does take place. We have an indication that it might amount amount to something under a million votes -- that is only an indication, not compelling evidence. Meanwhile, we have large amounts of evidence that millions of people who should be able to vote are prevented from doing so.</comment>

<comment>There seems to be a common logical error being made by many commentators here. They point out -- quite correctly -- that illegal voting does sometimes take place. But they use that single fact to conclude that we must take stronger measures to prevent illegal voting.The problem is that there are two sides to this problem: votes cast that shouldn't be cast, and votes that are NOT cast that SHOULD be cast. This is similar to a problem in science with testing: you get false positives and false negatives. In some situations, a false positive is a lot worse than a false negative, so we bias the test to reduce false positives. In other situations, a false negative is worse than a false positive, so we bias the test to reduce false negatives.I consider both false positives (people who vote who shouldn't vote) and false negatives (people who are prevented from voting who should be able to vote) to be equally serious problems.However, we know that there are millions of false negatives in our voting system, and perhaps hundreds to thousands of false positives. It therefore seems obvious to me that we must devote our greatest efforts to reducing false negatives, and much lesser effort to reducing false positives.Does anybody here find my logic flawed?</comment>

<comment>I think several of us have already pointed out the flaws in your argument.</comment>

<comment>Who? and Where did they do so?</comment>

<comment>Found you again...http://www.quickmeme.com/img/a...</comment>

<comment>Do you have anything other than mudslinging to offer?</comment>

<comment>After I learned that the U.S. constitution does not grant a right to vote, I always wondered why it was it was that people would contest this fact. Lawyers know it. Constitutional scholars know it. The average person, not so much.Ah well, whatever.I know my right to vote is constitutionally enshrined and unimpeachable. I guess I can live with that.</comment>

<comment>This article makes me think of how many polling locations are in churches which wouldn't even need a formal voting celebration to dissuade certain citizens from voting.</comment>

<comment>Illegal voting is very rare but that's the excuse always used for blocking legitimate voters from voting. Closing down numerous polling stations. Cutting days for voting. No souls to the polls. Republicans are making it more and more difficult for voters to vote. We have a right to vote, no party should change the rules so that they benefit from the outcome. Still, we are dealing with the party of no shame after all. No level is too low that they won't stoop to.</comment>

<comment>While republican claims of voting fraud are virtually non-existent, their actual remarks highlight the clear objective in preventing citizens from voting; just a few noted below:Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Mike Turzai told a gathering of Republicans that their voter identification law would “allow Governor Romney to win the state ofPennsylvania."conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly:  “The reduction in the number of days allowed for early voting is particularly important because early voting plays a major role in Obama’s ground game."Former Florida GOP chairman Jim Greer:  “The Republican Party, the strategists, the consultants, they firmly believe that early voting is bad for Republican Party candidates,” Greer told the Post.  “It’s done for one reason and one reason only ... ‘We’ve got to cut down on early voting because early voting is not good for us,’”</comment>

<comment>Not to mention the recent number of elections that Republicans have won that the polls said that they would lose.</comment>

<comment>Everyone knows what the GOP is doing with voting law changes. They're a shrinking party and they know that the only way to remain relevant in the decades to come is to suppress black, Hispanic-American, young adult, poor, and female votes. Its good to hear that states have taken up the job of pushing back the GOP's voter suppression efforts.</comment>

<comment>Show an id</comment>

<comment>And that is sad. Both parties should win votes by getting support for their policy positions, not by using underhanded tactics.</comment>

<comment>" Outlier " does not mean exception.</comment>

<comment>Most States that implemented voter ID law provide free voter IDs to those who cannot afford them.  It is how the laws avoided the cost issue in the first place.</comment>

<comment>If that is true and it's also relatively easy and not too time consuming for working people then it's legitimate to require that i.d. for voting.</comment>

<comment>Well in North Carolina if you do not have one (drivers license, non-drivers license id, military id, passport, tribal id) already it requires a trip to the DMV which is never pleasant.</comment>
