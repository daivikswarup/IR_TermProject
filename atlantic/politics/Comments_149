<comment>As an activist friend of mine said, the goal had been to even get officers charged, but if protests occur now what is being protested? The jury? There has been no inference of a corrupt trial, so you would be protesting the jury, not the system. It shouldn't be about the result you think should happen (without heating the case) but should be about making sure the system even has a chance to address it. And it has.</comment>

<comment>A fair system for one thing would have had the venue changed.  This is quite an obvious move.</comment>

<comment>If anything, the lack of venue change benefits the prosecution.</comment>

<comment>... instead of benefiting the status quo of police getting off.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, so those that wish to riot if it's not a guilty verdict, really are protesting the jury, not the system. In this case, the system did everything it could.</comment>

<comment>Gray was the system...and a prime example of what a system family is...</comment>

<comment>But that's my point, Bmore!</comment>

<comment>shadeseekerIm sorry.But I would have to respectfully disagree. The death of Freddie Gray happened in Baltimore  City.Gray was a Baltimore City resident .And it was Baltimore  City employees who were charged .A"Jury of their peers" would mean a trial in Baltimore City . Its not like they didn't hear about the trail in Glen Burnie and Dundalk [Baltimore suburbs] A suburban jury would have the same chance of being biased as a City one.And so far there has been no evidence that Porter hasn't had a fair trial</comment>

<comment>shadeseekerI would add that ive been on a Baltimore city jury.And know  many others who have. And know a few of the State  Prosecuters personally ..And while  "Jury nullification" does  sometimes  occour among black jurors, from all that ive seen and heard, it isn't as prevalent as many seem to thinkSo the people that assume that the black jurors are going to automatticly want to convict Porter and that the white jurors are automaticly going to want to aquit Porter, are mistaken     ,</comment>

<comment>You miss the point of change of venue.  This is quite obviously a case where it should be changed, given the rioting and violence following upon the supposed injustice.  Three AAs and three whites charged make the case dubious so far as racism goes, of course.</comment>

<comment>As an activist friend of mine said, the goal had been to even get officers charged, but if protests occur now what is being protested? A lot of the police brutality cases rarely to never make it to trial and if they do, they steer the trial in the defendant's favor like moving it to all white, conservative, pro-police areas where people will never convict cops.</comment>

<comment>Except none of what you just said, applies in this case now does it MaxMen because it's a Black officer and the case is in Baltimore courthouse, which is as far as you can get from a " conservative" venue...</comment>

<comment>Almost. The jury also is also composed of those in the county, but outside the city.</comment>

<comment>The jury is only compromised of baltimore city residents. None from the county.</comment>

<comment>Mr FusionAll of the jurors are from Baltimore  City. None are from Baltimore County[ the suburbs and a completely different political entity ]</comment>

<comment>Yes, my mistake and thank you for pointing that out.</comment>

<comment>Mr FusionBaltimore's politics can be confusing since there is a separate county called "Baltimore county.And because Baltimore  City is one of those rare American cities which aren't in a county of any kindWhich is a major reason why a third of our residents left.Baltmore City is not that big. And many residents only had to move 1-5 miles to live in  a suburban   area where houses had grass yards and property taxes were half of what the city charges .</comment>

<comment>Right, because this particular case is applicable to all and every police brutality case nationwide? Especially if it involves white cops which form the majority of such cases?Soo much more perceptive.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, they rarely make it to trial. So the goal of protests has been heard, it was brought to trial, charged heavily, kept in a jurisdiction that favored the prosecution; So if it is a not guilty verdict, there really shouldn't be riots or protests, because at that point you are protesting the jury, not the system.</comment>

<comment>How do you protest the jury for a trial that hasn't been selected yet for a trial that didn't happen at all? You aren't making any sense.</comment>

<comment>Bmoreskyand seaI would add, that no matter what the verdict is, that neither the Prosecution or the Defense can really complain about the judge. He has been very even handed so far.And no matter what the verdict is, he should be thanked by Baltimore's citizens for not allowing the trail to become a circus in the courtroom. He has been very compentent  in my opinion</comment>

<comment>While I don't disagree with your point, I do believe the protesters* still want reform and accountability in the system. Currently, these cops are still collecting paychecks.* There is a difference between protesters and those who riot. They are not one and the same. We saw in Ferguson how many protested then a handful came out and rioted. The next day, the protesters were there cleaning up the mess the rioters left. The same happened in Baltimore. Contrary to many claims, there was little rioting but what damage was done was constantly highlighted.</comment>

<comment>Mr FusionI would agree that the media gave the very misleading impression that the whole city was on fire. But the looting was very widespread. There was even looting in suburbs like  DundalkI live in the other side of town from where the Sandtown looting and rioting was. And  there was widespread looting on East Monument Street and Eastern Ave. The Walgreens on Eastern Ave was torn up.I know people that work there.And they said that the looters went right for the pain medicine . The cigerattes all were stolen as wellAnd I watched as laughing teens walked by me with bags of stolen  clothesThese kids were not "angry". They were quite happy.Apparently the kids who attacked a neighbor of mine that night[for no reason at all] also were laughing</comment>

<comment>Nothing - they're just looking for something to break or something to steal. The past riots proved that.I'm betting most of the protesters couldn't even describe the case other than "black man killed by white cops."</comment>

<comment>Baltimore People’s Power Assembly's Sharon Black: “There’s a negative connotation to rioting..."You mean like the targeted assaults on Pakistani and Korean store owners in Sandtown and the torching of their businesses? Lots of xenophobia and racism in communities that don't support the moron Trump.</comment>

<comment>Word.  Want to fill us in on more of the facts about Baltimore--I think the readers would want to know, Tastes.  Thumbs up.For instance I don't know about Sandtown.</comment>

<comment>Convenience stores and liquor stores are more often owned by middle eastern and Asian community members, the targeting had zero to do with race and everything to do with what items were available. Also targeted were cell phone stores and pharmacies. And please remember that looters and rioters are not synonymous with protesters. they are often individuals who take advantage of the situation.</comment>

<comment>Not true -- black-owned businesses were protected and left undamaged (not all businesses in Sandtown are owned by East Asians and multinationals.) Carry out restaurants were also burned. Mob violence is mob violence, and it tends to target foreigners and "outsiders".. And the highlighted quote has nothing to do with legit protesters.</comment>

<comment>black-owned businesses were protected and left undamagedI'm unable to verify that. Could you show us what black owned businesses were not targeted while their Asian neighbors were?</comment>

<comment>Mr. Fusion -- for example, from NPR:"At the hardware store on the corner of West North Avenue and North Pulaski Street .... The window was smashed Monday night at the height of the riot. Someone also threw a brick through the front door. But that's the extent of the damage. Yvonne Gordon works at the store. She says it was spared because it's owned by black people. As soon as the door was broken, a bunch of guys from the neighborhood jumped in front to stop the looters. YVONNE GORDON: "They was like, this is a black-owned store. And we're not going to tolerate it. So go ahead and move. Go on home somewhere 'cause we're not going to tolerate it.""http://www.npr.org/2015/04/30/... :You can easily find other examples as well, and examples of Asian and Pakistani businesses being targeted -- google is your friend in this instance..</comment>

<comment>BmoreskyandseaBut it should be noted that there weren't any protests on the day of the main rioting   . Freddie Gray's family had explicitly asked for no protests on the day  of his funeral .And there was absolutely no one out there that day carrying signs or protesting. It was just straight out rioting and lootingYou can argue that the smaller rioting   on that first Saturday were protests that got out of hand .But what happened on that following week[ I seem to recall it was Monday or Tuesday] was not even remotely connected to any protest</comment>

<comment>If the courts won't convict cops, legislatures and city administrations need to adopt zero tolerance for police violence against citizens. If cops aren't sent to prison for abusing and murdering citizens, they should at least lose their jobs. This issue needs to be in the spotlight until it is resolved.</comment>

<comment>You are a fool and more than likely one of the uncivilized swine running the streets robbing, and murdering people at will. You want to be able to commit crime unabated and not have to suffer the consequences of your and scum like you crimes. BS. Have no fear though the public is arming themselves more and more each day so you won't have to worry about officers you will meet instant justice right at the scene of the crime you fools commit. Civilians do have all the criminal friendly politicians on their backs like officers do so justice will be swift against parasites like you and they won't have to go thru months and years of BS to justify killing violent felons resisting arrest and got what they ask for.</comment>

<comment>The swine murdering people at will are often euphemistically called the police.</comment>

<comment>Gray was injured evading arrest and died as a result. The charges against the cops caused a "ferguson effect" and cops stopped policing certain areas. Now the murder rate in Baltimore has exploded. So...it seems the problem of police in balitmore is roughly 1/1000th the problem of street thugs killing each other.</comment>

<comment>Those arresting him have been charged with "false arrest". They had no cause to stop him, let alone arrest him.</comment>

<comment>They had a cause, the illegal knife. They didn't have probable cause to pursue him after he fled, but he fled because of his long rap sheet.</comment>

<comment>The knife was legal. Other witnesses said they started after Gray before he ran. He was stopped and forcibly held before they had any idea that he had a knife.</comment>

<comment>The charges of false imprisonment were dropped by the grand jury.  No one is on trial for false imprisonment.</comment>

<comment>Gray was murdered by the persons representing an institution that was originally organized to track down and return runaway slaves. Gray was not a slave, and did not deserve to die, even if he was evading arrest for being Black, which is the only crime the Baltimore Police know how to enforce.</comment>

<comment>So the illegal knife and long rap sheet had nothing to do with him running away?</comment>

<comment>The prosecutor said the knife was legal in Maryland. The Supreme Court in Heller did state that a person may arm them self for self defense.</comment>

<comment>The guy was a drug dealer. Seriously, you're defending a drug dealer. In the meantime, 300 black people have been murdered in the city and no one cares. It's only the great St. Freddie that they want to riot over. Give me a break.</comment>

<comment>Porter killed a man. Seriously, you're defending a killer?</comment>

<comment>tttbnrNo offence,but have you ever been to Baltimore?Our police force is around 50% black. Our Mayor is black.So  are  all of the top elected officals in  Baltimore. The judge in this trial is black.As is the State's Attorney .Almost all of the  City Council, city Council, are black.And a majority of the jurors in this trial are black.As is the police officer on trialIm sorry.But you have a strange concept of  how white supremacy is practiced</comment>

<comment>The mayor, police officers, Baltimore's elected officials, and the judge are black kapos, enforcing the white supremacy that informs their class status.</comment>

<comment>When a cop assaults someone, that makes them a criminal. Your supporting criminal activity is all we need to know about you.</comment>

<comment>hahahhaha, excellent parody, A+</comment>

<comment>When are you going to post some of your conservative views for us?  Do you save those for other web sites?</comment>

<comment>Well that of course makes sense ONLY IF reality matches what the BLM movement claims.Cameras on thugs.Darren Wilson still doesn't have his job back, folks!!  Time is overdue to rehire Wilson in Ferguson.</comment>

<comment>I suppose they could always use another janitor.</comment>

<comment>Who, the mayor of Baltimore or the chief prosecutor?  Sure they'd do a good job?</comment>

<comment>Darren Wilson still doesn't have his job back, folks!!Freddie Gray doesn't have his life back either. Tamir Rice doesn't have his life. John Crawford doesn't have his life. ...</comment>

<comment>Who has Tamirs tampered with pellet gun ?</comment>

<comment>Tamir Rice's gun was still in his waistband when he was shot. The cop had no clue whether it was a toy or not. Ohio is still an open carry State, it would have been legal even if it was real.I never understood why so many people like seeing blacks murdered.</comment>

<comment>I don't like seeing anyone murdered.  Eye witness reports that he was waving the gun at passers by, The public.  This was very tragic but some of the blame MUST be put on other parties.</comment>

<comment>Nor do the two cops killed in Boston, first degree murder  by a thug.  No question about that one.</comment>

<comment>The court is a jury of peers. Getting charges brought has been the goal, breaking the blue line. That has been accomplished. If there was something showing the case has been corrupt that is one thing, but it has been anything but. protesting now, is protesting the jury, not the system.</comment>

<comment>You are absolutely correct, and the reason why police departments, legislatures, and municipal administrations are no longer trusted to govern well is they have consistently sided with abusive and murderous police policies rather than the people they are supposed to represent.</comment>

<comment>This comment is awaiting moderation. Show comment.</comment>

<comment>Well, aside from watching your language a bit, AH, you are of course correction.  thumbs up, dude.  (This site is pretty good with not cutting comments--except for Mr. Coates, who cuts off all his commentary regularly--but you don't want to push it with certain words.  Friendly advice for the future.)</comment>

<comment>These uncivilized fools are not activists and peaceful protestors so stop calling them that.  They are domestic terrorists and violent felons who seem to think that making threats of he will be guilty or we burn down the city intimidation BS is going to force a guilty verdict of a case that never should have been in the first place. Well parasites a majority of this country is tired of your BS and will not be intimidated in to anything in fear of your stupid temper tantrums. Burn the damn city down it will prove peoples point of you fools being nothing but a bunch uncivilized, uneducated, racist, anti American, anti law and order domestic terrorists. This time law enforcement better have the weapons ready and prepared to use them. These parasites are not going to be happy no matter what happens. This time they are arrested they had better be facing jail time and not have their charges dismissed so they can get right back out and continue their violence and hate.</comment>

<comment>After 300 years of your bullsh!t, you ought to be surprised they haven't burned the entire country down.</comment>

<comment>Not possible with only 13 percent of the population.  Anyway, I doubt if most AAs in fact support the "activists" in good ole Baltimo.</comment>

<comment>The black and brown population is continuously increasing in this country or haven't you noticed.  It is entirely possible.</comment>

<comment>Dream on.  The AA population hasnt increased since the Civil War (as percent of population).  As for other groups--Asians, south and east, are the largest growing group in the US--and they are more white than whites!  Or haven't you noticed?</comment>

<comment>So - you support black people destroying their own neighborhoods?It undermines support for their cause.It exacerbates capital flight. It exacerbates white flight.So - why would an educated person such as yourself support self-destructive behavior?</comment>

<comment>John, don't put words in my mouth.  The word support is nowhere in my post.</comment>

<comment>It was certainly implied.  So - do you support rioting and looting?</comment>

<comment>I have to agree with Orange Policy on this; when peaceful resistance fails, civil disobedience is inevitable.</comment>

<comment>But what follows the failures of the protests isn't "civil disobedience," it's attacking innocent, completely unrelated people.  When peaceful resistance fails, the inevitable result is burning down some random stranger's shop to show the law you're angry?  That's not just wrong, it's actively counterproductive.Until the people responsible realize that and care enough about their communities to protect them rather than destroy them in times of strife, we're just going to see this same cycle over and over and over.  Instead, what happens is that people who really do care about the community protest, the protest goes nowhere, and then lunatics take advantage of the situation to get free stuff under the guise of being victims of The Man.  The community response needs to be as strong against the rioters as it is against the police, and it's really not.</comment>

<comment>BoomerGalWhy do I have the feeling that if someone was looting your neighborhood  and burning down buildings, that you wouldn't be calling it " Civil Disobedience"?The riots in Baltimore involved people looting stores.There was no protests that day.None at all. This wasn't Selma.It wasn't the storming  of the Bastille .It wasn't Lexington   & Concord. It was just a group of jerks who  acted against the wishes of the vast majority of Baltimore residents[ Feel free to come to Baltimore and ask residents if they thought that the rioting  was somehow beneficial .Or if it was " Civil Disobedience" . Trust me, you wont find many that will.Even if you only walked through the black neighborhoods]</comment>

<comment>So you support killing black youth. You implied it.</comment>

<comment>No - apparently you do. Murders in Baltimore this year have set a record, even as arrests are down about 50% and while murders and other American cities such as New York city are a fraction of what they used to be.Less police presence =  more dead black youth, not that you guys ever give a crap when your insane theories shockingly don't work in the real world.Under O'Malley - murders were down though it took over 100,000 arrests/year to make that happen. But I guess he was a racist, wasn't he?</comment>

<comment>If you dislike criminals, then you will dislike these cops. They falsely arrested someone. They assaulted him. They put him in a police van while cuffed and shackled without any restraints. They deliberately drove recklessly causing Gray to be injured. They didn't give Gray any medical treatment nor did they call for medical assistance as they should have.Where the heck is your personal responsibility now?</comment>

<comment>So that makes you happy. You really are a sick puppy.</comment>

<comment>1) You were screaming that everyone was guilty, no matter evidence or due process, and you were attacking anyone who disagreed. Once again, you were wrong.  Admit it.2) You have a reading comprehension disorder.  Pointing out that there is a tradeoff - in terms  of more dead black youth - when you demonize the cops only means that you guys might examine the real world consequences of your social justice crusades.In economics, we adults discuss the concept of tradeoffs. Look it up.</comment>

<comment>John, you made up your own facts multiple times on this and other threads. When confronted with facts you will always try to divert attention to something unrelated.The discussion is the killing of Freddie Gray. Whomever else was killed in Baltimore (or wherever else you wish to bring up) has no relationship with the topic at hand.Gray was murdered. That is a fact. You like it when blacks are killed. That is also a fact.</comment>

<comment>I have a 100% correct track record the outcome of these media inspired trials.You are positive that this particular officer was guilty. You were wrong.Now you are positive that Freddy gray was murdered, even though there is not yet been a murder conviction.So, you apparently don't learn from your errors.If no one is convicted of murder, I expect a full retraction and an apology.You were also on the side of demonizing the police, which has led to a heck of a lot more black murders in Baltimore. </comment>

<comment>You have a 98% track record of being wrong. You spell your name right otherwise it would be 100%.</comment>

<comment>I support mayors like Giuliani and Bloomberg, who saved countless black lives by enforcing the law.The biggest victims of mayhem are innocent black people people who live in those neighborhoods.</comment>

<comment>But you support killing black youth. You implied and didn't deny it. Gray was a victim of a criminal act. He was falsely arrested and assaulted. He was killed inside a police van. He was denied medical treatment. And you support that.</comment>

<comment>Please link to where I supported the killing of Freddie Gray.The prosecution accused 6 people of murder.  It looks like a massive case of over-charging.If a jury finds them guilty, they should go to jail.  If not, then people should accept the process.I don't support a rigged jury outcome to appease a mob. Do you?</comment>

<comment>Please link to where I supported the killing of Freddie Gray.Nope. You implied it and still refuse to deny it. Your support for exoneration of those who murder blacks is standard.The prosecution accused 6 people of murder.  It looks like a massive case of over-charging.Nope. http://www.usatoday.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>White people abandoned Detroit after the '67 riots.The black-run city ran up $18B in debt over the next 35+ years and the declared bankruptcy.The center city is now recovering only after said bankruptcy because white people are moving back.Apparently, you do need us.</comment>

<comment>"Apparently, you do need us."By design.  However, as your population diminishes, how long do you expect that to last?</comment>

<comment>Uummm, most of the Detroit tax base was going to fund the construction of the suburbs. The city never got anything back from that.</comment>

<comment>OrangePolicyThere was a huge flight of people from many American cities that suffered from riots in 1968.And it wasn't just white people fleeing. There was a huge influx of black DC residents into the suburban county of Prince Georges county, starting  in 1968The 68 riots certainly weren't the only reason for the decline of cities like Baltimore.But they certainly hurt them badly</comment>

<comment>Because it's funny to watch them throw temper tantrums and destroy their own neighborhoods and then look at the burned-down buildings and say, "How come there no jobs out there?"</comment>

<comment>"A riot is the language of the unheard".When the courthouses, legislatures, police, etc. refuse to listen to you then violence is all you have left.</comment>

<comment>A desperate people will resort to desperate means. And those with power will whine that they want a piece of the pie.</comment>

<comment>That makes sense, genuinely, but I feel like if that's the actual motivation the violence would be directed at the institutions that have failed the rioters.  Right?  I mean, I live near an area that had some heavy riots last year and from what I could see on TV and driving around the area the rioters attacked stuff like gas stations and liquor stores.  It doesn't make sense to destroy somebody's store because the courts and legislatures won't listen to you, what do the two things have to do with each other?  If I was enraged to the point of violence that the court system had failed me, I'm not going to go set my neighbor's house on fire.Personally, I think a lot of the rioting is the language of greedy, violent people who want free stuff.</comment>

<comment>Violence is difficult to control, and mob violence doubly so. I wish the violence was better directed towards the targets that deserve it, but unfortunately in riots, innocent people almost always get hurt. And then of course you have those greedy, violent people who just want to take advantage of the situation.I am not in any way saying that riots are a good thing. I just think it's unfair to solely blame the rioters and let the people who created the situations that allowed the riot to occur  off the hook.</comment>

<comment>I think the rioters and the people who created the situations leading to that state of affairs are two separate issues.The rioters can be solely blamed for the riots.  Really, they can.  Both of us know exactly how stupid, selfish, and downright evil it is to take advantage of civil chaos to steal from some stranger and burn whatever you can't carry.  No matter what, that reaction is simply not justified, and the decision to do it lies squarely at the feet of the people who take part.The people letting murderous cops get away with it likewise are solely responsible for their dereliction of duty.  It seems sort of obvious that plenty of police out there see civilians as livestock at best and the enemy at worst, and our current efforts to hold the bad ones accountable are sorely lacking.  Just like some idiots use protests as a pretext for violence, some idiots use lawful authority for the same purpose.  The fault lies with them, though, and the people responsible for them, and they're never, ever the people the rioters go after because the police stations aren't full of liquor and electronics.  Police corruption and rioting are two completely separate issues that relate to the same general problem, but their perpetrators are completely responsible for their own conduct.</comment>

<comment>pizzaeagleHave you ever heard of something called the voting booth?And I hate to tell you, but the institutions that you just mentioned are predominatly  black in Baltimore.And represent the majorityof Baltimore's population</comment>

<comment>Word.  "Burn baby burn," if you're old enough to remember, was the chant of the "activists" in Chicago way back when.  Things haven't changed much for the street folks today.</comment>

<comment>Nope, but then you always do seem to be inventing crap.</comment>

<comment>Now now, watch you Fuse.</comment>

<comment>These uncivilized fools are the Baltimore Police Department.</comment>

<comment>These uncivilized fools are not activists and peaceful protestors so stop calling them that.Did you want us to start calling them "Police Officers" instead?BTW, YOU are part of the problem.</comment>

<comment>This morning I woke up and prayed a heartfelt intercession prayer for Officer William Porter as the trial evidence reported to me clearly and unequivocally lends itself to a not guilty verdict on all charges. Yet the  article stated comments, ones that ignore or do not appear to want to even listen to the voices echoed in that trial touch raw emotions in me. Again,can true justice be served where the evidence shows what you thought imay reasonably be in doubt ,correct  or enough to convict under the law as a lot of the reported prosecution's argument  appeared to have been webbed into sympathy and throwing Daniel to the lions? So today like those warriors of biblical  faith I stand in the shoes of Officer Porter in faith in you God knowing his justice might be delayed for a moment but you who always listen will come forth and save this innocent man !!!</comment>

<comment>Venerating standing in the shoes of Officer Porter is like venerating death camp kapos.</comment>

<comment>I don't think any right minded god would approve of what those six cops did. Now, YOUR god may. So go ahead and pray to your god that he support murderers and killer cops.  Pray that the guilty will never pay for their crimes. Pray all day if you have to. I just hope in the end you will realize that no god made Porter do what he did and ignore Gray's need for medical assistance.</comment>

<comment>Well, let's go over the facts as we know them, gang.  It matters.Arrestees often complain of problems so they can get taken to the hospital instead of being booked, sometimes they simply say take me to the hospital.If you look at the body language in the video, the movement, postures, and demeanor of the cops as they take him over to the paddy wagon, you'll notice a rather calm, professional manner, not the hot-headedness claimed by the street folks.A fellow arrestee in the van initially described the arrestee in question as putting on an act--he later changed his testimony, presumably under fear of retaliation from the mob and fellow prisoners.What evidence the jury heard is of course beyond our ken.Hope for the best.  I hope Baltimore stays calm and starts to attract better citizens and elected officials.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>they weren't aware of the new regulation, which had only been sent out to the police a few days before, as I recall.  As for them lying, what evidence?</comment>

<comment>Not a chance. Baltimore is sealing their fate as the Detroit of the East with his. If the cops aren't convicted, they will riot, loot, burn, and drive away any reasonable, decent residents left. If the cops ARE convicted, still pretty good chances that these thugs riot, loot, and burn things in 'celebration".</comment>

<comment>No you're thinking of what happens after the Terps win.</comment>

<comment>Possibly.  But you should know about fruitlessly rolling the stone up the hill Sisyphus.  We live in hope, or not.</comment>

<comment>I know you meant it in a friendly way, but referring to fellow commenters as "gang" is probably not the best choice of words here. :)</comment>

<comment>Huh?</comment>

<comment>What's even more amazing is that on the other coast of the country, this cop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?... won't even face a trial. Of course, the guy he paralyzed lived, but I'm pretty sure he tried to kill him. Pretty sure.Apparently it was an "accident."WTF is wrong with America?What in F**K is wrong? How can this happen and there be absolutely no repercussion on the cop? Is this what a hero cop looks like? Is this what the rule of law looks like?Argh!I gotta leave this stuff alone before I go nuts.</comment>

<comment>What is wrong with America are the institutions that pervert justice, rather than uphold it. It starts at the academy, where bigots and racists are trained to exonerate the killers tasked with enforcing the rule of the the rich.</comment>

<comment>Probably because most people are glad the guy's dead and won't cause the community any more grief.</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate America? Seriously, what kind of a scum bag can defend a murdering cop that thinks an innocent man (the prosecutor said Gray was falsely arrested) deserved to be thrown around inside a police van?You probably enjoy it when people point out you're a sick person.</comment>

<comment>I never said I "hated America." That's a pretty loaded way to start a conversation, especially since I never complained about our country as a whole.Freddie Gray was a scumbag, as his past history reveals, and he was known for faking injuries to avoid jail. I think he was a worthless human being and better off dead or imprisoned.</comment>

<comment>You are a scumbag, as your comment history attests.</comment>

<comment>That's too bad...I was hoping we were going to be best friends.</comment>

<comment>More likely your desire is to enforce Baltimore Police Department policies.</comment>

<comment>He's a troll, Ignore him.</comment>

<comment>Can't we have both?</comment>

<comment>Where is the evidence he faked injuries going to jail?It wouldn't matter if he had faked an injury in the past. Police are not qualified to determine an injury's extent. Protocol and policy is that if a prisoner complains of an injury, he is to be seen by a qualified medical person. Before being loaded into the van, Gray did complain he couldn't breathe. He also had difficulty walking. That was seen on a video.Only a scum bag that hates America would want to see an innocent person killed and the killers go free.</comment>

<comment>LOL. I guess then I'm a "scum bag who hates America." Good riddance...the world is better off without Freddie Gray.</comment>

<comment>"innocent"Like, i get that you're a professional troll, but you had to smile when you wrote that one. Oh boy....only in America is a multiple convicted felon carrying an illegal weapon, fleeing the police is an "innocent" man.Well, good news for you. The other "innocent" Freddies of Baltimore have murdered 300+ people in the city.</comment>

<comment>The prosecutor has charged three of the officers involved with false imprisonment. Because they had no cause to stop him, let alone arrest him. Because Gray was innocent.That knife? Ya, it wasn't illegal. Plus, he was arrested long before the police had an reason to believe he even had a knife.All of Gray's charges had been misdemeanors. He wasn't a felon and was not on parole or probation when arrested.</comment>

<comment>Being a former felon and running aren't crimes, nor should they be. And the "Illegal weapon" in question was a spring action knife, which sort of kind of maybe rises to the level of being illegal.Gray actually committed a crime, or he didn't, but we don't fabricate or dramatize facts to indict him. Given that the cops couldn't even get their stories straight on what exactly Gray was being arrested for, I'd say the question of Gray's innocence is still an open question.</comment>

<comment>Apparently, the logic is, "If we don't get the verdict we want, we will burn down our neighborhood, which all but guarantees that no one will invest  and create jobs in said neighborhood."You can't fix stupid.</comment>

<comment>Do you support rioting  and looting?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Ok - fair enough.</comment>

<comment>When does it start? Inquiring minds want to know.</comment>

<comment>Give me a heads up, I like it.</comment>

<comment>March, 1770. Oopps, there were several authority figures charged and found guilty of shooting the rioters.</comment>

<comment>1770 huh?</comment>

<comment>Look it up. March 05, 1770. Boston.</comment>

<comment>Instead, why don't you re-read my question.</comment>

<comment>So you didn't like the answer? Not my problem.Some people were upset at the government. They then started throwing snowballs and stones at the military that was there to enforce the peace. The military shot a few of the rioters that were breaking the law. Six were charged and two found guilty of manslaughter. Some radicals seized upon the moment and ranted at how unjust the authorities were.The ignorance of some people on American history never ceases to amaze me. And most of them swear they are patriots.</comment>

<comment>Only a CVS was burned down...LOL....Do you have a clue about the ripple effect of the CVS burn and looting?  That one event, more than any other is what led to the huge increase in murders and violent crime in Baltimore...BECAUSE..there was one gang that benefitted and took virtually all of the narcotics out of that pharmacy, which completely altered the balance of power within the gangs in Baltimore...Which then caused multiple violent turf/ drug related shootings....Which actually was a good thing, since it helped cull down the herd of violent thugs in Baltimore</comment>

<comment>The community was very upset and turned in the CVS looters. The rest of the city, contrary to the Right Wing Nut Jobs, wasn't looted.</comment>

<comment>Mr FusionWhile I disagree with much of what "huntie" said, the fact is that there was a lot of looting outsideof Sandtown. Even a few stores in the suburbs were looted.  About a dozen stores on Eastern Ave were looted.Including a Walgreens .And E  Monument St   also had about a dozen stores looted. And the small shopping mall at N Highland and E Fayette was looted as as well . Even the wig shop there was lootedAnd that's just what I saw in my neighborhood. And I live on the other side of the City from Sandtown</comment>

<comment>huntieI agreed with most of your comment up until the "cull down the herd" sentence. Which is more than disgustingIve known more than a few people who have been shot stabbed and murdered in Baltimore.All of whom did nothing wrong. Is walking into a corner store robbery and getting shot  part of "Culling the herd" ? Is  resisting an armed  robbery on the way home from work, and getting shot ,part of "culling the herd?  Is being murdered in your own home, so that   you wont testify against someone that robbed your house, "culling the herd"?</comment>

<comment>The Herd i'm talking about are all the thug gang bangers that are now deceased as a result of turf wars</comment>

<comment>OarngePolicy"1910" ????Even if that was a typo[I will give you the benefit of the doubt.] its still not correct. Just back in the  1990s millions of dollars were poured into Sandtown specifically .It was a concentrated effort by [then]Mayor Schmoke, the Federal Government and  private sector investorsAnd there was a huge fire near JHU medical center.Although I don't think that the ever found the culprit.It does  seem like a strange coincidence  that it burned down the night of the riotsAnd the CVS store was certainly not the only store looted.And Sandtown wasn't the only neighborhood where there was looting. Lots of stores in my area took a few weeks to be fixed up and reopened</comment>

<comment>You can't fix stupid.If only you could be fixed. Maybe, if you went for a ride in Porter's police van you could be.</comment>

<comment>Lovely – wishing death on people who have different political opinions than you do.Tolerance!</comment>

<comment>These are the same people who shut down campuses over online death threats, yet here they are: making online death threats.</comment>

<comment>It's wishing criminal negligence, not a death threat.</comment>

<comment>If riding in Porter's van is a death sentence, then maybe you should condemn Porter for putting people in his van. That would make it First Degree Murder.Killer.</comment>

<comment>Non-violence is indeed the righteous civil-disobedience strategy, which btw is the course of action the vast majority of protestors have adopted.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure that the prosecution proved their case. It's difficult to make the case that a police officer didn't do the right thing...like proving a negative.</comment>

<comment>Was there poor choices made? You bet. But proving a choice to be criminally wrong is far different than you or I saying "That was not a great choice to make"I dont doubt for a minute that at least some of the cops made bad judgements and calls that eventually ended in his death. But to be able to prove, for any one of them, their own criminal actions is far more difficult, given "reasonable doubt" to show that THIS officer's actions directly lead to his death.And to ignore the letter of the law, in an attempt to appease the seething violent masses of feral Baltimore residents, is to make a mockery of the law.</comment>

<comment>What if a parent doesn't buckle a child into a seat belt?It was Porter's responsibility and he failed to do the job he was tasked with. His excuse of not following policy did not have any legitimacy. No court will accept that you didn't have to obey the law because someone else didn't. Porter is the one on trial and responsible for his decisions, not everyone else.He is charged with manslaughter and not murder. Yes, it was a bad judgement, but that bad judgement cost an innocent man his life. It may be a bad judgement to drive drunk or deep fry a turkey inside, but if you do, you take responsibility for what happens.</comment>

<comment>The good news is, no great loss either way. Burn it down, who cares?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You are sure this particular officer is guilty of murder?</comment>

<comment>Sounds like he's possibly guilty of manslaughter; he had a positive duty to Gray's safety that he neglected.</comment>

<comment>Haven't studied the particulars of THIS case; however, - OJ aside - I have some faith in the jury to get it right.The thing that we laymen don't get is WHICH evidence actually gets presented to the jury. </comment>

<comment>JohnJMacI  think that the jury was presented with good evidence from both the Defense and the Prosecution.And the jury[which is deadlocked at the moment] has a hard choice before them.Something  awful happened that day. A man died in police custody .But the  Prosecution had a high hurdle to jump in proving that Proctor deliberately and knowingly caused Gray's death.Personaly  I don't see any good outcomes  of this whole affair .Even if nothing else bad happens, there is still a death, and destroyed lives, as well as a murder rate that has gone sky high[ One of my employees  also works as a manager at a nearby drug store.He had to shut down the store and lock the doors  a couple of days ago, because two men sought  shelter in the store after being shot  in the upper bodies ,a block away.Two other men died   on  the spot. The store had to be shut down in case the shooters tried to break in to finish of the people that they had shot.. Its gone completely insane! ]</comment>

<comment>More later Pete - but actually at the Charm City Penn station as we "speak."Had a very impassioned young black professional giving me his perspective on the B'more police.Agree - not pretty in any case. </comment>

<comment>JohnJMacWelcome to Baltimore! You picked a fine week to  visitIm not sure whats going on tonight The jury   is still deadlocked.And  there  is no news of rioting. But ive heard massive amounts of police and fire sirens since about 4pm. Far more than usual</comment>

<comment>My Uber went right by the courthouse. Pretty small crowd. </comment>

<comment>Us blacks lift up the Freddie Gray's of the world.  That is wrong.  We should be lifting up the William Porter's of the world for taking out the garbage and trying to keep our streets safer.</comment>

<comment>Then you sir are no better than those who kill. The cops committed crimes. They lied about what they did. They should not get anything less than what anyone else would get who killed someone.</comment>

<comment>He caused the injuries to himself most likely.  Although neither of our opinions have been proven in court.  The only thing we know for sure is that they took a criminal off the streets.</comment>

<comment>We will know that the criminals are off the street when the cops are in jail.The prosecutor charged four cops will false arrest. THEY are the criminals here.</comment>

<comment>Dude sees cops and takes off running.  But the cops are the criminals.  Ok bro.  Who's trolling?</comment>

<comment>You are. You want Gray dead no matter.The criminals are the ones who broke the law. That would be the police.</comment>

<comment>I want people to not be low-life drug dealers.  If they choose that life, I won't feel bad for them.  I guess we'll find out what laws the cops broke.  I'm guessing you already have your mind made up though.</comment>

<comment>Does it matter if they are found guilty? You have already decided that Gray deserved to die.</comment>

<comment>You are the one calling them criminals.  It ought to matter to you.  I don't think he deserved to die but I won't pity him either.</comment>

<comment>He caused the injuries to himself most likely.Most likely? That means you don't know.No, six criminals are still walking the streets. The good thing is they aren't carrying guns or badges.</comment>

<comment>There are more facts to support he hurt himself than otherwise.  How do you know they aren't carrying guns?</comment>

<comment>Police need more than just a "he MIGHT have been doing something". They need a reasonable belief that the person has contraband on them or has committed a crime. Just being in a ghetto or having a criminal record is insufficient reason to stop someone.see Terry v Ohio, (1968) Under Terry, police may pat down the outside of a person who they reasonably suspect may be holding a weapon. BUT, they may not search his pockets short of actually arresting them. Nor must a person empty his pockets if ordered.Videos taken by two people show Gray had a difficult time walking after the arrest and the police dragging him. While waiting on the police van, at least one officer sat on Gray's chest while he was handcuffed.No "facts" have come to light since his arrest that would suggest he hurt himself.</comment>

<comment>He ran from them.  I'd say that's a reasonable belief.  The arrest part of this isn't what's on trial anyways.  And yes, there is testimony that he had a history of trying to hurt himself.</comment>

<comment>In other words, if a crime is committed against you but you don't have a clean record, it wasn't really a crime?</comment>

<comment>I'm not convinced any crime was committed against Freddie.</comment>

<comment>Because of some incontrovertible facts? Or because he was "garbage"?</comment>

<comment>Did he hurt himself?</comment>

<comment>I am asking you if the reason you aren't convinced a crime was committed against him is based on facts or because you think Gray was a piece of garbage and you're just happy "they took a criminal off the streets."It's a fair question.</comment>

<comment>And I'm questioning what you consider incontrovertible facts.  I'm not going to answer a question that's based on false premises.  And, yes, I'm glad there is one less drug dealer on the streets.</comment>

<comment>Let me put this another way.You sound as if you're making a determination about Gray's guilt based on his record, not the evidentiary facts of the case, but I don't know this for sure thus I am asking you that question.</comment>

<comment>Gray isn't on trial.  We know he is guilty of being a criminal.  That actually is an incontrovertible fact.  If it's proven the police roughed him up unnecessarily, they should be punished appropriately.  I don't think they did but I could be wrong.  Either way, Freddie Gray is no hero.</comment>

<comment>I know he's not on trial, but you said in another thread "he caused the injuries to himself most likely" which sounds like you're putting the onus ("guilt") on him.You still haven't really answered the question, however.</comment>

<comment>I could care less if he hurt himself.  It's the absence of facts that has me unconvinced.  That's the reason I asked that question.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, Reginald. I was just curious how much of Gray's past played into your thinking about the case.The recent story about the cop who sexually abused dozens of women (most of whom had criminal records) has me thinking about how we view victims.</comment>

<comment>That guy is a serial predator.  He should get the gas chamber.</comment>

<comment>Now you;re trolling.</comment>

<comment>He's already dead, Reginald.</comment>

<comment>The one in OK?</comment>

<comment>Gray was likely injured while being tackled in his attempt to flee. Not murder. Garner was an eggshell who died resisting arrest and being a tubby. Brown straight up charged an officer after going for his gun (DOJ confirmed).In the vast majority of these cases, the victim contributed to their own death by resisting arrest and being criminals. It's hard to feel much sympathy for them. Tamir Rice is a tragedy and if people want to protest his death, i support that. But Gray, Brown, Garner....they were just unlucky or suicidal. Nothing can or should be done about that.</comment>

<comment>See that picture that's the liberals claim there programs are working. And if you keep voting for them you will get more of the same an it ant just BALITMORE but every major inner city they represent. An this idea these thugs are waiting for justice is total bull shit. All there waiting for is the BLACK THUGS CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SPREE. Another FREEBBIE provided by the left wing govt. to let them burn an steal what ever they want</comment>

<comment>Why are they "tense", they want justice, it just might not be the verdict they were hoping for. Get over it.</comment>

<comment>I expect that if there is a defense verdict, the demonstrators and their violent thug compadres will be out in force, doing what they love to do but it begs the question, what exactly are they now protesting and rioting about, especially since the jury was comprised of 8 black people and the defendant is black......</comment>

<comment>My best guess is that it will be a hung jury, with one or two black jurors that will simply refuse to give a defense verdict or one or two white jurors refusing to convict and the jury will be hopelessly deadlocked....That will give the rioters all the ammunition they need to justify further looting and rioting ...  They can blame racism either way it goes...The only scenario the BLMers fear is a unanimous defense verdict.</comment>

<comment>Not until all white patriarchal oppressors are eliminated from Baltimore's city leadership and the police will we rest! Justice ain't built on our B(L)ACKS! No justice, no peace! #BlackKnivesGather</comment>

<comment>Many European patriarchal oppressors are not white.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, you're right: huWhite.</comment>

<comment>I wish the article would give me more detail of the facts of the case, maybe from court room reporters. What evidence has been presented etc. or what are the exact charges.  What is the prosecution's theory?The issue in this case does seem to be the difficulty in proving that the driver's actions caused Gray's injuries. Can it be proved that the driver was driving erratically etc.?</comment>

<comment>Porter wasn't the driver, he was the escort. The driver is charged with murder.Porter took Gray off of the arresting cops. Although Gray was saying he couldn't breathe and needed an inhaler. Protocol is to call for EMTs whenever there is a possible injury. Instead, Porter put him into the van on the floor.Porter then violated protocol by not putting a seat belt on Gray. Porter claimed that it was standard to ignore policy on this. Unfortunately, that is an excuse, not a defense. Porter is responsible for not putting him in a seat belt and any injuries for not using a seat belt.The arrest was only a few blocks from the station. Instead the van drove around making hard stops and starts with sharp turns. Porter wasn't driving but knew there were prisoners in the back shackled by cuffs and ankles that could not brace themselves. The van made six stops total, picking up at least two other people.After the fourth stop, Porter asked Gray if he was OK. Gray said he couldn't breathe. Again, protocol required that Porter summon medics and transport Gray to a hospital. Porter left him again without a seat belt.When the van arrived at the station, Gray was unresponsive. The station called the EMTs. Porter stood there and did nothing. Porter was still responsible for Gray. Porter also received extra pay because he had CPR and emergency medical training.Gray lived on life support for a week. By that time his bruises had had time to heal. The coroner decided that his death was caused by a broken neck. The coroner did not make much note of any other bruises on the body as they were not the cause of death.The prosecution charged Porter with manslaughter because of what he didn't do. Porter had a duty to Gray and failed it. That failure was a leading contributor to Gray's death.</comment>

<comment>These "protesters" don't want justice. They want revenge, someone to blame and a conviction no matter what. Oh, and they want to have some fun on the streets acting like wild animals and get some free stuff too. This is obvious.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the protesters have adopted the attitude of the Baltimore Police Department, which is reasonable, as the Police are a protected faction of society the protesters wish included them.</comment>

<comment>Lots of new flat screens on the market just itching to be looted !</comment>

<comment>Baltimore is surely worried about the outcome of this trial. But I do think it's too cold to be too worried about riots. Riots tend to occur in the summer. Just a fact.Edit: Just checked, temperature is 60 degrees in Baltimore. That's pretty warm. Be prepared, Baltimoreans.</comment>

<comment>And it's going to be in the 50s for days.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Nope. It is simple. Gray was cuffed behind his back and his legs were shackled. Thus he had no way to restrain himself from falling or sliding on the metal floor.The police knew that Gray was unrestrained and proceeded to drive recklessly, knowing that that would cause Gray to slide around the floor.  While they may not have intended to kill him, the mere fact they deliberately chose not to use a seat belt or summon medical assistance makes their charges apt.The police have a duty to safeguard their prisoners. Department policy required that he be put in a seat belt. Policy also required that medical assistance be called if a prisoner complains of any injury. That those policies were ignored is why they were charged. It is not an accident if it could have been averted.</comment>

<comment>i was not at the trial so I am going by reported accounts. There was no trial evidence of a rough ride or a definitive point in time as to how or when Mr. Gray was injured. So viewing both predicates  in the context that rules must mesh with facts I stand firm in my predicate analysis and defense of Officer Porter's innocence . May I share with you the loss of one of our officers. He was charged with transporting an arrestee who had been arrested by other officers and placed the gentleman in the police car in the rear behind the screen.. For whatever reason a fellow officer forgot to secure the confiscated bullets from a weapon that had been used or let others know of the presence of the bullets so as to enhance  a search for that second weapon.The prisoner was handcuffed I believe from the back. Unknown and unaware or not reminded of the appearance rules that people sometimes as prisoners have the ability of joint dexterity(That is to move joints in such a way that even handcuffed and in the rear of police cars can maneuver their hands out of handcuffs or handcuffed restrictions), the  prisoner did that moving his hands from the back of his body to the front where the second gun was located  on his person. He then, This prisoner tussled  with the officer through an opening between the rear and front seats. Knowing that lives might be in danger that brave officer fought to reacquire  that gun and restrain that prisoner. He failed , shot and killed in the line of duty. So many tears at his funeral. You see,nothing is as simple in the life of an officer exposed to dangers we do not always see and them too. Trial testimony from those who walk in the shadow of death for us every day proved to me, from what i read and if such is accurate, that this officer used  good judgment  to  help protect all including Mr Gray!!!</comment>

<comment>Porter had a duty to use a seat belt on Gray. He knew this and chose to disregard it.Porter had a duty to summon medical assistance if the prisoner was injured. It was not Porter's responsibility to triage or assess Gray and determine if his injuries were real or fake.At the police station, Porter was still responsible for Gray. When Gray was non responsive and not breathing, Porter did nothing. Porter was trained and paid extra in CPR and emergency medical response. He did nothing. Opening an airway may have saved his life.Anecdotal information on other situations are irrelevant to this unless you are prepared to accept that every cop is dirty.</comment>

<comment>My position remains the same. He Mr. Porter did what he was suppose to do and used those techniques that he thought would help this man based on what he was perceiving then. Accept that Freddie Gray 's life  was a difficult one myriad in drug use and drug dissemination that may have affected his life and many both spiritually and physically. Not knowing this I still  love  this man being in this world as the one man who loves all of us says Freddy Gray's life was worth it . And  as I know this I must evaluate the facts in this case pro ported to have caused and contributed to this man ''s death with an open non judgmental mind  , a man again seeded  in this world by christ for His purpose . The fact we are having such discussions are positive . How might we help those Freddy Gray's in the world and show them so much love that they get off and stay off the road to sinfulness. And I note your medical points as positive inclinations that the system and the training offered at the academy needs to be tweeted  or revamped medically  . As long as officers intertwine with prisoners they are going to have to make decisions . Some touching on medical issues. We can disagree but make that energy change oriented. My position remains  the same not guilty on the record .</comment>

<comment>Gosh - why have the trial then?</comment>

<comment>It's CVS's fault for killing Gray. Burn the CVS to the ground!!!</comment>

<comment>Freddie Gray was worth more dead than alive. It's disgusting. And Baltimore hitmen decided that they needed to make six trials. It's a freaking joke. There's legitimately no way you can convict any of the officers.</comment>

<comment>If the riots start up again I say just let them loot and burn. As sad as it is, there needs to be an example of what it is these police officers are dealing with and what it is they safeguard society from. I'm plenty tired of hearing about how horrible the cops are when they show up and beat down or shoot someone that was endangering someone else, and then how horrible the cops are when they don't show up at all.Figure things out, people.</comment>

<comment>Black people need a way to start Christmas shopping. Expect not guilty verdicts and subsequent rioting and looting.</comment>

<comment>I'm on the side of the community organizers here, but I'm just going to point out that the word "rebellion" also has some negative connotations, especially lately.</comment>

<comment>I'm sort of curious as to what will happen in the unlikely event of a conviction.  If the officer ended up being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, I wonder whether riots would still result, just because of all the pent-up tension.Bodycams and civilian review boards are the answer, but the problems with lack of trust, for good reasons and bad, runs extremely deep.  Baltimore is probably going to get worse before it gets any better.</comment>

<comment>Body cams for thugs, civilian review boards for judging people who resist arrest and otherwise endanger cops doing their duties.Any other ideas?</comment>

<comment>Someone needs to explain to Sharon Black that  looting  packs of toilet papers and  packs of cigerattes and Oxycotten from drug stores isn't a " Rebellion"</comment>

<comment>Reparations?  (Just kidding, couldn't resist.)</comment>

<comment>That picture says it all. Black neighborhoods look like war zones.</comment>

<comment>John IngrumMost neighborhoods in Baltimore are full of boarded up houses.The mainly white  Baltimore neighborhood  of Pigtown   and the almost all white  Baltimore neighborhoods of Curtis Bay and Brooklyn[not the one in NYC], have hundreds of boarded up housesMy own neighborhood of Highlandtown is fairly racialy mixed. And we have a lot of abandoned houses as well</comment>

<comment>animals don't under stand human logic, they act like they live</comment>

<comment>Everybody knows these fools are going to protest no matter what the verdict is.  They know the media will be there and they might get to see their selves on TV.  It will also give them an opportunity to loot some stores for Christmas.  Baltimore p.d. needs to be out in full force, ready to crack some heads.</comment>

<comment>This system, for better or worse, is the best there is.  If found innocent, or guilty, the best system in the world is being used.  If every one that loses a trial by jury stated immediate protests, there would be protests all the time.  If the officer is found guilty, should the police protest?</comment>

<comment>"Best system in the world"--what's you evidence of that?  Europe has been far more democratic institutionally and culturally that the US for quite some time now.</comment>

<comment>No way this cop is convicted of "manslaughter" because he failed to secure a suspect who essentially killed himself.   The professional looters know this and are on their way to Baltimore with U-Hauls.   Have fun, Ms. Mayor and Ms. Prosecutor.</comment>

<comment>The ole AA folk song, "There's a Gal in Baltimo" should be changed to "There's a Mob in Baltimo."  It's become a habit there to riot.</comment>

<comment>I just read a comment by a Black student activist group saying that if Officer Porter is not convicted actions of protest will be taken as their voices will not be silent . So tonight I am going to pray more earnestly to the Blessed Virgin Mary to protect Officer Porter. Oh sweet Mother Mary place your wings of love around that officer in need  for he is innocent !!!</comment>

<comment>He'll need more than the Christian appropriation of the Greco-Roman goddess Diana to do that job.  Protestants of course gave up on Mary in principle 500 years ago.  I mean, she was a good Jewish mother and all that, but other than that . . . .</comment>

<comment>So sorry u do not know God's mother for she is a loving woman who always intercedes for us our children. Please read the Story of a Soul by Saint Therese of Lisieux.</comment>

<comment>Time to grow up Sonja.  You were misinformed and poorly educated.</comment>

<comment>I was educated to love as God loves and no one will ever keep me from loving the Mother of God. Join me in praising her for saying yes to God's plan for our eternal salvation . </comment>

<comment>The trial is a waste of time to placate the race baiters.</comment>

<comment>it would have been a more interesting article if the author had actually talked to other people besides one political activist  .The only people quoted are activists and police officials[and the latter quotes seem to just be quotes from news articles]im not sure as to where the author lives.But most Atlantic authors seem to live in either DC or NYC. Would it have been that hard to drive 40 miles from DC to  Baltimore    ,  to walk around an hour or two and talk to some Baltimore residents that weren't political activists or police officials?</comment>

<comment>I'm from SE Arizona.  Where are you from?</comment>

<comment>Never pays to attempt to get free money... as nothing is free in this world.,,sometimes you might get more than bargained for.... </comment>

<comment>The outcome matters not.  The BlackLiesMatter idiots will still march, loot, and pillage.</comment>

<comment>True.  They know from recent media events along these lines that truly, Black Lies Matter.</comment>

<comment>If you own a store, its probably best if you hire armed guards to protect it.  They will loot and they will burn.  That's what blacks do.  Especially before Christmas when they see a chance to get free stuff. Call in the national guard, before its too late.</comment>
