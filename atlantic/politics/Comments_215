<comment>Like most of us NYC Republicans, Trump is socially moderate and fiscally conservative who believes in states rights, secure borders, and a strong military - an America First agenda.Cruz, the evangelicals first choice, is un-electable in the general election. His social conservative views on issues like abortion and gay marriage are too extreme to ever become POTUS,  But f "Evangelicals" are too stupid too understand they don't have the numbers to get  an evangelical candidate elected in a secular governed nation, than they deserve the blame if Cruz is nominated and gets beaten in the general.Trump, because of his socially moderate views, as well as his ability to beat-up on the media and drive his own narrative is the only Republican positioned to win the Presidency.TRUMP 2016</comment>

<comment>No one knows what Trump believes, because he's never held office and never had to deliver on a campaign promise.</comment>

<comment>Those are perfect credentials, just like knucklehead obama.   Any idiot can be president of the US, and there's been a long line of them.  The US will be an impoverished nation by the end of the century,</comment>

<comment>If you've given up on America, and simply don't give a sh*t, vote Trump.It's accurate, but it would look awkward on a bumper sticker.</comment>

<comment>I don't live there, but I am watching the train wreck from afar.   America lost its way and is in a death spiral.  It will eventually be like what most if today's Latino, African and Muslim dominated societies.</comment>

<comment>Hyperbole alert!</comment>

<comment>You nimrods that don't live here but for some reason think you know better than Americans what is good for us have to be the stupidest people on the planet.</comment>

<comment>That's a contradiction as the stupidest people on the planet live in the US, and the mean IQ of Americans is falling.  Good luck with that.  Your country will be an impoverished nation by the end of the century, and the rest of the world is cheering that on.</comment>

<comment>Donald, this is not the time nor place to be shilling.</comment>

<comment>I don't know if it's quite that bad.  Trump evidently thinks he's hit a nerve and can become president.  I am likely to give him a chance because all the others have already betrayed us.  And he seems to like success well enough that I feel he might very well deliver in a way that American voters will like better than the circus that has been going on, of a president out of control and an opposition party in place which does nothing but enable him.  Presidents, once they are elected, seem to care about their legacy.And because the issue of illegal immigration/amnesty is so important to the future of this country and the current slate of nominees has caved to something so disastrous for the country, and worse, have taken money to deliver this amnesty to their masters, I view Trump as the lesser of what some might call two evils.</comment>

<comment>Hell liberal, you people could care less now and I do not see you whining about this. Indeed, the entirety of the Obama Era can be summed up as one that could care less.And that, would fit on a bumper sticker.https://www.bing.com/images/se...</comment>

<comment>I'm not the one who thinks that America is doomed because not enough people are living in shame of who they are.</comment>

<comment>JUST LIKE GREECE!!!™</comment>

<comment>Obama never held a public office before he was elected president? You might want to double check that.</comment>

<comment>So being elected as a senator of Illinois is "never holding public office?" -- why are you people so ignorant of reality?</comment>

<comment>Oh, and he had such a great record as senator that he stood out from all the others who would have liked the job?</comment>

<comment>Way back in Feb 2007 I tried to ask O a tough policy question about his time in the Senate. His response might have kept him from being elected twice.I wasn't able to ask my question, but I posted it hither and yon. It has 21,000+ views on YT.Yet, oddly enough, "patriots" like you have never tried to ask it or any other tough question. "Patriots" like you run away when asked to help. Some patriots.</comment>

<comment>And the question and answer was?</comment>

<comment>The question is here:24ahead.com/n/6350See the Stop Amnesty Challenge for more recent questions for him and Question Authority for dozens more.</comment>

<comment>I assume you meant to respond to someone else?</comment>

<comment>Trump has an office, that must count for something. .</comment>

<comment>Ya, but he takes the elevator. He never had to run for it. Hell, he did one time when he "almost" had that accident. Lucky for him his Chinese tailor had just delivered a new suit.</comment>

<comment>Nothing that could be considered credentials to be a president.  Today, any idiot can be president.</comment>

<comment>You can say a lot of things about Obama, but idiot is objectively not one of them. You only make yourself look bad making such a claim.</comment>

<comment>Nah, he is certainly an idiot.</comment>

<comment>As I said, you're only making yourself look like a fool.</comment>

<comment>I don't think he's an idiot, but I do think he is more of an idealist than a realist.</comment>

<comment>3/10 on the scale</comment>

<comment>Obama doesn't have to repeat the same sentence over and over waiting for a new thought to enter his head like trump does.MAKE AMERICA HATE AGAIN.</comment>

<comment>We know that Trump is a terrible leader who has already offended our allies. The PM of England calls him an "idiot" and "three times a loser." Trump fires back and what is the result - enmity with England. There you have it. That is Trump's failure leadership skills in action! He's a walking disaster!</comment>

<comment>I'm socially conservative-moderate (it's a tough spot to explain...not as conservative as Falwell but not as moderate as Trump) and I think Cruz is the best candidate. He wants to leave marriage up to the states, for example. He is the only candidate I've heard proposing that, which is the actual constitutional way to deal with marriage. On social issues, his positions are pretty much on point. CRUZ 2016.</comment>

<comment>Tell me why marriage policies have anything to do with who ought to be President, or who would make a good President. What is the Canadian interloper going to do to improve the real lives of Americans who work for a living? Most of us couldn't care less about who marries whom. We have bigger worries.</comment>

<comment>Well it matters to me. It ain't my job to convince you of why it is important or not. If you want to know what he is going to do to improve the "real lives" of Americans who work for a living, check his campaign page.</comment>

<comment>So you have no idea of why it matters if some same sex couples get married.</comment>

<comment>I said it matters to me, and a whole bunch of people. If you don't believe in traditional marriage, there's no way I can actually convince you, so I'll spare myself the trouble.</comment>

<comment>So you're a busy body that feels others business is yours. Gotcha. Just another busy body that can't keep your nose out of others affairs.</comment>

<comment>No. I don't care about people being gay. I care about  the redefinition of marriage.</comment>

<comment>I factor marriage equality into my voting decision.  I cannot support a candidate who would actively seek to reverse it.  I understand we have bigger fish to fry.  The republicans like Cruz, should also understand this and stop squabbling over an issue that has been answered by the supreme court.</comment>

<comment>Idiot.</comment>

<comment>Great, insult the people who disagree with you. How very liberal of you.</comment>

<comment>Trump well leave everything up to everybody.  He plans to sit in the White House and tweet insults all day while eating burgers. </comment>

<comment>Still a step up from the past two presidents.</comment>

<comment>This is EXACTLY what Trump would do as president.</comment>

<comment>He's unelectable.  So a vote for Cruz is a vote for Hillary or Bernie</comment>

<comment>Maybe someone "electable" like McCain or Romney would do a better job, huh?</comment>

<comment>Actually, they would. No one is voting for Canadian Cruz and expects him to win. He's not even eligible.</comment>

<comment>He is eligible. His mother is natural born, so he is natural born. It ain't that hard.</comment>

<comment>Marriage shouldn't be left up to the states.   It is a matter of equality.  There are many benefits afforded only to married people.</comment>

<comment>No it's not a matter of equality. And the whole married benefits thing is BS anyways. Marriage is a religious contract first and foremost.</comment>

<comment>No, it's not a religious contract. It's a purely social contract.</comment>

<comment>That was born from religion. So, yes, it IS a religious contract. At least you can agree that the government should have NOTHING to do with marriage?</comment>

<comment>Marriage preceded religion as an economic  contract between  families, clans and tribes. Women were basically  property. </comment>

<comment>I'm not sure it exactly preceded religion, as an actual origin date of religion could be pretty hard to figure out. But especially marriage by a western definition is intrinsically united to Christianity.</comment>

<comment>Does that invalidate all those Indian, Chinese, Indonesian, and where ever else, weddings?Which came first, marriage or religion is unknown. Both predate historical records. Yet, marriage has been in society's best interests and is an instinctual state. My guess is marriage is a societal arrangement.</comment>

<comment>No it does not. In India, China and Indonesia people are able to marry however they please. And you just proved my point with that. You get the state out of marriage, and all this people can celebrate their marriages however they please. And yes: muslims CAN have multiple wives if they want. And yes, if a particular church endorses gay marriage, they can carry it out. It's not a church I'll ever visit, but it's there. Doesn't it feel much more free?</comment>

<comment>Only a few of those people are Christians but you claim marriage is a Christian institution.</comment>

<comment>RELIGIOUS institution. And most religious people in America are Christian, and Judeo-Christian values are paramount in our culture. And as I mentioned, separating the state from marriage would not only be beneficial to christians, so I don't know what your problem is.</comment>

<comment>You wrote above: marriage by a western definition is intrinsically united to Christianity. Now you seem to be walking that back.</comment>

<comment>How? "Judeo-Christian values are paramount in our culture". In a culture where certain values are paramount, most institutions are gonna be pretty united to said values. I said that if the state got outta marriage a Christian marriage wouldn't be the only option anyways.</comment>

<comment>Marriage was an important institution before Christ ever set foot on this earth.I'm effen tired of you morans that don't have an effen clue but insist on inventing crap. Go bother someone else for a while, I have work to do.</comment>

<comment>You didn't have to reply if you're so busy.</comment>

<comment>Dumbshit.</comment>

<comment>Assume Trump is elected. He proposes keeping out all Muslims (even temporarily).1. Please list some likely Congresspersons who'll support his plan.2. Please tell us what % of Congress will - in a desperate attempt to keep their careers - pass a resolution stripping Trump of funding.ANSWER KEY:1. I don't think any would support it. Even Cruz won't support Trump crazy plans during the crazy primary.2. The great majority of Dems would do that, of course. But, so too would the great majority of GOP, because they want to be elected again.P.S. Trump fans are strict authoritarians so they don't believe in debate. If any Trump fans reply, it will consist of lies, smears, obfuscation, etc. etc. They'll do anything except try to answer questions they should answer.</comment>

<comment>The President has the power to limit immigration for any reason whatsoever in the interest of national security.  It has been used many times in the past, even by Jimmy Carter.</comment>

<comment>Oh gosh. What Carter did was much, much, much less than what Trump proposes and happened during an entirely different time under much different circumstances. Your attempt at an obviously hugely flawed talking point has been noted.The President can do lots of things, but if Congress pulls his (or her past 2017) funding, he/she only has limited funds that can be used. What people like you don't understand is that if Trump tried to do what he proposes, the entire establishment would fight him tooth, claw, and nail. On one side you'd have Trump and the dumbest, most deranged, nearly most powerless 20% of the U.S., and on the other you'd have the smartest, most rational, most powerful people in the U.S. Trump's dumb and deranged base isn't capable of understanding that reality.</comment>

<comment>So Mitbert is not Pro-Mitbert?</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but Trump is an opportunist who appeals to fear and xenophobia. He hides his terrific weakness - his  utter lack of policy savvy by hurling curses in every direction. He represents a devilish crisis in America, not any kind of solution. He is a huge disaster and sadly, many drink the Kool-Aid.</comment>

<comment>Nothing says religious right, like being an accused rapist, thrice-divorced, a serial adulterer with a mail-order lesbian bondage porn wife.Falwell's hacks will put aside their usual judgmental nature, so long as he has an "R" next to his name.</comment>

<comment>If they want to win and have an "R" in the WH- they need to "put aside their usual Judgmental nature" and support Trump.We already know that Trump has crossover appeal and will be pulling lots of Dems and Independents into his camp,  so if he can do that without losing the evangelicals - then he will win the WH in a landslide.TRUMP 2016</comment>

<comment>People keep saying that but it's simply not true.  Trump appeals to one specific type of person, and that's about it.</comment>

<comment>that's not true - he is polling very well with Democrats:http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12...</comment>

<comment>I finally got around to reading this piece, which Trump supporters have been posting pretty much since it came out, and basically it says "registered Democrats who vote Republican are going to vote for Trump, especially in Appalachia and the South." It doesn't say a mass of Dems who have been loyal through the Obama era are about to defect.It name-checks West Virginia as a place where Trump has high "Democratic" support and then pre-empts my objection by admitting that WV hasn't voted for a Democrat since OG Clinton. I'm not sure that really means anything at this point.I'm having a hard time believing people who happily voted twice for Obama are suddenly up and bolting to Trump, and the NYT piece doesn't really bear that out, but we'll see.</comment>

<comment>He has strong support among democrats in states that traditionally go for republicans.  Good luck with that.Unless he can flip New York or California you shouldn't hold your breath for that landslide.</comment>

<comment>I doubt he'll have much trouble winning people over.   You underestimate the anger of the average citizen in those states.  Unconstitutional guns laws, sanctuary cities, slower emergency response times, and outrageous cost of living, particularly in Manhatten and San Francisco.</comment>

<comment>The average voter simply isn't that angry, at least he doesn't share the nihilistic rage of your typical Trump supporter.Anyhow, how is electing that oompa-loompa going to help emergency response times and lower the cost of living?</comment>

<comment>It won't. Just like electing Sanders won't bring back millions of good factory jobs or rectify income inequality. The good ship Merica has sailed. The entire election is a massive circus designed to perpetuate an illusion of choice, and representative government.</comment>

<comment>Like I said earlier, Trump's slogan ought to be "If you don't give a sh*t about America anymore, vote Trump."</comment>

<comment>Why is it, then, that Trump draws crowds in the tens of thousands, people snaking in lines around corners, even after the places are full, in all sorts of weather in so many different areas of the country, while all the rest sit in rooms of about 5 to a couple of hundred people?  Oh, and most of these rallies are not even reported on by the media, who hate him.</comment>

<comment>It's a circus sideshow. Nothing more. People go to these rallies to see the monkey perform and throw feces around. It's the same audience you see in Jerry Springer audiences.</comment>

<comment>Because there's no shortage or angry morons out there willing to blame everyone other than themselves for their respective problems.</comment>

<comment>Trump doesn't know shit about running this country, but he knows how to sell himself to idiots.</comment>

<comment>2/3 of Americans want more gun regulations to keep them out of the hands of ijits, morons, and red-necks.I'm unaware that "sanctuary cities" were an issue. But then most people that would think it is an issue then turn around and scream about some constitutional right to bear arms while ignoring that the Federal government may not force locals to enforce their laws. You nimrods are funny.Slower response times? Uummm, see your doctor if you can't get it up.Cost of living? Ya, that is a real problem. You want the government to solve a private problem caused by capitalists.</comment>

<comment>Thanks to DCCC, the Blue Dogs, and the "New Dems" there is a huge right wing Democrat constituency that hated NAFTA and will vote for Trumpf. The Dems have their own mess too but no way will Bernie or Hilary go too negative on one another.</comment>

<comment>The blue dogs are long dead.  They've been dwindling since '94 and they're all but extinct now.Even if these "right wing democrats" existed in significant numbers in blue- or swing states, they aren't enough to tip the electoral college.  Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric will more than offset any erstwhile Reagan democrats.If Trump wants to carry Ohio, he's going to have to come up here to Cleveland.  And Trump, the guy who cheered on the rowdies who beat up a black protester at one his rallies, is going to have to convince a city that has been recently rocked by two excessive force scandals to vote for him.</comment>

<comment>Not."Mr. Trump appears to hold his greatest strength among people like these — registered Democrats who identify as Republican leaners — with 43 percent of their support, according to the Civis data."but"In many of these areas, a large number of traditionally Democratic voters have long supported Republicans in presidential elections."</comment>

<comment>Then they're not democrats.</comment>

<comment>Bullshit.</comment>

<comment>You want to believe only one type of person supports Trump.  If you look at who is posting on his FB page, you will see blacks, whites, and all the skin tones in between.  You will see young and old.  You will see atheists and believers.  You will see men and women.  I support Donald Trump and I am a 43 old Japanese female who follows the path of Buddha, and normally votes 3rd party.</comment>

<comment>By "type" I mean personality.</comment>

<comment>I think you're right that Trump's supporters aren't just hillbillies and racists. I'm pretty far left and I appreciate the way he is shaking things up. But as someone who also tries to follow the path of Buddha, I am looking for signs of compassion in Trump. Buddha, like Trump, was a rich boy, but he learned the importance of compassion. I have yet to see any of that in Trump. He has shown no sympathies for the working class. In that respect, he is no different than any other Republican.</comment>

<comment>He's not perfect, but he is compassionate to our veterans and to working class Americans, two groups who have been poorly represented in our country.  He helped a poor widow keep her farm after her husband committed suicide, thinking the life insurance policy would save the farm.  He didn't know suicide voids the policy.  Trump running for president could be interpreted as a symbol of great compassion.   He could've opted to retire in the Bahamas and live the remainder of his life in the lap of luxury.  Instead, he's running for POTUS.  Maybe he is doing this because he sees America slowly crumbling, and the hardship many of us are suffering.</comment>

<comment>Very good comment.  It amazes me how people can judge Trump, and only Trump, to be the worst kind of person, when they will give a pass to almost anyone else.  Ever since he appeared on the political scene, most of the criticism about him is nothing more than name-calling and judgments about just how horrible a person he is, and then they judge him on their suppositions.They actually did that with Romney, too.  He was a decent man, yet is one of the most hated people on the internet so far as I can see.  His name is still being brought up as what is wrong with this country.  And HE was the only one in decades who had stood with the American people on opposition to illegal immigration and amnesty, and actually had a good record on that issue.So all of you Trump haters, keep on making up your stories.  One thing Trump supporters DO have is that they are at least giving him consideration as a human being at least as honorable as the corrupt, sold-out open borders crowd which cares not a whit about Americans, not even the ones who voted them into office.</comment>

<comment>is Trump tower, or the Wollman Rink a TV persona?  Trump is about substance.  Cruz is about phoniness.</comment>

<comment>He is actually leading with every wing of the republican base, from evangelicals to business conservatives</comment>

<comment>Which still adds up to 30% overall.  How does that math work?</comment>

<comment>He is getting a larger share of evangelicals than any other candidate, a larger share of social conservatives, a larger share of business conservatives... It adds up to whatever it adds up to because it is a crowded field.</comment>

<comment>so, basically, their usual judgmental nature was always a sanctimonious, prudish act, and they'll abandon their supposed principles on a whim to back the profanity-spewing adulterer and his porn wife because Baby Falwell tells them to.</comment>

Between The classic liberal Katrina (do as I tell you not as I do ) Vanden Huvel to John (I am never right but thats not going to stop me) Nichols, They have little credibility even with leftist as their cratering readership shows. But I still read it for entertainment value.</comment>

<comment>Katrina is not a "classical liberal"  which is what most republicans are or aspire to be.  (look up the definition)She is a socialist liberal ...no different from the rest of the "progressives" in this country.</comment>

<comment>She is a limousine liberal. Whatever kind of liberal she might be she is a hypocrite of the highest order.</comment>

<comment>A limousine liberal is a socialist liberal with lotsa money - making them even more hypocritical.  So yes, I stand corrected, Katrina is definitely a "limousine Liberal"</comment>

<comment>Youll burn for eternity, fornicator! Repent now!</comment>

<comment>I have noted sanctimonious and hypocritical conduct by Christian Evangelicals who pray (prey) daily, as well as by the apostate Trump, who never prays, not once, but lies about it daily.But please remember, judgement is Mine.</comment>

<comment>Trump's going to need a greater percentage of hispanics and women than Romney; somehow I don't see that happening.</comment>

<comment>Not only wil he get a bigger percentage of those groups, but also more blacks will vote for him than any other Republican ever.Do you seriously think most hispanics support illegal immigration?Those here legally or citizens already hate illegals as much as anyone, maybe even more.</comment>

<comment>Well, I would argue that if Trump leads by 35% amongst REPUBLICANS his crossover appeal is pretty much not there. 35% is "big" but he can't even get a majority among the Tea Party darlings...And yes it is a crowded field, but he is not polling in a way that shows crossover appeal. Even as others drop to nothing he doesn't go up.</comment>

<comment>we shall see.  According to the NY times - right now Trump is going to take 20% of Dems from Hillary - my guess it it will be a lot more if Trump controls the narrative for the next 10 months the same way he's controlled it for the last 7.</comment>

<comment>In yer dreams. Only if you count "Democrats" who identify as Republican and people who never turn out to vote.</comment>

<comment>He means Dems like my Kentucky cousins who hate that "Ngg@r in Chief", haven't voted Democrat since Kennedy and wouldn't vote for Clinton or Sanders even if they promised to resurrect Big Coal and legalize meth, but will remain Democrats because their daddy was, and his daddy and..,all the way back to Calhoun.</comment>

<comment>If Trump is the GOP elect you are not accounting for how many Rep will switch and vote  Dem.  Large number. </comment>

<comment>LOL  - yeah right, if you believe a large number of Republicans think that Trump is so toxic that they wil vote for Bernie or Hillary and give them the next two or three picks for the Supreme Court...than you are nuts.</comment>

<comment>“I have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit,” Ivana Trump told CNN in a statement Tuesday. “Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president.”</comment>

<comment>Russell Moore's reaction aside, rank-and-file Evangelicals have never really had an issue with infidelity, worldliness, narcissism and aggression towards out-groups. Exhibit A is one Ted Haggard, who could be forgiven pretty much anything as long as he was breathing fire against The Liberals.</comment>

<comment>Evangelicals love redemption stories.  They love stories where someone used to be a sinner and then "saw the light" and become a righteous servant of the Lord.Trump used to be a New York City liberal, but he came around and became a conservative republican.  He may not have invoked the name of Jesus when he did so, but he hit enough points on the redemption narrative that at least some evangelicals consider it to be "close enough".</comment>

<comment>How about liberals who support Muslim rape gangs, Muslim pedophilia, Muslim wife beatings and Muslims tossing homosexuals off of roof tops?You might think about that when accusing your ideological opponents of hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>Please name a liberal who supports that. I know I don't.</comment>

<comment>The very fact you drudge up a decade old evangelical scandal and WILL NOT speak out against Muslim immigration tells everyone you do in fact support that.</comment>

<comment>So we're just going with making stuff up then?</comment>

<comment>Just looked through your recent comments. Not a thing in there about the mass rapes/pedophilia or terror committed by Muslims on a daily basis.  As I already pointed out you ignore the Muslim crimes of today to kvetch about decade old scandal.Let's play the favorite game of cultural marxists " Who's the bigger victim? "http://www.jpost.com/Internati...Muslim rapefugees in Germany stone transgender "women" . Do you side with Muslims or trannies?When a German woman is sexually assaulted by Muslims do you side with your lefty compatriots who call her a liar and bigot ? Or do you just ignore and attempt to bury the whole thing like liberal feminist media is doing?</comment>

<comment>Oh, Germany! I don't think about them too much because I live in America.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  Replace the word "Evangelical" in this comment and replace it with "black" or "Jew".  Bigot, anyone?</comment>

<comment>OH HEY WE GOT A VICTIM HEREI also see you're upvoting the guy who claims all Muslims should be kept out of the US because they're a pack of wife-beating rapists. Selective outrage, anyone?</comment>

<comment>Not true.  You target a group of people and make things up for the express purpose of demonizing them.  I want to keep terrorists out.  No one has said anything negative against American Muslims.  You need to lie to make your propaganda work. I just report facts.</comment>

<comment>What facts? You're just tossing around the words "bigot" and "propaganda" like an Oberlin sophomore.My point was that Evangelical leaders are corrupt and hypocritical and the Evangelicals don't seem to care. I used Ted Haggard as an example. Sorry if that's too politically incorrect for you!</comment>

<comment>Like I said.  By your ethics evangelicals are fair game for any kind of abuse.  Replace the word with "gay" or "Jew" or "black" or "Mulsim" and anyone can see the hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>Evangelicals follow charismatic leaders who love the press and meddling in politics. If I happen to see the faults on such a gleefully visible figure, I'm going to call them out.</comment>

<comment>It is hate speech by European standards.  As you know I am determined there will never be hate speech laws here.  I will always call out double standards and hypocrisy when it comes to free speech.  </comment>

<comment>So what's your opinion on France's hijab ban or Switzerland's minaret ban? PC fascism or bold stand against Islam?</comment>

<comment>What? in a public school?</comment>

<comment>Yep, so yea or nay?</comment>

<comment>We have uniform requirements in schools.  You must wear pants, for example.</comment>

<comment>What do you think specifically about restricting individualized religious expression in public schools? Yea or nay?</comment>

<comment>I am a radical individualist.  I understand that some institutions might require me to wear pants though.  Such is life.</comment>

<comment>What about a ban on building minarets on private property?</comment>

<comment>I am not against building any religious temple.  Islam has issues.  It is a religion anti-democratic in creed.  As a religion about a deity it is 100% protected.  As a totalitarian politcal movement that is anti-democratic it is not protected speech.</comment>

<comment>And now we've come full circle, because that's pretty much what I've been saying about evangelical Christianity. FWIW anti-democratic political speech is still protected speech as long as it's not directly inciting violence or treason.</comment>

<comment>We are not full circle except in your imagination.  And you are wrong.  If your group is to overthrow the government then the government will suppress it, as per our laws.</comment>

<comment>I posted this to the wrong response, but that's just not true.</comment>

<comment>The problem with contemporary politicians - you kowtow to one special interest group, you alienate more people than you attract. If they kiss the sword of the Latinos because they "can't lose the Hispanic vote," they alienate the working class ... likewise with evangelicals - most Americans are turned off by extremist religious groups ...</comment>

<comment>"Trump said that while he hasn’t asked God for forgiveness, he does participate in Holy Communion.“WhenI drink my little wine — which is about the only wine I drink — and have my little cracker, I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness, and I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed,” he said. “I think in terms of ‘let’s go on and let’s make it right.’”http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/...Trump doen't go back often because there is no cheese on that cracker.</comment>

<comment>No cheese, but seconds on the whine.</comment>

<comment>Lol, the way he talks about it is even ruder than the way I do. Jesus' body is a "little cracker"?</comment>

<comment>Only Catholics believe it's literally Jesus' body. To Protestants the bread/cracker is a symbol. </comment>

<comment>Depending on the Protestant. To many of us, the bread is a metaphor for sharing in the body of Christ, and the bread is disposed of respectfully. Nobody calls it a "little cracker". The fact that Trump does tells me he's not very familiar with his church traditions.</comment>

<comment>I don't think religion crosses Trump's radar much at all.  Which makes it all the more hilarious that he's making a speech at Liberty U.</comment>

<comment>I agree. He sounds as though this is all new to him. It would be better to simply admit that.</comment>

<comment>Oh OK, did not know that.  Still seems kind of rude</comment>

<comment>And this is part of what I mean when I say he doesn't speak the language of evangelicals. Thank you for posting this; it's a perfect example.</comment>

<comment>I've heard he sometimes refers to Huckabee  as a "Little Cracker"</comment>

<comment>Will America ever be enlightened enough to elect a President who checks the "None" box for Religion?</comment>

<comment>Maybe... after the nuclear fallout - from "The Great Theocratic Wars of the 20th and 21st Centuries" - finally settles?</comment>

<comment>Obama is a defacto atheist. </comment>

<comment>Oh come on, John.</comment>

<comment>In this - Bill Maher and I agree.He's been to church - how many times in the last 7 years?</comment>

<comment>All presidents find church attendance difficult and presidential church attendance has suffered in recent years - at least since the time of Reagan and heightened concerns about terrorism (Reagan used to say, "I hope the good Lord understands"). The Obamas are no exception. They occasionally attend St. John's, which they can walk to from the White House; they also attend the chapel at Ft. Ritchie, adjacent to Camp David, when they are present there. But, the Obamas haven't used Camp David as much as the Bushes have. They have occasionally attended elsewhere, and the President has had regular conversations with those who have acted as pastors to him. See Joshua Dubois' book on this subject for more information.</comment>

<comment>Reagan never went to church while he was president.  And since when are church attendance and theism equivalent?</comment>

<comment>I don't think Reagan was much of a Christian either. </comment>

<comment>That's between Reagan and his God.  But to claim that church attendance measures theism is absurd.</comment>

<comment>Obama hasn't been a church goer since he left Wright's church. He used the National Prayer Breakfast to denigrate Christians and he has been all but silent about the Christian genocide in the ME.I personally don't care except for the obvious deception. </comment>

<comment>I like that term, "de facto atheist".  So I gave you an upvote, even though I think that Obama is probably not a de facto atheist, not unless one considers a president who respects the separation of church and state concept, something  that is vital in a secular democratic republic, to be a "de facto atheist".IMO, nothing to be ashamed of to admit being a de facto atheist.</comment>

<comment>Is that why he attended church for years and wrote movingly about his conversion? Is that why he sang "Amazing Grace" when no other words seemed appropriate? You are a liar.</comment>

<comment>Rev Wright's church. </comment>

<comment>So? How is that relevant?</comment>

<comment>Don't know many Christian pastors who are raving anti-Semites:http://www.faithstreet.com/onf...</comment>

<comment>Bone up on your church history.  Christianity and anti-Semitism have a long, entangled, unfortunate history with each other.  An anti-Semite is not the same thing as an atheist.</comment>

<comment>Rev Wright is to Christianity as Farrakhan is to Islam. Bone up on your doctrine - NO mainstream Christian denomination today espouses anti-Semitism.Obama's "church" was a fringe sect led by a raving anti-Semite. </comment>

<comment>Again, how does any of this make Obama an atheist?  You keep moving the goal posts.</comment>

<comment>My point is that the only church he's attended as an adult was one whose doctrine is not recognizable by any of the traditional metrics.Just as a Farrakhan adherent isn't a traditional Muslim. </comment>

<comment>Non-traditional is still not the same thing as atheism.  You haven't proven your original point.</comment>

<comment>There is no way to "prove" what one believes.But - we Christians generally have pretty good radar about who's faking it.Going to Rev Wright's church, criticizing Christians at the National Prayer breakfast, failing to make much of the Christian genocide and failing to go to church are in my debit column. My opinion only.On the credit side, he says he's a Christian, some guy sends him a biblical passage of the day and he sang "Amazing Grace" in Charleston. </comment>

<comment>So your original post was an assertion of opinion rather than fact.  Yet you proceed to allude to evidence to support this opinion.  As a Christian I was taught to defer to what John Calvin called the "judgment of charity" and not assume what I could know what another soul believed.  Just because you don't care for what you think is Obama's version of Christianity doesn't mean he's an atheist.</comment>

<comment>What do you know of the doctrine of Rev Wright's church?Do you think many Christian churches are led by raving anti-Semites?</comment>

<comment>What I think of them is irrelevant.  My Christian tradition taught me that it is not my place to decide who, among those who style themselves Christians, is "faking it" or not.</comment>

<comment>Ok - fair enough. </comment>

<comment>Studies have shown that as education increases the belief in deities decreases.  Considering the fact that the majority of politicians have college/advanced degrees I would assume there are more than a few "closeted" atheists/agnostics.  The shameful thing is that in American you have to pretend to be religious to even get elected to the school board...</comment>

<comment>Amen, brother.Wow, this comment board is better than going to church on a Sunday morning?</comment>

<comment>The religious right is full of it.  They just want someone who will stick it to the people they don't like- gays, women, people of color.  If someone does that, they'll fall in line.  We'll see how much candidate's faith matters when they turn out in support of Trump. Which they will, because, again, they are a bunch of phonies.</comment>

<comment>The carnival barker should have the KY clerk share the stage with him, they best represent the right wing's definition of christian values.Religious fundamentalism is the scourge of civilised society.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, she was married several times too... shared values.</comment>

<comment>Both of the Bible thumpers as in Donald Trump and Kim Davis are laughable. Both been married several times. Kim Davis was right to become a Republican. The party of the family values which is also laughable!</comment>

<comment>No matter whether it's Hillary the Witch, or Bernie the Socialist, as the Democratic nominee, this Liberty University crowd is going to vote Republican in November.  If Trump can fake it there, he can fake it anywhere.</comment>

<comment>Trumps biggest mistake would be going full religious...never go full religious...but seriously all joking aside.  Cruz will get laughed off the stage in a General Election amongst the entirety of the largely secular voting public due to his associations with religious hatemongers who have said such things as requiring the death penalty for homosexuals and adulterers.  Trump needs to wake up to the fact that the religious wacko birds that populate large swaths of the Republican voting base are not representative of the majority of American, many of whom, like myself, lean conservative and want to vote conservative but CANNOT and will not support religious/culture warriors...hope that makes sense....</comment>

<comment>I did an honest LOL... never go full religious!</comment>

<comment>I think you raise some good points here. Not only will Cruz have difficulty getting votes among the more secular public, he will also get pushback from people of faith who are not hatemongers. David Brooks' column about that issue was only echoing a discussion that is already taking place in some Christian communities.</comment>

<comment>The way politics works and human psychology works tells me that the country likely wants to go down a more conservative path, the pendulum swinging and whatnot, but nobody outside of the religious fever swamps particularly wants to hear about things like who can marry whom and how they can have sex and all the other nonsense.  Why the GOP continues to go and drink from that well I will never know while people like myself sit on the sidelines refusing to vote for them until they stop.</comment>

<comment>It's a small sample size, I know; but I know several people in the Millennial age group - all Christians and all raised in conservative Republican families - who want nothing to do with the GOP over the culture wars. They are fiscal conservatives and some are very involved in their local churches, but they don't want to be associated with people that they see as more hateful than tolerant. They have gay friends, Muslim friends, and atheist friends; and they don't want their friends to think they're associated with people who look down on them.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, that basically describes me to a tee.</comment>

<comment>Made sense to me.</comment>

<comment>Your views are similar to some people I know, but who among the current crop appeals ?</comment>

<comment>Trump doesn't express himself as an evangelical. I don't think he'll have as easy a time in that speech on the 18th as he thinks. He is certainly not the next Falwell - the headline is ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>"If you gave Fallwell an enema, he could be buried in a matchbox." - Hitchens</comment>

<comment>My dislike for Hitchens is only exceeded by my loathing of Falwell. Gotta upvote that one :-)</comment>

<comment>Trump can easily navigate this clever trap of the left. Even Moses, King David, and St. Peter disappointed 'The Boss' from time to time.</comment>

<comment>The GOP, without knowing or acknowledging it, actually stands in a pretty decent position to retake politics in this country.  The problem is they are running back to and pandering to the small, aging, and hateful religious/culture warriors and their descendants.  Meanwhile, many of us, like myself, happen to be conservative and perhaps a bit libertarian, not religious, and not keen to hear about "culture war" B.S. much less care about it.  I feel there is a large segment of the country like this but because the GOP has the likes and ideas of folks like Cruz, Huckabee, etc. it fails to reach us...</comment>

<comment>The difference is that Bernie may have some "out there" political ideas compared to the mainstream but he hasn't associated with hate groups like Cruz has...that is a significant difference I think...</comment>

<comment>What "hate groups" has Cruz associated with?Conservative Christians?I think the difference is that one side no longer believes in free speech and debate. </comment>

<comment>The Family Research Center is classified as a hate group due to the death threats it's members espouse on homosexuals.  Cruz has shared the stage with numerous speakers who are on record calling for death to homosexuals, adulterers, and anyone not following their sexual edicts.  Furthermore, many of these same individuals that he has associated with are in support of a theocracy in America.  //Now I am a conservative and I understand and find this vile, so imagine what a liberal would do with that?  Time to wake up.  Cruz is a disaster waiting to happen.</comment>

<comment>Seeing Donald Trump stand up there with a bible in hand is laughable! This man has no Christian spirit in his heart.  Denying even children from war torn countries from coming here as refugees. That is disgusting. So he needn't stand there with bible in hand preaching how holier than thou he and other some Republicans are. He couldn't even name one passage he liked for heavens sake. If you are such an avid church goer you would think he would know at least one! Trump is just like Sarah Palin when asked what papers she read. Any of them all of them as she couldn't name just one either. He will pander to whatever group he needs to get their vote. Ever noticed how all Republicans have to mention God at some point! Rarely do you hear a Democrat mention that, not that they are not believers they just don't feel the need to ram it down the throats of everyone every minute of the day.</comment>

<comment>If the evangelical right buys what Trump is selling, they're stupider than I thought they were. He might be the least religious man in the nation. His religion consists of money, popularity and power.</comment>

<comment>Keep in mind, too, that's 33% of white evangelicals, not all Christians. He's not doing that well among all Christian voters.</comment>

<comment>Wrong- he's doing great!</comment>

<comment>33% of white evangelicals in Iowa will not be enough to win there, unless he gets a lot of other, new voters to caucus. The majority of the GOP in Iowa -at least in recent election cycles - has been made up of white evangelicals. They will be less of a factor in NH, and he might do "great" there, but he is in trouble in Iowa.</comment>

<comment>....says the Trump hater... yawn. </comment>

<comment>Evangelicals are under seige.  According to mainstream media like NT Times they are every kind of evil under the sun.  Political Correctness is no longer something we can joke about.   In Europe they are calling anything you say about mass rape by migrants a "hate crime", but here evangelicals are ipso facto fascists.  Trump is really their only hope versus the PC fascists.</comment>

<comment>Do you believe that Muslim citizens have a right to be considered innocent when suspected of a crime?</comment>

<comment>Simplistic.For example - the move to get rid of slavery and the Civil Rights movement were overtly driven by men of intensive Chrsitian belief.  </comment>

<comment>Both sides of the American slavery debate claimed to be speaking from profound Christian conviction. The Bible clearly has a positive view of slavery something pro-slavery Christians routinely pointed out. Abolitionists took a broader, less literal view of the Bible. Unsurprising that this divide led to the South being, to this day, home of the most people who take a literalist, fundamentalist view of Christianity.  Religious leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. led the desegregation movement, but it’s also important to note that the pro-segregation movement was also conceived as a Christian one. Arguments against “race mixing” were largely framed in religious terms. The judge who ruled against the interracial couple in Loving v. Virginia argued that the “Almighty God” put people on separate continents and “did not intend for the races to mix.” Christian right leader Jerry Falwell himself got his start giving sermons about how integration was offensive to God.</comment>

<comment>Rules of bible quoting for "Christians":Whenever a bible passage can be used to support someone's belief and bigotry, that passage is clear, stands on its own, and does not depend on any other context or special interpretation.Whenever someone points out any of the hundreds of bible passages showing god literally ordering or approving killing of children, raping of young girls, proper treatment of slaves, death penalty for minor infractions, and genocide, the proper response is(pick one or more of the following):1. It is taken out of context 2. Can only be understood by special understanding of context 3. The OT is not relevant 4. God can't be understood by humans 5. This is selective quoting 6. The quoter doesn't understand the bible 7. God didn't say that, he was "misquoted" 8. God meant some special application, such as to Israelites or    ancient clergy, etc.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  One more thing: Lying is fine if it's done "in the name of Jesus".--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's pretty clear that sometimes the bible "means" exactly what it says, and sometimesit "means" the opposite.  Think of an ox being gored.  Which reminds me,If god is able but not willing to prevent evil he is himself evil.If he is willing but not able he is flaccid and weak.If he is both able and willing, how can there BE evil?If he is neither able nor willing, why call him god?</comment>
