<comment>Chief, you are the fastest racehorse this world has ever seen. You race at a master level of politics.Go for the doctorate level.Speaker Ryan mentioned that we need better ideas, not better politics. Second that.</comment>

<comment>"we need better ideas, not better politics"I find those hard to separate.  It's hard to consider better ideas when the politics is so poisoned that the association of a single person with an idea becomes a basis to discredit the idea.If Obama says something, then many conclude that idea should be banned.  On the other side, ideas from Ryan are pretty much DOA.</comment>

<comment>Let's give Ryan better ideas and Obama better politics.Everyone has their own tool preferences. I say if they want more tools to do the work they wish to do, let's keep those custom-made tools supplied to them.</comment>

<comment>Lyin Ryan is a LIAR and can not do basic arithmetic</comment>

<comment>Very interesting history and perspective. It seems, though, as if you're postulating a framework of either heavier protest or heavier political involvement, when both/and seems necessary and inevitable. I think of DeRay Mckesson announcing his bid for mayor of Baltimore, and it seems like the perfect 2016 marriage of protest and politics. My bet is that this next generation of influential political voices, whether initially successful in gaining office or not, introduces vocabulary and ideas to the mainstream that makes it far more likely to gain widespread recognition of systemic oppressions and injustices, and that THAT sets the stage for the next major leap forward. At least that's my fervent hope.Thanks for the great article.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, I don't think it's very wise for Millenials to substitute these other forms of protest (which, as the author asserts, are working) for voting. They need to do both.</comment>

<comment>I can't wait to hear the usual knuckle dragging drivel that's sure to come on a topic like this. I thought there would be more already, but I guess it's early.Go ahead you guys (and you know who you are). Prove me wrong.Good luck!Bwahahahahahahahahaha!!!!As for the changes or lack thereof brought forth by Obama, well, when he was first elected, as I said then, he was merely human. And he was. Good on me for seeing the truth of things. I've only recently become aware of what Black Americans really face in America, so I must say, I am amazed with their patience and willingness to put up with generations of crap. Astonished really.Anyways... It will, as always, be interesting times ahead.</comment>

<comment>As for the changes or lack thereof brought forth by Obama, well, when he was first elected, as I said then, he was merely human.As is everyone.But he was also a product of Chicago Machine Politics.</comment>

<comment>Bill Clinton went to Georgetown and Yale Law.  Hillary went to Wellesley and Yale Law.  Neither are a product of Harvard.John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, and George W. Bush (MBA).  Obama went to Columbia and then Harvard Law.</comment>

<comment>30 years of Elis, ending in 2008. Maybe we need another from Harvard?</comment>

<comment>I don't think the critique was ever that he was painting himself as some kind of superhuman, then proved unable to rise to that level. If anything, that just buys into the notion that conservatives always had that people voted for Obama simply because they were swept off their feet by the charismatic huckster and needed to be returned to sobriety by a dose of Republican smelling salts.Rather, I think it would be more accurate to point out that if the Democratic voters had actually wanted a hesitant, reflexively triangulating consensus seeker, they had that option in the Democratic primaries, and they wouldn't have picked Barack Obama. "Hesistant, reflexively triangulating consensus seeker" basically describes in one sentence everything that Hillary Clinton offered in 2008. And she was rejected as a candidate, because her policies were not equal to the severity of the moment.So when the Democratic voters actually reject that option and go for the alternative, and then said alternative immediately starts behaving exactly like a hesitant, reflexively triangulating consensus seeker, it was entirely understandable that the Democratic base, which I might note includes African-Americans, revolted. The base did the impossible by making a black man president in America, and what were his first acts? It would be inaccurate to say that he proved craven and weak. No, Obama was craven and weak whenever it came time to help the little guy. When it came time to take unpopular steps to protect the moneyed class? Oh, then Obama was as bold as Heracles. A bailout of the banks without any strings attached? That had to be passed now, and we dare not wait to see what might happen. A bailout of homeowners, or a stimulus package that's as big as his own economists are saying it needs to be to do the job? No, that's too liberal; we must cut the package in half in an effort to secure the vote of Republicans, then negotiate lower to get the vote of Republicans, then go still lower just to get Olympia Snowe's vote to get out of a subcommittee where Democrats have the majority.Some of us have forgotten the fact that we were looking at this, goggling our eyes in horror and practically screaming "What are you doing?!" Nor have we forgotten that the Obama administration's response was to mock the "professional left" for what, in effect, were being the only ones to object to the Democratic Party's strategy of shooting itself in the legs and sparking a bipartisan populist revolt at exactly the moment we could have turned all of those working class whites back to the Democratic Party by harnessing their rage. If the Obama administration had harnessed that anger, all those Tea Partiers could have been grudging allies, willing to trade help for "those people" in exchange for punching back against the moneyed interests who have effectively gutted the Rust Belt of jobs, opportunities and hope. Instead, we committed them to outright Trumpism, all because Obama was more interested in not appearing liberal than actually reaching the optimal policy result.</comment>

<comment>Bernie is Obama 2.0 in some respects.</comment>

<comment>They say history repeats -- the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.</comment>

<comment>You may have something here, that's certainly been the case for the Bush presidential dynasty.</comment>

<comment>"I don't think the critique was ever that he was painting himself as some kind of superhuman, then proved unable to rise to that level."Can you recall the 2008 campaign? I can. Obama was painted as a grandiose figure in 2008, both out of necessity and because it worked like a charm on a besotted media.The necessity was that Obama had no experience to speak of, and a background his campaign did not wish to discuss in any detail. The campaign devoutly wished to draw a veil over the whole Socialist street agitator/shakedown artist aspect of Obama's work with ACORN. They certainly didn't want to discuss Obama's work on the Woods Foundation with Bill Ayers, nor the Chicago Annenburg Challenge either.So what did that leave? Obama had spent about two weeks in the Senate before starting to campaign; there was no record to run on there; and he had mostly voted 'present' in the Illinois State House.So it was a campaign all about the Great Promise of This Extraordinary Figure. The media gave copious in-kind contributions with tingles up their legs. They declared the Great Race Speech where Obama refused to disavow his anti-American, racist pastor to be a 2nd Gettysburg address (I do not exaggerate), applauded Obama's vapid Berlin Gate address ("The World Stands as One" -- ooh! the black JFK!) and swooned with delight at the Grecian columns of the Democratic Convention acceptance speech.The press treated Obama like a sacred figure, not to be defiled by common criticism. They had John McCain so thoroughly cowed that he was afraid to call Obama by his full name. Because that would have been racist.You can't make this stuff up. But you can try to remember it.</comment>

<comment>Luckily for me, Obama's need to distance himself from the whole "socialism" thing has led him to support dividend-paying capitalist ventures with taxpayer money for the past 7 years.</comment>

<comment>Crony capitalism is an excellent method of stealth socialism. Spread the money around, and the means of production will volunteer to become controlled by the government.</comment>

<comment>As long as my dividends go up year after year after freaking year, your tiresome "socialism" gibes are entirely tolerable.</comment>

<comment>And yet here you have a Sanders who is willing to kick your table over at a time when this nation is preparing to go into negative interest country along with everyone else.You will get to mansplain to voters how breaking the banks makes an iota of sense as we head for another massive recession.</comment>

<comment>the funny part is you actually think you are intelligent</comment>

<comment>get over it.</comment>

<comment>you fox news kids are such dorks</comment>

<comment>Who said that any of this came from ''fox'', liberal?http://www.centerforinquiry.ne...As I distinctly recall, the ''dorks'' were the very liberal media whose pictures you see at the above link splattered these all over their rags.</comment>

<comment>because that's where you infantile morons hangout</comment>

<comment>In all fairness, Obama probably didn't have much of a choice. He was beholden to the people who put him in office ... and no, I'm not referring to voters.</comment>

<comment>"they were swept off their feet by the charismatic huckster and needed to be returned to sobriety by a dose of Republican smelling salts"Well, he did say he would stop the rise of the oceans...its as if almost by magic...</comment>

<comment>and then sKKKalia said "we will make them rise again!!!!"</comment>

<comment>if you don't know why he bailed out the banks, you shouldn't be posting</comment>

<comment>Two comments: one, I think we'll have to see what turnout looks like after the general election to draw any real conclusions about the post-Obama electorate, and this seems like kind of a screwy year across the board anyway.  Two, I think the author is mistaken that black political power is permanently enhanced.  In fact, I think it has already hit its apogee and will decline in the years to come as Latinos displace blacks as the 2nd most important constituency in the party both in terms of numbers and financial clout, particularly in big states.  At present blacks are a bigger share of the Democratic base than Latinos, but that will change and Democratic hopes to change some purple states to blue depends entirely on Latinos.</comment>

<comment>Blacks are historically unmotivated to vote unless it's for a black politician. They'll even put race before white liberals' bolstering of the custodial state (e.g. Sanders)—things that supposedly "help" them, like welfare, money into the black hole of public education, and other handouts.I know the rhetoric from the DNC is that the Affordable Care Act helped blacks more than others, but what's the reality? Welfare blacks were already receiving "free" government healthcare.Perhaps non-welfare blacks were really that underinsured—but again, it points to their classic irresponsibility and chronic need for wealth redistribution.</comment>

<comment>Wha? Nonsense. Nanny-state conservatism has caused far more damage.</comment>

<comment>Can you explain what you mean by "nanny-state conservatism?"</comment>

<comment>Probably better to call it "nanny-state GOPism". I'm a GOP guy, but not a conservative, and I am quite sure my conservative allies in the party didn't like the nanny-state stuff. Like, for example, expanding Medicare, giving handouts to extraction industries, etc.Me, I don't mind those sorts of things. But then, I'm not a conservative; I see politics as an arena defined by "who gets what", and I'm unembarrassed at the idea pursuing my interests.</comment>

<comment>aha .... the racist comments start. Blacks are historically unmotivated to vote unless it's for a black DEMOCRATIC  candidate.Good observation!!! Blacks hardly vote for KKKonservatives.Oh wait!!!! Nooo, you are rrrrright! Tim SKKKott, the black RepubliKKKan got 90% of the black vote, right? As did Alan West, Herm the spurm Cain, Ben "I will be gay when I go to prison" Carson  .....</comment>

<comment>I agree that black political power is declining. I would go further, and say that the Democrats have clearly betrayed their most faithful voters in favor of the increasing Hispanic vote. The huge Dem push for open borders and "a path to citizenship" (& votes for Democrats) shows their priorities, and it isn't the amelioration of black living standards. Nobody gets hurt worse by competition from illegal alien labor than blacks who are so often competing for the same jobs.If I wanted to be really cynical about it, I could point out that the Dem self-image as "champions of the oppressed" requires lots of oppressed to be the champions of. Whipping up resentments is a much easier path to voter turnout than solving problems, and it's a perennial winner too.</comment>

<comment>This comment is awaiting moderation. Show comment.</comment>

<comment>Can you tell us more details about this?</comment>

<comment>Crying there is no oppression while whipping up fear of the same people who are "making up a false narrative of oppression" is an even easier path to voter turnout.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is whipping up fear of blacks. Not even Donald Trump.The only people whipping up fear are Liberals and SJWs, their puppets.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz:  "police are afraid of Black Lives matters protestors"Donald Trump "most whites are killed by blacks"and then there is this http://www.bloombergview.com/a...But I'm sure you are sure.  You are always right, right?</comment>

<comment>Well, Trump is correct at any rate. You people, on the other hand, not only bury your heads in the sand over such realities, but in a true paranoids fashion, continue to insist that somehow, the number of Klansmen who still remain on the planet [ barely enough to get up a hand of Canasta ], are somehow more dangerous than burning cities, ambushed cops, and murdered 9 year olds....</comment>

<comment>it's okay, we know you are a political moron</comment>

<comment>Never underestimate the power of the Vast White Conspiracy, which guilefully thwarts Blacks in their quest to acquire employable skills, giving rise to intolerable rates of violent crime in the "inner city."  Having caused Black poverty by their mean, selfish, uncaring opposition to equitable redistribution of income, how can Whites fault the hostility to law enforcement that prevails within the Black Community?   Only invidious racism can account for the refusal of peace officers to weigh economic circumstances in deciding whether to enforce the law.When are we going to hear complaints from the Black Leadership about the jobs being hoovered up by migrants?  Never, that's when.  Democrats have bought their loyalty with promises of continued welfare benefits.  Blacks now even entertain rosy visions of "reparations."  They will voice no objection to holding "border security" hostage to the demand that a path to voting the Democratic ticket be created for the "undocumented."  This is how the Big Red Vote Harvesting Combine rolls.</comment>

<comment>Since the "intolerable" crime rate in inner cities is less than half of what it was 22 years ago, I can't imagine what sensational adjective you used to describe it back then.</comment>

<comment>Figures can lie, and liars can figure.  The rate of violent crime in Baltimore is almost 4 times the national average.</comment>

<comment>Yes let's compare Baltimore to Manhattan, Kansas. Lol WTF?</comment>

<comment>What's that got to do with my comment?</comment>

<comment>Ah but the drop in crime is largely due to the introduction of new policing methods, which cannot be sustained in the face of the BLM astroturfed war on the cops.</comment>

<comment>Actually it's not. Or rather, that assertion hasn't been remotely proven.</comment>

<comment>war on the cops?? the stupid with you never ends</comment>

<comment>You mean B.G. (before Guiliani) before stop and frisk? When semi-auto gunfire at New Years Eve was rampant?</comment>

<comment>Guiliani lowered violent crime in NYC, and all the other inner cities dropped their violent crime rates just to give Guiliani mad respect.Another theory: the ratio between older Americans and younger Americans is higher than it used to be, and older Americans don't commit as many violent crimes.</comment>

<comment>In 1995?</comment>

<comment>The idea that Guiliani miraculously lowered crimes rates (the exact same amount as every other city in America during the same time period) single-handedly is as hilarious as it is delusional.</comment>

<comment>The descendants of slave-owners deserve reparations for the wealth of servants that was effectively stolen from their forefathers between 1863-1865.  Imagine how much richer said descendants would be today.</comment>

<comment>The greatest factor of inequality is single parenthood. Two live cheaper together than 2 apart.</comment>

<comment>You may have the causation backwards: a lot of working class women are choosing single parenthood because they want a child and the men available to impregnate them can't hold a steady job. In that scenario, the women often choose to be a single parent of one actual child instead of a de facto single parent of one actual child and one deadbeat husband.In other words, the women who are single parents don't have the choice of marrying the *same* men that the married mothers marry. Broadly speaking (not universally, but "on average"), the men that the married mothers marry are contributors; broadly speaking (not universally, but "on average") the men that the single mothers *could* marry would be deadweights around their necks, not contributors.</comment>

<comment>In all this you have to figure whether the women would get more welfare/food stamps with the deadbeat man around or not. Usually she's better off without him around.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, she usually is.</comment>

<comment>Mark, blacks in America had a 25% illegitimacy rate even in the 1950s and 1960s. By the end of the 1970s, it was 50% and has continued at 72% to spiral out of any sort of bounds other than pure lack of self-responsibility and a colossal sense of racial entitlement. Not too far behind, btw, are latinos with their 53% illegitimacy rate. Someone needs to turn off the spigot that has those youth and now 3+ generations believing those of us who work for a living and pay taxes aren't instructing our own offspring to read between the govt. entitlement lines and finally put an end to their predatory breeding madness - far too many of whom simply become criminal predators as well. With any luck, the nation will have in the next generation still in grade school today a smarter, more engaged and more self-responsible electorate than millennials, of whom none of us expect much. If millennials want to redeem themselves, they can start with their friends and peers to slow the flood of careless, single parent procreation. The drag on America will always be the millions of children purposefully brought into the world to live off taxpayers handing them a govt. check. </comment>

<comment>I don't have the causation backwards as it still does not change the fact that single parenthood is the greatest factor. Your point is well taken that a single parent would be drug down lower by a dead beat dad.</comment>

<comment>their descendants need to get a job like anybody, they didn'tsuffer because of slavery</comment>

<comment>We suffered hugely from the incessant labors involved in the care-taking of the blacks.  There was the tremendous capital investment, and then the provision for their  food, clothing, medical-care, shelter,  supervision, labor-instruction.Blacks in the US are alive today only because we invested 240 years and endless effort and monies caring for their forefathers.  Otherwise their lines would have ended in prison camps somewhere in West Africa.When will we be compensated for our centuries of labors and investment on behalf of blacks?   Sum total is easily in the tens of trillions. </comment>

<comment>wow, you have some serious stupid going on</comment>

<comment>Why, specifically, do you say that?</comment>

<comment>Non-university educated whites are quickly closing the gap, though. It's a class thing far more than a race thing.Of course, I'm just parrotting a conservative talking point (see, e.g., Charles Murray's 2012 book); liberals might disagree with me since they have their own facts.</comment>

<comment>The rate of white illegitimacy has gone down to @ 26%, much of it due to reductions in unwed teen pregnancy. Meanwhile, black and latino teens continue to procreate and drop out of high school at sky high rates that are unequivocal financial suicide, just unsustainable madness that guarantees the cycle of poverty and crime.</comment>

<comment>Why not an article about the dwindling White electorate? Some gleeful cheering about white peoples being a minority in America? Ah, but as White people become scarce, we become more valuable. Eroding our formal political power enhances our informal social power. People are still going to want to live in white neighborhoods and send their kids to white schools to improve on their current condition, but those schools and neighborhoods will be fewer and farther between.</comment>

<comment>At the risk of sounding racist I wonder if you have a point. I'm not white or black but I wouldn't want to live in a black neighborhood. Why is it when there are a large number of black people in one area the crime increases? Surely there has to be at least one middle class neighborhood where there are mostly blacks and it's a normal nice town instead of a "ghetto". If anyone know the answer please reply.</comment>

<comment>It's a matter of culture, not race. There are middle class "black" areas, but often, when blacks rise into the middle class, they move to other middle class areas, that just happen to be "white". And often, when that happens, many whites begin to move out.And everything is fine, until the "black trash" follows the decent black people.</comment>

<comment>What will happen to the black middle class if affirmative action is banned? All of those black doctors who have desk jobs in the hospital basement will have to find meaningful employment.</comment>

<comment>What are they doing at those basement desks?</comment>

<comment>Not operating on people.</comment>

<comment>They are creating the new race of humans that have no trace of white genes.</comment>

<comment>Only you can prevent dysgenic breeding. Don't get trapped.</comment>

<comment>Nice bit of fiction.</comment>

<comment>When white people leave, civilization recedes. There are already roads in the Central Valley of California that have been paved since the 1930s, but are now reverting back to dirt.</comment>

<comment>Meh. I lived for a time in a trailer park on a dirt road in Appalachia. Didn't do me no harm.</comment>

<comment>Based on your grammar it obviously didn't help much either.</comment>

<comment>You mean, when whites arrive, civilization recedes.</comment>

<comment>By your definition, Haiti is the pinnacle of civilization. Don't trip over the bong, hippie.</comment>

<comment>Haiti was doubtless better off in the hands of barbaric (white) slavers, eh?That's the typical European pattern: wreak utter havoc through wanton barbarism under the guise of industry/religion, and then victim blame whilst enjoying a collective mountain of ill-gained wealth and political power.And, naturally, all while taking sole credit for mankind's "progress." In fact, progress is best characterized as progress made in spite of white people, not because of them. </comment>

<comment>What is your definition of "progress"? Failure to develop a written language?</comment>

<comment>What's yours? Wholesale slaughter and barbarism?</comment>

<comment>Never having invented the wheel?</comment>

<comment>You didn't build that.</comment>

<comment>Maybe your ancestors should have fought a little harder instead of allowing themselves to be enslaved and colonized?</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a true rapist.</comment>

<comment>Two cheers for white civilization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>What those cheering seem to fail to understand, is that we are fast becoming a nation OF minorities, and "whites" will still be the largest faction, at least for a time.If illegal Latino immigration is allowed to continue though, then easily by 2050 the US will be a majority Hispanic country. It may happen anyway, even if we hermetically sealed the border (which isn't going to happen), because so many Hispanics--especially new arrivals-- have so many kids.Keep in mind that Hispanics are not a "race", they are an ethnicity, and many Hispanics identify as "white", or "Asian", and, though rare, as "black". Although "black" Hispanics are very common in Brazil.</comment>

<comment>Many Latinos are White and blend into the Anglo White race in America in a generation or so. I'm ambivalent about majority minority America. White people dont stop being White just because they become a minority. It hasn't happened anywhere else in the world. In some ways White things become more desirable as they become scarce. </comment>

<comment>Yes it has, Brazil once had an absolute White Majority of around 60% in the 1960s. Now Whites are only 48% of the population.</comment>

<comment>I'll always be White. Even if Whites become a minority I can still trace my ancestry back to Tregony, Donegal, Annweiler, and Sobrance. I can still take a DNA test that proves I'm 30% German, 25% Irish, 25% Slovak, and 20% English. I can still claim descent from Niall of the Nine Hostages. I can still claim Irish and Slovak citizenship by descent (as can my children). I'll still be able to pass on my genes to my children. What exactly changes if Whites are a minority?</comment>

<comment>Nothing. America will still be America. Biological differences among humans are overvalued for their effect on culture.</comment>

<comment>It's both culture and biology, but everyone acknowledges the culture part and ignores the biology part.</comment>

<comment>Right on, 60% of kids born today have at least one white parent even though officially <50% of new borns are classified as white.  That's probably because its not cool to be white anymore.  That is a passing fashion, will come around.</comment>

<comment>America has always had a melting pot. Lots of groups are white today, who certainly were not white when they got off the boat -- Irish, Italians, Jews, Poles, Eastern Europeans, Greeks, etc. Because back then white meant WASP.Now it doesn't. So tell me, are Chinese-Americans white or not? Judging by the way they assimilate, I would say that if they are not today, they soon will be. Ditto for Indian-Americans like Bobby Jindal.How about Latinos? Sure, just look at Ted Cruz. He's the first Latino to ever win a caucus, and the media, who love 'firsts,' won't even acknowledge it. Because he's a conservative they consider him white. Lots of other Latinos are assimilating and becoming white too.So all this talk about whites becoming a minority is premature to say the least. Whites are actually a very inclusive group.</comment>

<comment>For me, White is a genetic and not a social science term.</comment>

<comment>Actually, the melting pot stuff is very, very recent. There's a reason the U.S. was an economic powerhouse democracy when it was 80% white from the 1700s - 1940s and was nearly 90% in the 1950s. The pot starts melting from 1960+.</comment>

<comment>the issue is what's called "the minority majority" where blacks,asians and latinos combined outnumber whites, because the minoritiesgenerally vote democrat</comment>

<comment>Majority minority has nothing to do with voting, just arithmetic.</comment>

<comment>has nothing to do with voting? it does when republicansare running out of white people</comment>

<comment>Majority minority means the sum total of minorities exceeds the number of 'whites' regardless of how or if anyone votes; arithmetic.</comment>

<comment>okay, I'll put you down as a slowwit</comment>

<comment>Sure and you are innumerate exacerbated by bias blindness.</comment>

<comment>your simple minded efforts at pedantics is hilarious</comment>

<comment>Wanting to live in a "white neighborhood" is more salient among the white lower middle class than among affluent whites. Most of *us* would much rather live next door to an African-American lawyer than a white janitor.(And anyway, it doesn't matter which of these we *prefer*, since anyway we choose housing that the African-American lawyer *can* afford, and the white janitor *can't* afford).</comment>

<comment>I prefer white trash to just about any other type of people except maybe recent European immigrants.Anyway, research is quite clear that *all* whites prefer white neighborhoods.http://www.slate.com/articles/...Blame ethnocentrism or racism or whatever; there is no evidence that personal wealth has any effect on this preference.</comment>

<comment>"Anyway, research is quite clear that *all* whites prefer white neighborhoods."___Since I've just this moment conducted research that has proven that at least 3 whites don't share this preference, I think what research has *really* proven is that you don't understand the correct meaning of the word "all". That took me 5 minutes, so if I spend, say, a month doing a full scale research project I'm quite confident I could find that your definition of "all" is off by thousands of people.But anyway, as my previous post indicated and which you didn't even attempt to refute, it doesn't *matter* what white upper class professionals "prefer" so far as race is concerned, because we consistently prefer (as demonstrated by our actions) to live in neighborhoods that African-American (and, actually, Asian-American, and immigrant) professionals *can* afford (and *do* afford), and that loads of whites simply, unambiguously, full stop, *can't* afford. That's not only true, but it's *obviously* true.</comment>

<comment>"African Americans are converging around an abundance of issues, wanting to be heard and employing new strategies to achieve it."Like playing victim for the profit of White liberals?</comment>

<comment>"The post-Obama bloc employs a different strategy to bring about change—one rooted in creativity and energy."Like burning cars and playing the 'knockout game' with elderly white people? How creative. The latest generation of yooofs are feral, unhinged monsters.</comment>

<comment>Acting like undocumented shoppers also.</comment>

<comment>It seems to me that one of the problems black Americans may face politically is that the Democrats have come to rely on their vote, and don't feel it's necessary to do much to earn it. I mean, what are black people going to do -- vote Republican? Yeah, right.</comment>

<comment>The point of the article is, partly, that this relationship is beginning to show cracks.Of course, we tend to vote Democrat because Republicans made a calculated choice to recoup racist white voters by making us into (political) targets. But for the platform of racist outreach, which Republicans have re-affirmed over the last seven years, absolutely more of us would vote Republican. Same-sex marriage, abortion - there's substantial overlap on social issues.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your perspective!</comment>

<comment>Street theater is only useful if it somehow translates into electing officials with clear agendas on improving conditions. If all it manages is to get a few college presidents removed and sparking a "conversation" that leads nowhere, it isn't worth the bother.And if younger blacks really want to dance with Republicans, well good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>"And if younger blacks really want to dance with Republicans, well good luck with that."I care about Black people.Do you?I'm okay if they want to dance with White liberals,I want the best for them.</comment>

<comment>I care about all people not named Scalia or Cheney.</comment>

<comment>Hey why stop there....why not 60M people who voted for Romney, surely they deserve the same fate don't they?</comment>

<comment>No, they don't.</comment>

<comment>I care about Cheney if he happens to be holding a firearm in my vicinity!</comment>

<comment>Yep. This. Street theater is good, and can be fun, but the right has made the gains it has in my lifetime by doing the tedious long game of getting people elected to school boards, city councils, and street improvement committees. I love creativity and energy brought to the political process, but it doesn't replace politics if you want to see changes happen in the political process. This would be my message to all the young, newly excited and energized folks, black and white, and inbetween.</comment>

<comment>The left has made plenty of progress too via its long march through academia and the popular culture. You don't think all these special SJWs thought up this nonsense by themselves, do you? They were carefully taught.</comment>

<comment>Fueled by the success of the 2% and less crowd, blacks see this as a chance to rise to their full 13% potential. You go girls...</comment>

<comment>It's pathetic that writers like this encourage blacks to vote based on the color of their skin, as if there could be a candidate that represented the views of all blacks.  Give me a conservative that respects the person and doesn't use identity politics to drum up support by hatred based on lies and half truths.</comment>

<comment>No one wants to live under Black rule.  Not even Blacks.</comment>

<comment>Why would you say that? Look at election results in Chicago or elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>Why are blacks moving in droves back to southern states?</comment>

<comment>And then turning those places into Thunderdomes of unrelenting vicious crime and corruption.</comment>

<comment>Well, that DOES explain the rise of Trump and the democratic divisions between Sanders and Clinton. </comment>

<comment>Perhaps someday the democratic party will renounce it's long held sexism and racism and start governing to benefit all people and not specific groups</comment>

<comment>another dumb fox news viewer heard from</comment>

<comment>According to the article, is there anything black people are going to be doing except expect or demand this and that? It's too long and boring for me to examine myself. Someone ought to do it for me.</comment>

<comment>When whites have made investments in blacks in the last 70 years, it's been in the athletic ones or musical ones.  With those, some return can be had (for one's university, pro ball-club, Olympic team or record company).But what else is there to invest in that's black-related?  Chicken-shack restaurants?  Cheap- clothing labels?  Hair-products?  Gold jewelry?How about real estate?  Um, Inglewood and Harlem are on the road to getting gentrified hard.   That's not an investment in blacks, that's smart-whites needing housing and having a great willingness to displace black owners and renters to get it.If you think that a ton of government investment is suddenly going to make blacks this great ROI proposition,  you are mistaken.  The IQ's are not there and "environment" can only do so much to influence that.And frankly, if some Asian-kid eating fish-heads and living in a shack can get admitted to Harvard with no affirmative-action involved,  what's the black kid's excuse? Right, there's no excuse.  Just the reality of having a small brain and low impulse- control lol.</comment>

<comment>you dumb regressives are hilarious in your ignorancekeep watching fox news and stay atupid</comment>

<comment>Do you watch Fox News?</comment>

<comment>only to see what SNL will make fun of next</comment>

<comment>You are helping their ratings.  Who's the dummy?</comment>

<comment>they average less than two million viewers, what ratings?</comment>

<comment>That's more than CNN, and MSNBC.</comment>

<comment>they sure as hell are not "america's news headquarters"you dumb goobers will believe anything they say</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you have seen cases like some old Duke University professor who criticized Black culture and was hit with an outcry of racism. Many Blacks actually insist that what they do (culture) is (implicitly) intrinsic to who they are (race).</comment>

<comment>Sorry but that is BS.  Hint.  I have spent quite a bit of time in Africa.</comment>

<comment>Big deal! Being there doesn't make you an expert. </comment>

<comment>It makes your understanding BS.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be follow that old trope that "if some black people protest about something, all black people agree"Can you think of a single subject where all white people across the board would agree on and tell me with all honest that there would be not one white person to disagree.So I would ask that you consider why black people can't  hold opinions that differ from other black people after all, what difference to the argument does it make if "a group of people disagree with you, and there black"?On a side note I actually do disagree with Will Yum. For one there is no such thing as black culture. For one Africa is the most culturally diverse continent on earth, also the most biologically divers, so the idea that black people as a whole have a shared culture is a bit of a myth, granted that it is a myth that is often perpetuated in the west by both blacks and whites for differing agendas.African American culture (not fully, but in a general sense) is really just a subset of American culture and most of it can be summed up as either a assimilation and alteration of White American Culture a Rebellion from White American Culture or something imposed by White American Culture.Lets be clear here, culture like identity is something that is heavily shaped by the outside.If you take a look at Brazil a place where slaves (while slavery lasted longer) were allowed to hold onto their culture and also form their own communities. There you can see actual traceable culture.Many of the things that Americans wag their finger at when referencing black culture. The rest of the world look at as American Culture.So just to clarify there is nothing distinctly black about African American "Culture" as a whole.</comment>

<comment>Voting is how we publicly express our opinions. Blacks bloc vote at an over 95% rate. So, yes, it's a fair claim.</comment>

<comment>considering the racism of the republican party, what do you expect,?</comment>

<comment>You said it, not me. I said many Black people or the most vocal Black people... I never said all Black people. So.. no need to create a strawman.</comment>

<comment>I hardly think it is a strawman argument (the word seems to be used far to liberally online recently like some sort of internet fashion accessory)You invoked the opinion of some blacks, to counter the argument of someone on a subject affecting blacks. I pointed out that just because some blacks hold that opinion it in and of it'self is irrelevant to the discussion, and also to think twice about (unless it was done intentionally to be divisive) using the "well these black people disagree with you" argument in the future.</comment>

<comment>What makes you say that?</comment>

<comment>I am literate.</comment>

<comment>perhaps you should have claimed that you are a world expert at the frontier of human genetics, who are discovering what many are converging on, that so much of human social behaviors, what have been loosely known before modern genetics science as "culture" are actually strongly influenced by genetics. Yes, nature is more and more recognized as far more determinant than nurture.In another 10-20 years, you will be astounded of what'll come out of Beijing Genomics Institute. </comment>

<comment>The issues of crime, poverty, socialization, etc. are fixed just fine by nurture, unless you believe you are more criminally prone than the average Asian.</comment>

<comment>Tong Benevolence.</comment>

<comment>Some are. But in 20 yrs, you will see statements in social science today are similar to medieval beliefs of the natural world before the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Bonobo are Pan are very different socially. Tiger and lion are 3-my separated. Is lion social behavior vs. tiger solitary lifestyle a matter of culture? Wolf and dog are only 30 ky separated. Are their difference just cultural? Can wolf pups be nurtured into labradors? Phenotypic social behaviors do have genetic basis and we are just at the dawn of this knowledge. The sudden rise of civilization and social organization of the last 10 ky was not by chance. We are still evolving.</comment>

<comment>Maybe not, I've heard that research into behavioral genetics is very much frowned upon at the elite level, in the US anyway.</comment>

<comment>That's why I mentioned Beijing Genomics Institute. The Chinese are not bound by our "code of silence or blissful ignorance". They are into eugenics and try to breed geniuses. A lot of scientific contribution will come from outside the West.the short versionhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...the long onehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>A real example of us falling behind because of political correctness.</comment>

<comment>So we are different species?  Wow.</comment>

<comment>Species is not a scientifically natural concept. It is just a taxonomic concept invented by early biologists that is rapidly discredited in modern genomics science. Using "species" in social and race discussion is nothing more than being inflammatory.All I say is that human behavior and mental illness, similar to our physical susceptibility to diseases like cancer, cardio- or cerebrovascular diseases, have a strong genetic component, and environment (cf. epigenetics) has some controlling effects but not as much as the current popular beliefs.In any case, regardless a person's ethnic or racial background, our society already accepts the principle that each individual shall be treated by his/her own merits. Racial genetic profile, just like medical profile cannot be used against or for that individual.</comment>

<comment>Most males in prison share the same genetic markers for sociopathy in numbers that are not replicated in the general population. The foremost delineating factors seem to be gender, then mental brain development, followed by variant nurturing which can mitigate but not compensate for the other two. Race, culture and patriarchal religions are all balled up into one, unwinding whatever positive effect good parenting might have on a male offspring. </comment>

<comment>yea....right...you should publish...Race, culture, and "patriarchal religions" are all bailed up into one, unwinding...good parenting.flabergastingly stupid.</comment>

<comment>Who isnt?  </comment>

<comment>Exactly....that's why poor whites have outscored rich blacks on SAT ever since records have been kept.</comment>

<comment>what you are so wrong is to use population statistics - which in itself is meaningless, to argue against certain policy. True, social policy can only help so much, and many Black activists are just as so wrong to insist "statistical equality" - such as demanding proportionate representation in area governed by meritocracy. But we should treat everyone strictly on individual basis. Hence, we must remove as much bias as possible against an individual because of his/her race. And we should also phase away preferential treatment just because of race also. Affirmative action is for remedy to help one or two generations, but cannot be forever.</comment>

<comment>Where did I use population statistics?And who said I was "arguing against certain policy?"  Doing so is hardly a requirement for commenting here.</comment>

<comment>you mention IQ. It doesn't matter what the average or the distribution of IQ are like, the principle is to treat each person on his/her own merit and not by the social group s/he belongs to. I'm sure you agree to that. But of course, the problem is that many Black activists demand their 13% representation everywhere, as if high-tech industry or jobs (which are already highly preferentially biased for them) are like political votes. Meanwhile they will ignore their over representation in sports for example.</comment>

<comment>"The IQ's are not there" You can't believe that.</comment>

<comment>It's not a matter of "belief," sweetheart.</comment>

<comment>Thank you (and your up-voters) for affirming that people still think like you.You see, the main problem with Political Correctness is that out in the open, away from the safety of the internet, people like yourself hide your true thoughts.However in the actual world, you're a teacher, a police officer, a large employer, someone who actually has a certain amount of power to affect other peoples lives, and while you wouldn't dream of publicly speaking these thoughts you still hold to them.When you get a black kid moved to a lower class, it is because your racist (even if you believe your racism is right)When you hold out your officers gun and the black persons life in front of you means less than a white persons life, it is because you are racist.When you decline CV's from black sounding names (because you think black people aren't as smart as white people) yes, even if you think that is true you are being racist.The problem is, that in the open world you would never admit to that being the reason for your actions and so anyone who tries to call you out on it is accused of playing the "Race Card".People like you do your best to hold black people back, refuse to acknowledge it's people like you who do this and then blame black people for being held back. If it wasn't so sad it would be comical.</comment>

<comment>Most of your ilk are "held back" by nature, by genetics.    Whites just go through the motions of processing you through the system.  Trust me, whites would love it if all blacks were par with whites and Asians intellectually.  We'd be a much more productive society. But blacks are not par, and never have been. And this goes back 500 years ago and before that, when whites were hardly around to "hold you back" from whatever you aspired to do at the time -- say, chuck spears,  beat a drum,  make grass skirts lol.</comment>

<comment>Well it is a shame that those masterful genes haven't passed onto yourself..... lol.I don't think "blacks" ever made grass skirts. I don't expect you to have an understanding or appreciation of black history, I doubt someone of your state of mind would take the time to study African History so your opinion on what black people were doing 500 years ago is quite irrelevant to any discussion on the subject.I for one am not going to join a "Who is the superior race" argument, firstly because the vast majority of the intellectual world who has spent any time studying such things understands that "Race" it'self doesn't really exist in the way people like yourself think it does, that it is more so a social label than a biological trait with just as many genetic differences to be found between two people from different parts of Africa, as with any African and European.... lol.And honestly my comment wasn't really aimed at you, but at those who believe racism doesn't exist any more. I was simply putting up a sign post to say "Look, there really are people who think like this person and those who up-vote them, so please at least consider whether someone is being discriminated against or just playing the card in future"</comment>

<comment>More strawmen than a hay-field lol ^</comment>

<comment>If what you wrote " that it is more so a social label than a biological trait with just as many genetic differences to be found between two people from different parts of Africa, as with any African and European" is based on Lewontin's fallacy of the 1970's genetics science, then perhaps you should read more modern stuffs.BTW, the point here is NOT to argue with you about "race." It's only about recent scientific progress. And regardless what science says, our society is against treating anyone differently based on background that includes ancestry, creed, beliefs.. etc. So, yes, race is totally irrelevant w/r our law and economic opportunities. But in science, "race" in the sense of genetic clusters evolved and adapted to geographic regions over 10s of thousand years does exist - scientifically.Think about wolves and dogs. There are more so-called "genetic diversity" (which is an incorrect metric in early days of genetics science that led to Lewontin's fallacy) between two wolves than that between any wolf and any dog. But if you want to believe there is no biological difference between wolves and dogs based on that argument (and they can still cross breed easily), just adopt a bunch of wolves into your house.</comment>

<comment>Alright, ill bite (that was just a really lame wolf dog pun I was making)While I disagree with the Wolf, Dog analogy as this is not comparative to race, but rather species evolution such as Homo Erectus being compared to homo Sapien .Also with the lion tiger analogy, you would be more accurate comparing a Bengal Tiger, with a White Bengal Tiger.I think the problem is one of a little knowledge plus common sense (baring in mind that common sense can often be wrong as it is a personal deduction not the acquisition of knowledge) can lead to quite huge misunderstandings.Now if we were talking about ethnicity we would be on much sturdier ground as there are certainly biological markers and specific (even if minute) genetic markers among different ethnicities.The problem is that Race is 3 groups (Negro, Caucasian, Mongoloid) created at a time when there was no real understanding of genetics other than  kids inherit traits from their parents or other family members.And when we come to ethnicity we have problems grouping specific ethnic groups genetically to racial groups because there are just far to many exceptions to the rule.An Ethiopian for example is (for the most part) racially black. However the ethnic group of a racially black Ethiopian may actually hold more in common with a racially Caucasian ethnic group than a native group from south Africa because the genealogy shows that the Ethiopian and south African are separated (from contact) for a longer period than that Ethiopian has been separated from that Caucasian branch.So while the Ethiopian are and the South African are both considered black (Negro) the racial identifying (skin colour) really holds no meaningful explanation as to what black means.So yes there are minute biological differences which makes one person appear black and one appear white, it holds really scientific usefulness.A little bit like packing up your house belongings to move to a new house and labelling one box shiny things, and another box non shiny things. It doesn't give you or anyone else any meaningful pointers on what is actually in the box, what value the box holds, what the capability of the items in the box are.A bit like when people try to assign intelligence and criminality to race.</comment>

<comment>Does it make you feel better with your last sentence? "A bit like when people try to assign intelligence and criminality to race."?Many who do what you said, "try to assign" are non-scientists with a hidden agenda. Throughout the history of human genetics science, people abused the name of "science" for political agenda and the bad came in both sides. Racist haters try to "pseudo-prove" some races as inferior. But sadly, scientists themselves like Lewontin and SJ Gould fell into the trap of letting their personal background (Jewish - post-Nazi holocaust) dictate their science and be wrong from the other side: use pseudo science as a mean for anti-racism.I don't think you are a scientist in the sense of doing active research with peer review publications much less a geneticist with work in human genomics arena (if you do, I apologize).So, this is not an appropriate place (and futile) to dwell deep into why what you said is incorrect, but let's leave at this: wolf and dog were separated only for ~30 ky, not that much difference in terms of generational separation between human groups. The modern mathematics of classification of human genomes (via Support Vector Machine algorithm for example - googling it) delineate humans into clusters with as much distinction as what are normally considered as different species.Species is an archaic biological concept (~3 centuries old), predated the time of rigorous modern mathematical genomics classification. An alien civilization coming to Earth shall have no problem of classification of humans. For some reason, some people are intensely emotional if they are told of being different from others.From some perspective, it is a strangely irrational desire to be considered as similar to others, especially that one hates. A foreigner who is not White or Black once made a comment that he didn't understand why Black wants to be considered the same [human group] as White, while Black people hate and despise White people so much. In his country, people view themselves as being unique and different from other races. They cherish their heritage but that doesn't make them hateful or alienated from any race. (he made some contribution to dog genome sequencing).In the US, no one ever bothers to talk or publish the new knowledge of human genomics, as it serves little scientific purpose. In medical science, race-correlated illness is so well-known. You can look it up about tamoxifen and women of sub-Saharan ancestry, for example. There are more arcane things such as whether Y-DNA CF haplogroup has connection to sub-Saharan Africa or not, as this link is never found between Eurasian and SS Africans. There is mysterious archaic human genome introgression in SS Africans but not found in Eurasian, just like Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes in Eurasian but not in SS Africans. These are just few examples. Researchers know, but they never publish as it serves no use to their career while carrying the risk of being accused of racism.But science aside, race should have no role in social organization. Each individual should be treated by his/her own merit. The genetic inheritance of each individual through 200 ky of evolution is irrelevant.Let's consider this: psychopath is a genetic trait of ~ 2% population. Many are violent, abusive, or larcenous criminals. But many are not, such as ebenezer scrooge CEO's who aren't in jails (e. g. Shkreli). In fact, psychopath such as  James Fallon led a very productive life. Hence, it is wrong to be legally biased against a psychopath until proven otherwise, just like it is wrong to be biased against a person because of his/her genetic ancestry. But denial of the existence of psychopathic trait, like certain social behavior is scientifically wrong. Best wish to you.</comment>

<comment>Black people are our responsibility.  They are like children.</comment>

<comment>That is the implicit message of most forms of charity - that the help must be given because the helped party does not have the capability of helping themselves, unlike the superior givers.  That message is what breeds hatred from those who are on the receiving end, why dependency yields unintended consequences.</comment>

<comment>If you are smart, you'll take what is given and be gracious about it, even if the gift is inappropriate and almost totally useless in your situation. You shouldn't alienate the giver -- who knows; maybe they'll give you something useful next time around!</comment>

<comment>With all due respect, Theodore, What everyone needs is a mother like yours.  Read what you wrote again:"The post-Obama bloc’s urgency for action is clear. African Americans are sick of the unemployment rate being perpetually twice the rate of whites. They are tired of poverty touching more black children while declining for other groups. They are sick of black neighborhoods being patrolled by battle-ready police. They are tired of rights and opportunity being held from them just because of their race, whether its new voter-identification laws that complicate access to the ballot or the persistence of employment, rental, and housing discrimination due to black skin and a black-sounding name."All of these issues of unemployment, poverty, and police are directly related to education and family issues.  They cannot be fixed with the vote.From your impressive resume, I assume you are conversant and thoughtful on many issues.  But here at theatlantic.com you have only been used to write article after article about black voters.  Doesn't that give you pause?</comment>

<comment>Is education not related to public policy?</comment>

<comment>Of course.  But lack of schools and educational opportunity long ago stopped being the main issue.  In some schools the sheer weight of cultural indifference to education and antisocial behavior prevents significant opportunity, but that is not usually the case.I live in a place with great public schools available to all.  This doesn't seem to have helped some folks at all.I am certainly for good public schools.Why are most folks here so against the idea of cultural issues being part of the problem?</comment>

<comment>"This, coupled with exasperation with electoral politics, has revealed that many blacks are beginning to feel like a people without a party."This is what happens when you squander your Civil Rights victory.</comment>

<comment>This is subtle but dangerous ground.  One subscribes to the mantra that success is denied because of race, new laws happen that vastly increase Civil Rights and reduce the influence of race, yet one still is not succeeding.  Look around and see other minority groups arriving, making progress and what creeps in is the deadly subconscious feeling that maybe those KKK fanatics were right about inferiority all along.I don't know about feeling like a people without a party, but being a people without good leadership is apparent.</comment>

<comment>"African Americans are converging around an abundance of issues, wanting to be heard and employing new strategies to achieve it."Wanting to be heard? What happened to all of the hope and change? It's hard to believe that Obama is so popular with those who are worse off under him.</comment>

<comment>All of which is why the upcoming SC primary will be an important gauge of candidacy.</comment>

<comment>"... the post-Obama black electorate..." will continue to have a declining influence, as the proportion of African Americans in the United States declines.  There is a reason why there are black leaders who regard easily available abortions as a type of genocide, designed to lessent the influence of African Americans.</comment>

<comment>People forget how rough MLK had it.  He was forced to drink from black only drinking fountains at the back of the bus.  He was relegated to the blacks only counter at the cafe.  He was constantly discriminated against and lynched.</comment>

<comment>MLK was constantly lynched?</comment>

<comment>There were no drinking fountains on buses, front or rear.</comment>

<comment>Mostly, because black leaders tend to be male and tend to be some of the most sexist creatures on the planet, unable to abide the thought of young black females controlling their own fertility, finally fed up and telling black males to get it together or no more litters of babies by numerous soon to be incarcerated high school drop outs and unemployed ex-cons.</comment>

<comment>"Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination."The full context quote is far more nuanced:"Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was.  Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination.  And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you’ve gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured -- and they overcame them.  And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too.  (Applause.) "</comment>

<comment>I spent a few years talking about all the stuff Obama did right.No one would listen.Circumstances forced him to lead from behind.  He handled it with great mastery.Understandably he wants to get out in front.He is being vague and using euphemisms.Some people are nervous.</comment>

<comment>To have a political impact, it's not only critical to vote in presidential elections but midterm elections as well. Midterm elections are where many congress members are elected and this often advantages conservatives, because republicans are more dedicated to showing up at polls on a regular basis. Long lines at polls during presidential elections are typical. Empty voting venues are traditional during midterm elections.</comment>

<comment>Democrats don't do well in midterm elections because their mouth breathing, parasitic base doesn't actually know what a Senator or Congressman is.</comment>

<comment>There are plenty of divided nations we can look to and see how this will work out. Kenya has 41 tribes. Nigeria has dozens as well. Both are corrupt nations where nothing gets done.

<comment>I don't know why these dumb kids try to postelsewhere, they don't know anything and theyjust look like fools</comment>

<comment>So long as black Americans seek improvement in their fortunes through the political process they will fail, and create acrimony along the way. Politics is force. It creates benefits for some by taking them from others, and stealing half or more along the way.Anyone who wants to "pull blacks from the doldrums of society" (to use this author's langauge) should be focused on removing welfare programs that create dependency, eliminating minimum wage laws that outlaw unskilled labor and prevent young black Americans (and millions of others) from getting onto the career ladder, and slashing regulation, taxation, and government spending to create real economic growth, thereby creating more opportunity and higher wage rates.</comment>

<comment>Blacks need to save themselves.They will continue to fail as long as they expect White liberals to do it for them.Which they have no intention on doing.</comment>

<comment>Will Black liberals do any better? I am not so sure.</comment>

<comment>They've been "liberal" for 50 years.If I were a Black, I might start asking a few questions.</comment>

<comment>What a load of bullshite.</comment>

<comment>My compliments, Marty. This is an excellent summary of a failed economic paradigm. It's almost as if Von Mises and Rand had an improbable love child, who was never allowed outside and whose reading material consisted solely of the ponderous tomes of his parents. Sadly, it turns out that none of these ideas work in the real world. Best of luck with further reading.</comment>

<comment>You mean welfare does not create resentment and dependency? Minimum wage laws do not make reduce the number of entry level jobs? Regulations do not inhibit growth?  Maybe common sense, thinking, observing and experience should be added to whatever reading you have done.</comment>

<comment>Rose, you sound a lot like Marty. You two should find another hobby besides Objectivism Meetings.In any case, most CEOs of major corporation receive all sorts of "welfare", such as getting their income declared capital gains (and, thus, saving substantially on tax). They seem like very happy folks to me. Pharma companies spend more on advertising and marketing than research, while taking breakthroughs made with public research-support money and claiming patent protection on these products, and they laugh all the way to the bank. At the same time, entire industries like coal, oil and firearms privatize profits but socialize the inevitable costs of their products, and I don't see many unhappy execs in their ranks. Perhaps there are wells of quiet desperation and resentment in their ranks, that I don't know about.  As to dependency, like ranchers on public land in the US, a mantra of "rugged individualism" repeated sufficiently, seems to provide a lot of protection against recognizing certain types of government subsidy. It's a question of having the right social supports for your (very partial) view of the world.</comment>

<comment>In any case, most CEOs of major corporation receive all sorts of "welfare", such as getting their income declared capital gains =====================That's false.  Stocks grants are taxed as income when acquired.</comment>

<comment>A tendentious reply at best, my dear Jiffy. In real life there are a couple of options on, err, options.  For a semi-popular run-down, see: http://www.investopedia.com/ar...In any case, income on the sale of stocks is taxed as capital gains, which is where the real money is made. Various hedge fund dodges, moreover, allow a wide latitude for the definition of capital gains. Even the dullest of Americans, for example, saw a glimmer of this when people started to calculate Mitt Romney's effective tax rate (around 14%!!) during last election cycle. Such a reduced tax is a direct subsidy to wealth, and it plays a large role in the widening of inequalities during the last 30 years or so. This is a form of welfare as it preferentially protects the income of the wealthy (i.e., gives them money). Don't even get me started on the FICA cap.I note you had little to say about my other examples. Wealth (increasingly inherited wealth) is the largest recipient of welfare in the US. If you want to start looking for places to cut subsidies to the truly undeserving, then my advice is, "Start at the top."Another bit of advice: pop your own corn. It's much cheaper, taste a lot better, and you avoid all those nasty chemicals that create the fake butter taste and that keep the oils from going rancid.</comment>

<comment>You really don't know what you are talking bout.  The sale of the stock is taxed at capital gains if there is a gain.  When the stock is vested, it's taxed at the value of the vest date as income.  I get stock grants at work. I know how this works.</comment>

<comment>"Don't even get me started on the FICA cap" Oh please do.  I'll prove you wrong really fast.</comment>

<comment>Gawd, I love the tax nerds who write on this site. Leaving aside, the fact that FICA is part of a long list of forms of welfare for the already-rich-and-privileged that I listed, the basic facts are that FICA is a very regressive tax. Currently, it's around 6% capped at a mere +/-$118,000, which is still comfortably more than twice the median income of the US, and almost 6x the official poverty level (!). When you consider that the proportion of income derived from investments balloons as one goes further north of the FICA cap (taxed at reduced capital gains rates) and for all intents and purposes is non-existent at and below it, then you'll see the first dollar one earns is taxed far more heavily than the millionth (never mind the billionth) one in the US. This is the definition of an extremely regressive tax (far worse than a flat tax, in fact).Sure, there are things like the AMT (and that has been raised slightly recently - not much, but something). And, yes, I know, how much of the absolute tax haul the "rich" pay, but this is an artifact of the concentration of wealth over the last 35 years or so. With the exception of a brief period in the '90s, this period has been marked flat or declining middle-class wages and purchasing power and widening inequalities, a situation that has been created in large parts by such tax policies and corporate give-aways. Theoretically, for example, one could imagine a society where one Bill Gates, provided 1% of his income as the entire income-tax haul of an entire country) but such a society would scarcely be an ideal place to live. Sadly, the US has made great strides towards such a social arrangement in the recent past.Indeed, if Americans actually understood the differences between between median and mean more clearly, then there would likely be a revolution or at least a ruckus (especially attacking the ludicrous measure of "average household worth", which is "not much" for the majority of Americans and "lots and lots" for a very few. Good popular summary here: http://qz.com/260269/painfully..., but you can also download the much larger census report on poverty in the US.Basically, I just want to see the millionth dollar earned taxed at the same (but preferably higher rate) than the first one. At the same time, I want to see subsidies to very profitable industries named as "welfare" before any of you guys talk about how many Americans are on food stamps, the 47% of the population who are "takers" and other transparently false statements. After that, I feel people voting their interests would make a better society.</comment>

<comment>Your long post did not address why raising he cap will fix SS.  It will not.</comment>

<comment>I said that the FICA cap was yet another form of welfare for the already-privileged. It depends on what you mean by "fix SS". I can tell you that it certainly won't hurt SS.</comment>

<comment>The goal of SS tax is to reach 90% of the income.  Raising the cap would increase payouts under current law.</comment>

<comment>My compliments, Mr. Saris, on your ability to deny consensus economics and overwhelming historical evidence. No doubt you are also a denier of climate change. And you believe vaccines cause autism.Thanks for chiming in, but, honestly, until or unless you're intellectually capable of accepting reality, the grownups won't be listening to you.Best of luck.</comment>

<comment>Marty, baby, if giving money to the already-rich, and shutting the disadvantaged out from income support, truly made a better world, then, we would surely have a utopia by now. You don't represent "mainstream" economics, not even a "consensus" of economists, btw, so stop pretending. You represent something like a cult of market fetishism, and like most cults, the more it fails in the real world, the more firmly its believers, well, believe.Sadly, such economic policies are in fact driving climate change globally, as oil, gas and coal are amongst the biggest recipients of effective subsidies (what any fair person would call "welfare"). To add to the craziness, this subsidized money is then plowed back into "have PhD will lie" science (compliments of various groups supported by the Koch Bros). Do you think that people really do not see this connection?As to vaccines and autism. (Where did that example come from?) While the connection does not exist, the distrust of Big Pharama (another welfare-queen industry) is palpable amongst those folks. This distrust is, sadly, warranted, as subsidized Pharma money is more profitably put into buying politicians and marketing products rather than research into effectiveness and safety (80% of which actually occurs with public money, btw). The level of craziness has gotten to the point where whole journals are being created to publish made-up studies (see http://www.the-scientist.com/?..., which are then shown to doctors (very often at conferences in sunny places, sponsored by (you guessed it) Big Pharma. In a world where companies actually do behave in this manner (and get away with it either with no sanction or laughably small fines), the sense that patient safety is an afterthought in vaccines is not unreasonable. It just happens to be wrong in this case.Could you at least choose examples that you actually know something about?</comment>

<comment>That's racist. But I once encountered a Taiwanese who actually asked why Blacks wouldn't want an country on their own, self-governed, independent from oppressive White. As a Taiwanese, he wanted nothing more than complete independence from China. He thought that would be best for Black people also.</comment>

<comment>get back to us when you grow up, little boy</comment>

<comment>I hope that people can just be Americans and stop being so racist. When you see yourself as "black American" you are racist.</comment>

<comment>But until then we do.This place is run by new york liberals.Who are the most racist people that you will ever meet.</comment>

<comment>Inside the "progressive" bubble, certain truths cannot be acknowledged, much less uttered, and the denial of reality even gives rise to an aura of egalitarian "feelgood."   Let us consider the young men we have seen, between intervals of rioting, looting, and arson, with their fashionably exposed backsides, venting their litany of resentments, in "inner city" slang, to Geraldo and Don Lemon, on the "mean streets" of Ferguson and Baltimore.  Who do we fault for their failure to acquire employable skills?   Why were they, and their parents, so disinterested in the educational process?  Why, in the "inner city," is learning seen as a "White thing"?   Is this situation not a certain formula for poverty, and rates of violent crime that drive Whites to self-segregate?   Prating about the lack of "parenting" is here an exercise in futility.  We have created this situation by providing so many alternatives to lawful employment.  When we assume the responsibility of providing, generously, for out-of-wedlock offspring, interest in "parenting," and the educational process, evaporates.And I'll ask again:  Why does the "Black Community" express so little interest in the jobs being taken by migrants?  Is it perhaps the case that mowing lawns and making beds, activities that most of us regularly perform, are seen as beneath the dignity of Blacks?    So how about roofing, framing, painting tile-setting, dry-walling, etc., trades that lead to comfortable lifestyles?</comment>

<comment>" So how about roofing, framing, painting tile-setting, dry-walling, etc., trades that lead to...."  .....self respect. That's been given to them too.</comment>

<comment>In the Southwest, migrants have established a virtual monopoly in these trades.</comment>

<comment>Hardly addresses the point of my comment but OK, I know that they have a monopoly because they work for monopoly money. Those trades were a White man's business anyway, you never saw a Black man framing a house 50 years ago. Houston is deep in Mexican territory by the way so I know a little about them.</comment>

<comment>I thought we were on the same page.  I am objecting to allowing migrants to take over these trades, and questioning why the "Black Leadership," given the high rates of Black unemployment, is not complaining about this practice.   If you are objecting to the impact migration is having on pay scales, why allow it to continue?</comment>

<comment>We're close enough for horseshoes I guess. I was only pointing out that Blacks haven't worked the trades you mention in any numbers ever. White men are the ones losing their jobs.</comment>

<comment>Into a vacuum rushes...One would be hard pressed to find black males headed into the trade sector even in the 1970s. Had they, then they'd own their own construction, plumbing, HVAC and electrical companies - solidly middle and upper middle class, particularly given the residential and commercial building boom after the 1980s.</comment>

<comment>And what whining, resentful rationalization do you have to offer for the lack of interest by Blacks in such employment today, as witnessed by their failure to protest current immigration policies?  But we both know the answer to that, don't we?  They are being "paid off" by Democrats to acquiesce in making border security hostage to the demand that a path to voting the Democratic ticket be created for the "undocumented."</comment>

<comment>Poor folks shouldn't be able to vote?  500,000 postal workers should be stripped of their right to vote?  Those serving in the US armed forces should also be stripped of their right to vote?That's not a NY agenda, that's the Old Confederacy... change your avatar, you are giving the Empire State a bad reputation... go with the Stars & Bars or General Lee... something along those lines... thanks.</comment>

<comment>No real property no vote! Oh, and if your brains fell off when the doctor slapped your little baby behind no vote for you....lady.  lol  While we're dreaming we may as well go all the way.</comment>

<comment>Suffering is how nature teaches you to quit being stupid.  Black Americans are slow learners.Republicans don't care about blacks because they are going to vote Democrat, no matter what.Democrats don't care about blacks because they are going to vote Democrat, no matter what.The only real problem black people have is black people.  Only they can fix it.</comment>

<comment>"Black Americans are slow learners."They're not as stupid as they seem.They can be quite clever when they want something.But their efforts have been distorted in the wrong directions.You can be clever and stupid at the same time.</comment>

<comment>For the past 50 or so years (since the inception of the War on Poverty) the government has been bent on alleviating the kind of suffering that teaches people to make better choices. Behold the outcome! It's not limited to black people, BTW.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, not limited to blacks.  Just look at all those spoiled white kids waving socialist signs and cheering for Bernie.</comment>

<comment>I don't think I can agree with to much of what RepublcanDon said... He is correct that republicans don't care for Colin Powell or Condolenza... Even though either one would make more sense on the campaign trail in South Carolina.   On " Dems don't care about Blacks" .. We do have a black man in the White House, and a black Attorney General...  They seem to have a difficult relationship with law-enforcement the last two yrs too. </comment>

<comment>Slavery in America is alive and well.  Today though, people enslave themselves by choosing to view themselves as a continual victims.What ever happened to 'We shall overcome'?  Are people really so powerless?  Do some people really need other people to lift them from their morass?</comment>

<comment>Dr. Ben Carson sure is playing the "Victim card".  Clarence Thomas played that same card to great success.  Bill Cosby, the alleged serial rapist, is now playing that same well-worn card.I guess you gotta play the cards you are dealt.  But is the deck stacked?</comment>

<comment>Something is missing in this writer's analysis if he acknowledges that racism is institutionalised, and that the republican party has refused since day one to work with country's first African American President, but then suggests the result will be they shift allegiance to that very party.  Particularly curious given that the republican party's leading candidate has directly and intentionally broadcast racist messages.</comment>

<comment>Simply mentioning the "work ethic" is today condemned as "racism."</comment>

<comment>There is a dictionary of micro-aggression vocabulary. work ethic may be one.</comment>

<comment>And new research  shows that some segments of the black electorate are beginning to prioritize their self-interests over the group’s well-being—a departure from the black voting canon.Maybe those people that have been responsible citizens and worked hard are getting  tired of unconditionally supporting those that won't.</comment>

<comment>We should strive to be a color blind society - like France. No race identification, no obsession of race, both the good, the bad, and the uglies. Everyone is on one's own merit, and will be helped if falling low into the safety net, race is irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>What are "banlieues" and "no-go" zones?</comment>

<comment>France is now an utter mess, as are many places in the UK and throughout Europe, never again to be truly British and Continental...or even safe, particularly for girls and women.</comment>

<comment>It is pretty clear who is the party of inclusion. Just look at any GOP rally and what you will see is a sea of white faces usually older with the one or two black or Hispanic faces.There are no huge numbers of black or Hispanic faces in the crowd. Look at Hillary or Bernie's rallies and you an entirely different picture. That's the real America a mixture of all races just as it should be. When you hear the words, 'take our country back' what they mean is take it back to where the majority was white. That is not the case today the majority is changing to brown and it is that that scares the hell out of the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Can you blame them for being scared?  Look at Central and South America for Christ sakes.  Look at the Middle East.  Look at Africa.  What sort of governments do those areas have?  Are those our values?</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? Scared of what? Are you saying black and Hispanics in our country are all radical dangerous people? If not I have no clue what you are going on about!</comment>

<comment>Judging by the governments that Blacks and Hispanics form I would say it is fair to call them dangerous.  Do you have a better metric to judge a culture?</comment>

<comment>Are you serious? So the white population in your mind is pure as the driven snow and don't have any hate in their heart for anyone? Get real for havens sake. Majority of mass shootings done by white men! Yes white. Not black. Not Hispanic. Imagine that.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Blacks and Hispanics commit more mass shootings than Whites, though White mass shootings tend to be deadlier.</comment>

<comment>That's absolute bullsh*t</comment>

<comment>http://www.gunviolencearchive....</comment>

<comment>So? That lists the number of mass shootings, not a breakdown by race. You can't back that up so you throw up a link and hope nobody looks?</comment>

<comment>They have links to the source material.  Very enlightening.  Here is last night's mass shooting.http://www.khou.com/story/news...</comment>

<comment>You should dig up. Or just admit that you made that sh*t up. It's not true. </comment>

<comment>Here is Saturday night's mass shooting:http://www.wdsu.com/news/local...</comment>

<comment>So you don't understand the definition of 'mass shooting'  as defined by the FBI? Sorry buddy, you're certainty notwithstanding, the overwhelming majority of mass shootings are committed by white men. Better than 90%. GTFO with that bullsh*t. </comment>

<comment>They use the FBI definition of "4 or more victims".  Try again.</comment>

<comment>That is the definition. So again, can you show me anything at all that backs up your claim that white men don't commit the vast majority of mass shootings? No, no you can't. Because you are wrong and you got called out on it. Eat some humble pie. You know everyone here just discredited everything you will ever claim as fact now, don't you? The bottom line, white men commit well over 90% of all mass shootings. </comment>

<comment>You are just trolling.  I get it now.  Carry on.</comment>

<comment>Trolling? Because I called you out on a blatant lie and you refuse to admit it? Doesn't that make you the troll?</comment>

<comment>I provided links.  You provided nothing.  The 90% number you cited was a dead giveaway that you are not being honest.</comment>

<comment>You provided links that don't say what you think they say. Eh never mind, you're a lost cause liar, or too stupid to know you're lying. Carry on.</comment>

<comment>http://www.gunviolencearchive....You should probably read those links again.</comment>

<comment>I read it. I'd tell you to keep trying, but you've proven your inability to be blissfully uninformed.</comment>

<comment>They are links to news stories of every mass shooting since 2014.  No way you read all of them.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you give Mother Jones' running piece on every mass shooting a peek. Or just use the FBI database, instead of all these slanted 'news' stories. There is actual hard data out there. Just let it go. You've been called out for pushing lies, you can't admit it cause you really want to blame black folks for every wrong in this country, and I don't have any interest in an intellectually dishonest discussion. So again, carry on.</comment>

<comment>The links are from various ABC, NBC, CBS affiliates and local newspapers.  Try again.</comment>

<comment>So, you think a link to one news article about one incident  proves that white men aren't responsible for over 90% of all mass shootings? Sure man, keep doubling down on this nonsense. Off the top of your head, name 3 mass shooters who are black. You can't unless you google it and go way back in history. It's a ridiculous assertion. We all see the names and faces of every dude that shoots up every school and movie theater. They're all white, save a couple Asians. Get real.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  You are really having a tough time with this.To your first point, I provided links the latest 6 mass shootings.Your second point is based on media coverage.  The national media doesn't generally cover gang violence in the hood.</comment>

<comment>I told you I looked at your links. Not a single one says what you think it says. So, no, you can't name 3 black mass shooters? I know you can't. You know how I know that? Because white men commit over 90% of all mass shootings. Now here you are moving the goalposts talking about gang violence in hoods. That's not what your original assertion was. You have been called out, and everyone here knows you have no idea what you're talking about. I'm going to say this one more time. White men commit over 90% of all mass shootings. It's a fact. So quit trying to make black people responsible for it.</comment>

<comment>So if a mass shooting is gang related it doesn't count?  Goalposts and such...</comment>

<comment>Of course, as long as it falls into the guidelines outlined by the FBI. Most don't, and you know it. You just want to blame all the country's problems on black folks.</comment>

<comment>An eminent example of engineeredperception.     First, note that the only “metric”used to “gauge” whites against blacks is mass murders.  Not totalmurders.  Not drug prevalence.  Not rapes.  Not average intellectualstanding.     Also, since whites are still themajority in the country, even if they had a lower rate per capita ofoffenses, they could still, in total numbers, represent more.     There is a great deal ofconnivance in the Liberal party's machinations.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Democrats are so infatuated with "inclusiveness" that they cheer Obama on when he promises to bring here multitudes of largely unemployable Middle Eastern Muslims.   I'm sure American womanhood, unlike their German counterparts, will enjoy this "enrichment" of our culture.</comment>

<comment>Obama bringing in multitudes of unemployable Middle Eastern Muslims. You really must stop listening to Faux News, Limbaugh and others. They haven't got a grip on reality either.</comment>

<comment>Obama is already bringing them here.  Over 70 House Democrats have demanded that some 200,000 migrants be brought here in 2016, including 100,000 Syrians (House Dems Call for 10-Fold Increase of Syrian Refugees, Julian Hattem, The Hill, 9-11-15.)   Not to be outdone, the Senate Democrats, despite the recent orgy of lewd and violent sexual misconduct visited upon the women of Germany by Muslim migrants, have just torpedoed legislation requiring affirmative, individualized "vetting" of these "refugees."    MSNBC hasn't been reporting on all this?</comment>

<comment>I'm always amused when liberals accuse people of living in a right wing bubble when we're on leftist rags like The Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>The Dem Party is losing white voters and their overall proportion of the party is falling. That's not the sign of a "more inclusive" party.http://www.people-press.org/20...</comment>

<comment>Those who vote Republican feel more at home where the like minded are of the same color that being white. They are not an inclusive party and never will be it's not who they are. They don't reach out to other minority groups because they are not interested in doing so.  Republicans are scared of the changing demographics as their base is shrinking every day. The Dem party is doing just fine with the electorate they don't have divisive hate filled candidates running around the country.  If I were a Republican I would be totally embarrassed with the circus we now see that passes for intelligent people!</comment>

<comment>No offense, but you're confusing "inclusivity" with a very natural phenomenon of minority ethnic/racial groups banding together to maximize the effect of their vote.It's typical of multi-racial societies, and it explains why the Dem Party is losing white voters. Whites will likely be a minority within the Dem Party within the next 10 years.</comment>

<comment>Whites will be the minority in the country period. That as I said before is what scares the hell out of Republicans. They relied on white voters for years soon those voters will be few and far between. Dems have never had to worry about getting minority voters that has always been a problem for Republicans.</comment>

<comment>And just as the GOP establishment was hoping to win more minority votes, the Dem Party is alarmed about white working class voters leaving them and becoming Independents or GOP voters. Like I said before, your vision of "inclusivity" is mistaken - what we're actually seeing is just a process of the country dividing up along racial lines.You might think it's a bad direction for the country to be going in, but it's also a pretty typical story of how multi-racial/multi-ethnic societies organize themselves. We're headed toward a future where ideology matters much less than identity. The demographic trends in whites leaving the Dem Party is evidence of it.</comment>

<comment>But the Same Crooks.Tell me Johnson.What did the chieftains of the Black Lives Matter movement [ starting with McKesson ] do with all of that money it received?</comment>

<comment>"Decreased voter turnout should not be mistaken for disinterest." No but it does translate into less power. We can not succumb to the tyranny of the 'or', protest or voting. It needs to be all strategies together.</comment>

<comment>The post-Obama bloc employs a different strategy to bring about change—one rooted in creativity and energy. It is because of them that Black Lives Matter exists. Their hunger strike and protest at the University of Missouri, emblematic of campus protests across the country, accomplished what complaints to the state legislature and the board of directors could not.That's an extremely charitable way of looking at what is essentially mob mentality and extreme tribalism taken root in our younger generation.I'll argue the opposite:It is BlackLivesMatter and the individuals who make it up (and most specifically their shared ideology) which is precisely designed to NEVER accomplish change, and to implode at the end.I say this because youth movements these days are based on an ideology of extreme tribalism, rooted in what you were born as, and not what you accomplished for yourself or the nation. We call it identity politics, but that's just a pretty name for different tribes of people grouping themselves according to skin color, genitalia, where they put said genitalia and so on. Then after they group themselves, they fight against each other for the biggest slice of the political pie.What is the most important rule of any movement seeking to change the status quo? Solidarity. So why are today's youth taught to value what makes them different from each other, instead of what makes them the same?And this is why I argue that the post-Obama electorate is going to be the biggest defender of the Status Quo for the next thirty years (even if they themselves honestly believe otherwise, that they are fighting for a revolution, it will accomplish the precise opposite).</comment>

<comment>What'll happen is the black females will actually graduate college with a degree and get jobs, unlike the black males. Then those females will start their own businesses or head into corporate America and what few professions are hiring: health care and tech. Within that framework, maturity and responsibility begin to take root, further distancing the "can do" females from the "can't make me" males. i.e. There's going to be even more single black ladies living better lives, refusing to hook up with the black equivalent of arrested development man children living in mom's basement.</comment>

<comment>Oh.  Are "out-of-wedlock" births in the "Black Community" on the decline?</comment>

<comment>I think there is some error in this idea that black people used protest then votes and are now swinging back to protest.  Especially considering one of the chief things groups like SNCC tried to do was get black people in the South registered to vote. The protesters of the Civil Rights era were using protests to force entry into the general political process because they understood that that is where the real changes would be made.  Protest is not an alternative to voting or law-making.  It's a way of forcing your way into that process.</comment>

<comment>Of all the issues facing black folks, the one that's most infuriating to me is housing and employment discrimination. I can see why police shootings get so much attention - they attract media attention and they're symbolic of the problems that blacks have had with this country's justice system for so long.But still, in terms of having the greatest impact on black people getting ahead and being able to put this country's wretched treatment of them behind them, employment discrimination would be my pick for the top agenda item. It's absolutely unacceptable - esp. given that racial discrimination is illegal. This form of discrimination needs to have been solved yesterday.</comment>

<comment>The disinterest of Blacks in the acquisition of employable skills should have been remedied yesterday.  I have a solution:  No learn, no work, no eat.</comment>

<comment>>It is a constituency that has grown impatient with elected officials’ generational promises that their programs will eventually pull blacks from the doldrums of society into a fairer America where opportunity is accessible and hard work is rewarded equally.As it should! 50 years of an expanding welfare state, affirmative action, and deteriorating social institutions like marriage have done nothing to help the black community.>The post-Obama bloc employs a different strategy to bring about change—one rooted in creativity and energy...hunger strike and protest at the University of Missouri...yanked the state’s Confederate battle flag ... lack of diversity at the Oscars...unapologetically black new music video...Oh... are these supposed to be better solutions?</comment>

<comment>Is the Welfare Queen ranchers and "Patriots" the solution? Everyone sees their preferential treatment, but somehow that doesn't count.</comment>

<comment>Black Lies Do Not Matter!</comment>

<comment>Obama's treasonous illegal alien and muslim resettlement policies along with race baiting have created an ongoing SECOND 9/11 terrorist attack against America!!I will even call it a "Manufactured, False Flag" US Government sanctioned "PURGE" against its own citizens and the police! Congress is allowing this to happen with the recent passage of the Omnibus $pending Bill....And Obama's solution is to take away our guns with one hand and attack us with the other hand.Obama is a Liar and Traitor. Impeach him now you skulking cowards!One small problem. .....There are more traitors in Congress than patriots!Trump, Not Rubio .........in 2016</comment>

<comment>When none of the horrors you predict, for example gun confiscation of Jade Helm actually happen, does that help?  Or do you just figure "he's brown so he must be awful..."</comment>

<comment>I did not mention race because, Treason is race neutral.</comment>

<comment>Then why aren't you clamoring that all the Republicans that have refused to work in Congress be charged?My guess is you suffer from ODS; Obama Derangement Syndrome. BTW, if you want to impeach the President, it seriously helps if you have a real reason.</comment>

<comment>You may ask what is the GOP doing? Not only did the GOP roll over the last 7 years, the just did this to PROTECT Obama.!''RNC SCUTTLES IMPEACHMENT IN COMMITTEE VOTE''By J.B. Williams | January 16, 2016...Sorta raises serious questions about WHICH party they really belong to!newswithviews. com/JBWilliams/williams320. htmAt the opening of the January Republican National Committee meeting in Charleston South Carolina Wednesday, the RNC Resolutions Committee was forced to vote on a RNC Resolutionknown as the Agema Resolution, supporting the proper Impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama for his many crimes of treason, tyranny and treachery against the United States and the people.The nine member Resolutions Committee chaired by Carolyn McLarty of Oklahoma, voted unanimously to kill the Agema Resolution in committee, preventing the full body of the RNC from ever having a vote or voice on the measure in the full meeting scheduled for Friday January 15.Not one member of the RNC Resolutions Committee supported the Agema Resolution to impeach what is admittedly the most impeachable administration in U.S. history. Not even known acts of treason and tyranny by the Obama Administration, not the Iran deal, or even Obama’s recent unilateral gun grab EO (Executive Order) just a week ago, was enough to cause the leadership of the Republican Party to support a resolution on impeachment.The nine members of the RNC Resolutions Committee who blocked the measure from the full body are as follows…Carolyn McLarty (Oklahoma) ChairMelody Potter (West Virginia)Paul Reynolds (Alabama)Tamara Scott (Iowa)Steve Scheffler (Iowa)Pat Longo (Connecticut)John Frey (Connecticut)Rosie Tripp (New Mexico)Linda Acherman (California)Republicans were given the purse strings in 2010 and have not “defunded” anything since, not even Planned Parenthood. From 2009 through 2014, the Republican excuse for not impeaching Obama was “we don’t control the Senate” and “we will impeach if we get control of the Senate,” which the people gave them control of a year ago in the 2014 election cycle.Since 2014, the Republican excuse for not impeaching has been, “there is no public outcry for impeachment,” which is true, because Republicans had taken “impeachment off the table” under Boehner and McConnell, and clearly, it remains “off the table” under Paul Ryan, and certainly Priebus.THIS VOTE WAS NOT REPORTED ON BY THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA.........................Trump, NOT Rubio in 2016</comment>

<comment>Maybe, just maybe, there are some Teapublicans that realize that an impeachment would backfire on the entire RWNJ crowd.You need a reason to impeach a President. Wishful thinking about fake scandals don't make the cut.</comment>

<comment>Africans-in-America have been brainwashed into voting Democrat and staying on the Welfare State plantation. Black institutions, businesses and neighborhoods have crumbled while Democrats have piled up Third World majorities among Black voters.</comment>

<comment>Hhmmm, I didn't know the Bundy welfare queen ranchers and farmers were "Africans in America". I was unaware that so much of America's major corporations were "Africans in America". Wow, the things you can learn from the RWNJs.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that younger millennial voters are turning to alternative means of expression or rejecting traditional power structures by not voting. Young people tend to not vote going back to ancient times. Its just the nature of democracy - voters under the age of 30 are streaky, unreliable and put more energy into making excuses for not voting than voting itself. Older voters pay their bills on time, they don't litter and they vote.If you don't vote, your voice doesn't count. Go to all the rallies you want, donate money to somebody or tell all your friends you're angry and you're not going to take it anymore. It doesn't matter. If you don't vote, your opinion doesn't count. Your vote is all you have to truly force change on the system - that and the ability to convince others around you to vote.</comment>

<comment>In 338 days the worst president we have had up to the present, will be gone.  Thank God for that.</comment>

<comment>Obo's an axxhole,but the worst?Murika under dubya was a terrifying place.The problem is a perpetual lowering of the bar.</comment>

<comment>I hated W too.  However, even W didn't work for 8 years to Islamicize the U.S. and the world.  He didn't work to strengthen Islamic propaganda.  He didn't work to shove Islam down our throats.  He didn't kiss Islamic @$$.  Etc.</comment>

<comment>LBJ was one of the worst presidents ever.  Corrupt to the bone.  And an arrogant ass.</comment>

<comment>He was an arrogant ass, but Obama has been a con man par excellence.  Con is his game.</comment>

<comment>Ooooh, I dated both those guys! However, i didn't know the dude that voted for McCain, he's so old!That would be crazy rapist Herman "Nein! Nein! Nein!" Cain the Pizza man and uttery delusional Ben "Pyramids are grain silos and Obamacare is worse than slavery" Carson? On the Democratic side we have giant Jesse Jackson and some guy named Obama? ... Barack Obama, the President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief</comment>

<comment>The lack of progress is mostly due to the ability of racists, eagerly aided by the MSM, to twist any bid for EQUALITY  into some arrogant demand for special treatment. Same with feminism.</comment>

<comment>I hope this new electorate actually votes in local and state elections as well as national ones.  One of the Republican's key advantages is a perfectly fair one.  Their core votes year in and year out.</comment>
