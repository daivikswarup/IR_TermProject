<comment>"So why do Americans so fear and dislike political dynasties?"Because a family is likely to share the same economic and social interests, and whether consciously or unconsciously, they're going to favor those interests over other, equally legitimate interests.    Concentrated political power then serves to cement concentrated economic, social/cultural power to an ever narrowing group of people.America is a nation of 300+ million people.  There is enough talent present that we should not need to go to the same well over and over to find qualified leaders.  And we should have a broad gaze, because those other leaders with other points of view are likely to offer fresh ways of looking at the world.If the Bush clan or the Clintons want to keep running for high elected office, that's their right, and the right of voters to choose, but I think every voter should be skeptical, especially when it comes to the very highest office in the nation, of electing people from the same family.</comment>

<comment>So there's the thesis, followed immediately with these examples:Interesting that, despite the inclusion of "spouses" in the thesis, no spouses show up in the examples.What we have here is a thinly veiled promotion of HRC's candidacy. With Jeb now knocked out of the race, the only dynastic candidate left is Hillary. And with her campaign going through unexpected struggles, The Atlantic throws her a wee bit of support.Here's the thing: there is one field in which women have followed their spouses: politics.  Does anyone else remember what a big deal it was when Ella Grasso was elected governor of Connecticut? It wasn't because she was the first female governor, but rather, because she was the first woman elected governor of any state, in her own right.Does anyone honestly believe that HRC could ever have won her Senate seat, from New York, if she had not first been First Lady? Electing Hillary will not be a step forward for women, it will be a step back to the 1920s, when Nellie Ross and Miriam Fergusson succeeded their husbands as chief executive of their states.Both the GOP and the Democratic Party have loads of women who have moved into high office (governors and senators) without their husbands doing the heavy lifting. And if Hillary was a man, her repeated appearances of impropriety would have driven her from the race long ago. She is a viable candidate only because of the desperation of some to elect a woman now. Well, I too want a woman President, but I'd prefer having one who has both deserves it and has earned it.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that's fully fair to Hillary. Hillary and Bill are two very strong and driven people who were attracted to each other for that reason. If Hillary hadn't married Bill, it's true that she probably wouldn't be running for president right now, but I'm sure she would have become a prominent public figure anyways.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps.  I certainly think she would have tried.  But she's a really poor campaigner who doesn't come across well, at all. She won her Senate seat against a very weak GOP candidate, and when she had a good candidate running against her (2008), she lost, despite being considered the more formidable candidate.I think it's more likely that, without Bill, Hillary Rodham would be a rich corporate lawyer whom few had heard of.</comment>

<comment>"So why do Americans so fear and dislike political dynasties?"I'm certain we fought a revolution over this once. There is simply no good reason to have a country run by a monarchy.</comment>

<comment>We don't... Any political dynasty that exists in America exists because the people voted for it.</comment>

<comment>Political dynasties focus excessively on their entitlement to power.</comment>

<comment>>So why do Americans so fear and dislike political dynasties?Oh, if only there were something in the American national background that might explain a distaste for being at the mercy of distant nepotistic power. Alas, it must remain forever a mystery why so many people unaccountably think "because I married the right person" isn't a compelling reason to hand someone the reins.Anyway, political dynasties aren't necessarily a bad thing IF there is a sort of public service motivation behind it; if, to put it another way, being the high-profile kid means your ass is going to be out there on a PT boat or taking flak in an Avenger, instead of sitting in the National Guard. But that's not the case for the Clintons and Bushes; it's the other way round for them. They're after power and status and ease; that the route they've picked requires them to govern is almost immaterial to them. The entirely selfish motivations of the current crop of politicians do not admit the transmission of desirable traits. </comment>

<comment>I completely agree.  Look to the Roman Republic on this.  In order to be taken seriously for any kind of public office you had to have done your time in the legions.</comment>

<comment>Political dynasties made sense to have in the days of the Adams and Roosevelts because there was a much smaller group of well educated and informed people in the country. So someone with connections and inside knowledge made sense to elect. But we live in an age now where information about any subject is easily accessible and there is no shortage of academics who are eager to educate people on any issue. I find it hard to believe that out of maybe hundreds of millions well educated and intelligent Americans eligible to run, Hillary by virtue of marriage has innate skills no one else possesses.</comment>

<comment>There aren't anywhere near "hundreds of millions" of well educated Americans eligible to run...</comment>

<comment>Ok, there are more than 100 people eligible.</comment>

<comment>Not quite. Instead, the ruling elites fear making it too obvious that the formula of hard work equals success is wrong because the US has become a lottery society. Your station in life if dictated by your luck at birth, primarily, and the lucky breaks you get along the way, secondarily.It's a myth that the Founders hated monarchy. They hated the British Monarchy, and even there, "hated" is too strong a word. They just wanted to be the guys in charge, not the guys who reported to King George.In fact, the Founders liked monarchy so much that they went to the trouble of inventing the Presidential System, which amounts to having a revolving constitutional monarch.</comment>

<comment>Uh, tell Congress and the SCOTUS about that revolving constitutional monarch thing.  They may have a different idea.  As did the Founders.  Checks and balances weren't just a theory--they were implemented by the Founders to keep ALL branches in check, not just POTUS.</comment>

<comment>That's the problem with high school history books. They're mostly myth or whitewash. Don't forget, Washington was offered a throne. What if he had not rejected the idea?Check this out. http://www.law.virginia.edu/ht...</comment>

<comment>Sure, if the word monarch has no meaning then sure what you said makes sense.</comment>

<comment>You just don't get it. The ruling class has let us down. The country is in horrible shape. The middle class has been crushed. Our foreign policy is a mess. Our economy sucks. Terrorists are running wild. Our politicians are bought and paid for. And you're talking about dynasties?</comment>

<comment>you voted for them didn't you?Democracy - picking leaders through name recognition</comment>

<comment>Of course, the leaders you vote for have been chosen for you by others precisely because of name recognition (as well as the deep pockets of plutocratic donors). Few US citizens have any say at all on who gets to run for office in the first place.</comment>

<comment>What idiot wrote this?Is this stupidity a cause or is it an effect?</comment>

<comment>The The Atlantic is shilling for Hillary. They are just getting started with the contortions of logic and history.</comment>

<comment>"So why do Americans so fear and dislike political dynasties?"Well, our country kinda WAS born out of a disdain for hereditary monarchy (among other things, of course). This whole deal with political dynasties gives off a feeling of aristocracy that the VAST majority of americans reject. And, let's be honest, 99% of these "political dynasty candidates" use their name as an excuse to run and a reason why people should vote for them (Jeb! and Hillary are the most in your face examples). I mean...if y'all saw the last debate, with Jeb! defending his brother like a rabid dog (a rabid chihuahua more like lol), why do you think that was? To protect the reputation of his family, which is the ONLY reason he, or his brother, or his father ever reached political power of any sort.</comment>

<comment>With ham handedness so transparentit's embarrassing, as well as indicating that the “journal”printing it didn't have a sense of the American people as all butuniversally slow witted, The Atlantic tries another shill to promoteHillary Clinton.  Any legitimate credentials she has may be wearingthin, or her own cravenness becoming too obvious, since The Atlantichas to resort to wholesale imbecility in pushing her here.     Such as the illegitimate parallel,talking about scions entering the same business as their parents.   Among other things, this isn't a more moderate level job, this is thevery top, where there isn't much, if any, company.  This is the levelwhere the rules and orders come from.  One does not “enter” acompany at this level, they are awarded it by others with power.  Andthat has the nasty name of “nepotism”.     It has to be remembered, at thispoint, that there is absolutely no proof that the “electoral”process, at any level, is honest!  All claims of tampered with votingmachines aside, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the“results” provided by “electoral” boards are valid, and notjust numbers they pulled out of a hat to make sure the New WorldOrder's wishes aren't carried out.  And, more telling, there is not asingle attempt listed on the record to ever verify that they arehonest!  They take it for granted that the public are at leastlargely so stupid they don't question the results.     And consider the patent duplicityof The Atlantic speaking of “inherited traditions of publicservice” in political dynasties!  “Public service” like JohnKennedy starting the Vietnam War?  “Public service” likeEisenhower lying that the U.S. did not use spy planes over the USSR,only to have Captain Gary Powers paraded before the public?  “Publicservice” like Harry Truman starting the Korean War?  Public servicelike the massive policy of criminal interference in other nationscarried on by Ronald Reagan?  “Public service” like George W.Bush lying about banned weapons systems in Iraq?  “Public service”like Bill Clinton apparently overseeing the most widespread system ofpolitical murder in American history?     Incidentally, shills at this pointmay be inclined to say that many of these presidents were not membersof political dynasties, but this is intended to show that whatpresidents, or any politicians, do is not “public service”.     Government is nothing more than anengine for the obscenely rich to get obscenely richer, on the backsof the “rank and file”.  And that's all.  They lie and say thatthe swindles they enact that are intended to enrich them are “forthe good of the people”, and the imbeciles believe it.  There is amassive program of government trying to steal huge tracts of privateland out West, to later award it to political friends under the guiseof projects “for the good of the public”, and hordes of Liberalparty maggots cheered when one of those condemning it was killed.  Itonly takes a look at those who never lose a dime of corporatefortunes, no matter what happens, to see the thievery on a massivescale.  It is the utmost cravenness and connivery to speak about“public service” in politics!     But, apparently, cravenness andconnivery are second nature for anything having to do with theClintons.</comment>

<comment>Yep, political dynasties are handy. All that experience--let's keep 'em around.And slaves, too. Multi-generational slavery may be bad for those who are enslaved, but it's good for the country. Kids grow up knowing how to do slave stuff from Day One. Whereas Bushes and Clintons get up to speed quickly on bombing places and receiving knob-jobs from interns, slaves' kids can shuffle and mumble "Yassum!" before they're old enough to walk. Hence, we should have more of it.African-Americans have paid their dues; we shouldn't make them slaves again. Instead, what about pundits? For one thing, there are at least as many pundits in the U.S. as African-Americans so the supply's taken care of. The only downside is that it'll take a while to work those pasty bespectacled pundit bodies into plantation-shape.And among those of us who read a lot of online opinion, who hasn't fantasized about certain authors stooped over beneath a broiling sun for hours at a stretch picking cotton or harvesting sugar cane?</comment>

<comment>Pass. Politicians make terrible statesmenLeaders should ideally be picked from diplomats, engineers, or military</comment>

<comment>There should be a track record of real world accomplishment.</comment>

<comment>Political dynasty is not a gubment of the people.In a perfect democracy, any shnook with the best skills and qualifications should be the leader.But a liberal media monopoly has turned it into a popularity contest.</comment>

<comment>We should burn the bodies of Bill Clinton and W together as a form of national healing.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. No more Clintons, no more Bushes, ever.</comment>

<comment>Just use Trump and Cruz as kindling and you've got a deal.</comment>

<comment>But now you have to throw Hillary and Jeb on the fire as well.</comment>

<comment>"Candidates from established political families may have unfair advantages, but an inherited tradition of public service isn’t something Americans should dismiss out of hand".Nuh, that is definitely something Americans should dismiss out of hand. And just for good measure, to make sure that "established political families" get the memo, Americans should simply ban the practice outright. The photograph at the top of this article is a much better argument against this undemocratic tradition than the article itself is in its favour.</comment>

<comment>Look, if you can't criticize a candidate for lacking the proper family background to run for office, you can't argue in favour of another because they have that background. And no way do I want to live in a country where I would be overtly considered to have less merit just because I lack one of a handful of last names.</comment>

<comment>No.</comment>

<comment>The scale and complexity of modern life allows the second and third iteration of a dynasty to become wholly disconnected from ordinary people. The founder might actually have needed these people to one degree or another to get where they are.The dynastic heirs did not.</comment>

<comment>You are so misguided. </comment>

<comment>I look forward to a cute story in People magazine next year in which Chelsea Clinton walks into the Oval Office and tells her children "This will be mommy's office someday."</comment>

<comment>Established names.Yeah... certainly the rage nowadays.Bush and Clinton have a hugh burden at this moment in time.</comment>

<comment>"In a mature society, 'civil servant' is semantically equal to 'civil master.'" --Robert Heinlein</comment>

<comment>Political Dynasties- Aside from individual candidates within one family or another, the problem we've seen this election cycle is that the dynasty "heir/heiress" can lock up donors and support in a way that prevents other (better, younger, smarter) candidates to explore a run for office.  Of course, this is also related to the U.S. campaign finance system.But I think voters of all political persuasions have a sneaking suspicion that we possibly could have fielded a better (GOP) and broader (Dems) field of candidates if neither  Secretary Clinton or Governor Bush had signaled that each was interested in running for President of the United States.</comment>

<comment>The assumption that a political aristocracy has an "inherited tradition of public service" is not reasonable.The assumption that the members of a political aristocracy will act in the interests of that very aristocracy is reasonable.That a political aristocracy will also align itself with a ruling plutocracy is quite certain.</comment>

<comment>We have only had one Clinton for president. We have had two Bush presidents. We certainly don't need a third one as in Jeb. We have seen what a mess the last Bush left behind. No more Bush's. Barbara Bush was right the first time.</comment>

<comment>While it bears a resemblance to hereditary nobility, I wonder if modern political dynasties have a more modern explanation:  BrandingMarketing a national brand isn't easy, and having built-in brand awareness by having a recognizable last name likely confers a substantial advantage.</comment>
