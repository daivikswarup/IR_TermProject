<comment>Good article. I like that it discuss the views of both parties</comment>

<comment>The theory of supply and demand does not predict that immigrants will reduce wages. Immigrants increase demand as well as supply--by buying things, and by making things cheaper for natives, who can use the money they save to buy more things. The higher supply reduces wages, but the higher demand increases them. Even if immigrants increase supply by more than demand, the ultimate effect on wages will depend on how elastic the supply and demand curves are; a small increase in demand can outweigh a large increase in supply if the demand curve is elastic enough.Therefore, theory is ambiguous and you need to look at the evidence. The evidence is mixed, and every individual study is open to criticism, but the average result of most studies is that immigrants have no significant effect on native wages. This paper for example looked at 129 different effects reported over several different studies and found that a 1% increase in immigration decreases native wages by just 0.029%: http://link.springer.com/artic...</comment>

<comment>The provided paper does not address the issue at hand, though: unrepresentative or mismatched sampling. At least, I did not see it there. Meta-analysis is helpful, but this did not address the legitimacy of the studies looked at. It is possible that immigration studies have had a sampling problem for a long time, especially if it has been accepted as necessary compromise to reach good sample sizes. Or, it could be that immigration does not strongly effect native wages. You can't really come away from the paper you provided feeling like the proper critical analysis has been done, though (it could have been, but sampling really didn't seem to be addressed). </comment>

<comment>Here is the problem with your argument.  Mass offshoring of industries wasoccuring at the same time period as mass immigration.  So the "higher demand" you speak of was more than canceled out by the fact that much of that demand was being satisified overseas.What did we all observe in conjunction with skyrocketing rates of immigration after the Immigration Act of 1965? We saw occupations that were formerly middle-class, such as landscaping, construction and meatpacking - become poverty wage occupations.We saw, as Mr. Frum reports, the percentage of people on disability skyrocket.  We saw private sector union participation plummet.http://www.theatlantic.com/pol...After World War I, laws were passed severely limiting immigration. Only a trickle of immigrants has been admitted since then. . . By keeping labor supply down, immigration policy tends to keep wages high. Let us underline this basic principle: Limitation of the supply of any grade of labor relative to all other productive factors can be expected to raise its wage rate; an increase in supply will, other things being equal, tend todepress wage rates.â€” Paul Samuelson, Economics (1964)</comment>

<comment>Read this again:"This paper for example looked at 129 different effects reported over several different studies and found that a 1% increase in immigration decreases native wages by just 0.029%:"Then follow the link provided.The studies in the meta analysis are intended to discover the degree to which "all other things are equal" in fact. Or to put it another way,all other things are unequal in different ways so the question is what is the net effect of these differences. Most immigrants are employed in services which can't be imported from China. </comment>

<comment>You are confusing the work that the immigrants do with the products that the immigrants buy.Maybe you should be commenting on the Oscars article, buddy. You are out of your league here.</comment>

<comment>Not just products -- services.And you haven't provided any empirical evidence whatsoever for your points, spud.  Paul Samuelson's decades old theory isn't really that compelling in light of empirical evidence to the contrary.Also, as noted in a prior discussion, you don't appear to be taking into account confounding variables when you blithely connect wage stagnation to immigration during the last 50 years."Maybe you should be commenting on the Oscars article, buddy. You are out of your league here."This was totally unnecessary.  M W's post was well-reasoned and thoughtful, even if you disagree with the conclusions. </comment>

<comment>"Services," like state-subsidized healthcare, ESL, etc. Yup, that is really infusing economic growth into MDs and teachers who retire with $3 million annuities, professions that have been "really struggling". Who pays for these services?</comment>

<comment>The cited study shows little effect on wages from immigration. Are you claiming that immigrants spend a greater share of their income on imported goods than than other people at the same income level?Do you have a citation for that? You read the linked article, right? Maybe not.Not even the abstract?"Using 129 effect sizes, we find that the observed local wage and employment effects are very small indeed."I'll explain. Immigrant labor has very little effect on employment, so referencing outsourcing is irrelevant since that is a *different* factor effecting employment from the effect on employment resulting from immigrant labor.</comment>

<comment>No,  the OP tried to isolate increased demand as a factor that would help raise all wages.I merely pointed out that this factor was offset by decreased demand from offshored jobs.</comment>

<comment>The effects of trade on the economy--whether it produces increased growth or not, increased gdp or not, is not the same question as the effects of immigration on employment and wages.If you read the chapters on trade in Samuelson, you can draw some general conclusions based on theory. But as with the effects of immigration on wages and employment, all other things are never equal, so the question needs to be addressed by attempting to compare theory with evidence.</comment>

<comment>It's true that immigrants, like the native born, probably buy some products from foreign countries. But they also buy a lot of products from America. Even if you consciously tried not to buy any products in America, you would have to buy all of your housing from America (that's already 1/3rd of most people's spending), as well as all of your healthcare and education, most of your other services, and most of your other food. These categories are far bigger than the manufactured goods you could potentially buy from other countries. So some of immigrants' demand is flowing towards Americans, even if not all of it is.Second, there are a billion things that have happened in the economy since 1965. If you want to attribute lower wages to immigration, you need controlled studies instead of merely pointing out a correlation. And the vast majority of controlled studies find little or no effect. Even the study discussed in this article found a large effect for only a very specific group that was in direct competition with immigrants--which does not support the idea that immigration reduces wages for the native born in general.I agree that increasing the labor supply, other things being equal, will tend to depress wages. My point is that with immigration, other things are not equal. The demand issue is one thing. Another thing is the fact that most Americans are not in direct competition with immigrants, but rather have jobs that are complementary. Immigrants increase the demand for complementary jobs by making them more efficient, but do not affect the supply for those jobs, so immigrants should raise the wages of people in complementary jobs. It's possible that immigrants reduce the wages of people who they are directly competing with, but increase the wages of people who they are not directly competing with, such that their overall effect on wages in America as a whole is zero or even positive.</comment>

<comment>It sounds really crazy and all - but you - random internet guy, may just have to accept that Paul Samuelson- Nobel Prize winner in economics, and writer of the most widely used college textbook for many decades - actually might know a bit more about this subject than you do.Harvard economist Borjas also did the studies which confirmed Samuelsons' findings.Card attempted to refute them - but it turns out that he used deeply flawed control groups- as Borjas pointed out.</comment>

<comment>Okay, let's play the appeal to experts game:http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-...52% of economists agree that low-skilled immigration helps the average American, compared to 9% who disagree.http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-...Free trade is even more lopsided: 85% of surveyed economists agree or strongly agree that it is good for the country, and 0% disagree.So you are the one who should accept that the consensus among experts refutes your ideological view of economics.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, progressive.Perhaps you thought that I wouldn't notice that your "IGM group" is heavily biased towards Progressive Democrats.There is nothing scientific going on here - these are merely partisans expressing their political opinions - just like you are doing.</comment>

<comment>The person or theorist I wouldn't pay attention to is David Frum. Here's what he claimed in an Atlantic article dated January 5, 2015: "All the net new jobs created since November 2007 have gone to immigrants.."ALL the net new jobs? REALLY? Frum quotes Center for Immigration Studies, a fact-free Washington Think Tank that is neither non-partisan or independent, though they claim to be. CIS has one objective--to push the idea that America's immigration system is an unadulterated evil and that the only way to save America from impending doom is to cut drastically the number of immigrants.</comment>

<comment>Why is it you immigration'advocates' have to consistently resort to demonization of opponenets if the case for continued large scale immigration is so strong?  Even when I pillory someone I would only describe them as "fact free" in outrageous cases like Creationist arguments that are genuinely divorced entirely from scientific reality. Condemnations like "unadulterated evil" in the absence of examples to support your claim just come across as childish, but typical of 'progressive' zealotry on many issues. </comment>

<comment>Oh, grow up. I did not say CIS is an unadulterated evil. I said they push the idea that to allow more immigrants into our country is an unadulterated evil. Their sole agenda is to advocate for increased restrictions on immigration. And they use a lot of fuzzy math to do so, hence the quote used by Frum about all employment growth since 2007 going to immigrants.</comment>

<comment>The one who needs to "grow up" is you.  You start by blatantly misrepresenting what I wrote, thus admitting you have no rebuttal to my actual argument. You then bolster my original criticism by admitting the CIS merely advocates for "increased restrictions on immigration" which is a far cry from denouncing the current system as "unadulterated evil." </comment>

<comment>Play the ball, not the man</comment>

<comment>Ironically, CIS plays the man not the ball. They refuse to use a plan that's guaranteed to stop Obama's immigration agenda, just because I'm the one who came up with it:24ahead.com/mark-krikorian-der...I realize @MarkSKrikorian has some enablers, but look at reality. Illegal aliens are able to get their way because they have smart, rational, focused, dedicated leaders like Jorge Ramos, Luis Gutierrez, @ANoorani, and @FrankSharry. They and others keep pushing to get their way. Opponent leaders aren't in their ballpark, and that's partly because those opponent leaders are enabled. The pro-amnesty base doesn't enable their leaders: they demand performance. Do the same.</comment>

<comment>I'm not an economist.  I'm not an expert in statistics.  But I've witnessed with my own eyes how jobs that were once clichÃ© for  young African-Americans trying to get out of poverty have been taken by illegal immigrants and their citizen children: fast food worker, janitor, nanny, elder caretaker. etc.  And when I raise this with fellow progressives what comes back isn't economic studies saying my eyes are misleading me, but politely worded vile racism about work ethics.  Except it's utter bs: lower educated African-Americans didn't coincidentally become unwilling to work at McDonald's starting in 1986.  Coretta Scott King and Barbara Jordan warned about just this phenomena.  A few years ago in my hometown Chicago there was a protest about how many publicly funded construction sites didn't have a single African-American visible on site.  I'm repulsed by how my fellow progressives respond to raising these issues as "nativist" or racist.  If it's true that immigration is having this effect on African-Americans (and young A-A unemployment in Chicago is at third world levels), then it might as well be an unadulterated evil.</comment>

<comment>The bottom line (we don't know if the effect is positive or negative, but we've got lots of evidence it is small) doesn't fit political posturing.</comment>

<comment>The problem with all those studies is that they focus narrowly on wage suppression. There is no study, as far as I know, that investigate how immigration influence unemployment rateOn the other hand: I also believe they are far too broad in the groups they define. Immigrants tend to cluster in some professions but the studies are often looking at "all high school dropouts" instead of "people employed in landscaping"</comment>

<comment>Studies, schmudies.All you have to do is look at what people do. If everyone says the new Jack-in-the-Box is a culinary mecca but no one goes there, maybe it isn't.Likewise, if mass immigration doesn't reduce or at least keep wages low, then why does virtually every major corporation support it? Why are USChamber, WalMart, McDonald's, the Koch bros, etc. etc. so keen on it? Would they support something that *raised* wages?</comment>

<comment>Employers try to pay as little as possible to get equivalent work. This is why the best response is to support collective bargaining which would also sort workers into legal and illegal workers and allow only the former to be hired.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for that hoary old talking point I showed wrong almost 7 years ago:24ahead.com/s/immigration-wage...</comment>

<comment>The Liberal left should sometimes stop and think about why they suddenly find themselves on the side of Wall Street Capitalism :-/</comment>

<comment>Not true. The title of the linked meta analysis is" Joint impacts of immigration on wages and employment: review and meta-analysis"The 'employment' part of that is about increased or decreased employment as an effect of immigrants entering the job market.</comment>

<comment>The meta-study I quoted does talk about unemployment rates, and also finds a very tiny effect there.Also, I think using a broad group is correct here. All Americans benefit from lower prices due to immigration, so we should ask whether immigration affects the wages of Americans as a whole. If immigrants reduce the wages of people employed in landscaping, but raise the wages of people employed in, say, customer service occupations where you have to speak English, then they might still be a good thing for the native-born as a whole. I'm not sure how you can justify limiting the research to particular industries.</comment>

<comment>>> so we should ask whether immigration affects the wages of Americans as a wholeNo. That's how economists think and why they do the studies the way they do, but this is politics ! If there is a substantial group of people in the US that believe that immigration affect their lives negatively, they have their democratic right to use their vote to change the policy>> I'm not sure how you can justify limiting the research to particular industriesBecause people of "particular industries" think they're are hurt by immigration... and then votes Trump !</comment>

<comment>Part of the pro immigration fallacy is that it looks at statistics for short sample periods. Even using 3-5 years can distort results relative to Longer periods. The real effects don't occur until a period of settlement has occured. Immigrants first find the government teat and then begin to compete in the labor market. For example the Asian influx during the 70's resulted in the final death of unionized construction labor in the 80's.</comment>

<comment>I can always tell the people who have never had direct exposure to a large scale influx of low skilled immigrants. And the topic of this article is specifically large scale low skilled immigration into a country where jobs for low skilled workers has been declining for decades.</comment>

<comment>They most certainly depress wages and, along with those depressed wages, workers have to access welfare to make ends meet. Certainly there is more demand of various items, there are more people after all, but given a group of low wage workers compared to high wage workers, well, one pays much more in taxes, the other costs taxpayers a lot. Why we would voluntarily import low wage workers whether they are legal or illegal is sheer insanity.</comment>

<comment>Supply and demand applies to laborDuh</comment>

<comment>Right, but demand isn't static.</comment>

<comment>But if you replace laborers with illegal immigrants at a lower wage, you just replaced one person that can afford stuff with two people that can't afford stuff.</comment>

<comment>Most social liberals are now Neoliberals in economic terms. More disturbingly I find many of the white people here, who talk a big talk on race issues, turn around and hold economic positions indistinguishable from the Koch Bros. Conor Friedersdorf is a good example, although he at least admits to being a libertarian.  Yet there are several commenters here who tell me how pro-Union and 'economically left' they are yet, again hold the views one sees in The Economicst or Wall Street Journal. Just look at Noah Smith, as cited in the article, a zealous advocate of large-scale low-wage immigration, who (despite being white) tars opponenets as 'racist' like he draws breath, writing from Bloomberg View. </comment>

<comment>I am not surprised that the pro-mass-immigration studies have been demonstrated to have been using flawed control groups.Whenever I am assured that the fundamentals of some subject magically do not apply in some PC situation, I get skeptical.In this case, the PC crowd with the collusion of big (bi-partisan) corporate interests are telling us that what we have all read in our freshman economics textbooks was wrong.But they are going to have to work harder to try to disprove the Borjas paper.http://cis.org/articles/2004/b...After World War I, laws were passed severely limiting immigration. Only a trickle of immigrants has been admitted since then. . . By keeping labor supply down, immigration policy tends to keep wages high. Let us underline this basic principle: Limitation of the supply of any grade of labor relative to all other productive factors can be expected to raise its wage rate; an increase in supply will, other things being equal, tend todepress wage rates.â€” Paul Samuelson, Economics (1964)</comment>

<comment>It seems to happen more and more often these days that science jives with whatever it is PC/leftists/liberals want to be true.  They are literally creating their own reality.</comment>

<comment>Another important thing that Borjas talks about, which Frum does not mention is that localized studies ( such as the Card Miami study ) are often distorted in ways that make national studies of this phenomenon more appropriate:http://cis.org/articles/2004/b..."More recent research raises two questions about the validity of interpreting near-zero cross-city correlations as evidence that immigration has no labor market impact. First, immigrants may not be randomly distributed across labor markets. If immigrants tend to cluster in cities with thriving economies, there would be a built-in spurious positive correlation between immigration and wages.Second, natives may respond to the wage impact of immigration by moving their labor or capital to other cities. For example, native-owned firms see that cities in Southern California flooded by low-skill immigrants pay lower wages to laborers. Employers who hire laborers will want to relocate to those cities. The flow of jobs to the immigrant-hit areas cushions the adverse effect of immigration on the wage of competing workers in those localities.Similarly, laborers living in Michigan were perhaps thinking about moving to California before the immigrants entered that state. These laborers learn that immigration reduced their potential wages in California and may instead decide to remain where they are or move elsewhere. Moreover, some Californians might leave the state to search for better opportunities.The flow of jobs and workers tends to equalize economic conditions across cities. As a result, inter-city comparisons will not be very revealing; job flows and native migration effectively diffuse the impact of immigration across the national economy. In the end, all laborers, regardless of where they live, are worse off because there are now many more of them.Because local labor markets adjust to immigration, the labor market impact of immigration may be measurable only at the national level...".</comment>

<comment>On the one hand, any study of the effects of the Mariel boat lift has to include the spike in crime and drug trafficking that happened soon after in Miami, and the costs in both money and lives lost from the eventual response from the government to ramp up the 'War on Drugs.' On the other hand, since Castro basically dumped his criminals and mental patients on us (thank you Jimmy Carter!), it's hardly a representative sample of immigration.</comment>

<comment>On another hand, the War on Drugs is a jobs program</comment>

<comment>"According to the Congressional Research Service, from 1945 to 1970 â€” as the foreign-born population fell â€” the bottom 90 percent of wage earners saw an 82.5 percent increase in their wages. During this time, millions of prior immigrants were able to climb  out of the tenements and into the middle class.In 1965, Congress passed a new immigration law which helped produce an unprecedented wave of low-skilled immigration. The foreign-born population more than quadrupled, from fewer than 10 million in 1970 to more than 42 million today. In 1970, fewer than 1 in 21 residents were foreign-born, today it is approaching 1 in 7. In cities such as Los Angeles and New York, almost 4 in 10 current residents were born in another country. One-fifth of our residents now speak a language other than English at home. One-quarter of our residents is now either an immigrant or born to immigrant parents.This  ongoing immigration wave continues during a time when workers are being replaced with automation, when record numbers are living on welfare and when manufacturing plants are closing their doors. All of this has combined to help create an immense wage-compressing surplus of labor: 66 million working-age residents are not working. Real average hourly earnings are lower now than they were in 1973.The Congressional Research Service reports that during the 43 years between 1970 and 2013 â€” when the foreign-born population grew 325 percent â€” incomes for the bottom 90 percent of earners fell nearly 8 percent."</comment>

<comment>ever heard correlation (or in this case coincidence) isn't causation?in 1945 2nd world war just ended: most Europe was in ruins (like literally), Japan was defeat and humiliated, Russia and China were busy with recklesssocial experiments, and USA economy had no competition</comment>

<comment>Sure and the US had half the world's GDP going for it.Still does not change the last paragraph and also...correlation is correlation so more cheap labor at the same time we have lowering incomes looks suspiciously like the law of supply(labor) and demand(wages).</comment>

<comment>well, if decreasing available labor was good for living standard in the country, Syria would be golden now  upshot is that simple supply-demand picture is not useful here because: 1. immigrant also consume, 2. USA economy isn't a close system, i.e. it relies on export and import.  there are comments above that discuss this in more detailsand an automation argument is just silly, sure lets come back in 19th century and use horses instead of cars, we all will be rich and employed</comment>

<comment>http://www.theatlantic.com/bus...</comment>

<comment>you do realize that this article is pretty much sequel to one which you cited, where David admits situation is unclear, don't you ? not to mention that articles in popular magazines are hardly match for scientific research</comment>

<comment>Even the pro-immigration side admits that mass immigration is of little benefit to Americans.  The left pushes mass immigration for other reasons.  The rapekrieg in Germany shows that immigration is sacrosanct to leftists.  Nothing will stop them from supporting open borders.</comment>

<comment>But the whole "immigration doesn't actually ultimately hurt native-born workers" concept is based on the premise that native-born workers 1) have the ability to, 2) can, and 3) will move into higher-paying jobs the immigrants cannot fill.Unfortunately, in this economy, and for foreseeable future honestly, I'm not sure that premise holds. A lot of these lower-wage workers do not have, and cannot get the skills any faster than these immigrants can, to move into the higher paid jobs. The reason they were working lower-wage jobs in the first place was largely due to not qualifying for the higher skilled jobs. Even if you want to throw in retraining, going back to school, etc., those tend to be fairly time-consuming, fairly expensive, and ultimately may not pan out, because employers may not be so interested in taking a chance on a fresh-out-of-retraining middle-aged adult, over a younger person with the same skill set. Even if they would, there simply aren't enough jobs for the native-born low-wage workers to move up into. And those who do manage to move up to the next tier of jobs, they drag the wage rate at THOSE jobs down, because they will likely do the job for less than the people who were holding those jobs before.Add to all this that a fair number of immigrants still send portions of wages back to their "home" countries, and you're creating even LESS demand for the additional workers here.Sure, in the lonnnng-term it may all even out, but problem is for most people, the long-term really doesn't matter. No one cares that 100 years from now, things will be a little net better, if for the next 5-20 years of their life, its going to be harder and worse. The "not a zero sum game" theory tends to miss that detail, but its an important one. Good down the road is nice, but if given the choice, just about everyone would keep "good today" even at the expense of a little better down the road</comment>

<comment>Not to mention that economist ignore the impact of families, communities, and the environment. </comment>

<comment>It's their fault because "immigrants" do the hard work nobody will do according to pro illegal immigrants.</comment>

<comment>The assumption that illegal immigrants are only capable of working the very lowest paying jobs is wrong. In the last two decades, once good paying occupations have been turned into low paying jobs by excessive immigration, legal and illegal. The best example is construction trades, which 30 years ago were considered honorable middle class occupations. Hourly wages for construction carpenters is a good example. In the 1980s, in places like Phoenix, Las Vegas, and San Diego, a skilled carpenter couldmake $20.00 to $30.00 an hour or more. Carpenters were buying suburban homes and putting their kids through college. Today in Phoenix, the wage scale for the same skilled workers is $10.00 to $18.00an hour, and it's likely the worker will speak Spanish and live in shared housing in a rough part of town ... beyond the author's mumbo jumbo statistics - this is the reality.</comment>

<comment>That isn't due to immigration. It's due to the fact that everyone's salaries have remained flat over the last thirty years, inflation, the shifting of wealth from the middle class to the top 1%, and the fact that 95% of new economic growth goes to the one-percenters.</comment>

<comment>The reason why wages have remained stagnant and declined is because the labor market has been intentionally flooded - this is the cause and effect. It's basic supply and demand.</comment>

<comment>Where is your evidence to support this? Because current data show it to be the exact opposite:http://www.epi.org/publication...http://fortune.com/2015/09/01/...http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/...</comment>

<comment>Personal experience. In the late 80s I averaged $1,500.00 a week doing production framing in Las Vegas. Today, you would be lucky to make $600.00 a week as a framing carpenter in Vegas, and if you spoke English only you would not be able to communicate with many of the other workers. Nevada's workforce is estimated by liberals to be 10% illegal immigrant and it's probably a lot higher in reality. I lived through this - I know all about it. I moved to a rural area in Western Colorado to get away from it. Younger Americans have been brainwashed into believing a false story. Your links do not showanything except how out of touch people in NYC are with reality for average Americans. </comment>

<comment>You are the biased one. You have no respect for native people's rights. </comment>

<comment>Native people? You mean Native Americans? More likely you mean white people.</comment>

<comment>Actually the hardest hit group in terms of unemployment among native-born Americans are black people. You 'progressives' carrying water for neoliberal economic theory always overlook that, despite preening about your racial consciousness in other instances. </comment>

<comment>Use the right term and maybe somebody will know what you are gassing about. I get it, I get it, you hate progressives. Move along...</comment>

<comment>No, I dislike pseudo-progressives like you that talk a big 'social justice' game, but are global capitalist cheerleaders when push comes to shove.  There are genuine leftist, both economically and socially out there, but their voice is muted by the media.    'Labor mobility' is fundmental to neoliberal theory, which is why people like you find themselves in step with the Koch Bros. and Bloomberg, i.e. the capitalist billionaire class, on immigration. </comment>

<comment>So true. 51% of young African American males are unemployed.  What sort of jobs did they do before we imported so much manual labor? Oh, right... manual labor.</comment>

<comment>Let's not let massive unemployment figures amount young African Americans distract us from what is really important: black thespians and the Oscars. </comment>

<comment>No, your side has no credibility. Your studies and figures have been proven bogus decade after decade. Your side has billionaire open border globalists with an agenda spending billions to astroturf the issue with paid for think tanks and whores in the media and weasels in both political parties who have sold their country out. Your side lied when they passed the 1965 Immigration Act. Your side lied when they passed the 1986 amnesty. Your side lied when they said we needed millions of STEM workers when we did not. Your side lied when they said Obama was beating all other presidents in deportations when he is not. Your side paid the Sierra Club 100 million bribe to never talk about immigration and the environment ever again. your side lied when they tried to pass the so called immigration reform in 2007 and 2013. your side buys and controls the media who shoves all true efforts to reform Immigration like the 1995 bi partisan congressional commission on immigration and their recommendations for less immigration down the memory hole. Your side demonizes anyone who dares study immigration like Borjas who has conclusions they do not like and prevents non tenured scholars to study the effects of immigration.your side demonizes anyone who merely wants to discuss an immigration policy that would have less immigration as a bigot, racist, xenophobe, and nativist , while giving a fee pass to those anti Americans on your side who want endless non white immigration to " rub the rights nose in multiculturalism". We aren't discussing the issue anymore. We are looking for ways to take action to solve the issue. Your input is  going to be "anecdotal." Maybe you should do a study on how long it takes for you to kick a dog before it bites you.</comment>

<comment>Don't you know  that personal experience is irrelevant these days?  If some egghead didn't do an "empirical study" to support your point of view, your point of view is invalid.  Isn't it weird how said eggheads always seem to side with leftists and globalists?</comment>

<comment>Union or non union?Average now is 20.56..http://www.bls.gov/oes/estimat...Average for union carpenters is higher'"The average annual salary for a union carpenter was $76,000 as of 2013, according to Careerbliss.

<comment>Not sure about your case, but here in Oregon production framing appears to me to still be primarily an "Anglo" trade, yet wages have gone down and down anyway. I think we are confusing a more or less perpetual labor glut with the impact of immigrants, illegal or otherwise. The economy is not producing the high wage jobs it used to because capital got the upper hand during and after the Reagan administration. Blue collar whites backed the wrong horse (Republicans) and got themselves screwed.If you want policies that favor labor, up and down the chain you have the Democratic party. Higher minimum wages, better benefits, and unions, not "right to work for less."</comment>

<comment>Production agriculture in the PNW is not an "Anglo" trade. There are Hispanic-majority, or at least plurality, counties in eastern Washington. </comment>

<comment>Absolutely true. In the good ole days farmers employed 12 year old Anglo kids and "guest workers." Today they employ illegal immigrants and many legal ones. I have a farm, and the commercial nurseries down the road pay a pretty good wage to their Latino labor.I would add that back to the Nevada example, workers managed to unionize the Casinos and hotels, and those wages are pretty decent. They should have unionized construction while they were at it.</comment>

<comment>Addiction has a price; don't ignore the cost please.</comment>

<comment>Did you even read what they said? </comment>

<comment>Who is "they?" Did you click on the links?</comment>

<comment>Yes I did. You didn't give data. You gave links to fortune magazine which isn't impartial at all. Its a pro-business rag. The other links are also funded by globalization interests.Yes, there is a lot of money to support propaganda. And its working on you. Congratulations.The facts are that immigration lower wages. You can cherry pick data to show otherwise and that is what you are doing.</comment>

<comment>The links, even the Fortune one, had charts, numbers, and well reasoned arguments that highlight the many reasons why wages are stagnating.Maybe instead of trolling, you guys should actually provide data on your own end to support your assertions that illegals are depressing wages but noooooo.</comment>

<comment>The data shows exactly the opposite of what ?According to your links, wages have been stagnant since the seventies. If I compare with US immigration statistics it seems that immigration have been on the rise in the same time frame. What does that prove ?</comment>

<comment>Seems to me you and your ilk are conflating wage stagnation with immigration without any quantifiable evidence to support that other than ideologically driven anecdotes than those links which were done by those who are educated, knowledgeable, and experienced, in the subject matter.</comment>

<comment>You didn't answer the question: What does the data you linked prove ? As far as I can see, it's a non-sequitur</comment>

<comment>I did answer it. Stop trolling, read it more carefully, and you'll see it.Meanwhile, I wait with baited breath for any of you to provide data to support your assertions that immigrants are responsible for wage stagnation. Very baited breath,</comment>

<comment>You're not worth arguing with</comment>

<comment>So that's a "no I have no evidence to support my claim that immigrants are responsible for wage stagnation" and "I am a very bad troll." figures as much.</comment>

<comment>see:https://research.stlouisfed.or...https://research.stlouisfed.or...</comment>

<comment>I know one thing, illegals were moving out of California during the 90's and 00's due to low wages (when jobs available) and high cost of living for the South, the Midwest and anywhere else.Guess what made wages depressed and cost of living go up? Yep, that is it.Census numbers show that poor uneducated Latinos are the ones whose wages have gone down the most, 8%, than any other group, Blacks 6%, Whites 4% and Asians 1% for similar groups (I round up the numbers). What is the common denominator?Go ahead and say there is no negative effect to immigration of the poor to the poor here, that labor is not elastic.</comment>

<comment>So why aren't houses getting cheaper instead of more expensive?</comment>

<comment>Illegal immigrants, when they first arrive, tend to work low paying jobs because of credentialing problems (Doctors are no longer Doctors, Lawyers are no long Lawyers, etc).</comment>

<comment>Illegal immigrants who were white collar workers of such category? I haven't met a single one! I have met refugees and a couple of immigrants who were white collar workers.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but without the immigrant professors teaching and doing research at colleges, the cost of college would go up too, so the skilled carpenter still might not be able to afford it.You have to look at whether immigration benefits or hurts the country as a whole, not just specific professions, especially specific professions where immigrants are direct competition.</comment>

<comment>1. Open all borders.2. Double World GDP (median estimate).</comment>

<comment>And all that added wealth would go straight to the 1%.</comment>

<comment>"It exerts its influence in large part because it purports to be based on close study of real-world effects, not blackboard computations." Really. I am a Miami native and our family has been here since 1919. In the 1980s, Miami was not the 'real world". In that time period Miami was awash in billions of illegal cocaine money unlike anything that has happened before or since. to those who did not live here then there is little to say to make you understand how much illegal drug money was flooding the community. To say Miami was typical of any city at that time is ludicrous, deceitful and a deliberate lie.. Also, if immigration was good for Miami, why has it become one of the most heavily poor cities in America at the top of all cities in income disparity?Immigration is a racket, a transfer of money from labor to capital. The push for endless and unlimited immigration is done by the billionaire open border globalist who profit and then pass on all the social, economic and environmental costs to the communities. The globalists spend hundreds of millions on think tanks and donations to politicians and organizations to push their open border agenda.How many readers of the Atlantic know about Soros spending millions to push open borders, or the cheap labor globalist billionaire David Gelbaum who gave the Sierra Club 100 million dollars in 2006 on the one condition they never mention immigration and the effects it has on the environment ever again.Year after year we are force fed lies on immigration and when the weasels are caught in heir lies , they have no shame or apologize, they just move onto the next lie or bogus study. Look at how many years we were told we had a shortage of STEM workers when in fact we have 3 million Stem workers not working in their fields ad their wages have been stagnant for years. The open border anti American globalists and their studies have no credibility.  The just have the billions of dollars coming from those who want open borders and an endless supply of cheap compliant labor and to import a new electorate easier to lie to and dupe .we are not a nation of immigrants , we are a nation of citizens betrayed by both parties and the media on immigration.</comment>

<comment>Thank you.I've been pointing out that, besides the Mariel boatlift, all things were not otherwise equal in Miami compared to Card's control group of American cities during his test period of 1980-1984 due to the famous Cocaine Boom. You're the first person I can recall who independently came up with that crushing objection to Card's study.</comment>

<comment>Thank you Mr. Sailer. I read your unmatched political analysis and excellent and almost always unique immigration commentary on vdare, so I may have received the objection initially from you, but the confirmation certainly came from having lived here all my life.I want to thank you for something you wrote the other day. You mentioned how if our opponents keep demonizing and destroying those informed moderates on our side who are only calling for a reduction in immigration, then soon the only people on our side will be radical people unafraid of being demonized. if you call people with the same immigration position as the late democrat Congresswoman  Barbara Jordan a neo Nazi, then soon you will only have neo Nazis to contend with. if the open border globalist keep kicking the dogs in the room, soon the only dogs left will be the ones who bite back. I am not the smartest person in any crowd, but even I realize our real enemy is not immigrants, they just want to take our jobs and country, the real enemy is those who want to make that happen. if we can't find a solution, at some point the billionaire globalist  people who have been playing with fire are going to get burned. the open border crowd in all the western countries need to wake up and see they are making a big mistake. There are many stupid people in the west who want to eat the rich. The rich are flooding the west with people who come from countries that have recipes. This will not end well.</comment>

<comment>I first read Card's paper in the 1990s. Card's paper is grossly overrated and misused in the immigration debate. For example, Card found evidence of reduced domestic migration to Miami after the Boatlift, which offset the population effects of the Boatlift.In short, Card found evidence to support the theory that immigrants displace domestic workers. (Read the paper - Card even used the term "displaced".)You would never know that fact given the media and progressives deliberately misrepresenting Card's paper. It is a testament to how low the quality of policy debates have become in this country that we are making policy based on obvious and deliberate misrepresentations.</comment>

<comment>The corporations that own the media are the same that profit from globalization. When Clinton deregulated media ownership he made things much worse in the media.</comment>

<comment>See Harvard labor economist George Borjas's study, Immigration and the American Worker: http://goo.gl/ksreGw  Upshot: redistributive effects (from labor to capital) swamp growth in the economy 100/1.   This is precisely what the laws of supply and demand would predict.</comment>

<comment>Regardless of whether it hurts us, we let them in and we hired them and paid them wages knowing they are illegal.  That means that we bear some responsibility in dealing with the problem humanely, and "ship 'em back home" is not an option.  Also immigration has recently become net-zero so it is somewhat moot.  And if we are going to bomb Syria and Iraq on a daily basis (and brag about it - see State Dept's "Think again turn away") then we have a responsibility to let in well vetted legitimate refugees regardless of whether it hurts the economy.  Then they can learn from us and hopefully return to their homelands with a new respect for freedom and democracy.</comment>

<comment>Who is "we?" I had nothing to do with hiring illegal immigrants. I have taken a stand against it since 1990.</comment>

<comment>"We" is most people.  Who did nothing other than quietly grumble about the influx of cheap labor as they enjoyed the benefits.  Year after year.  Take some responsibility for your behavior.</comment>

<comment>You probably also blame woman who were raped. </comment>

<comment>It's been ILLEGAL the whole time...You really saying it's my fault that I didn't round up a pose and do Obama's job?</comment>

<comment>Notice the "we". This is typical displacement of responsibility. There is no "we" here. The fact that its illegal means its not a "we"!! If it was a "we" thing then we would have made it legal. </comment>

<comment>Maybe "we" is the human race?</comment>

<comment>This is the typical economics argument -- how dare you allow pesky facts and lived experience to interfere with my grand theories.  And most of the people writing and thinking about immigration receive its benefits (more ethnic restaurants!  cheaper maids!  cheaper childcare!) while bearing none of its costs (schools flooded with non-English speaking students, taking away resources from their kids;  competition for unskilled work; having 12 people living in a 2-bedroom apt right next to you).  But the unskilled and uneducated and frankly low-IQ people are the ones getting creamed by this.  For instance, labor-force participation by teenagers, down from 72% to 42% from 1978 to the present.  Who is now doing all those low-skill jobs?  Immigrants.  And if you are a poor schmuck teenager who is not bright enough to graduate high-school, much less attend college, where do you get you first job opportunity to learn those essential skills for a lifetime, like showing up for work, dealing with supervisors etc?  It used to be they could be a dishwasher, landscaper, grocery bagger, whatever non-glamorous job that got them work experience and essential skills.  Now?  Tough luck buddy.  I've seen it time and again, low skilled and marginal workers (remember all those ex-cons The Atlantic cries their crocodile tears about not being able to find work?  Who the hell do you think their competing with, Yale grads?)  It used to be those low-skilled marginal, low education workers could find work in construction, yard maintenance, dish washing, etc.  20 million unskilled immigrants later, they usually don't.  Sucks to be them, but it's no skin off of Noah Smith's back.</comment>

<comment>We need to overhaul our immigration system and it is time to introduce a merit point based immigration instead of present chain based immigration. we don't need to import siblings and then cousin and everyone in the family chain of a foreign origin US citizen regardless of their skills. We should allow only immigration of spouse/children/parents through family immigration and rest has to come based on their standing on merit point based system. this merit system should evaluate a potential immigrant based on his/her education, work experience, English language skills, adaptability to host nation (USA), no criminal background and genuine need of the labor market. we also need to end diversity lottery as present day USA has enough diversity in terms of ethnic background of its population. Also we need 99% effectiveness in border control and mandatory E-verify, prison terms for willful violators. After all of the above is done then think about what to do with illegals? In my personal opinion people here for about 10 years with US Citizen kids/siblings/spouse, have English language skills and no criminal background need to pay fine and provided with EAD and then apply for a Green Card through existing channels (no special path to citizenship) and rest should be deported.</comment>

<comment>I wish you could see how well it worked 30 years ago! No permanent nothing for nobody and, you sneeze wrong, grab on.</comment>

<comment>"They could welcome the newcomers at no cost to the settled population."51% of all immigrants are on some form of welfare and that is most definitely a cost to the settled population.  So regardless whether they reduce wages or blow you up or change the culture of your community so thoroughly you no longer recognize it there is still a very easily identifiable monetary cost that nobody can dispute.http://www.usatoday.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>While important, there are vast differences in welfare usage across ethnic groups.  As I recall, East and SE Asians were the same as native whites at just under 30% receiving assistance, with South Asians below 20%.  This argues for immigration selectivity rather than our de facto open border policy with Latin America started under Reagen. </comment>

<comment>Get rid of nepotistic immigration, add merit to the term.</comment>

<comment>There is a lot of money and power to be had in proving that immigration, devaluing native protection, and imperialism are all for the greater good.Supporting liberal immigration is exactly the same impulse as those who support Columbus or other imperialist. They see Columbus as an explorer not as an exploiter.The progressives who support immigration are the modern version of the people who supported colonies in the 18th and 19th century. There is a lot of money to be had in ignoring the rights of native people. Its just another form of deregulation. </comment>

<comment>Native people. Lol</comment>

<comment>I'm confused. Who is making all the money from immigrants? I'd assume it is farmers employing illegals to harvest crops, builders employing illegals to do manual labor, meat packers employing illegals, nursing homes employing illegals, etc. Call me crazy, but I'll bet that the folks making the money are more likely to be on the right than the left.</comment>

<comment>Yes, good point. But American politics belong to the rich, and the rich of both persuasions love immigration. The rich on the right love it because they get richer. The rich on the left love it for a more complicated reason -- it assuages their white guilt and lets them feel like do-gooders. Besides, they don't suffer an inconvenience. Any inconvenience is born by the poors.</comment>

<comment>If Columbus discovered an Americas today the progressives would support the conquest of those lands. They would ignore what happens to the natives and only focus on the data they wanted to. If you pointed out how the natives suffered they would call you a xenophobe or racist or something to stop debate.There has always been a lot of money to be had in exploiting native people by flooding their lands with foreigners. Inflows of foreigners destabilizes the natives, drives down wages, and results generally in a relatively few urban elite becoming incredibly wealthy.Its the same old story.</comment>

<comment>A small sample will not detect a small effect. Preiod !  And that's  true for every statistical test of significance.Everything else is blowing smoke.Why can't Disqus  allow us to reply to mutlipel posts with one reply ?</comment>

<comment>This could be, just maybe, perhaps, possibly, one of the best Atlantic articles I've read. Balanced, fair, analyzed both sides of the argument, and let the reader make his/her own decision.</comment>

<comment>Gee.. "Wages did decline, he finds, but no more for those workers he regarded as competing with Marielitos than for those he regards as not competing". So wages did decline, but his conclusion is that an influx of low skill workers doesn't hurt American workers. What a bunch of baloney. This is an exercise in using statistics dishonestly to arrive at a pre-conceived conclusion.Love the "he regards as not competing" - that is a key giveaway that his opinion has substituted for fact.</comment>

<comment>So in other words Frum and Borjas have bupkes, but maybe Card's study was flawed as well.Labor markets are not static. 100,000 new immigrants are not simply job takers, they are also spenders. They need housing, food, clothing, and transportation. So they don't just take, they also give. It may be they take more than give, at least for the first few years, but its not zero sum.I assume immigrants, legal and otherwise have some impact on wages if there are too many too fast in a poor labor market. I also assume this impact diminishes over time as they get settled and move up the food chain. But the real reason American wages have flat lined probably has little to do with immigration however. Its about corporations getting the upper hand due to a GLOBAL labor glut and their freedom to move capital and production anywhere they please. Its about a flat minimum wage and declining unions.</comment>

<comment>No...it's about being addicted to cheap illegal labor. </comment>

<comment>Cheap labor yes. Both legal and illegal, and both here and abroad. Capital seeks out low cost labor wherever it is, and in whatever form. And our government largely supports this. Welcome to libertarian land.</comment>

<comment>...not the people. Thus Trump.</comment>

<comment>Trump is certainly playing with this, but in fact he also seeks out the cheapest labor he can find for his projects. People are utter fools to think he is on the side of working Americans.</comment>

<comment>Lol. Cause you think the current lot does? NAFTA was a Clinton...</comment>

<comment>NAFTA was Clinton plus nearly all Republicans in Congress. The only resistance came from Democrats tied to labor.Trump has zero ties to labor, and has a record of hiring on the cheap, so do the math.</comment>

<comment>>> Welcome to libertarian landDon't make it a partisan issue. Both sides of the isle have been involved in this. Yes, the DEMS have offered some more welfare, and at least pretended to care but they've never presented any solutions, only band-aidIt doesn't matter if you vote/voted Bush or Clinton (either version of them), the outcome will be the same pro-immigration policy as it has been for decades under presidents from both parties</comment>

<comment>But it is a partisan issue. One party supports labor unions and the other doesn't. One supports access to health insurance regardless of employment or income, the other doesn't. And one party supports a substantial increase in the minimum wage while the other doesn't. I'd like to see the Dems be more pro labor than we are, but I have no illusions about the alternative.Immigration is largely a red herring in this. It has a marginal impact on wages at or near the bottom. Its more of a distraction than anything.</comment>

<comment>The subject is immigration. Both sides of the aisle is pro-immigration, there is no substantial differences thereRegarding all the DEM "support" for different issues: They have had the necessary majority several times during the last 50 years, yet not much have been done</comment>

<comment>In the US the states set the main rules for unions. In Republican led states there are "right to work" laws that allow workers to opt out of trade unions, In Democratic states unions are easier to organize and maintain.Democrats only controlled Congress for 2 of the last 25 years, and when they had the chance they did raise the minimum wage. States run by Dems also have higher minimum wages.Dems created Obamacare, which allows poor working people to get health insurance, subsidized by the government.On immigration, Dems favor what we call comprehensive reform, which is not an open door policy at all. But it wold legalize many who are here illegally, allowing them to bargain for better wages.</comment>

<comment>Mass immigration is a feature of globalism.  Corporations can't outsource formerly well paying jobs in construction, commercial trucking, commercial fishing, etc., so they in-source those jobs with cheap immigrant labor.  The problem is that domestic cheap labor is worse than foreign cheaper labor, because we are required to bear the social costs of an enormous pool of unskilled workers and their families: costs like school overcrowding, welfare use, crime, urban sprawl and crowding, etc.</comment>

<comment>Immigration and job export are both features, not bugs, of "economic liberalism," otherwise known as unregulated capitalism.Resentment against the immigrants instead of the capitalists is misplaced.</comment>

<comment>Both immigration and free trade are responsible for wage suppression and unemployment, and both are elements of the globalization of the economyUnions, for example, lost their leverage because of both: A large supply of unorganized (and even illegal) workers ready to work for less than the unionists demanded plus the threat that the company would be outsourcedMy worries is not so much about wage stagnation but about the number of people on welfare that have risen dramatically since immigration picked up as Frum notes. More welfare is not a solution and higher minimum wage will just make the problem worse: Illegals doesn't care about minimum wage and employers can just outsource their business to China</comment>

<comment>I don't buy the argument that immigration has had much if any impact on unionization. For example, the Las Vegas casino and hotel trade is staffed mostly by immigrants, yet they managed to unionize and get decent wages and benefits in what is otherwise a very low pay trade.We would actually be better off with even more people on "welfare" if that reduced the surplus labor available at the low end. More welfare, higher minimum wage, and more unionization are solutions to both wage stagnation and inequality.</comment>

<comment>We have a lot of European citizens working here (ie. not illegal immigrants): Even with the strong unions in Denmark, only 10% of the foreign workers are unionized while +65% of the natives are.Organization percentage on the Danish labor market (Denmark is blue): http://videnskab.dk/sites/all/...Number of foreign workers (the sum of the two-colored bars. The black line is how the economists expected it to go): http://multimedia.pol.dk/archi...People on welfare as a solution is repugnant to me. It rip people of dignity and purpose, and leave them to rot at the bottom of society</comment>

<comment>The idea of able bodied people not working is repugnant to many, but we need to get over it. We have a world with a more or less permanent surplus of labor. Why punish people for not having jobs that do not exist?</comment>

<comment>"Declining wages for existing jobs prodded native-born workers to improve their skills and shift to better paid work."This may be my favorite argument from the open-borders neo-liberals.  If you depress the wages of the most vulnerable American workers, well, we're doing them a favor!  See, that's the boot in the butt that they need to better themselves, get trained, and move up the jobs ladder.If that argument is true, let's eliminate the minimum wage.  Better yet, let's cap it for low-skilled jobs to give native born Americans the gentle nudge they need to better themselves.Edit - and this is a really good piece from the Atlanic, like most of Frum's pieces.  Balanced, specific and wonky.</comment>

<comment>Just don't confuse "neo-liberals" with....you know....actual liberals. The neos are right wingers who want unregulated capitalism.</comment>

<comment>Neo-liberals are right wingers, now we have heard everything.</comment>

<comment>You dont know what political right means huh?</comment>

<comment>Yes.  You don't know the difference between "liberal" politics and "liberal" economics. Here is a primer.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>No. No it doesn't.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...This is all stuff that anyone with a Googler can research for themselves.</comment>

<comment>You are looking like a fool right about now.</comment>

<comment>That is absolutely the case. The Koch brothers are "neo-liberals."</comment>

<comment>So many ways of saying, "The beatings will continue until morale improves."</comment>

<comment>This feels oddly similar to the climate change debate, where the reality of the situation is obscured by alarmists and devout deniers. How could you deny a significant influx of immigrants _wouldn't_ impact a job market? Perhaps the more nuanced reality here is sure, we could keep population stagnant and deny immigration at all costs, but wages so many pressures that immigration is the least of its threats.</comment>

<comment>How could the Nazis convince Germans that the Jewish deli owner down the street was part of a global conspiracy to destroy the Aryan race?Propaganda. What we're witnessing here is pure propaganda. And it doesn't much matter that many of us are skeptical. The propaganda repeats relentlessly, and the sheeple go, "Well, they wouldn't put it on the internet if it wasn't true."</comment>

<comment>Because there was already extreme racism against Jews in Germany</comment>

<comment>Which side of a debate is propaganda?</comment>

<comment>There is no debate on immigration in America. In politics, it's all kabuki, and surely you're not counting internet discussions as part of any national debate?</comment>

<comment>As with so many assumptions that things are really simple, evidence does not often support it. A careful attempt to do that suggests that the effect of immigration on wages and employment is slight.This study was discussed in an earlier comment by another person.http://link.springer.com/artic...</comment>

<comment>And don't forget, this is downplayed in European media. You need to dig deeper into the alternative media to find the really disturbing stuff.Everybodym read about  Cologne, but few know that in 2015 alone, hundreds of german women and teenagers have been gang raped by sometimes as much as 9 men on one woman. You can find information about it fex herehttp://www.gatestoneinstitute....</comment>

<comment>That's because low-skilled workers earn minimum wage, and you can't pay people less than minimum.Oh, so wages did decline. Of course they did not decline only for those competing with Cuban immigrants. It's all one big pool of labor, and the influx of immigrants enlarged that pool. Non-immigrants who competed with Cuban immigrants saw their wages decline, but some non-immigrants managed to get better jobs (which they would have anyway). But then those non-immigrants who managed to get better jobs increased the size of the pool competing for those better jobs, so wages for those better jobs declined as well.</comment>

<comment>The summary measure for all effects remains very small.  Wages are not totally elastic to demand but are 'sticky' according to many economists.</comment>

<comment>It is the wrong question to ask if an influx of low skilled migrants will depress the wages of low skilled local population. The more interesting question would be how the influx impacts the whole population. One needs to take into account that an influx of new workforce is increasing demand of everything, starting from food groceries schooling, housing. Are we considering the positive impact of having low wage agricultural workers on the price of food we are paying at the supermarket for example? Or the ability of municipalities to finally fix some roads and pay less for that then normal? Large scale immigration is rejuvenating the whole economy. People will see that besides the news of the horrible rapes committed by the middle eastern refugees in Europe, in a few years growth will return there. And there will be many to take credit for that, but the credit should go to Angela for her courage and vision.</comment>

<comment>We already have all the agricultural workers we need, plus how can we call the exploitation of human beings a "positive impact?" You could have made the same argument to defend slavery.</comment>

<comment>Precisely. It is the same argument as defending slavery. By the way nobody argued those days that slaves will take away the jobs of the low skilled workers. Maybe it was not true then as it is not true now. Regarding the moral argument of exploitation that is an entirely different story. It is not clear to me that we should "protect" the long line of immigrants trying to come in and get exploited by keeping them out for their own good.</comment>

<comment>The low-skilled workers and the slaves were the same back then, but in any case, craftsmen, artisans and other skilled workers certainly did argue that freeing the slaves would cost them jobs.Not really a different story. It comes from the same self-centered mindset. Anything is positive as long as it benefits me/us no matter how badly it screws you/them.Ask yourself why we have so many immigrants trying to come in and get exploited? It's because US policies have devastated their countries economically. In particular, NAFTA destroyed the small Mexican farmer and was the direct cause of Mexico becoming a narco state and the largest source of immigrants, legal and illegal.They're jumping because the building is on fire, not because the landing is going to be cushy.</comment>

<comment>"It is the wrong question to ask if an influx of low skilled migrants will depress the wages of low skilled local population."I disagree.  In relatively well-off society like ours, we should be concerned about our most vulnerable.  As Borjas' work shows, low skill immigration benefits primarily the immigrants themselves (to whom we owe no moral duty), and upper income people who can better afford cheaper goods and services.  The people who suffer are low skilled native born workers.  So low skill immigration essentially redistributes value from poor natives to wealthier natives.</comment>

<comment>I don't think this is true. Low-skill immigrants mainly work in agriculture and construction. The poor spend a much higher percentage of their income on food and housing compared to the rich. So the cheaper goods and services you get from immigration primarily benefit the poor.I also disagree that we have no moral duty to immigrants. Certainly, it would be morally wrong for us to invade Mexico, steal their resources, and give it to our poor people, even though that would help our poor. And I would also argue that it is morally wrong to deny people economic opportunities just because they are foreign. It was morally wrong for California to keep people from Oklahoma out during the Dust Bowl, for example, even though doing so may have kept wages up for unskilled California farmworkers.</comment>

<comment>Only 4% of immigrants work in agriculture, and the contribution of field labor to the shelf-price of food, is very, very small, and the poor don't tend to buy single family housing.  (By the way, does anyone else remember when construction was a well-paying middle class job?  Gosh, I wonder what happened?)As to your second point, the only duty of a nation state is to the interests of its citizens.</comment>

<comment>This is just nonsense....There are plenty of jobs out there!I have friends working 2 or 3 part-time jobs  :)</comment>

<comment>Funny! But seriously, the bigger problem is that it's getting harder and harder to hold two part-time jobs. The problem is that they now schedule you on Friday for the following week. They have fancy software that predicts exactly how many people will be needed in the store, hour by hour, so you get three hours here, five hours there, two hours on Saturday, etc.So say you're working at Retail A and Retail B, and you get your schedules in your mail on a Friday. It's only a matter of a few weeks before your two schedules clash, and you'll have to pick one or the other. That racks you up an absence at one of the two places, and being absent gets you fired.</comment>

<comment>Yup being available to work can be difficult, that is why you get paid.</comment>

<comment>Way to miss the point. If your schedule is M-F 8 to 12 at one place, and M-F 1 to 5 at another place, no problem. But if your schedules are constantly changing, it's not a matter of being available.</comment>

<comment>if it was easy you would get paid even less (or if there were even more workers in the pool you would get paid even less)</comment>

<comment>Too bad you can't make money shorting economic studies.</comment>

<comment>It's a shame about once in a generation or 2 Americans need to be reminded of the benefits of immigration and what role immigration has played and continues to play in America's success.This isn't news and there are dozens of credible economic studies that disprove the populist hyperbole about immigration but for some reason this gets lost every couple of decades.</comment>

<comment>This county no longer needs mass low-skilled immigration.  Immigration should be based on merit, as it is for every other developed nation on the planet.  Doctors, nurses, and engineers should take precedence over Mexican landscapers.</comment>

<comment>No, now the US needs millions of working age immigrants a year to keep the demographic balance which has become lopsided as the US population gets older and have less children.</comment>

<comment>We should seek to stabilize our population at no more than 300M.  On a planet with limited resources, and at a time when all are justifiably concerned with AGW, there is no reason that we need to continue to have an explosive growth rate.And even if I agreed with you that we needed to continue growing our population, let's do that with well-educated Europeans and Asians, instead of poorly educated Africans and Latin Americans.</comment>

<comment>Why?You are making arbitrary targets without reasoning.  There are population shortfalls in dozens of US cities and locations that is leading to serious problems with maintaining infrastructure, local debt and shrinking tax bases.Look, you want to repeat populist hyperbole - that's on you but the economics of America's demographic issues as they relate to Social Security, tax burdens, tax bases and economic growth are really clear and absent ethnic bias that clouds these discussions with feelings over the empirical data.</comment>

<comment>"There are population shortfalls in dozens of US cities and locations that is leading to serious problems with maintaining infrastructure, local debt and shrinking tax bases."Then the people in those cities (e.g., Detroit), should move.</comment>

<comment>...that's the problem actually, which you don't seem to get.</comment>

<comment>No we do not.  If we really needed more low skill workers we could simply scale back welfare and there they would be, ready to work for peanuts just like the immigrants.What we actually need is less of them, to drive up wages.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, but the data and demographics of the situation tells a very different story than you're trying to make.</comment>

<comment>Feel free to provide some.  Until then you are just a crazy person claiming that we need millions of new poor people per year.</comment>

<comment>He's right. Low-skill Hispanic immigrants, as a group, don't ever catch up. Neither do their children.  Their income, and the level of taxes that they can pay, aren't sufficient to support the level of welfare benefits (social security, medicare, etc), that we expect.Immigration policy as it stands today, is not a panacea for a declining birth rate.  If anything it makes the problem worse by adding to lowest tier of workers.http://www.businessinsider.com...</comment>

<comment>The US has a category of preference that is based on employment criteria:"People who want to become immigrants based on employment or a job offer may apply for permanent residence or an immigrant visa abroad, when an immigrant visa number becomes available according to the following employment based preferences:First Preference: Priority Workers, including aliens with extraordinary abilities, outstanding professors and researchers, and certain multinational executives and managersSecond Preference: Members of professions holding an advanced degree or persons of exceptional ability (including individuals seeking a National Interest Waiver)Third Preference: Skilled Workers, professionals and other qualified workersFourth Preference: Certain special immigrants including those in religious vocationsFifth Preference: Employment creation immigrants (investors or entrepreneurs)"https://www.uscis.gov/green-ca...</comment>

<comment>Several comments suggested that undocumented workers suppress employment in the construction trades, especially in single family house construction.A study of productivity in the construction trades examines this issue since undocumented workers and unreported work would tend to bias estimates of changes in productivity."There is no evidence that employment in construction establishments is suppressed (relative to the population data) when undocumented immigrants become much more plentiful.  In fact, employment in construction establishments tends to increase even more than employment from the well-regarded population survey."http://www.bls.gov/osmr/pdf/ec...</comment>

<comment>All this says is that when there is a spike in housing demand, the demand is accompanied by a spike in employment for illegal aliens, who come and take those jobs.  The better data would be to look at wage growth during periods of heavy home construction.</comment>

<comment>Others have addressed this question.  All wages in construction have been essentially flat and from the study I cited, productivity in single family construction has been declining.  this is data since 1980 including the spike. According to that study, undocumented labor in the constructon industry peaked in 2007  at 13.5% and then declined slightly...P.60)From other evidence, the wages of unionized construction workers is significantly higher than non union workers. So that also is a factor since undocumented workers are not union workers.</comment>

<comment>That's baffle-gab. Later on, in that same document.They believe it's all a misperception because it's only in residential construction and only in the big cities that illegal aliens have taken over jobs. But, come on, that's exactly what we're talking about. We're not talking about the occasional barn Farmer John and his son Bubba raise somewhere in a big square state. We're talking about construction.And to further the muddying of waters, just a bit later, on page 60, they present a chart that shows that illegal aliens have gone from 2.2% of the construction work force in 1987 to 12.8% in 2011. That's a 580% increase!The claim that you can increase the supply of labor with no effect on its price violates a basic law of economics. If someone is going to argue that the case at hand is an exception, they'll need to make a much better argument. Extraordinary claims, after all, require extraordinary evidence.</comment>

<comment>The real problem is that Hispanic immigrants, as a group, never do catch up.  Their relative position hasn't changed since the 1960's.  If they did catch up, we would be in a much better place as a nation.http://www.businessinsider.com...</comment>

<comment>The flow of mostly illiterate non English speaking people without discernible talents but an insatiable appetite for taxpayer funds is what this debate should be about.</comment>

<comment>Nah, there is no such thing. They are all making a horizontal social movement bringing their skills to make this country great because this nation was made by immigrants (omit the need for labor and the general limited education of the day) and their children and this new immigrants will make it even better and who will pay the taxes to pay for all the white people who are aging and who is going to do the hard labor no US-born person would do (for peanuts and bad working conditions) making the economy halt.</comment>

<comment>I haven't read the economists' articles in question, but some general points can be made.  (1) The original Borgas study can be ignored except for its value as a curiosity.  Samples of a few dozen, no matter how careful the matching, cannot tell us anything reliable about an issue like this.  At most it tells us that Card's results appear not to hold for a small selected sample and further research is desirable.  (2)  Typically in research like Card's, such obvious confounds as including everyone above age 16 are controlled by regression type approaches or tested through sensitivity analyses.  Card is a top labor economist, and I would be surprised if he didn't do this.  Perhaps someone who has read his work can comment. (3)  Whatever is true of Florida at a certain point in time may not have been true in Texas then or Florida now.  No matter how well done Card's work is, it's results should not have been and cannot now be taken as resolving the issue of whether large scale immigration costs Americans jobs.  It could be that the Florida economy was at the time growing much faster than the country's and the extra labor was more easily absorbed there than it would have been elsewhere.  It is possible that most immigrant Cubans originally lived with families, which might have meant less need to find immediate work and more financial and network support than other immigrants enjoy. (4)  The effects of legal and illegal immigration need not be the same, nor need either be the same as the effects of legalizing masses of illegal immigrants.  For political reasons, the Cuban migration was exceptional.  They came here illegally but as soon as they touched ground in Florida they were legal.  (5) The question of the effect of immigration, legal and illegal, is an empirical one that can be answered with more and better data and analyses.  The fact that we know little about the answer, is just one result of our country's substantial underinvestment in the social sciences.</comment>

<comment>"The fact that we know little about the answer, is just one result of our country's substantial underinvestment in the social sciences."The "investment" numbers in the trillions of dollars with practically nothing to show for it and do you know why? Because people don't want to learn how to fish as long as you catch it and cook it for them then serve it on a bun like you do. You are the problem. </comment>

<comment>The investment in social science research is hardly in the trillions of dollars.  SBE the major funder if basic research at NSF has never had an annual budget of as much as $300 million and that covers about 20 behavioral and social sciences as well as major science indicator surveys.  The economics program budget, which was the largest budget for any of the behavioral and social sciences, has probably never been above $30 million and when last I looked, about 10 years ago barely touched $20 million.  So it allows for funding maybe one or two studies of immigration and the labor force a year, given all the other issues economists study.  NIH in the last few decades has had considerably more money to devote to the social sciences than NSF, but that has all been related to health issues.  Other mission agencies fund some social science research, with most coming from the military, but much of this is narrowly focused or program evaluation research.  One aircraft carrier probably costs more than all the money devoted to social science research across the federal government during the past decade.  As for. Having nothing to show for it,  I might add that one set of NSF funded studies alone - the studies that paved the way for and then enabled spectrum auctions, has probably returned to the U.S. Treasury more money than the government and private foundations together have devoted to funding social science research since the nation's conception. Another set of studies paved the way for kidney transplants among unrelated donors.   So I think my point 5 still stands.</comment>

<comment>We know all we need to know about the behavior of the permanent underclass. What we really need to know is what to do about people like you that insist on getting in the way of a solution.</comment>

<comment>Please spare the insults, read my comment, and tell me specifically how I get in the way of a solution.  You might add what you think the solution should be since I haven't a clue what you are talking about either with respect to me or with respect to a solution, except that you know nothing about our country's investments in the social sciences.</comment>

<comment>"....me specifically how I get in the way of a solution..." You are one of those guys that wants to study the pile of dog doo on the carpet then study it some more until it becomes a pile of rose petals that can be picked up one by one by one.</comment>

<comment>Adding millions of poor people to America every year will always make us richer. How can anyone dispute that?</comment>

<comment>By adding active high school students of both genders Peri's and Yasenov's study increased the size of the unemployed/underemployed before-immigration group by ~30K - 40K people (based on rough estimation of current Miami high school population).  Relative to the 125,000 new immigrants, 30K a bump to the before unemployed numbers must sqeu the results.</comment>

<comment>Yes, by all means, keep the borders open to low skilled, below average IQ immigrants.  The US will be an impoverished nation by the end of the century.</comment>

<comment>We have a $19 trillion debt.   Some might argue we're already impoverished.</comment>

<comment>Written like a true-blue member of a journalist demographic wrapped in academia's starched white collar - who could not care less what happens to America's blue-collar demographic.   Let them eat cake...</comment>

<comment>It is impossible for liberals to acknowledge the truth on immigration because it is such a boon to their electoral chances.  They would rather hundreds of women be raped in one night than slow down immigration.</comment>

<comment>David Card's original study of wages in Miami in 1980 to 1984 versus several other American cities assumes that all else was equal in those cities except for the Mariel Boatlift. But, just from watching movies and television -- e.g., 1983's "Scarface," 1984's "Miami Vice," and the current period piece "Narcos -- people should be aware that Miami's economy in 1980-1984 was enjoying one of the biggest cocaine importation booms in history.For example, here's the late Glenn Frey's 1985 music video "Smuggler's Blues" that vividly depicts why all else wasn't equal economically in Miami in 1980-84:https://vimeo.com/58719183</comment>

<comment>Here's a segment from the new Netflix miniseries about Colombian cocaine overlord Pablo Escobar, "Narcos," with an American DEA agent narrating what changed in Miami's economy from the 1970s to the 1980s:https://youtu.be/WRFzeFw_9kg?t...All else besides the Mariel boatlift was definitely not equal in Miami before and after 1980. The Mariel boatlift of 1980 coincided with a huge increase in cocaine imports flowing through South Florida.</comment>

<comment>There's an interesting addition to this story. The Wall Street Journal posted a commentary regarding this issue on January 18th at http://www.wsj.com/articles/ne... . It was written by Giovanni Peri and Vasil Yasenov and discusses their critique of the paper by George Borjas but makes no reference to Borjas' response to that critique which was posted on NBER on January 11th. If you google "George Borjas Mariel boatlift" (without the quotes) for the past week, the first three items refer to this response. If Peri and Yasenov were aware of Borjas' response, then the commentary was extremely dishonest. In any event, the Wall Street Journal was very sloppy in not checking to see if Borjas had already written or currently had a response. They should immediately remedy the situation by adding a very clear comment and link to the Borjas response at the beginning and end of the commentary. Of course, Peri and Yasenov can always write their own response to the Borjas response. However, the Wall Street Journal should add a reference to the Borjas response immediately.</comment>

<comment>Evidence that immigration does lower native wages: http://posnetres.blogspot.co.u...</comment>

<comment>What these studies prove is that social "science" is for the most part a politically motivated collection of opinions and drivel wrapped around statistics and simplifications. You can prove anything you want with even some quite compelling logic as long as you restrict what data is considered applicable to the subject at hand.The last 30 years of our open borders policies and what it has done to the wages of working Americans is all anybody who hasn't spent all his time in academia needs to know.</comment>

<comment>I also wonder how many native-born citizens would take the jobs the low-paid immigrants do, even at higher wages. Dishwasher, roofer, digging trenches for the cable companies, etc. And good luck finding any food in the grocery that required hand-harvesting if the immigrant population disappeared. Or pay $25 a pound for strawberries. Maybe an increase in the minimum wage would encourage workers, but there's a lot of push-back on that as well. Meanwhile the "disabled" population has exploded. We called that malingering in the Army. It could land you in the stockade.</comment>

<comment>Gees nobody ever heard that one before. Well Einstein who did those jobs before we had all these Mexicans?</comment>

<comment>Today I heard David Frum on an intelligence squared debate aguing against the motion "THE U.S. SHOULD LET IN 100,000 SYRIAN REFUGEES"I have to say that he dominated the debate, despite being paired with a weak partner.   The comic relief was the whiny and melodramatic Robert Ford, who was arguing for the motion.  How that man ever became a US ambassador is beyond perplexing.  At one point during the debate while he went off on a tangent about how the Syrian government was personally persecuting him he literally began yelling at the moderator about not being done speaking yet and got his mic shut off.</comment>

<comment>If most of the immigrants were conservative Republicans you can bet that the Democrats would be down on the border building a wall faster than a teamster on meth. </comment>

<comment>This article is just a smoke screen. Yes there is a minority of employers that think they can benefit from off the book employees that can be cheated and abused. We only have a enough jobs for half our the population. This article doesn't examine the cost of having immigrants. Each person living in this country uses resources, water, food, clothing, electricity, gas medical care. What they can't buy (because they are receiving starvation wages) is either given to them through charities or stolen. What percentage of the illegal immigrants become part of the homeless problem? What percentage of the women and children, illegal immigrants, become victims of white slavery and other violence? For every business that is helped by immigrants 10 to a 100 other businesses are hurt by illegals.  Lets take care of the people living here now before we let others in.</comment>

<comment>How many Americans are dishwashers? Landscapers? Janitors? Car Washers?  Fast Food Workers? Construction - Manual Labor?  Painters?Apart from migrant field workers, farm and produce workers, Immigration is ruining our country.These are supposed to be entry level jobs for teenagers and high school graduates, not careers for low skill legal and illegal aliens.Another factor this study ignores, American convicted felons.  They can't even flip burgers or wash cars when released - where do you think they return to?They lower our standard of living.  They depress wages.  They use more public services and aid then the taxes they pay.I have friend's with Associate's Degree that compete with state college graduates to work at Target.No matter how your crunch the numbers, importing low skilled workers permanently and allowing them to be eligible for state and federal benefits will be the death of our country.</comment>

<comment>The theories and/or conclusions reached by the Mariel boat-lift example are flawed.  The Miami situation was very unique and hard to duplicate.The main reason this mass influx of immigrant labor worked in South Florida was the fact that many or most of these new immigrants got jobs working for the thousands of South Florida businesses already owned, operated, or managed by Cuban Americans. Most of these were service businesses that needed low-skilled labor. In addition, most Miami Cubans living in Miami at the time were patriotic, conservative, Republican leaning people who gladly assimilated into America, bringing the best parts of their culture while blending into American society. Like Marco Rubio or not, when he tells the story of his parents, he is telling the story of almost all Miami Cubans of the the 50's through the 80's.This fact is part of what makes Cubans very different from other groups of recent Hispanic immigrants, particularly those from Mexico, South, and Central America) who (despite their hard working nature) tend to lean liberal and who came to this country in full realization (and often, in anticipation) of the government benefits afforded to immigrants, even illegal immigrants.The Miami-Cubans of the 50's through the 80's (as well as the Haitians, Jamaicans, and other Caribbean transplants) were very industrious, and more likely to work 2 and 3 jobs than to take government assistance. They came to this country for a better life by getting better work, and thoughts of applying for government assistance rarely, if ever, entered their minds.In the 1980's, the existing Miami Cubans acted like a community-wide mentoring group to the Marielitos, and while helping them find jobs, also helped them to learn the English language and to assimilate. Unless all the details of the Miami example exist in a particular region, assimilation is far less likely to happen.</comment>
