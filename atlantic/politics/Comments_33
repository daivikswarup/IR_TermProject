<comment>Fascinating, not least because many of these are consistent to some internal logic.Still, I think Jon Stewart effectively summarized Trump's appeal: he's America's id.</comment>

<comment>I can see that. Everyone wants to be a victim, straight white wealthy men just as much as anyone else. Trump allows them to be a victim, to be pushed upon and oppressed by society. I suppose it's inevitable. America love san underdog, so you start sincerely believing you're an underdog. Trump lets you feed that delusion.</comment>

<comment>I doubt Trump supporters are wealthy.  Most of those people already rented one of the other candidates.</comment>

<comment>Upper-middle class, not Koch-rich. The profile of the typical TPer was upper middle class.</comment>

<comment>"Remember when democrats actually cared about the working class? And not just the slave labor welfare class?"Teaparty stupidity on Aisle 1. Dem leaders don't really care about the working class, but it's not like the GOP or Teapartiers or Trump offer a better alternative. The "slave labor" is a little strong, but the "welfare" hearkens back to the glorious @EWErickson/@KEder/@jstrevino #IAmThe53 plan that helped cost Romney the election.You can't make a silk purse, etc. Likewise, you aren't going to get pro-American ideas from anti-American people that are attracted to the Teaparties.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats want open borders, and don't care what that does to the employment and wages of American citizens. The GOP pretends to care about illegal immigration, but does nothing, in obedience to the Chamber of Commerce.Trump alone is addressing the issue of illegal immigration. When the "respectable" politicians refuse to tackle a pressing issue, voters will turn to other politicians who promise to do something.</comment>

<comment>Even if that something is utterly ridiculous and non-viable, I guess.</comment>

<comment>So, having a country is ridiculous and non-viable?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, because that's what I'm talking about.  SMH</comment>

<comment>Call me completely innocent, Young R, .............. but, .....'having' a country' ..... or 'having a Cloud Cuckoo Land vision of a 'past land' when the REAL world has moved on, somewhat', Young R?i humbly ........ ponder!</comment>

<comment>You know, azt24, we've been opposing illegal immigration your way for years and it's never worked. Isn't it time to try doing things in smarter ways?Start by pointing out that Dem *leaders* want *loose*, not open borders. Then, realize that a good part of the Dem base doesn't want that or shouldn't want that. And, use that to undercut Dem leaders to the Dem base. That's a smart thing people like you can do but your partisan hackery (among other issues) gets in the way.Trump is in fact addressing the issue. So too could Bozo or Carrot Top. What we need is someone to address the issue in the right way. Trump has proposed lots of things, but given that his audience is much dumber and much, much crazier than his opponents, he won't be able to get hardly anything on his list.One option is to make @MLP_Officiel think she's an American politician. A more realistic option is to change Trump to be better. Considering that his base is too dumb and crazy to make him better, that's going to be difficult.</comment>

<comment>So, you didn't read the article?</comment>

<comment>And building a multi billion dollar boondoggle wall has been proven to halt illegal immigration . . . .oh wait . . .</comment>

<comment>The wall in East Germany worked well for keeping people in  so hopefully it is not a shock that it would work keeping people out.</comment>

<comment>That was a very short wall erected by a totalitarian government.</comment>

<comment>Right, the Berlin Wall worked soooooo well it's still around today!..........Ohh, wait, it failed too. Most historians consider the separation of Germany to be a complete failure. Got any other historical examples inyouri?</comment>

<comment>That's why deportation alone doesn't work and a wall costing billions isn't completely effective. We have to look at Ted Cruz' plan. Combine deportation with ENFORCEMENT of Federal laws regarding immigration. Strengthen Federal law to discourage illegal immigration. Put more people along the border to stop illegal immigration.</comment>

<comment>Cruz has addressed illegal immigration and his deportation process doesn't include letting them back in as citizens in an expedited manner.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but Trump uses violent language and encourages hate. That's why azt24 loves him so.</comment>

<comment>Fool, the tea party is the most American segment of our society.  A lieberal hears the term tea party and gets in a full bore panic run</comment>

<comment>"Ronald W. Mann": you illustrate why TPers must be opposed. Your comment is nothing but a smear and a false statement. Instead of attempting to understand my opposition to TPers, you just lie and smear. If virtually every TP I've run into hadn't done the same, then perhaps my opinion of them would be slightly better.Except, of course, for the fact the TPers are the *least* American segment of our society. They're traitors in all but the legal sense. They've shown time and time again a willingness to turn their backs on their fellow Americans, whether disabled vets or Californians. They're the people who've threatened to "go Galt". The only reason they're the biggest anti-American group is because there aren't too many terrorists and RCP members in the U.S.To top it all, I've been trying for years to get TPers to help with my smart plans to stop amnesty, with no luck. Instead, they've done stupid things that have helped Obama.For the facts on their anti-American movement, see 24ahead.com/s/tea-parties</comment>

<comment>No, they cringe because they know they're about to be smothered by a massive ego with no actual substance behind the massive sack of buzzwords they carry around.  And because they think they're being clever when they adopt cute little phrases like "lieberal"I've yet to see any signs of actual patriotism in a tea party supporter.  Generally it seems to be rampant self-interest.</comment>

<comment>The term lieberals just represents what liberals are.  I am certainly not rich or driven by what I can steal from others.  I have worked all my life, have my own business in which I am currently involved.  Just how do you define patriotism.  By how much you can steal from others to enrich yourself?</comment>

<comment>Your suggesting that all, or a sizable fraction, of liberals frequently steal from America? I am liberal and I don't steal, so you just made that up.</comment>

<comment>You are totally correct yet when I point out that America is a racist country, people call me a liar.You can't have a Tea Party America that isn't a Racist America.</comment>

<comment>We have the most racist America I history with the black Jim Crowe In the White House</comment>

<comment>Most racist in history, huh? More racist than during slavery? More racist than during Jim Crow? More racist than when black people couldn't vote?You are truly the perfect voice of the Tea Party - stunningly ignorant of history and unrepentantly racist.</comment>

<comment>Just listen to yourself, your whole life evolves around racism, it is your sole reason for existing.  I know who I am, really don't need little people like you defining me.  Your guilt will follow you to your grave, truly sorry for worms like you</comment>

<comment>Actually my whole reason for existence is composing music.You're all projection and no reflection, Donnie.</comment>

<comment>hahahaha</comment>

<comment>Are there racists hiding under your bed ?</comment>

<comment>It took you six months to think that one up, Larry?</comment>

<comment>Nah, I must have swiped it from a liberal, who likely plagiarized a conservative.</comment>

<comment>"Black Jim Crow". Bet you think that's real smart. We should make decals with that. Right wing brain farts on aisle 3.</comment>

<comment>And there it is. Where's your white hood and swastika Ron? Better get your lynchin rope and 12 gauge ready for the coming "race war!" You old white people are amusing lol.</comment>

<comment>So are you voting for the Latinos? Ben Carson? Because the left is old and white.... If you didn't realize already</comment>

<comment>I can't for the life of me understand why liberals wouldn't want to preserve our country for their children!</comment>

<comment>Because when they got their abortions their children were all dismembered and their body parts sold to the highest bidder. Hey- it’s not slavery!!</comment>

<comment>Funny, I see nothing anti American about the Tea Party. Of course, it doesn't really exist. </comment>

<comment>Nothing is so American as astro-turf.</comment>

<comment>STOP!!!  STOP IT EVERYBODY!!!  I understand that this is politics & it's pretty hard to get along, but we all agree on the same things!  America sucks right now - agreed?  We need to start showing a few people like radical Islam just really WHO is in charge - agreed?  Our military needs to start kicking ass & taking names while they multiply by about 5000 - agreed?  We need a proper tax system - agreed?  We need to stop shaming actual heroes and pray we're given more - right?  We need to do a LOT of vacuuming in Congress and the Senate - agreed?  We ALL EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US, know we need to get off our big butts and stop complaining and fighting and START VOTING AND MAKING EVERYONE AROUND US VOTE, that we know we are in desperate times and since the so & so's in the state capitals aren't doing it and the losers in Washington aren't doing it, then we have to vote in people who will!!!Agreed?  Surely you must at least basically agree with me.I'm a college graduate.  I actually worked for a Senator in Calif and I learned so much from her.  She's gone now and I've no idea what she'd say about any of the candidates.  Doesn't matter.  I was complaining to her about something once and instead of saying I'll fix that or I'll look into it - as I surely expected her to, she told me to get off my butt, stop whining, get along and work together to get it done!  And I sucked it up and I did.  We can't afford petty arguing.  We're half sunk and 10 miles from shore so with Trump or Sanders or Kermit the Frog, we all are in for some long hard work.  You both sound so incredibly intelligent!! Certainly smarter than me.  Why don't you suck it up, put your heads together, and keep America from drowning?  Or at least try.  And then go back to fighting.  Truly, no disrespect to anybody.  Eyes on the horizon.  Or shore in this case.  AND VOTE EVERYBODY VOTE VOTE !!!!!</comment>

<comment>Nancy, please contact some ACTUAL military commanders. There is a very good reason were not doing a major ground offensive. You can't bomb an ideology away, Bush tried to in Iraq. Most of ISIS's central command is made up of exiled Iraq commanders who were loyal to Saddam Hussein's army. We ironically got ourselves into this mess by creating ISIS, thanks to Cheney's boys, the CIA, and groups like the Carlyle Group. Our government has been taken over by big money, and Obama doesn't know how to clean up the 7 countries in 5 years plan. https://www.youtube.com/watch?... So we have only ourselves to blame, and you better believe Trump won't solve or change any of this.</comment>

<comment>Sleek, please contact real military officers.  Not a single one would support Obama or that traitor Hillary Clinton who put military lives in danger with her glib compromise of classified material.</comment>

<comment>In a perfect world, but it’s not perfect and a large portion of our population will vote for entitlements and a large portion will vote to preserve their life styles.  Each side is fighting to win! Trump is the only candidate who isn't a card carrying member of a party so there is at least a tiny glimmer of hope that he will be different...</comment>

<comment>The Teaparty leader types make enough to put them in the upper-middle-class territory. However, the TPers attracted a lot of useful idiots living in Tuscaloose trailers. Their objection to the elites etc. is cultural, but they had a strange way of showing it: not by standing in solidarity with fellow whites but by standing in solidarity with those who wouldn't have them over for dinner no matter what. TPers are truly stupid, deranged people suffering from full-blown Dunning-Kruger. Now, many of them are Trump fans.We need an opposition to the elites, and it would be possible to keep the elites in their place. However, we won't do it with the Teapartiers or Trump. See 24ahead.com/n/12094 for the problems with the "policy" paper he released on Sunday.</comment>

<comment>"TPers are truly stupid, deranged people suffering from full-blown Dunning-Kruger."You can stuff your insults where the sun don't shine. What condescending bullcrap. Even the NYT, who eagerly tried to confirm this same bias (because conservatives have to be stupid, every liberal knows that), had to admit that TPers were simply GOP voters, if anything rather better educated than most.</comment>

<comment>I've been in hundreds of online conversations with TPers in comments and on Twitter. I have yet to meet one who isn't a vile idiot.Prove me wrong: show me a smart TPer doing something smart (not Cruz or one of the other charlatans).</comment>

<comment>That's been my experience too. What's more, we're all told over and over how "The Tea Party isn't racist!!" but you can go on ANY TP page on Facebook and hear the most vile racist bilge against Obama...and nobody ever stepping in to say "whoa amigo, that's out of line, you might want to dial it back some"Show me otherwise, please. Make me believe.</comment>

<comment>Comments about Prez zero are not based on race but on his incompetence.  He has failed on everything he has tried, nothing works but he keeps riding along on his unicorn talking about how great he is</comment>

<comment>If failure consists of a recovering economy and an end to two wars, getting Osama, opening relations with Cuba and Iran along with a huge improvement in healthcare you are absolutely correct sir.</comment>

<comment>So you do understand, not one of those is even close to complete and failing day by day.  Prez zero legacy=failure</comment>

<comment>Lols. No defense to back up your words and when someone can list a handfull of things you're completely wrong about, you just respond with more ignorance and nothing to back it up.Another fat, uneducated middle management looking idiot that thinks he knows how the world works. These baby boomers need to die out.</comment>

<comment>At least we produced something for you to waste</comment>

<comment>It's not producing something to steal from what was already established, destroying it progressively and leaving the pieces for the following generation to try to put back together, all while continuing to be the largest driving force in the denial of civil rights and scientific fact and progression.Without the boomers the amount of crazy idiots, tea party rejects and other fat uneducated dumbasses would be cut so slim, things could actually become serious again and we wouldn't have a circus act like trump and hilary dominating out political media.The best thing you can do is die before you start leaching money out of SS along with the other millions of boomers.</comment>

<comment>Well we do know that lieberals like you do not pay into SS out of your welfare so you don't have much to say about that.  If we had another "progressive" 7 years like the last the destruction and bankruptcy of the country would be complete, which is the ultimate goal of progressives</comment>

<comment>Silly.  I worked over 40 years, saved and invested and now get SS and Medicare.  Obama's election was a watershed moment.  Actually he is liked around the world.  I also voted for George W., and always support the President.  And I think generally things are pretty good here.  Need to eventually lower debt.  Influx of illegal immigrants is at a historical low.</comment>

<comment>All of your comments are unfounded. You cannot make these claims when they are all false and ignore fact. The world does not like Obama. Illegal immigration is not at a historical low. Don't just google the positives about a given stance you take,  you need to research the opposing opinions as well, then use critical thinking to come to the conclusion of the truth based on the perceived bias of the authors who are trying to tell you what to think.</comment>

<comment>You must not live  near any sanctuary cities where streets are flooded in the mornings with migrant workers waiting to be picked up by someone who wants off the books labor</comment>

<comment>Your idea on what exactly Social security is about is completely bass ackward. The boomers have paid into Social Security their whole working lives as it was intended to be a means for people to have money after retiring, or in case of disability (SSD). It IS NOT leaching off of SS when the money they paid in is THEIRS to draw on!</comment>

<comment>Social Security is a Ponzi scheme that if tried in the private sector would get a private insurer a long prison term. It worked in the beginning when there were more workers than retirees because the WWII generation had lots of babies(hence the baby boomers). The problem is that those boomers pushed for abortion and had many abortions and their Gen X'er children had even more. Now those boomers are retiring and expecting that money to be there but not realising that the potential millions of worker offspring that they would need one day are not there to support them because they were killed off before they ever had a shot. Those boomers were paying for their own parents with their contributions to SS. They aborted their own future income and now the leftist Ponzi scheme is upside down and unsustainable all because they were sold a lie. The importation of low wage peasants will not save them nor will their grandchildren, the androgynous and childless millennial socialists. The money that was "theirs" is long gone and the ones that were supposed to sustain it already have their own hands out for government largesse(no doubt paid in part by taxes raised on property owning baby boomers). Irony. Death panels may not be too far away. Maybe it can become a truly liberal utopia ala Logan's Run.</comment>

<comment>give it time, you'll grow up someday.</comment>

<comment>First: Iran is a terrorist state. They openly say they will destroy America and Israel. It is not intelligent to give such people what they need to destroy you. Second: Cuba is a fascist government run by Castro a merciless dictator. Lastly, even liberals and democrats are now saying that Obamacare is a wreck as written. So many smaller medical facilities and businesses have had to shut down because of the extra strain on their particular economies that it is ignorant to call it any sort of a win.. Healthcare prices have gone up, healthcare insurance prices have gone up. The results of Obamacare anathema to the free market United States of American envisioned by our forefathers. Small businesses being stifled by the government is an affront to the idea that the American Dream can allow anyone to build a business. It protects big established businesses because they can weather the storm, and, as we see in many cases, they can avoid some of the regulations by hiring a bunch of part time employees instead. That is something small business owners couldn't get away with.</comment>

<comment>Obama himself today said the economy is hungover, and my health care is so great now I have to pay a huge deductible and get less covergae</comment>

<comment>I've seen it myself, over and over and over, but apparently I'm just making it up to make TPers look bad, right?</comment>

<comment>You can't convince someone who is so utterly convinced of the opposite. Not all Tea Party folks are vile. Not all Trump people are vile. It's a very dangerous game to play to lump all people in any given organization as merely mechanically reproduced replicas of one another. People in any group are as diverse, ranging from vile and rude to compassionate and patient and mentally slow to brilliant. Saying otherwise simply proves your bias is so strong that your mind cannot be changed.</comment>

<comment>Has there ever been a Tea Party sign spelled correctly?</comment>

<comment>You sound like a vile idiot.  Therefore anyone who recognizes your ignorance you label a vile idiot...</comment>

<comment>"Disappointed" (/disqus_DJQpaKLWVg/): Thank you for a much-belated illustration of what I'm talking about.Maybe you can give us a follow-up illustration of how you're a vile idiot? My signature issue is opposing amnesty and I have the only realistic action plan that will stop it. Will you help with that plan? If not, what realistic action plan to stop amnesty do you suggest as an alternative?</comment>

<comment>When Ted Cruz, Michelle Bachman, and Allen West are "tea party leaders" than yes this is a movement full of idiots.</comment>

<comment>We fart in your general direction.</comment>

<comment>Hah! I'm always amused at self-righteous pseudo-intellectual left-wing trash who comment on anyone else's intelligence, especially when they barely rate retard on the scale themselves.Excellent job illustrating Haidt's point.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for illustrating my point. You don't have the integrity to admit that I'm not really "left-wing" nor to admit that I've been opposing amnesty for over a decade. Instead, you just launch right in to smears. That's all TPers have: they're incapable of engaging in valid argumentation. They have to be fought on that alone, not to mention all the other ways they're horrible for the USA.</comment>

<comment>Lols. These idiots sure love to throw around catch phrases and non-facts. 'OBURMA IS BAD, LEFT WANGS ER STUPID, KAY?' It's like you have a phrasebook written by retarded, racist children that you're pulling from.</comment>

<comment>Tea Partiers are NOT Trump fans.  Loons are Trump fans.Tea Partiers - whom you totally mischaracterize - are Cruz fans.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you have the facts to back that up. My belief is that Cruz/Carson/Crazy Uncle Joe are suffering at the hands of Trump. I highly doubt that Trump has gained support from those who hadn't previously been supporting some other candidate. But, if you have facts to show otherwise then let us know.</comment>

<comment>And there you fail again in your arrogance. Read some of the comments - a surprising range of people support Trump. You don;t have to be a loon to make a mistake - if, indeed, it is a mistake.</comment>

<comment>Ronald Reagan said it best when he said that liberals know so much that "isn't so". If you knew what the "TEA" in Tea Party meant you'd know that they are not actually a "Party" but rather a tax revolt movement. You are mistaken if you think that, like leftist's, they are driven by class envy or the racism of identity politics. They really don't care about how much money the 1% have or that a black man is President. What they feel is that they are Taxed Enough Already(TEA) and that our government is out of control with spending and usurped powers. They simply want less taxation, a smaller government and more freedom. The ones that despise them are those that either feed at the government trough, believe that the government's role is to "fix" everything, or are envious and grievance driven. It takes a simple mind to paint them as "racist" in a false belief that thrusting that cannard upon them still has any meaning and no resemblance to the truth. The only thing that it accomplishes is to reveal that those that make that claim are mostly anti-white racists and lily white guilt ridden libtards. The reality is that a broad swath of Americans support the TEA "party" ideals when not filtered through the misrepresentations, lies of omission and outright lies of the leftists Government-Media-Complex. This is why we have the ascension of the Trump candidacy. He has tapped into that. You can falsely claim that his support comes merely from "stupid racists" but when he takes upwards of 20% of the black vote in November(which he may just do) along with many democrats that won't vote for that lying hag or that commie crypt keeper, he will win in a landslide.</comment>

<comment>LOL. Everything I've been saying about them wrapped up in one comment. Here are >220 posts since 2009 detailing why they're a bogus group that's horrible for the U.S.:24ahead.com/s/tea-partiesAmericans have soundly rejected Teaparty ideas, and even more would do so if they knew what they were actually about.</comment>

<comment>"Gee it's almost like American culture has an unhealthy fixation on glorifying victimhood and martyrdom!"The accuracy of your comment is demonstrated by the reply posted by DeShawn Biggims, which was, "Unless they're white and working class. Then you're a target. "The sickness runs deep. Woe is us.</comment>

<comment>But Trump doesn't offer victimhood, but being a winner! Let America win again! is his motto.It's the liberals who play point-scoring about who can be the most worthy victim.</comment>

<comment>Trump's whining about Megyn Kelly being on her period because she asked him slightly-less-than-softball questions is just one of many examples of his victimhood.</comment>

<comment>I didn't hear it as whining, and I don't believe there was any reference to her period. Trump was just proceeding according to his motto, 'nobody hurts me unharmed.' Megyn Kelly attacked him with some rather nasty gotcha questions, so he attacked back.</comment>

<comment>If you think any of the questions asked of any of the candidates in that debate were "gotcha" or hardball in any form, you're delusional.  Which I already know, because it's you.</comment>

<comment>There are ways and ways to ask questions, and Megyn singled Trump out. It's a political rule that candidates are just supposed to smile and take it even when the journos get nasty. But Trump doesn't play by those rules.</comment>

<comment>Yes, reading statements that you have made and asking if you stand by them really is hitting below the belt... [rolls eyes]</comment>

<comment>If someone had asked Obama hard personal questions in 08 or 12, you would have been f*ckin overjoyed. If Trump thinks that he's been treated rough so far, he's got no idea what it's going to be like when the oppo research really gets to work on him. You are so transparently partisan, all the time, that you're laughable.</comment>

<comment>And that's a quality you want in the leader of the free world?  Someone who can't let an insult or an attack (not that he was either insulted or attacked) roll off their back and move on with dignity?</comment>

<comment>"...bleeding from her ..wherever..." in not a reference to being on her period?  WTF is it then?  Further, if "let America win again" is his motto, doesn't that imply that America is losers now?</comment>

<comment>Trump flat out stated that America loses all the time in his campaign launch speech.</comment>

<comment>"I didn't hear it as whining, and I don't believe there was any reference to her period"My point proven, thanks.</comment>

<comment>You're so angry you've got blood coming out of your eyes...coming out of your, uh, wherever.tell me the last time you ever heard anyone say that in conversation.</comment>

<comment>Indeed - the biggest victim gets to be the biggest bully.</comment>

<comment>As an upper middle class white guy who was raised in the south by lower middle class white people, I can tell you that there are a lot of us who are pretty privileged, yet feel like victims.  In some way we are.  It's not that we're underdogs, it's that we're losing some of our privilege. It's a loss of power.  There's a reason many people idealize the 50s.  It was a pretty great time to be male and white.  As things begin to balance out a little (and I mean just a little.  It's still pretty great to be male and white), a lot of people feel insecure.</comment>

<comment>Do you think that as women and minorities balance the scales a bit, white people will inevitably lose? That people of different races/genders will never see themselves as being on the same side?The goal of Democrats is, essentially, to return America to the glory years of the postwar boom, but women and minorities can play an equal part.</comment>

<comment>I think that being firmly planted at the top feels good and being not so firmly planted at the top feels precarious.  That's why we see so much outrage and perceived victimization among upper middle class whites, especially those who are older and male.They're used to having a certain amount of social power and status.  Now they see it threatened by those whom they've always subconsciously (or consciously) thought of as inferior to them.  And a lot of these guys worked their asses off to get where they are.  A lot of them started from the bottom.  So when they see a woman or a minority complaining about injustice, they think about all of the injustices they personally faced and they think that the only reason women and minorities are catching up is because of special treatment.  The thing is, I don't think they realize that those injustices typically aren't equal.  Women and minorities (and, heaven forbid, women minorities) have to work even harder to get ahead.All of this is kind of a long way of saying that, yes, as women and minorities begin to catch up, white men will lose some of their power and status.</comment>

<comment>Ordinary working people were never "planted at the top". But they used to feel that they lived in a country with laws, not at the whim of the ruling elite. They don't feel that way anymore.</comment>

<comment>Women and minorities are part of the mix (Any expansion of the labor supply hurts members of the existing supply), but the story is bigger than that.  There is less opportunity to be had all around, before you even consider the new competition.You also have to keep in mind that there are very real challenges to 'manhood' as it related to society.Most of the jobs that have been eliminated or moved over the years have been 'manly' (lots of physical labor) jobs.  Educationally, the gap between men and women has become staggering: In recent years, 20% more women have been graduating than men with 4-year degrees.  We constantly hear about violent crimes against women, even though men are far and away more likely to be victims.  We talk about abusive policing and the travesty of our criminal justice system, but often fail to mention that there are more than 10 times as many men incarcerated as women, and that men get longer sentences for the same crimes, even controlling for prior records.None of this is to say that men are 'victims'- just that their issues are largely irrelevant to public perception, even though they are in fact vital to society at large.  It's easy to get bitter or defensive when you only ever hear about how bad other groups have it, even as you're personally struggling your ass off.Bottom line, the path to advancement is missing for too many, be they black, white, gay, straight, male, or female...  So long as that is the case, there will be strife and pushback from different segments as they perceive others to be getting a better deal than them, whether they are or not.</comment>

<comment>The libertarian will always say the world getting better is impossible, because while normal people see it as a paradise. The libertairan being a foreign creatures sees it as a nightmare.</comment>

<comment>Look the fact you fail at reading comprehension libertarian is the failure of your parents.</comment>

<comment>While I'll be the first to admit that my parents were far less than stellar, I've managed to score highly on reading comprehension in spite of that hurdle.  I suspect your grammar scores were somewhat lackluster, though.Just to round this chain of crap out, let me take a stab at what you seem to have been trying to say:You are implying that, because I am a libertarian, I don't think the world can get better.In fact, I think the world , on average, always gets better.  It will just require some new thought, which I don't see on either major party's stage at this moment in time.</comment>

<comment>Yeah Will you just don't like it when people call out your shallow libertarianism.</comment>

<comment>Rather, I'm mildly annoyed when someone wastes as much bandwidth as you have being busy not having a point.</comment>

<comment>Oh I do, you libertarian deliberate ignore and shoot down solutions because they do not fit your rather narrow idiocy.</comment>

<comment>I shoot down solutions I believe to be unworkable.  I quite often propose alternatives.  Please, though, continue stereotyping me based on your preconceived notions, rather than on my words or actions.  It's almost as productive as starting off sentences with "You black people" or "You immigrants".</comment>

<comment>Ah Yes libertarians are a race now you're saying, lol.</comment>

<comment>So, dealing in stereotypes rather than with individuals is desirable so long as they're not racial in origin?You do realize, that you've not actually espoused any solutions or ideas in this entire 'conversation', right?  Do you have an actual problem with something I've said, or do you disagree with me simply on the basis of the straw man of me that you've built in your head?</comment>

<comment>Of course I do, you completely out of hand dismissed peoples solution's libertarian, without offering a counterpoint. Because you cannot  for libertarianism at its core cannot think beyond; deregulate everything, and get rid of taxes.  Also if you fit the stereotype you might want to do some introspection.</comment>

<comment>Wow...  You are amazingly dense.  I was agreeing with the person I quoted.  And you were talking about reading comprehension!  Oh man, is this priceless.  It's also amazing how stunningly out of touch you are with my policy beliefs.  Well, not really, since all you have to work with are the laughably caricatured stereotypes you carry around in that impenetrable head.</comment>

<comment>Yep another lie. YOu know what kind of creatures cannot cease lying libertarian? Also going to whine more about me bieng racist against libertarians?</comment>

<comment>Your arguments don't rise to the sad level of logic and consistency found even in racism, so no.</comment>

<comment>Hey your the one who compared people not liking libertarians to racism.</comment>

<comment>Not liking a group of people by default because of  your  caricatures of their beliefs is as stupid as racism.</comment>

<comment>Well when that actually is your beliefs, its just me making an accurate assessment of you.</comment>

<comment>It's no "like racism."  It is racism.</comment>

<comment>hahahahahaha</comment>

<comment>Dude, don't feed the troll. lol</comment>

<comment>You have the grammatical skills of an angry eight year old. General people reading your comments can't tell what you're trying to convey much less the person you're arguing with.</comment>

<comment>Oh another angry libertarian.</comment>

<comment>Is that what you told your English teacher when she was telling you that you'll be retaking fourth grade for another year because you failed her class again? Did you just learn the word libertarian and think it means 'people that tell me I'm stupid'? Please, sit  and try to use your mind, and your ability to communicate as a human being to tell me specifically how it makes me libertarian to tell you, that your sentences are illegible gibberish.</comment>

<comment>Yep that libertarian is really angry.</comment>

<comment>Poor baby. :< Hurt his brain trying to read whole paragraphs.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I'll say you're angry. Now that you're reverting to your typical form.</comment>

<comment>Lol. I've been making fun of you the whole time. I'm pretty sure you're just retarded. There seems to be some major comprehension issues going on.</comment>

<comment>The goal of the Democrats is to pursue an endless series of Utopian plans where more and government is always needed to distribute "fairness", which not-so-incidentally always involves more government power and more people dependent on government to live (and more money and power for the ruling elite). It's your ultimate self-licking ice cream cone.</comment>

<comment>Democrats want to use the government to power.   They are fooling you...</comment>

<comment>It's an impossible dream.  Just adding women to the workforce (when we're shedding 'per capita' jobs) means that the relative labor supply is up 30-45%, even as the relative need for labor is down.(When I refer to 'relative labor', I mean that, while there might be more people in the workforce than in 1950, there are less people working per unit of GDP, or likely, per capita.)</comment>

<comment>It could be that it was a temporary bump. It seems like the economy is discarding marginal workers now. People complain about our record low labor participation rate, but really it might just be correcting itself back to historic standards. Only instead of arbitrarily excluding a lot of people for being female, it is excluding less skilled or productive workers. Automation and offshoring are contributing factors.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that the LPR is correcting back to a lower level, so much as post-war America was a very special confluence of rapidly increasing economic efficiency, and a relatively limited workforce (worldwide, how many men in prime working age were lost?).Since then, it's been a race to the bottom of sorts.  Every year, the barrier to being middle-class successful gets a bit higher, even if society is allowing a few more people (women and minorities) relatively equal access to the game.</comment>

<comment>Per Capita Real GDP is still rising.https://research.stlouisfed.or...</comment>

<comment>It is, but it's not going to the 'per capita'.</comment>

<comment>One potential solution here: Remove as many men from the workforce as women enter.  That is, as many men stay home to raise kids as women start careers.  Of course, because this would rely largely on self-selection (no one should force a man to stay home any more than force a woman to work in a career) it would be a long time in the making but it's already becoming more common now.</comment>

<comment>I don't disagree with that idea at all.Personally, I think we should do more through the tax code to encourage single-earner households, which would likely be needed to allow anyone to leave the workforce.The only potential downside is that I've seen a number of studies that suggest women are more likely to be dissatisfied with a man who is seemingly 'lacking ambition', so it will also require some forward thinking and adjustment at home, too.</comment>

<comment>They'll have to carpet bomb the industrialized world then...</comment>

<comment>I don't agree with your stated goal of the Democratic party.  Their goal is to exploit minorities and special interests groups to gain power.  Period.  They do not serve minorities....they are worse off than ever.  Even well meaning liberals lack the logic to truly help disadvantaged people.  They think giving them handouts allows them to achieve.  It doesn't.  If a minority wants to make it in this country they should run away from "helpful liberals" who want their vote.  I have a great idea, how about minorities run for office and put all the stupid, greedy white Democrats out of a job?  The Clintons only have helped themselves.  Check the stats on how many minorities hold Democratic seats in congress.  Don't trust them.</comment>

<comment>Then they're planning on declaring WWIII.  I disagree.  I think liberal politicians only care to get elected, and they know they can only appeal to immigrants by making them feel inadequate, as if they didn't fit in.  The minute they stop that, they'll have no votes to count on.</comment>

<comment>It's not a delusion, he really is an underdog. The media hate him, and the media elect the winner typically. </comment>

<comment>Trump doesn't promote a victim mentality. Only an imbecile would claim as much.</comment>

<comment>It's not delusional to believe that the rich and their minions, politicians, are out to get you when all objective evidence proves it's true.Stagnant and declining real wages for the middle class are the result of government subsidies to the rich and policies such as importing foreign labor to replace citizens, see Disney and LADWP, promoting illegal immigration and attacking unions.Voters whose parents were solidly middle class see themselves struggling while politicians leave office office as millionairs and the one percent grab 80% of any economic growth. People who have worked and been taxed for years perceive that their children are at a disadvantage in college applications simply because of that work. They see their children saddled with unparalleled debt while they subsidize the education of less qualified students.Trump is the rights Bernie. People are mad and if you don't buy a progressive agenda Trumps your available choice. Faux news and the Republican establisment hate Trump because he is attacking the crony capital establishment where their profits are. The fact that he is part of the    establishment and as president would be just as bad as the other kleptocrats is being overlookd.</comment>

<comment>The real reason White Americans are voting for Chump is because of this fabricated fear of being a minority in our own country</comment>

<comment>'I'm not racist I have tons of black friends'</comment>

<comment>Ya and I bet you're afraid of them and would lick their nuts if they asked you. Respect is earned and being a little fake white liberal is NOT going to get you any respect from black people. In fact, MOST of them are laughing at you behind your back. Trust me, I grew up with them and if you really think that black people don't stick together than you're in for a big surprise! Why can't you be about your people and country? Oh that's right, you're a brainwashed liberal with no culture! Soon you will be saying "nigga".</comment>

<comment>Lols. Doesn't understand a sarcastic comment that's supposed to be a condensed quote of what the author said, and then responds with a giant slew of racist garbage. How can you expect an idiot to recognize another idiot though? I'm sure they all look the same to you.  There's stupid, ignorant fucks in every culture. Lots of blacks hang out in the streets and make themselves very visible, with knee sagging pants and poor grammar, while lots of whites hang out on the internet venting rage about being fat and slowly dying into racist comments on forums, using poor grammar, so really you're both not all too different, those people just aren't afraid someone will hit them in the mouth for expressing stupid opinions.There's stereotypes of every race and culture, you really need world experience.</comment>

<comment>I can ensure you it's much easier for a educated person to know who is no educated than a uneducated person to know who is educated. I don't "hang out" on the internet as I post facts to bring unity and organization. I'm highly trained and FAR away from from being fat. I want to be able to take my children to school without drugs, gangs, ghetto filth and godless immoral people. I suggest you tr' because so far you white liberals live travel outside of your safe little town and "experience the world" because you white liberals live in a fantasy world where you think everyone is going to hold hands and sing songs! White people were the first slaves in this world and only 2% of white americans ever owned slaves. When white people are a huge minority in America do you really think that the non whites are going to treat to equally? HOW STUPID ARE YOU? GO TRAVEL!</comment>

<comment>Lols. You can't just go 'I'm rubber you're glue' and win an argument.  Go get some real experience being around other people and try not to get your teeth knocked in by other for being loud and stupid. You don't know what liberals are, you don't know politics, you don't even know how to argue your retarded opinions in an intelligent manner. Slavery doesn't matter, all that matters is that people are people and you're an utter retard if you don't think otherwise. You're not better than your average gang banger and in fact you seem worse and dear god I hope you don't have children. They're going to grow up so damaged having a parent like you if so, you're a fucking sociopath and the world would be a better place without you or any of the other social screw ups.Try focusing on your own life and improving your own terrible personality, take a vacation, go travel, and gain some introspection on what makes you a despicable human being.By the way " I can ensure you it's much easier for a educated person to know who is no educated than a uneducated person to know who is educated. " is golden.Like, literally calling yourself uneducated by the context of this conversation. Priceless.Also -LOL- at highly trained. The only way you could stereotype yourself more as a fat basement dweller is to claim you're from the military, or take karate now.</comment>

<comment>Slavery doesn't matter? That's pretty sad because now I'm going to assume you're a spoiled little brat that has everything handed to him. I grew up in SF city and lived in Oakland punk and you wouldn't last one day in the hood without getting your pockets checked. Now as experience goes we have children shooting from 1000 yards out clean. I'm a grown man and been shooting guns since I was 15. You have failed to prove my facts wrong and you continue to give me your opinions. I'm trying to help you but spoiled little punks like you always learn the hard way. One day you will remember this conversation. Have a nice night loser!</comment>

<comment>Lulz. Oh man, the big man on the internet types are so freaking good for a laugh. You gotta be careful about it though. :< You'll turn into a compulsive liar and start believing those things you pull out of your ass. Anywhoozle. Get a reality check, or just die.</comment>

<comment>Delusional conspiracy theories and using random words in situations they don't apply, doesn't really equate to facts. Hard data and legitimate source material that's not another ranting basement fatty on a fake news site, are what make factual evidence for statements.</comment>

<comment>The national debt is almost 20 trillion from Bushes 11 trillion FACT. The youth is now majority non white and most will vote for liberals to keep their free treats. FACT. 20,000 children die everyday but liberals still support non whites who have families of 5 or more living on welfare FACT. White liberals have lost their culture and now are ashamed to be white FACT. White people have created over 90% of everything you touch FACT. Europe now has over 50 million muslims who demand sharia law FACT. Germans today in Germany ask themselves "what does it mean to be German? FACT. ONLY white countries are being flooded with immigration FACT. Liberals are for freedom of speech as long as it does not go against their beliefs FACT. Obama has bombed more countries than any other president FACT. Black people are only 14% of population but yet over 35% live on welfare and over 50% of all violent crimes are from blacks FACT.</comment>

<comment>He's successful because he does what he does better than anyone else who's tried to do it.  His niche is political commentary and calling politicians and the media on their lies/hypocrisy.  Nobody else does that as well as he does.  Also, most late night comedians are white.  It didn't keep Pat Sajak, Joan Rivers, Alan Thicke, Chevy Chase, and probably dozens of others from getting canned.</comment>

<comment>He admitted it on live television! His exact words is "I'm successful because of white privilege" Look it up if you think I'm lying! Now he has a black guy taking over his show to keep making white people look bad. His show is not even funny but boring and all he does is make jokes that only WHITE LIBERALS that have no culture think is funny.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, clown.</comment>

<comment>He can admit whatever he wants but that doesn't mean he's right.  I mean sure, if you want to have a show that targets the mainstream then it helps to be white because whites are 65% of the country or whatever and basically constitute the mainstream.  If you want to call that privilege I think that's shortsighted because there's also a lot more white comics out there trying to do that.  But there are plenty of successful comics that don't target mainstream white America.  Nobody ever says Chris Rock or Richard Pryor are/were successful because they were black.  They're successful because they found their niche in the entertainment industry and served that niche better than most.I mean have you seen Larry Wilmore's show?  Its not as good as Stewart's.  Maybe it will be at some point.  Maybe not.  But right now it isn't worth my time to watch it.  And honestly Colbert and Oliver aren't as good either in my opinion.  Stewart (and his writers) did what he did better than anyone and that's why he was successful.</comment>

<comment>If you like Chris Rock you should slap yourself because he is the most racist anti white black scum I have ever watched on national television. Stewart even admitted that he "thinks" he's successful because he's white! Why are you arguing with me? Oh that's right, you're also a white liberal who lost his culture! Now go educate yourself and stop being fake and a coward. Black people are NOT your friends you idiot and they're laughing at you</comment>

<comment>First part I agree with but in my opinion, Stewart is much more America's Id than Trump. There is  a real endgame in Trump's maddening ways. Stewart, not very much. Trump is actually the antidote to the buffoon Stewart</comment>

<comment>Pampered rich child, that's done nothing but inherit steal and swindle his way into a pampered rich position where he gets to gloat and laugh at those that are more poor than him, having them wallow around on the floor in a money blower in his lobby for scraps of cash after asking them to tell their crushing stories about why they need money for his entertainment. Totally the answer to all of our problems. Lol.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you, Jon Stewart is a scum who never earned a thing in his life.  He sold out to be a mouthpiece once his comedy career failed miserably.</comment>

<comment>David Letterman did a good job on exposing Chump. The look on Chump´s face is worth more than his whole fortune.Did anyone see the interview?</comment>

<comment>I just want to point out for the record that at the same point in the 2012 cycle, Herman Cain was polling at precisely the same 20-25% in the national polls that Trump is today (as was Rick Perry just before then).  These attempts by various members of the media to unearth the mystery of Trump's appeal are incredibly frustrating, because this "mystery" is very easy to solve.  To paraphrase the sage creators of South Park, at least 1 in 4 Americans are morons.  More than 25% of Americans believe that UFOs roam the sky, that ghosts haunt the streets, that President Obama was born in Kenya, that 9/11 was an inside job, that human beings were created in their present form 6000 years ago, and on and on it goes.  If the relationship were expressed as a Venn diagram, I think the overlap between morons and Trump supporters would cover almost all of both circles.  These people are not serious about Trump, nor are they really serious about politics in general.  What they are is stupid or cynically amusing themselves.  In two months their support will mean nothing, except for having given the media something to write about during the dog days of August.</comment>

<comment>I find those letters disturbing. The morons, as you call them, feel that their very way of life is being threatened because gay people can get married and people call each other names on twitter. I genuinely don't know what to do with that.</comment>

<comment>Just accept that in a country as large as ours, there are going to be a lot of weird/stupid people out there.  While their numbers are large in the absolute, they are still a relatively small minority unable to influence government policy in any meaningful way.  Their utter ignorance is their great weakness.</comment>

<comment>Weakness makes people easier to manipulate and frighten. The GOP and oligarchs have been able to make this work, and Trump can make it work, or use it to destroy or direct the other GOP candidates. Once Bush is trashed, he can encourage a weak alternative and then attack and destroy him. Trump is tired of business and TV and wants a new hobby he knows he can afford.</comment>

<comment>look in the mirror -  </comment>

<comment>Um, families are being destroyed of their livlihood because they didn't make a gay themed wedding cake. Lol, liberals are great.</comment>

<comment>A few decades ago you could say the same thing of restaurants that refused to serve black customers.</comment>

<comment>nope, the store still serves gays. They don't even sell gay themed wedding cakes to straight people, so they are being discriminated against for their first amendment rights.</comment>

<comment>yes yes, and small businesses are people too!!! Wrong. A business is NOT a person and therefore does not get personal rights like freedom of speech.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, courts have ruled that corporations are people.</comment>

<comment>You've got to remember that these are just simple farmers. These are people of the land. The common clay of the new West...There are 3 kinds of supporters: those that say he's 'refreshing' because he talks without a filter and says things that are not 'pc', those who say they are entertained, and those who talk about policy. I give credit to the first two, they are accurate. The last group of people just have no understanding of policy, politics, or the recent history of the United States. Those are the ones hoping Trump picks Palin as a running mate, or musing that Obama is trying to destroy America (or that Obama is to blame for not making the Republican party sane).</comment>

<comment>I am SO psyched at a Trump-Palin ticket. Just what this-here country needs : "a non-stop reality show runnin' in the White House, 24 hours a day, for the next 4 years or utter economic collapse, whichever comes first". Take your guess as to whether the show is going to last a full season.</comment>

<comment>Oh, that's easy. We can start with a 25% tax on imported Chinese goods -- something that would (on top of starting a trade war with China that the U.S. would lose) likely provoke a severe world-wide recession and place the U.S. in obvious violation of numerous international trading treaties (GATT, etc.) that it has previously championed and insisted that everyone else implement and fully obey.For a glimpse of the chaos coming soon to a "Reality Show Presidency" near YOU, check out :http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/don...</comment>

<comment>Trade with China is a small part of our economy.</comment>

<comment>No it isn't. That comment just proves that you don't know what you're talking about.Want proof? See :https://www.census.gov/foreign...Of course, the figures in U.S. trade with China in 2014 (last year for which figures are available), indicating approximately $600 billion in combined imports and exports, are not really the story here; the reason that The Donald's agenda on this topic is so unbelievably, recklessly idiotic, is that a unilateral move of this type would without the SLIGHTEST doubt throw the international trading system into turmoil, as other countries (and not only China, etc.) tried to protect themselves by raising equivalent tariffs against American goods -- you are talking Smoot-Hawley on steroids.This would cause either (a) the rapid collapse of the international economic system as we now know it, (b) the total isolation of the United States from the larger world economy, or (c) both (a) and (b).If you want another Great Depression, electing The Donald is a bang-on way to get it rolling.</comment>

<comment> He wouldn't be that dumb. Of course, everyone knows that China needs America more than America needs China. We should actually use that leverage to prove their human rights. They are essentially enslaving all of their workers by having an undervalued currency.</comment>

<comment>Trump wouldn't pick Palin.  Her chance came and went.  Everybody knows what a joke she is now and I'm sure McCain regrets that move.  I think Trump would like to pick another geriatric New York finance or media type since those are the people he knows but he may try to placate the Republican establishment by picking whoever the runner up ends up being.</comment>

<comment>Nah. If the unlikely, million-to-one shot happens and Trump actually becomes the nominee, he's going to pick the same boring Midwestern white male governor (maybe Senator) all candidates pick for VP. Can't overshadow the candidate, you know. Then I'm buying a lottery ticket. And going ice skating in hell.</comment>

<comment>I don't think he's that big of a longshot.  The most probable scenario is most of the mainstream candidates flame out and their supporters throw their support behind whatever mainstream candidate is left.  According to the gamblers out there that's going to be Jeb Bush.http://www.predictwise.com/pol...But so long as Trump is in the race the media focuses on him and people don't hear about the other candidates.  He has a shot at this thing.</comment>

It's a-gonna take a man on horseback to put things right, pardner.</comment>

<comment>The sad thing about it is that the right wing is going crazy over the Jade Helm exercises for reasons not entirely different from the ones you named. These people are getting to be parodies of themselves. </comment>

<comment>The difference is Herman Cain didn't have the monetary and media advantages that Trump has and that Herman Cain had to run against a well-funded establishment guy in Romney who even on his best day Herman Cain barely surpassed in the polls.Its early and most of the candidates are unknown so Trump (a well known guy nationwide) is predictably ahead.  Can he maintain that into the general?  I think he has a better shot of doing so than Cain.  I don't see any of these other candidates as being all that strong.  And nobody polls that much better than anybody else so I think the country agrees with me on that.  Could I see 51% of the party getting behind a guy who's currently polling at or below 10%?  Maybe but it looks like a longshot.  I mean if this weren't Trump we were talking about but some mainstream Republican then everybody would be saying the nomination is his to lose.</comment>

<comment>Again, for all the supposed advantages Trump has, he is polling exactly the same as Cain was at this point last cycle.  The numbers are identical.  The difference between 2012 and 2016 is not that Trump is stronger than Cain, but that in 2016 Romney solidified the support of the GOP establishment whereas this year it is dispersed.  Romney had the money, he had the endorsements, he had the key operatives, and most importantly he had no plausible challengers beyond the pathetic Tim Pawlenty.  This time around, there are 5 plausible "establishment" candidates battling each other (Bush, Walker, Rubio, Kasich, Fiorina).  Thus, it makes sense that not one of the plausible candidates is currently polling as well as Romney alone did in 2012 (together, they are polling around 30-35%).As for your claim that 51% of the party won't get behind someone currently under 10%, I think Bill Clinton in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, and John McCain in 2008 would all beg to disagree.  National primary polls are completely irrelevant, especially this far out from the primaries.  Heck, Hillary was around 50% at this point in the cycle in 2008 and we all know how that ended up.  The key in a dispersed primary like this one is to survive the early states and make it to the big states on Super Tuesday.  At that point, the solid 50% of the GOP primary votes held by mainstream Republicans will decide the race as they have every time since 1964.  It is almost certain that at that point the race will come down to some combination of Bush, Rubio, and Walker, with Ted Cruz playing the role that Trump is playing right now (only much more competently).Trump, who is not running a serious political campaign by any objective standard, will drop out of the race the moment his poll numbers start to drop.  Despite his supposed wealth, he is not actually spending any money on this campaign and he has no interest in doing so.  He will eventually claim that he made his point and that he definitely would have won, but that he needs to focus on his business or some nonsense to that effect.  His ego is way too big to allow him to subject himself to the embarrassment of an actual election that he cannot possibly win.  Besides, he has already won what he was really after, which is more celebrity and a more lucrative contract for his next TV show.</comment>

<comment>This GOP field is much, much stronger than the field in 2012, where voters kept casting about for alternatives to Romney, then dropping them as unsuitable. Yet the anti-establishment support is still going to Trump and Carson more than to Walker or Cruz. I think the anti-politician mood is very strong.</comment>

<comment>Walker is a classic establishment candidate, so I don't understand why he would be expected to get anti-establishment support.  Cruz is actually gaining support quite rapidly right now (the correlation between the rise in his support and the decline in Trump's is quite strong).  This is the tea era of the GOP, where about 40% of the GOP electorate is now actively trying to destroy their party.  The "anti-politicians" were polling at around 40-50% at this point in 2012, so it shouldn't be surprising that they are polling the same right now.  Fortunately for the party, however, sane people are still a (bare) majority and they will never allow anyone other than Bush, Rubio, or Walker (maybe Kasich) to win the nomination.</comment>

<comment>No, Walker is Tea Party, not GOP establishment at all. The GOP establishment talks conservative, but doesn't do much when push comes to shove. It certainly doesn't fight the public unions or cut the budget.I would say that the tea party is not trying to "destroy" the GOP but to take it over and turn it into a real opposition party. The GOP has been through this before -- e.g Reagan vs. Ford in 1976.As for how it will turn out this time, nobody knows for sure. It would be extremely difficult for a non-politician to prevail, but the GOP voter base is ready to vote for anybody who will kick butt and take names -- and not play by the rules. I'd keep my eye on Carly Fiorina too. She is very impressive.</comment>

<comment>Walker is no different in his agenda than any of a dozen Republicans elected governor in 2010.  He's gotten more attention than most of them because he is in a blue state and because of the recall circus, but he has embraced the exact same corporatist, Koch agenda as any of them.  He is trying to run slightly to the right of Bush and Rubio, but he is still solidly a mainstream, establishment Republican.  The tea party candidates in this race are Carson, Cruz, and Paul.  Trump is just Trump.As for Fiorina, her campaign is doomed by the fact that she is the worst CEO in modern American history.  Her record at HP is comically embarrassing.  Her chief role in this race is to attack Hillary in a personal way that the men in the race cannot, and try to position herself as a plausible VP choice.Right now, I would say that Bush has about a 50% chance of winning the nomination despite running a hilariously bad campaign thanks to his massive advantage in cash and organization.  Walker and Rubio are both at around 20-25%, and the rest are around 5% put together.</comment>

<comment>I'd say Bush has a very high chance of being the nominee, because the other mainstreams can't stop themselves from saying stupid things in public (Walker) or are good on paper but lack whatever personality is needed to actually win (Rubio and Kasich, who I honestly think are positioning themselves for VP).I also think it's sad that Republicans think they need to keep Florin around to attack Hillary, like her attacks will be more effective because she's a woman. It's that kind of reductionist, identity-politics thinking ("The chicks respond to other chicks! If Carly mentions tampons, then we'll really sweep the lady-vote") that dooms the GOP with women and minorities. They'd do much better if they treated them like people.</comment>

<comment>Obama "attacked" Hillary in the 2008 primary, won, and has enjoyed significant electoral success since then.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but that's because everyone was caught up in the whole "first black president" excitement.</comment>

<comment>I won't be surprised if they put Fiorina in as the VP candidate, or at the very least, make her a major campaign surrogate.</comment>

<comment>I think they tried the "let's throw a token in there to lock down the chick vote, since dumb women vote with their vaginas instead of their brains" back in 2008. I think that scared them off ever doing it again.Especially since Hillary will be the Dem nominee they'll give up women as  a bad job and double their attention on the only Americans they care about  - upper-class white men.</comment>

<comment>Oh, I certainly don't think they would throw just any woman up there - Palin definitely proved the foolishness of that.That said, Fiorina's debate performance at the kids' table pre-debate debate seemed to earn her some positive attention, and if she can come off as a smart, informed, savvy candidate that's able to stand up under the press (in all the ways Palin was never able to), then I certainly don't think it's an impossibility.</comment>

<comment>Agree. If Bush somehow tanks Kasich is my dark horse; especially if Trump keeps lasting.</comment>

<comment>In my darker moments I think maybe we should just do what they want and let them own the consequences. Disband all the unions, cut WIC and unemployment insurance and housing subsidies and Social Security and Medicaid to the bone, defund education and birth control. And let them deal with the millions of hungry people on the streets with no health care. The lifting of banking regulations, environmental standards and the top tax rate will magically solve that problem though! Surely some charity work willdo the job, if not. Easy Peasy.</comment>

<comment>I would never willingly give them what they want (I have kids who deserve a nation better than that), but also if the American public don't show up to the polls and this minority of folks actually wins an election...  well, to some extent we get the government we deserve.  Sadly, Kansas proves that they really don't care about the consequences, at least not enough to move off their ideological certainties or political apathies.</comment>

<comment>You're kidding, right?</comment>

<comment>The 2012 Primary cycle definitely had its share of insurgent candidates, as the attention swung through several people, including Bachmann, Cain, Perry, etc etc. The difference I see here, so far, is that all of those featured a spike in polls that the candidates couldn't sustain, leading to attention shifting to the next candidate, and so on.For some reason, Trump isn't flaring out the way those candidates did. Now, he may yet do so, but somehow he's managed to  avoid doing so thus far. It's definitely going to be an interesting year in the coming political season.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but through all that Romney maintained a solid 25%+ in the polls.  You don't have that this time.  If Trump had made some great speech at the debate and his numbers soared to what they are now I'd say its a similar scenario.  He'll flame out in a month.  But there is no obvious frontrunner here and Trump has been ahead for a while now.</comment>

<comment>But in a field with this many candidates, it's only going to take 25% to win the first primaries.  And if Trump actually makes it to the primaries and wins Iowa and New Hampshire, this could keep going.  Italy elected Berlusconi after all.  Trump entered the race with the single-worst polling record of support for a candidate of either party ... ever.  But that has gradually turned around, because apparently Republicans just like backing a 'winner'.</comment>

<comment>At the moment, 60% of women and 57% of men view Trump favorably (CNN poll).Calling the majority of Americans morons is akin to calling them 'takers', with the same predictable results. I can only imagine the panic behind the scenes in the GOP.</comment>

<comment>You are misunderstanding the poll.  60% of Republican women and 57% of Republican men view Trump favorably.  That is very different from "a majority of Americans."  And even that is overstating Trump's support, since only 20-25% of Republicans actually plan to vote for him today (i.e. less than half of those who view him favorably).  And it is only those specific 20-25% of Republicans who plan to vote for Trump who I consider to be morons.  Depending on the poll, Trump's overall favorability is somewhere between 20-35% (http://pollingreport.com/S-Z.h..., which is incredibly low for a national figure.  </comment>

<comment>There was very little arming of ISIS during the Arab Spring. The weapons ISIS have are largely conquered from Syrian and Iraqi forces. The latter, of course, being the incompetents that Dubya left the Iraqi military with, after the "debaathification", and then armed to the teeth.Let's not forget: There was no Al-Qaeda in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. They came after the invasion, grew thanks to the alienation of the Sunni, starting with the "debaathification", turned into Islamic State in Iraq while Bush was still in charge, and moved into Syria during the Arab Spring.The destabilization of the region can in its entirety be traced back to Bush and his string of massive blunders, and the people who supported him in his follies.</comment>

<comment>Point taken. But I'm not sure how much we can draw from him having a plurality of likely Iowa Republicans' votes.To me this is all the more reason to scrap our current primary system and go back to a slightly more democratic version of what we had in the old days. When you "throw it to the people" the hardliners, like cream in milk, are inevitably the ones whose agenda tends to rise to the top. Otherwise Trump would merely be a strange sideshow, rather than the train wreck-like main event. </comment>

<comment>He's leading a plurality of GOP primary voters. He's nowhere near a plurality of American voters. He would get absolutely decimated in any general election matchup.</comment>

Otherwise, you get to cast your lot for either Pepsi or Coke.  Or, do like I do, and throw my vote away on a 3rd Party candidate.  I won't equate voting with 'having a say' in any real sense.I agree, though, that it's definitely a mistake to conflate polling with voting.That said, the polling that's been done this year is terrifying to people like me that think voting should be legally required...</comment>

<comment>Nah, it would have no effect. Trump's policies and birtherism OTOH...</comment>

<comment>Depends if blacks can vote with their heads, rather than their hearts.  Their heads should tell them that they're best off in an overwhelmingly white country, as the exclusive dysfunctional minority.Hispanics have already driven the low-end blacks out of the low end of the labor market, are displacing the black middle class from government patronage jobs, and they're ethnically cleansing once-black strongholds all over the country.At the other end of the mass-immigration pool, Asian immigrants don't buy into the white guilt thing.  They have nothing but contempt for blacks.Of course it could have been different if the blacks had followed the Booker T. Washington model -- economic advancement through hard work, social acceptance through good behavior.  But their leaders took a different course -- the hostile parasitism of W.E.B. DuBois.  Booker T's model could succeed in a multicultural country.  The parasitic model requires the perpetual dominance of soft-hearted, soft-headed whites.</comment>

But sooner or later, they'll discover that the emperor indeed has no clothes - but it's fun to watch how selective perception clouds people's judgement.</comment>

<comment>I see a lot of the responses were from the "things can't get much worse in this country/America used to be great but isn't anymore/we don't win anymore" crowd. I can see why a lot of folks are blaming Fox News for Trump's successes. These fear-mongering messages were bound to turn into a crazed political movement sooner or later. People are seriously saying we should give the presidency to an ego-maniacal, self-professed crony capitalist because things have gotten so bad that it's the only viable hope for this country? Seriously? Overreaction much?</comment>

<comment>These fear-mongering messages were bound to turn into a crazed political movement sooner or later. Which party has been trumpeting, for years, the stagnation and decline of the middle class, and warning them about how they're losing ground to the wealthy? Trump's policy positions are necessarily rather hard to nail down, since he's usually advocated for both sides of the same issue*, but what he's fear mongering on is basically the standard Democratic message about stagnating middle class wages, though his protectionist solutions are more from the right wing (or possibly from the unions). presidency to an ego-maniacal, self-professed crony capitalistEgo-maniacal is almost necessarily a qualification to think that you are the most qualified candidate to run the foremost country on Earth, though some hide it better than others. Similarly on the crony-capitalist front, who is your alternative, besides Sanders? HRC and Jeb are both first order crony capitalists, and Obama's recovery team was at one point headed by Jeff Immelt, CEO of GE, to say nothing of the various revolving door positions that Wall Street has held in his administration, or his economic policy more broadly.*The mark of a true politician, I might add!

<comment>I won't argue that I trust Clinton any more than Trump. I will say though, that if you're looking for an anti-establishment Republican, either Ron or Rand Paul would have fit that bill and not been so out there like Trump. To me there is a certain brand of crazy going on if you skip over those two and go straight to Trump.</comment>

<comment>If you care about the middle class still existing, they're by far the worst. I think that's more of an issue for most people than civil liberties. </comment>

<comment>They also seem to strike me as anti-Citizens United, much like Sanders. I guess I personally prefer Rand because he's the least hawkish in the field (and even so if you include Hillary). When people complain that America is not "winning" enough, it makes me worried because it almost sounds like they believe there was a "winning" option in Iraq.</comment>

Claiming that illegal immigrants are coming here from Central and South America to rape our women and kill us is fear-mongering. Talking about the stagnation and decline of the middle class is not, by any measure, especially when there is enough empirical evidence to back it up."Trump's policy positions are necessarily rather hard to nail down, since he's usually advocated for both sides of the same issue*."No, his positions are hard to nail down because he hasn't really done much to state or even elaborate on them. He wants to build a wall, and force Mexico to pay for it, which is not only absurd when you consider just how hollow this threat is, but also that there is a net efflux of immigrants from the United States."Ego-maniacal is almost necessarily a qualification to think that you are the most qualified candidate to run the foremost country on Earth.."Blanket statements like these really detract from any position you're trying to defend, especially when they imply that Trump's ego is on par with Sanders'. Even if every candidate is full of himself/herself, there is a clear difference between Trump's ego and that of any other person running right now, and if you think I'm wrong then show me a quote by another candidate that would suggest that they are as crazy about themselves as Trump is about himself. The fact that you're willing to admit that he's an ego-maniac, while simultaneously believing that he's already worth so much money that he won't use the position to add some more weight to his wallet (like many other politicians already do) suggests to me that you haven't really put much thought into your position, just as you haven't put much thought into your comment.</comment>

<comment>“I think that I’m a better speechwriter than my speechwriters,” Mr. Obama told Patrick Gaspard, his political director, at the start of the 2008 campaign, according to The New Yorker. “I know more about policies on any particular issue than my policy directors. And I’ll tell you right now that I’m going to think I’m a better political director than my political director.”If that's not ego, I don't know what is.</comment>

<comment>What if he's right? He knows his staff.</comment>

<comment>We've all had a chance to see that Obama doesn't know crap. He is weak, he can't lead, he can't negotiate, he is the most polarizing president in history.

Where was their anger then? And why, when Obama continued many of Bush's failed policies did they accuse Obama of being too left-wing, of not going far enough in doing the very things they now are angry about?What's changed?</comment>
