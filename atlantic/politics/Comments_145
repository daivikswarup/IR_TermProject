<comment>The huge number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is the chief reason why wages have been stagnating and even declining in many occupations for over two decades. That a filthy rich corporate fat cat like Trump could become a "working class hero" on this issue is a bit bizarre ...</comment>

<comment>How many middle class and less has fat cat Trump hired?</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, what? Do you think hotels and resorts and office buildings and apartment buildings are currently run solely by 6-figure executives cleaning the rooms, washing the dishes, moving the bags, cooking the meals, parking the cars, repairing broken amenities, dealing the blackjack tables, taking reservations, running local advertisements, collecting rent, keeping the individual books....?or do you think he hires a massive amount of blue and middle-class level workers to do those jobs as well?Honestly, you lefties are as ignorant as you pretend to be smart. And that's saying something.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Well luckily we're not pretending.</comment>

<comment>if you're a lefty, and you think you're intelligent, you're definitely pretending.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>I'm willing to bet the orange-haired orangutan hires very few middle class workers. Thanks to your god, Reagan, and the former idiot-in-chief, W, the middle class has been decimated.*snort*</comment>

<comment>lol. oh you "bet", do you?well there's some fine lefty argument for you: he doesn't "think" something happens, therefore it "doesn't."Mr. Soros, you should get your money back from this one.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Can't handle the facts, huh? Typical of an uneducated, low information Faux News viewer such as yourself. You continue to vote against your interests because you're too brainwashed to make informed, intelligent  decisions.*snort*</comment>

<comment>rofl. poor low IQ, brainwashed little lefty follower: so inundated with facts that contract his Sros-created fantasy world, he simply cannot handle it, and lashes out in the last pathetic and hilarious bleats of weakness, tossing out a word salad of butthurt to cover how he intellectually just can't handle how the lefty maxims fail in the face of reality.so butthurt. so sad. so laughable, he is.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Talk about a word salad. All that drivel in one rambling, incomprehensible sentence.Anyway, I refuse to further debate someone so woefully unprepared.So I'll let you have the last word, because I know—being the simpleton you are—have to have it.*snort*</comment>

<comment>lol. ah, I love your little low-IQ, word salad ramblings; they bring a (jovial) tear to my eye, they make so little sense.I'm sorry you have failed to cover for Mr. Soros. And I'm sorry that your "bet" that Trump hasn't hired any "middle class" workers counts as "evidence" amongst the daily show set.it's cute, however, how much reality  hurts your wittle brain...*giggle*</comment>

<comment>What exactly, are "our interests" as defined by a statist like yourself?</comment>

<comment>We can't avoid voting against our interests. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats care about this country, except for what they can get out of it. The best chance we had of solving some of our problems was Scott Walker, but he bowed out early in the race.So now we have a choice between two criminal buffoons. Glorious.</comment>

<comment>Oh Snap^2!</comment>

<comment>Actually, Ted until Barry rolled into town, there was a middle class..and btw who's been running the show for the last seven years? It wasn't GWB...it's been Barry, the Wonderful Unicorn...</comment>

<comment>Say what you will about how Obama is governing the current state of affairs, but the fact is the that the middle class has been in decline since the 1970's.  It is a well established that real wages peaked in 1972 and have been declining ever since. The financial crisis which began on Bush's watch accelerated that decline.  It is only is now that people are realizing the effect of what has been ongoing for several decades.</comment>

<comment>When will anyone admit Barry's been in charge for the last seven years? . We're talking about now, not forty five years ago. At least have the wherewithal  of speaking the truth about today and what Barack Obama is responsible for, now. Straw dog arguments have no bearing in reality any more than these comments do. GWB hasn't been president for seven years. Grow up and get a grip on reality. Are you really this stupid? I don't know why I even ask. Non sequitur comments that have absolutely nothing to do with reality. Stupid is as stupid does. They certainly don't teach people how to think anymore, do they? A perfect example.</comment>

<comment>"...the middle class has been decimated."___Most of those folks were decently-paid members of the working class, but fancied themselves "middle class" because Americans do that.</comment>

<comment>Hey stupid, there is always somebody in the middle. Top and bottom too.  PS  More rich got richer and poor got poorer under Obama. Look it up.</comment>

<comment>You can't call another people stupid.  This has happened for more that forty years, it makes no difference the President being Republican or Democrat.</comment>

<comment>The poor's writing skills got worse too!</comment>

<comment>W was a cuckservative.  May his name be forgotten.</comment>

<comment>Obamacare and NAFTA didn't decimate the middle class? Lol denial ain't a river in Egypt.</comment>

<comment>You can blame Obama, but the trend has more than forty years. The parties just distraught the American people while the elites take a bigger portion each time.</comment>

<comment>Trump's employee count runs in the tens of thousands - 90% of Trump employees earn well over minimum wage (included in Trump's business plan, in writing, is a statement committing Trump's businesses to pay "Family Supporting" Wages to his employees.

<comment>U may want to go to my blog before you spout this nonsense.I am FOR Trump.I was making reference that he DOES hire.Why did you reply to me??Reply to the idiot above me, the O-bot</comment>

<comment>If true, your post was unclear. I'd correct it---maybe something got cut off.</comment>

<comment>He hires, yes. His hiring doesn't make a difference, many jobs are outsourced and wages are low. The fact is he's a liar and manipulative, and the people who supports him tends to share his xenophobic and hateful points of view.  Now, you have a right to be afraid (and angry) of Mexicans, Blacks and Muslims, but it isn't a sane perspective. I know many Mexicans, some Blacks and a few Muslims and all of them are correct people, workers and I found crazy to hate fellow human beings.</comment>

<comment>I hate most people equally :)Merry christmas</comment>

<comment>how many "illegal immigrants" do you suppose trumps has cleaning the rooms, washing the dishes, moving the bags, cooking the meals, parking the cars, and repairing broken amenities?</comment>

<comment>I believe I've seen figures that put Trump's current employee count runing in the tens-of-thousands!</comment>

<comment>What middle class? Barry, as the standard bearer of the Democrat Party hasn't been able to pass a single budget since he's been in office (year after abysmal year the entire US Senate votes against his budgets 97-0 ..sometimes 98-0) and the middle class has disappeared with real unemployment skyrocketing.  When full time work and unemployment hovers between 93 and 94 million out of the full time workforce, tell me where there is a middle class? As far as Trump is concerned, far more than Barry's ever done. He wouldn't know where to begin...</comment>

<comment>I am asking how many Trump has hired.The person I RESPONDED to did not answer because he knows the answer:Trump has hired THOUSANDS of poor and middle class.</comment>

<comment>Of course he has...I don't disagree with that assessment. However, as I said what middle class is there since Barack Hussein Obama has taken charge of the economy? Even Democrats have agreed in the past, particularly when there is a Republican in office, that the President leads the way in economic policies. What economic policies does the country have as initiated by Obama that has increased and uplifted America and given us an increased middle class? We don't and in fact, the media and Barry's supporters have come out and emphasized there is a new 'normal'. The reality is we have lots of 'part time' employment and a lot less when it comes to full time employment and we're supposed to roll over and accept that? Another result and reality is there is no discernible middle class and more poor individuals collecting food stamps.  A decided downward spiral into poverty and not a middle class at all. That was my precise point.</comment>

<comment>I hate Obama, lets not even discuss the jerk, he makes me wanna puke</comment>

<comment>Again, I don't disagree...self-induced vomiting is a decidedly better alternative. That's why I change the channel whenever and wherever I am...</comment>

<comment>Well, being visceral is the contrary of being rational. Anyway, you have a right to be that way, not to be proud of.</comment>

<comment>Yeah it's all Obama's fault.  He was clearly responsible for all those jobs that went to China in the 90's and the early 2000's.  And he was also responsible for those illegal immigrants that  came into this country during those times thanks to NAFTA.  Furthermore, the evidence that he orchestrated the financial crisis and ensuing bank bailout by the Bush administration is incontrovertible.  It's all Obama's fault.</comment>

<comment>Did I draw that conclusion or are you just making stupid comments to be noticed? BHO has been president for the last seven years. What about that don't you get? Do I have to draw a picture? No, the Bush administration bailed out no one..Barry did that and used a great deal of the bailout money as his own personal slush fund. Remember Solyndra and all the other 'green' companies he gave hundreds of millions to? They all went bankrupt but the DNC got the cash...among other things. You should really pay attention to what you're talking about...</comment>

<comment>It's clear the global financial crisis was not the direct fault of Barry Obama. But what about broader democrat policies that have created poor American economic and fiscal performance that republicans have been forced to follow.  Democrats have moved the world left.   A massive welfare bill that has raised taxes and made the US uncompetitive.  Ineffective and delusional programs such as no child left behind and common core.   In the 1960s African Americans had higher marriage stability than Whites and the murder and crime rate was the same.   Now legitimacy and marriage is at an all time low with the murder and HIV  rate ten times higher than Whites.  It's blacks killing blacks. Had conservative values been applied to nurture the family rather than then Black families would have the structure they needed, liberals tore down everything that was working.   Integration even denuded Black Community of its best people.Bushes Neocon/Zionist foreign policy imperatives, a Zionist policy democrats are equally prone to execute, also created a huge military bill.   Republicans know this and hate it but if anything conservatives are loyal and get on team even when the leader is a bit of a twat like George.  Cuckservatives and RINO are hated, they don't represent American conservatives but an elite control the process.</comment>

<comment>Hired? very few. You know, there's something called "outsourcing", it allows for skipping job rights and saving millions. It looks close to exploitation, but, what the heck!</comment>

<comment>I have said before that the worst thing anyone who worries about the effect of immigration on wages ever did was let the racist be the biggest voice of the movement.</comment>

<comment>Then maybe the democrats and republicans shouldnt have teamed up with giant corporations to screw the working class for the last five decades.</comment>

<comment>The requirement for not being called racist these days is to be someone who is not promoting auto-genocide.</comment>

<comment>The elites will call any anti-immigrant candidate racist, and then go for the throat if they acquiesce and try to compromise their views.  By making it clear that they will always vote against white people, minority race hustlers have ensured the next generation will not care about their cries.  This coming from a biochemist at a major university; I have seen the thought policing first hand.  One even went so far as to say we should enslave people if they vote republican in my lab.</comment>

<comment>You're kidding. When "anti-immigrant" cry, they complain about browns (Mexicans and Centroamericans), not about whites (Germans, Canadians, Polish, Ukrainians and Russians).If you are a racist person (many Americans are) and white it's understandable that you feel some kind of race hate (against you or against colored people), but many people live their lives not caring about skin color.Now, the current polarization in politics is very ugly but I wouldn't blame just one party.</comment>

<comment>Case in point above.</comment>

<comment>I think you're wrong. The economy changed and the people (I mean, the workers) ceased to be necessary (to an increasing extent). Migrants are another victim, not the culprits.</comment>

<comment>>> This is simply not true, and this article does a better job of explaining whyIt does ?"more than two decades of research on the local labor market impacts of immigration have reached a near consensus that increased immigration has a small but discernible negative effect on the relative  wages of low-skilled native workers"</comment>

If the authors meant "increased wealth for average Joe" my guess is that they would simply say so>> Please note this "small but discernible negative effect on relative wages" is for low-skilled native workersI don't see your point ?

<comment>Simply not true.  iPhones are assembelled by robotic machinery.   The costs are all in the tooling and marketing.   Tax rates have a bigger effect. </comment>

<comment>Prices are determined by supply and demand, not production costs.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Very rarely. If the profit margin is slim and production costs rise, the product is usually discontinued. If the profit margin is high and costs rise, the price is already optimized for the market and the profits from any increase would be lost in reduced sales; so the price stays the same. Increased prices are typically a response to inflation (which changes the price curve), not production costs - they do make a handy scapegoat, though.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Apple would have many choices. They have a high profit margin at prices that are already optimized for the market. If they increase the price, in hopes of recovering the higher costs, they would lose it all in reduced sales. All else being equal, higher sales volume is preferred as it maintains product relevance. Inflation, of course, changes price curves ... and that's what will cause Apple to raise prices. And in almost every case, they will blame it on cost increases and make as if hapless to prevent it. Because customers don't want to hear they are raising the price to optimize profit. They will never say that.</comment>

<comment>Hillary won't win against Trump, voter enthusiasm and trust are entirely too low for her, not to mention that I can't think of the last time the Democrats won the White House after a previous Democrats 2nd term. </comment>

<comment>If you really truly honestly want to see how unbelievably impossible it is for Hillary to win, count how many people on here- an environment that is far more pro Hillary than actual society- are enthusiastic about voting for Hillary? I might meet one a month.</comment>

<comment>No fan of Hillary here. But I'd like to point two things: I see Hillary much more electable than Tump. And that you are unable to think of the last time Democrats won the WH (do you refer to Clinton's second term or to Kerry's "lost" to Bush in 2004?) doesn't mean they can't win in 2016.</comment>

<comment>They are also more inclined to rant and not vote.</comment>

<comment>Why exactly? So that they stay in their class with possible increased benefits that will run out sooner? So that "escaping from being poor" leads you back to the same quality of life because you just end up paying more taxes and subsidizing the class of people you desperately wanted to depart from? Socialism does not work.</comment>

<comment>No way, Bernie wants higher taxes.</comment>

<comment>What does illegal Hispanic immigration do for legal Hispanic immigrants?  Nothing except lower their wages and opportunities. </comment>

<comment>You're right. Like two mice fighting for scraps, while the big rat has more and more of the cheese for himself.  In fact, poor whites and blacks make another two mice, and the four of them fight each other while the elite throws some scraps at them. You know, it's better to keep them entertained.</comment>

<comment>What's Bernies' attitude to the White privilege baloney?</comment>

<comment>He gets a pass on it, so mum's the word.</comment>

<comment>I've dealt with the computer models used, such as ORANI.   They require a great many factor estimates.  If you make a few minor and plausible tweaks you can change the outcome of these models from slightly positive to significantly negative.Economists suffer from the problem of political correctness.  If one came out and said "immigration is bad for the people here now" his career would be in jeopardy.   In addition many of the institutions and consultancies are pro immigration or working for pro immigration industries.Voting for immigration is like a Turkey voting for Christmass.</comment>

<comment>It also seems to have destroyed the middle class and stopped mobility from lower class to middle class.  It has also destroyed the rollout of automation and the high quality and good middle class jobs it creates.Besides, who really wants to live in Mogadishu America.</comment>

<comment>It does, of course."small but discernible negative effect on the relative  wages of low-skilled native workers". There says the effect is small and only for low skilled workers.  The issue being discussed was "illegal immigrants in the U.S. is the chief reason why wages have been stagnating and even declining in many occupations for over two decades". Chief reason. Wage in many occupations over two decades.  If the effect is small it can't be a chief reason, or can?</comment>

<comment>I can play with words too: If low skilled wages have had a small but discernible relative fall, then a "small but discernible negative effect on the relative  wages of low-skilled native workers" caused by immigration would be the "chief reason"</comment>

<comment>I liked that.   Now, How about this?   If low skilled wages have had a small but discernible relative fall, then a small but discernible negative effect on the relative  wages of low-skilled native workers could significantly have had a small but discernible relative fall which, in turn, brings a small but discernible negative effect on the relative  wages of low-skilled native workers and a discernible, but small effect on the small skilled and low workers whose small but discernible wages have an effect in the butt.You can tweak a lot, the point is: the economy changed. The pursue of efficiency has several repercussions and the wages are one of the victims. I don't see how could you blame immigration for that.</comment>

<comment>>> How about this?Boring game</comment>

<comment>There much more subjectivity that goes into economics than most economists are willing to allow. It seems to me that they consistently understate the costs of high levels of immigration.To give just one example: we now know that societies with lower levels of immigration have much higher levels of social trust. See for instance:http://www.citylab.com/commute...And yet I have NEVER seen a study on the economic impact of immigration that accounted for the high economic cost of the loss of social trust.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The correlation between social trust and societal homogeneity is fairly well established. The prominent sociologist Robert Putnam was so dismayed by his findings that he sat on the results for several years.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That may be true, but as you note it takes generational time - decades. And all the while there is a huge cost that isn't being accounted for or acknowledged.Also, there is no evidence that the same process is operative in Europe, and a lot of evidence that it isn't.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You won't really find a precedent in most of Europe for what is happening now unless you go back to the pre-Christian era, and then if you are talking about Celts and Visigoths marauding around the circumstances are too dissimilar to be instructive.. The US had major waves of immigration throughout its history. Europe has never really operated that way.Large scale assimilation of immigrant populations is fairly unique to the New World. You don't see wealthy Asian countries absorbing large numbers of immigrants from significantly different ethnic/cultural backgrounds either.</comment>

<comment>Most of the Irish that came couldn't speak English and were illiterate.   They were difficult to employ and provided rather a lot of competition to Anglo Whites labourers.  A problem for all.   Nevertheless they came from a European culture of Christian mindset and were fundementally compatible.  This is not the case anymore. Those from the Irish cities had a high degree of refinement, education and skill.   Alas not the case for the underdeveloped rural Irish.</comment>

<comment>And you don't suppose the lack of trust has to do with politicians like Trump fanning those flames?</comment>

<comment>Whatever the lack of trust can be attributed to, it still must be accounted for.</comment>

<comment>Or reduced by denouncing the ideas promoted by Trump.  Your argument might be entirely circular:  immigrants are bad for society because they are not trusted because they are bad for society because they are not trusted.....</comment>

<comment>My point is simply that if high levels of immigration reduce social trust (which they do), then that reduction has an economic cost, and that economic cost has to be factored into any economic cost/benefit analysis of immigration.The question of *why* high levels of immigration reduce social trust is a separate issue. But higher levels of social homogeneity are associated with higher levels of social trust all around the world. It isn't a phenomenon you can denounce out of existence. </comment>

<comment>It's hardly a separate issue when we are discussing anti-immigration political rhetoric.   You don't know how much of the mistrust is directly triggered by high levels of immigration and how much is triggered by political rhetoric.</comment>

<comment>As I said, this is a phenomenon that we see all around the world. Even if it is caused purely by political rhetoric, which is highly unlikely, it won't be denounced out of existence. So it still must be accounted for in economic analyses of immigration effects.</comment>

<comment>One of the reasons the US rose to global dominance is because we offered open arms to immigrants while Europe was still a collection of bickering mistrustful kingdoms. Those old divisions have been very hard to die, as we saw in the Balkans after the breakup of the USSR.  I get your point, that people have a natural tendency in this direction, but let us not take it as a fait accompli or assume other countries are a good model.</comment>

<comment>I'm not arguing against immigration, necessarily. I'm just arguing for an honest accounting of the costs and benefits so that we can make informed policy decisions.Personally, I think what inflames sentiment against immigration most is not rhetoric like Trump's, but more the refusal by the elites to engage the issue honestly.</comment>

<comment>The requirement for being not racist these days is supporting policies that are essentially autogenocide.  Americans are supposed to sit in front of an balance sheet and calculate that they and their children are marginally no longer cost effective and should be replaced.  You can't commoditise morality like that.  Adam Smith was opposed to this but RINO, liberals and some libertarians have become homo economicus.  Turkeys that vote for Christmass.</comment>

<comment>The US was big, had land and resources.   Farmer settlers can pull vast resources from land that had previously mainly supported hunter gatherers.  Europe was reaching over population.    It was mainly White European of mainly English background till 1965.  All of the founding fathers were Presbyterian.   Presbyterians vote for their minister rather than have him appointed and do everything by committees.  They highly value conscience and by imputation free speech.  Their impact is hard to deny.   Do you really think salafist Muslims wouldnt have implemented a caliph and sharia and freedom of religion?</comment>

<comment>Yes, because we were big is why we were not afraid of immigrants, and probably the ideas of tolerance preached by our founders had something to do with it.  But, where do you get the idea they were Presbyterians?  Did you mean Episcopalian?  I don't know what the Muslims would have done back then, but I think most of our problems with them today stem from our meddling in the Middle East to get at the oil.  You know, like over-throwing the democratically elected government of Iran, invading Iraq, that sort of thing.  Most people react badly to that.</comment>

<comment>Ann Coulter in Adios America spends perhaps a page or two on it.  She notes that King George complained of the Revolution being the "Presbyterian Revolution".   I can't give you a page number as I listened to the audible version in my car.  Its obviously not searchable.The meddling in oil may be a factor but I think it is small factor, say it was 15% because they have oil and we buy it.  Israel and the Zionist lobby that controls America with its money is maybe 45% of the problem.One reason I don't blame oil is the Jihads now running across Africa ie Kenya, Mali etc. and Indonesia, Mindanao Philippines.  Non have had Western intervention for decades.  As Samuel Huntington said the Islamic world has bloody borders.These are the factors I see:1 Islam is a young Manichean religion that copies from and is a reaction to Judaism and Christianity.   Because it is younger it evolved to outcompete those previous religions.  Mohamed was an Arab Nationalist who saw Arab paganism as inferior in comparison to the monotheism of the Christian and Judaic Tribes that populated the Arabic peninsula.   Its not surprise he used whatever technique would work to expand against the established religions, war, treaties, execution of apostates and the atheists of the day (plenty of them in the ancient world not only Greece)   rape of captive women, ransom.   Much of the religion is a rationalisation of these tactics and baser human  impulses.There is nothing like it anywhere else in the world.   The religion itself believes in theocracy.2 Arabic and Islamic Civilisation failed and there is intense anger and frustration.  Blaming the West is a way of scapegoating and externalising this embarrassment and develops a sense of social unity.3 At one point the Catholic church banned 6th cousin marriage  (see the Germanisation of Early medieval Christianity by Russel), and the Orthodox 8th.  This broke down tribal loyalties.4 Islam continued with consanguinity (inbreeding and 1st cousin marriage) and so could not build high social trust due to the problem of nepotism and tribalism.   The Baathists such as Asaad and Saddam Hussein were quite good at resolving this.   Two men I think were on the right track (apart from Hussein's imprudent war with Kuwait and his psychotic son)The war between Europe and Islam goes back to the Islamic invasion of Spain/Portugal, the Balkans, Byzantium even attacks on Vienna and slaving raids as far as Moscow and Warsaw.  Its a miracle the west survived, millions died defending it.</comment>

<comment>Ann Coulter is quite mixed up then, see e.g.,http://www.adherents.com/adh_p...And Jefferson had this to say about Presbyterians:  "I had no idea, however, that in Pennsylvania, the cradle of toleration and freedom of religion, it (fanaticism) could have arisen to the height you describe. This must be owing to the growth of Presbyterianism....  The Presbyterian clergy are the loudest, the most intolerant of all sects; the most tyrannical and ambitious, ready at the word of the law-giver, if such a word could now be obtained, to put their torch to the pile, and ... exterminate all heretics..."http://www.positiveatheism.org...I guess I can understand why Coulter would be a fan.What you say about the origin and design of Islam makes sense, but the Iranians were leaving all of that medieval nonsense behind in the 20th century.  It was in fact the British who rekindled religious fundamentalism to suppress rising nationalism and socialism.  I have friends who fled Iran with the rise of the Ayatollah and they say "mullah" used to be synonymous with "British spy."  The CIA overthrew the democratically elected Mosaddegh in 1953 because he wanted to nationalize the oil fields.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...étatThe medieval cultures like Saudi Arabia would have been swept aside long ago, but for our willingness to prop them up in exchange for access to oil.  They do public beheadings just like ISIS, over a 100 so far this year.  But, we give them F-16s because we like their oil.   And that is where the worst fanaticism originates.  15 of 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi Arabian citizens, yet we invade Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Yeah it is all the guy's fault who is saying what everyone is already thinking and is the truth. Illegal immigration is bad on every level for American citizenry. Legal Immigration exists to serve the country and people's interest, not the immigrant. It is the immigrant's responsibility to impress on us their worthiness and ability to assimilate, not on us to prove they aren't. Try to apply for citizenship in Canada or New Zealand. Let me know what they ask you. Hint: They will at least ask what your net worth is, career, and what you have to offer the host country at a bare minimum.</comment>

<comment>The highest levels of social trust are in orthodox jewish run diamond market.  The trust in the community is so high their transactions costs are extremely low.   No one else can compete because of the increased cost of lawyers, insurance, fraud.  The example is often used in academioc studies.   If you want to compete you'd need an equivalent religious order.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I have often thought the disproportionate financial success of the Jewish people is partially due to their resistance to assimilation, which then creates those very strong bonds within their minority position.  This is also what has triggered so much persecution.</comment>

<comment>That's only one reason.</comment>

<comment>Economists suffer from the anxiety of loosing their careers if they don't come out pro-immigration.The computer models used have a lot of factors that are only estimates.   In scenarios the factors if plausibly entered in certain ranges produce very negative outcomes.</comment>

<comment>Can you not see the H1-B VIsa and how it stagnates/depresses wages for American IT workers????Can you not see Disney firing a bunch of employees then replacing them with Indians at a fraction of the cost?</comment>

<comment>Which is especially funny given how many Moslems think artwork of any kind is haram.I'm imagining thousands of turban-wearing beardos shutting their eyes while drawing frames by frames. maybe thats why Disney artwork sucks these days!</comment>

<comment>The bulk of animation is done over seas...Asia.</comment>

<comment>Gah, 'turban wearing' would be more likely to be Sikh, not Muslim, and although Islam is a large proportion of Indian society you'd be far more likely to hire a Hindu or Buddhist indian than Muslim.  AND not all sects of Islam consider artwork is against their religion.  Egad, what kind of new dawn is it that has such low information?</comment>

<comment>The new dawn that finally realizes Islam is not just a religion, but rather a theocratic system that is utterly incompatible with the United States Constitution or Western values. Leftists have lost their minds with this alliance. They will be the first condemned by Islamic leadership for their support of gay rights, woman's rights, etc.</comment>

<comment>I never heard of a sikh. Asia as far as im concerned is a giant mess of strange faraway cultures and you really cant blame me for not telling the difference between a durpadurpa and a durpashurpa.</comment>

<comment>We accept lower wages based upon fear. A fear driven by greed which brought on the great recession. As unemployment rose, the average workers just did what they were told in order to keep their jobs. Raise a stink about your wages and out the door you go, there are many others who will fill your vacancy.</comment>

<comment>> free-marketer Herbert HooverIronic that you should bring up Hoover in a comment about Trump. Hoover performed the first forced repatriation of individuals of Mexican descent (mostly US citizens: http://www.npr.org/2015/09/10/... )Also, I think what you're looking for is the "lump of labor fallacy." The notion that there's a fixed amount of work in the world and every extra worker reduces the amount of available work (or supply of jobs) and thus wages are brought down for everyone.</comment>

<comment>Labor markets that are tight have increasing wages. Supply and demand.</comment>

<comment>Wages suck because the US lets other countries blatantly rob them.  When you are forced to train your H1B replacement, hatred becomes the rational response.Oversaturation is expected when you force your workers to train foreign nationals and universities sell out wholesale to educating foreigners as well.  You know, the ones we built and paid for to help our people in our country.</comment>

<comment>Manipulated stats for a government that loves its lobbyists who love cheap foreign labor and outsourcing.  If you think americans looking for jobs would do better anywhere else other than the US over natives you are insane, yet we allow the destruction of our industrial base to accomodate foreign workers.Include in your statistics the number of H1Bs that are naturalized while they stay here, you lie by omission.</comment>

<comment>Legally pales in comparison to biologically, and it is available in scraps because of what I stated.  The same people who destroyed the family just to double the workforce also force americans to fight as if the world were a free market when other countries use predatory practices with their currencies and with their labor against us.  Your extreme universalism is a fast road to extinction.Even if I don't win against the liberals and the cucks, the Mexicans will take up the fight as they hilariously turn on the political parties of this country once they are the majority.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, all those illegal immigrants coming into our country and lowering wages is the reason why our manufacturing went to China.  The logic is as plain as the nose on your face.</comment>

<comment>You must be stupid. Heard of PC? Of course, the diversitycrats do everything they can NOT to blame nonwhites for anything. That is the essence of PC. Illegals lower wages for ALL unskilled workers, even ones who have jobs without too many illegals competing for them. Wage levels across the economy as a whole are determined by labor productivity. But rising INEQUALITY is mostly due to mass immigration (though not sure if illegal is worse here than legal - not sure that inference can even be made), along with outsourcing (globalization).</comment>

<comment>I think it is even more bizarre that the Left and Right have become so out of tune with working class America that a fat cat like Trump have a platform</comment>

<comment>And. . .  continue to have his ties made in America, his golf courses and hotels cared for by immigrants, etc. He's taking people for a ride if they think he's going to change things that keep him wealthy.</comment>

<comment>It was the inevitable result of both parties accepting a certain economic philosophy and completely avoiding protectionism. Economists will shout from the rooftops about the danger of protectionism, and rightfully so, but obviously some amount of protectionism would make the working class feel like those in power care about their well being.And it really has been both parties. Democrats love to talk about republicans and outsourcing and union busting. But Bill Clinton did more to undermine the working class than any president in my lifetime.This is the path we have allowed ourselves to be taken down and these are some negative results of our choices. </comment>

<comment>Plus, it's really not right to call it "free" trade when the taxpayers of one country are spending 600B a year to maintain a global military presence whose main function is protecting international trade.  We should be funding at least half of our military with import/export duties.</comment>

<comment>Bingo. To address the Trump foreign production of ties thing, I would just reference Ayn Rand taking Welfare. She said it is moral to not support this system and still collect from it as it was her money they took in the first place. Her reclaiming a portion of it is not the same as politically perpetuating and supporting a failed idea.</comment>

<comment>The left don't care about the working class. They care about Jessica Jones fighting White privilege. Trump cares about the working class.  That's why he excoriated Disney for replacing Americans with foreigners.  (wouldn't have happened under Walt).   Trump is actually color blind, moreso than Mah People Holder.</comment>

<comment>No doubt the left and right are out of touch with the average voter.However with the Tea Party coming to fruition on the national stage the RINOs now actually have to act more conservative.  Look at what happened to Eric Cantor when he started slacking off.  They can at least keep those in theRepublicans on their toes bbecause they know people are not afraid to go Tea Party.The democrats have no other alternative.  Infact the core of their party has swung so far left they essentially abandoned those democrats who occupied the left of center.  If you ask me, this is why the Repubs went left.  They picked up the religious left and those thrown under the bus by the extreme left, thus moving the Repub Party more to the left of center.  I guess you could argue they are the older bluedogs, but whatever.</comment>

<comment>Yes indeed!  Fruit & vegetable, pickers, car washers, lawn maintenance workers, house cleaners, ditch diggers, et al are the chief reason why wages have been stagnating and even declining.</comment>

<comment>RIght, but the solution is to make all those immigrants legal, not to reduce their numbers.  The problem is not a finite supply of jobs.  The economy grows when more people join it.  The problem is when immigrants are illegal, employers can get away with paying them substandard wages, and that drives down wages for everyone else.</comment>

<comment>Yeah?  It has nothing to do with liberal multiculturalism and the corporations moving abroad, and the h1b visas, foreign student visas, fiancé visas and so on, stripping jobs from Americans?Bill Clinton used to say that the trade agreements were going to be sooo good for the U.S.!  He said that for every job we would lose in the U.S., we'd get an even BETTER high tech one!  What a fantastic liar.  And people believed him.</comment>

<comment>What Clinton said pretty much came true, until the Republican controlled Congress decided to cut the capital gains tax rate in 1998, turning a nicely growing stock market into an unsustainable bubble.  And, then what do you expect if you tax the proceeds of labor at a higher rate than capital?  Labor will move elsewhere and capital will gather a steadily increasing share of the nations wealth, triggering one speculative bubble after another as markets devolve into investors chasing other investors.</comment>

<comment>BS.  To encourage us to agree to rely on the "kindness" of corporations was a sick move on Clinton's part.  If you offer corporations a finger, they will take an arm, and they left us naked and helpless.  He's a corporate man, as are most Democratic Party candidates.  They never met a corporation they didn't love.</comment>

<comment>I hear you Colorado...there's no helping these folks that vote against their own self interest - let em eat cake. </comment>

<comment>The blames falls on those companies or corporations using this labor that undermines our wages.</comment>

<comment>Two things:Wage stagnation is not found across all levels of the labor force. Clearly wages have not been stagnating for the top quintiles by income.And, the majority of Americans receive health insurance through their employer.  The money employers pay for these non-wage benefits has been increasing vis-a-vis the amount they pay their employees in cash wages.This is why, when you look at stats like the employment cost index (which includes benefits) you see total compensation going up.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I agree that the employer sponsored (employee financed) health insurance is insane.But that said,  you seem to be claiming that when an employer  pays a huge portion of the employee's health insurance premiums, provides free to the employee fringe benefits and contributes to an employees retirement plan ... all that is _not_ compensation.If it's not compensation then what is it?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Value to whom, the employee?My point is simple.If US median income family ~50K in income is actually compensated at something closer to ~65K because of how much health insurance costs.  Or health insurance is 20% of total comp! This is why if you're discussing wage growth in the US, you need to factor in all those other real money outlays ascribable to employing people.</comment>

<comment>I am working class, I support Trump, not that bizarre. </comment>

<comment>For a white-shoe member of the WASP elite like FDR to become a working class hero was just as strange. Yet he did.Look through history, and you will see when the common people revolt against the rule of an established elite, they are almost always led by a member of that elite.</comment>

<comment>French Revolution comes to mind + 1830 and 1870 communes. It speaks volumes about human nature. Let's not think of Mexican or Russian revolutions and their leaders.</comment>

<comment>Wages have been stagnant since Reagan started waging a war of extinction against union labor. After an economic downturn, it was traditionally the unions demanding better contracts that started driving wages back up. Now with organized labor gutted, employers can continue to stiff workers year after year.</comment>

<comment>"…an overabundance of labour will tend to drive down its price, which naturally means that workers and their families have less to live on. One of the most important forces affecting the labour supply in the US has been immigration, and it turns out that immigration, as measured by the proportion of the population who were born abroad, has changed in a cyclical manner just like inequality."</comment>

<comment>There's a reason we call this thing "capitalism", not "laborism". I guess if people ever figure out that the whole point of "capitalism" is to transfer the fruits of labor into capital accumulation, then the Trumps of the world will have to stop calling it "capitalism". But so far, no matter how many times we very openly and publicly hear it called "capitalism", a lot of people still think that somehow workers are supposed to benefit and that it's not *really* a system designed to increase the returns on capital.What you're calling "wages... stagnating and even declining" is communist-speak for what capitalists call "controling costs".</comment>

<comment>Imbecile.No, its not bizarre.He's supported because of the policies he supports - which are HUGELY in favor of the working class.The fact that he's a hugely successful businessman is universally (except to you Marxists) seen as a positive: It proves he can function effectively as an executive.Only the Left cares about that class warfare nonsense you anti-Americans brainwash yourselves with.  In the real world, where people have to work for a living, we not only aspire to success but admire those that achieve it.On the Left, you all get your income by voting yourselves our income.  Virtually all of you either work for government or live off of it as helpless dependents.  You literally can not conceive of how responsible people actually think and what we believe.</comment>

<comment>"favor...working class" -  For starters, his opposition to the H1B Visa abuse by mega-corporations.  They are replacing millions of good paying American workers with foreigners simply because they can pay them, on average, 2/3 of what they pay us (and less than 1/2 the benefits).Then, obviously, the tens of millions of low (or zero) skill labor jobs currently occupied by illegal aliens from south of the border.  Did you know that, according to Obama's own monthly labor reports, over 40 million jobs in America are currently occupied by foreiners while nearly 95 million working age American citizens have no job at all?Try getting a job in the construction industry right now, as an American - just forget about it.  They can pay a illegal Guatamalan 1/3 what they pay you, with ZERO benefits, and don't even need to pay the payroll tax because they are paying them under the table.  Its almost as bad in fast food industries and with hotel staff.  Worse, the biggest corporations in America do the very same thing - aided by federal programs (paid for by our taxes) that not only allow them to hire directly from India, and anywhere else, with federal assistance in bringing the alien here legally, without EVER posting the job opening here in America so that we can apply.Tens of millions of jobs.Trump wants to shut all of that down, deport as many as possible, and make it extremely difficult for aliens to come here legally or illegally.If you can't support that, there's something seriously wrong with you.</comment>

<comment>Immigration is not why so many companies have fled the US. Our bloated government and tax policies are. It's gotten to the point where Mexicans are going back home to work in Mexico-based companies.</comment>

<comment>The wages stagnate because the economy changed. Big corporations squeeze everybody. Illegal immigrants came because even stagnant wages is better that they can get in their country, but they are not the reason, as many folks believe.</comment>

<comment>Like all the other candidates are working class, right?</comment>

<comment>i disagree - wages have been stagnating because the executives and investors in charge have been in a race to the bottom in a frantic effort to claim as large a chunk of the pie as they can, usually with some self-serving bullshit about "return on shareholder investment" or somesuch.if you want to argue that wages have been depressed by outsourcing and a shift to part-time, service sector.employment instead of full-time jobs with union protections and job benefits, there's an argument to be made...but as far as immigration, nah. tell me: are car companies and other manufacturers (the few which haven't left the country) hiring illegal immigrants to work the production line? because, by and large, it was the prevalence of those industrial trade jobs that drove the development of the middle class - those jobs provided a level of security and comfort allowing for establishment of other solid middle class support professions, like school teachers and nurses, once there was a tax base to support them.but the driver was a bunch of guys carrying lunch boxes to work every day. while there are always exceptions, most people weren't buying a picket fence and sending their kids to college on the strength of jobs cleaning hotel rooms or waiting tables or stocking shelves... and once those become the only jobs available, it's easy to see why the working class takes a hit.this stuff didn't happen by accident.are there industries where immigrant labor has depressed wages? sure! but agricultural wages were never very lucrative in the first place, were they? and construction... you can make the case undocumented labor has had an impact and you'd be right, but i'd argue legislation outlawing prevailing wage pay has done more damage to the ability of people to make a living in the trades.</comment>

<comment>You can be anti immigration. I don't agree with the position, but I respect it.What's getting to me is the unthinking reflexive rejection of all Muslims. Religious liberty is absolutely foundational to our republic.What's more, if you reject Muslims, you will DETRACT from the process of assimilation. This is precisely why some European countries are having so many problems. It's why Muslims there wall themselves off from wider society.Don't be a part of the problem. Differentiate between our own immigrants already here, and future ones you don't  want.</comment>

<comment>Many immigrants legal and illegal have no intention of assimilating into the culture of their new countries. Blaming it on rejection is making them part of a "victim" class...intentional balkanization where people maintain their culture and language is the reality - in many parts of America, Latino immigrants, many of who are illegal,  overwhelm neighborhoods and cities with Spanish language and culture.</comment>

<comment>As the child of an immigrant, that is, to put it mildly, nonsense.  Do you have any idea how many US citizens are descendants of immigrants?  German, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Honduran, etc...  Do you have any small businesses owned by immigrants in your community?  How about their children attending local schools?  It seems like you're just making stuff up.  I get there are pockets of communities where people gather because of cultural affinity, that has a long history (European immigrants), but that proves nothing.  A basic reading and understanding (!) of US history discredits your assertion.  Last point of reference, IF your point is accurate, how do you explain immigrants' efforts to have their children learn English and assimilate into US culture?  It would seem that they would attempt to keep their kids from assimilating.</comment>

<comment>In schools throughout California, teachers have to prepare two versions of lesson plans and exams: a normal one and a dumbed down one for "English learners". And this goes well beyond elementary school levels. Within plenty of immigrant and first generation communities these days, there is an appalling lack of English acquisition. </comment>

<comment>"Within plenty of immigrant and first generation communities these days, there is an appalling lack of English acquisition"And you know this, how?I happen to know-- or have known-- literally thousands of immigrants. I know of NOT ONE first generation descendant of immigrants who does not speak English fluently.Often, the reverse is true, the children of immigrants are less than fluent in their parent's language and many are embarrassed to speak anything but English. I've often had to encourage first generation descendants to not give up their parent's language and to be proud of their bilingualism.</comment>

<comment>I know it from teachers working in public schools in California. The situation you describe certainly exists, but is far from universal. </comment>

<comment>No, you don't know it from teachers working in California. I'm from California and the situation is the same there.Perhaps by "first generation", you only mean the young children of immigrants.If before entering school they only spoke their parent's language, then yes, they obviously would not be fluent in English. That is the point of bilingual education.Studies have shown time and again that children born of non-English speaking parents will lag behind other children for the first few years of school, but on average, they later will outperform the native English-speakers.By their teenage years, virtually all children of immigrants speak English fluently (granted, there will be rare exceptions).</comment>

<comment>Citation or your time and again studies are BS</comment>

<comment>You know, this is a common troll tactic to dismiss an argument.If I were writing a book or a college research paper, it would behoove me to cite all my sources.I read a lot. I read of these studies several years ago and have referred to them several times since then. I do not now remember the source.What that means is that I would have to do research once again to find the sources. I could certainly do that, but so could you.You are not going to pay me for my time nor are you grading me; thus, I feel no obligation to do the homework for you.You are free to thus ignore the claim, but you will need to provide evidence-- with citations to support the evidence-- if you wish to convince me.I know what I read; I have no idea where your opinion comes from.If and when you do the research and find that I am right, I expect you will offer me an apology.</comment>

<comment>This is not a verbal argument, therefore not a dismissive tactic, and google is your friend. I question that asking for the sources from which you make broad claims ANY TIME is troll behavior, but certainly not applicable to forum discussions. Asking for a citation on an outrageous claim such as what you have made is rational. "Citation please" on the internet means "I call bullshit on X, so back it up with Y, or shut up". Your infantile response and wall of text versus easily obtaining a link shows these multiple studies do not exist. You most likely DID do a cursory search and found nothing supporting your claim. Hence, whiny response about how you aren't going to work for me. Well it isn't me that compels you to share your views on this thread now is it? People who debate do so for the audience to learn. So, if you HAVE information regarding your claims, regardless of what I think, please share them and help enlighten the civil discourse. Otherwise, shut up.</comment>

<comment>"This is not a verbal argument, therefore not a dismissive tactic.."What does that even mean? One can't be dismissive of a written argument?Ok........I agree that asking for a citation on a claim, outrageous or not, is acceptable at times, but you certainly can't expect someone to remember everything he or she has read and what is the source.I've encountered this tactic many times previously. I will state something that, as far as I'm concerned is common knowledge, or should be, and I'm asked to cite the source.I don't know about you, but I don't have so much time on my hands that I can research every fact I cite. These discussions tend to be rather spontaneous and I depend on base knowledge, for the most part, to formulate my arguments.Oddly, many of these same people who ask for citations will swallow everything a right wing commentator says without question.Be that as it may, I did in fact google my claim. Rather than do all the work for you, however, I'll just give you a starting point.Google: bilingual children academic performance. (At least those were the search words I used.) The New Yorker had an interesting article which summarizes much of the research. You'll also find many more sources.Have fun. You can thank me later.</comment>

<comment>That's cool, but no. I asked for a citation. If it so easy why not just post the link that backs your claim? It is a logical fallacy to hold me accountable for proving your claims. It is called the Burden of Proof Reversal fallacy. Stop saying you are doing work FOR me (when you still haven't provided a one line link like I asked). It is YOUR claim, your burden of proof. As far as why it matters if it is a verbal argument over an online/written argument or not is due to the fact that providing a citation in a verbal debate is much more challenging and most definitely can derail discourse (which was your original complaint when I call BS). Which is also why most come prepared to verbal debates WITH citations on the things they want to impress upon their audience as credible."Oddly, many of these same people who ask for citations will swallow everything a right wing commentator says without question." --- Not an argument, and what is your proof they do no not research the claims of right wing commentators? Actually, it is more advantageous to look into it to further deconstruct opposing points.Also THIS was your claim: "Studies have shown time and again that children born of non-English speaking parents will lag behind other children for the first few years of school, but on average, they later will outperform the native English-speakers."NOT: Bilingual children academic performanceThese are not the same thing. Once again, citation on your claim. Not a wall of text explaining how it is a waste of time to answer a simple request. If you are going to BS everyone here, just don't respond.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but no.I understand. You're too lazy and afraid to have your white supremacist theory disproven.But no. You can do the homework. I already did half of it for you.As I said, I do not remember every single study I read several years ago and, despite your belief in your own superior intellect, neither do you.My citation can be found by googling the keywords I gave you. Several articles and studies appear under those keywords and most, if not all, support my claim. Those are my citations.Like I said, you're merely using a troll tactic. You know that no one can possibly remember the source of all his knowledge. By asking for a citation-- and refusing to do a simple thing like googling a few keywords-- you merely wish to poison the well.I don't post links nor click on links from unknown sources. You would have to be an even bigger fool than I suspect if you do.And yes, "bilingual children academic performance" is precisely what the discussion is about and is precisely what I claim. Children of non-English speaking parents who go to English language classes and who live in a predominantly English-speaking country will be bilingual.Yes, some children are born into bilingual households, but it is the very process of learning more than one language which fosters intellectual development. That applies equally to children of non-English speaking parents.I don't care if you want to hold onto your bias. I know cognitive dissonance is stressful. You can do the homework or not.My claim stands and I gave you enough information to investigate it further.If you choose not to, don't bother responding. But if you do, I will accept your apologies.</comment>

<comment>Your citation could be found by providing it. Once again you spent many times the amount of time it would take to provide this supposedly easy to find empiricism, writing and insulting me. Reinforcing logical fallacies with more logical fallacies (ad hominem) is not a defense for your lack of citation. I am not a white supremacist and race has zero to do with bilingualism as evidenced by the MANY languages employed by Anglo Saxons in Europe and around the world. Your claim does not stand just because you say it does. In the future when you debate, maybe try and use this as a guide to keep you from sounding ignorant: https://illuminutti.files.word...</comment>

<comment>I'm beginning to doubt that English is your first language.Three simple statements that you did not understand:One, I don't follow links.Two, I did not say you were a white supremacist. I said you believe a white supremacist theory.Three, I told you that my "claim" was something I read several years ago, and not online. Perhaps it was in Discover magazine or in a psychology journal or in some other journal; I simply don't recall.Thus, giving you the precise source of that claim would indeed require time consuming research.Nonetheless, I provided you with information that will lead you to several studies which support my claim, perhaps even the very study I read.Your argument that Anglo-Saxon "employ" several languages is irrelevant. We are discussing the children of immigrants and their academic performance.You seem to believe that developing bilingual language skills would NOT lead to greater cognitive development.THAT is the "outrageous claim".My argument that bilingual children often outperform monolingual children is practically self-evident. How could learning two languages (or several) not lead to greater cognitive abilities?The evidence is abundant and clear: bilingualism promotes cognitive development.Stop being lazy and afraid of the truth and do the research.Again, I am not writing a thesis paper, a journal article or any other scholarly work. I am neither being paid nor graded.I am merely on a comment board, trying to get people to think. You choose not to. That is your right.You have made what is an "outrageous claim". You have claimed, by negating my argument, that bilingual children of immigrants do not outperform monolingual English-speaking children.In a sense, you have posited the null hypothesis to my hypothesis.Do you have a citation to support the null hypothesis?</comment>

<comment>I am not going to humor proving a negative. I pointed out irrefutably your logical fallacies and you are just babbling the same ignorance over and over and I should believe you because a long time ago you may have read something in a magazine. Give me a break.First you said: "Studies have shown time and again that children born of non-English speaking parents will lag behind other children for the first few years of school, but on average, they later will outperform the native English-speakers." --- Non-English (with later learning English) speakers vs English speaker academic performanceI called BS and then you said: "And yes, "bilingual children academic performance" is precisely what the discussion is about and is precisely what I claim. " -- So now it has shifted to monolingual vs. multilingual academic performance.Then it changed to this after pointing out Bilingual Anglo Saxon cultures: "Your argument that Anglo-Saxon "employ" several languages is irrelevant. We are discussing the children of immigrants and their academic performance." --- Now it is Immigrant (non-English speaking -> English speaking) vs Native academic performance.Stick to a topic. These are not even close to the same demographics. Let us just stick to your last response: Provide a credible reference that immigrant children outperform native children after learning English.You can't, so you filibuster. By the way, according to your logic, your ignorant attack of: "I'm beginning to doubt that English is your first language." is nothing but a testament to my likelihood of being MORE intelligent, not less. Keep your claims straight, junior.</comment>

<comment>This really bothers you, doesn't it, the thought that those poor, ignorant immigrant children might have a cognitive and educational advantage over your proud, English-only American children?You pointed out not one logical fallacy. All you've pointed out is that I won't give you a citation that I don't remember.An ad hominem attack may or may not be a fallacy. If I am basing my argument on ad hominem attacks, then yes, it would be a fallacious line of argument, but I have not done that.As I said, you don't have to believe my claim. The very fact that you have spent more time justifying your refusal to google the keywords I suggested than it would have taken to simply do the google search tells me that you are not interested in being proven wrong.And "children of non-English speaking parents who later learn English" can be described with a single term: bilingual children. So yes, the two descriptions are equivalent. You're simply trying to muddy the discussion.As it is, I did you a favor.If I were to cite a source, say, The Journal of Linguistics, vol. x, issue y, pgs. 532-726, you would then have to do some time consuming research finding the issue in the archives of said journal, which may not even yet be available online.Instead, I gave you a few keywords (you could use others, if you wish) that you could google in ten seconds and be privvy to a plethora of both lay and scholarly articles, many properly cited themselves.Why is it so important to you to know presicely which article I read? The result is the same.And again, YOU made an "outrageous claim", that bilingual children do NOT have a cognitive/ educational advantage. Do you have a citation to support that claim?I posited a hypothesis, if you will. Attempting to prove the null hypothesis is, in fact, how hypothesis testing is done.Of course, I know the burden is not on you, but since my claim is, as I said, practically self-evident and, indeed, common sense (most people assume, without further evidence, that bilingual people are more intelligent), I have little burden to prove the claim to you either.At any rate, I gave you all the information you need to find ample support for my claim, thus removing whatever burden I had.As to links, I am not a computer programmer, but I have read (no citation. Sorry) that clicking on links is, in fact, how malware, viruses, etc. often enter a computer. In fact, many sites do not allow users to post links for just that reason.Perhaps you know better; I readily admit my ignorance on the subject. But, until convinced otherwise, I will follow the advice I've been given.</comment>

<comment>I pointed out your fallacies and you are hinging your entire argument on one. It is precisely what I am arguing with you about you idiot. Burden of Proof Reversal Fallacy: Laying the burden of proof those who question your claim. You have also projected White Supremacist ideologies on me for asking for a citation to your highly suspect claim. And you can't. Then you argue about malware. You are pathetic.</comment>

<comment>Not one fallacy.My mild insults have nothing to do with my argument, thus they are not relevant to an "ad hominen" fallacy. They are merely asides."Burden of proof reversal" fallacy would imply that I am making a claim that has no empirical support. For example, if I say, "aliens built the pyramids" and told you to prove me wrong, that would be a fallacious argument.However, I am merely repeating a claim made my other authors, and have not asked you to prove it wrong; I have simply told you that I don't remember the source. I did, however, direct you to several articles which support the claim I repeated, thus I have no burden to prove anything.Unless, of course, you are simply saying that I am lying about having read it, eventhough I can direct you to several articles which make the same claim. What point would there being in lying when I could easily cite one of those other sources?I don't cite those sources merely for the sake of honesty; I do not believe any of those (that I've seen thus far) were the original source that I read years ago.Thus, it is YOU who has made a claim without empirical evidence: you claim I am lying and place the burden on me to prove I'm not. Again, what point would there be in lying about having read an article years ago when I could just cite any of the several articles I googled, including the article in the "New Yorker" that I already cited?Your claim that I am lying does not hold up to reason.Again, you call my claim "highly suspect" and "outrageous" when it is really quite reasonable and intuitive: naturally, someone learning two or more languages would have an advantage for cognitive development.That is no more "suspect" or "outrageous" than claiming that someone who runs ten miles a day has an advantage for cardio health.The fact that you consider it "suspect" and "outrageous" is because it seems impossible to you that immigrant children (and let's be honest: were primarily talking about latino immigrants) could possibly be the intellectual equals or even superiors of American children.That is a belief in white supremacy  (or at least, American supremacy, although I suspect you would not be as incredulous if I said immigrant children outperform Latino Americans or African Americans).That is not to say you are a "White Supremacist", like a neo-Nazi or something, but you hold the belief that Americans (probably white European descendants) are intellectually superior to other "races" (except maybe Asians).The thought that that might not be true disturbs you, creates cognitive dissonance in your mind.I was not "arguing" about malware and it has absolutely nothing to do with my original argument. I merely said that that was why I don't click on links. I could still cite my sources; people did cite sources before the internet and "links" existed, you know.Your entire "argument" is fallacious at root. You can't refute my argument, so you try to poison the well by calling me a liar, by refusing to refer to the sources I provided and by trying to redefine the argument.My claim is simple: children born of non-English speaking children who are raised in an English speaking country ("immersed" in the English language) and who learn English in school (thus are bilingual) have an advantage for cognitive development and often-- not always-- outperform monolingual children.That's it. Support for that claim can be found in several studies by merely googling relevant keywords.</comment>

<comment>--- Burden of Proof Reversal Fallacy: Laying the burden of proof on those who question a claim. ---    There is no requirement that the claim be false, true, or backed up SOMEWHERE by evidence by "many" authors. The simple fact is: You made a claim. I rejected it. You demanded I prove it true/false for myself. That is the exact definition of the fallacy. You can argue if you want that fallacies are an acceptable form of arguing, but you can't refute the simple fact you are employing them.</comment>

<comment>Wow! You are really obssessed about this.It's been over five days and, I'm guessing, you still stubbornly refuse: a) to believe that I really don't remember the original source for my claim; and b) investigate the other sources I directed you to that support the original claim.That's fine. I understand you are afraid to have your belief in the intellectual superiority of white Americans shaken. It's sad, but understandable.Be that as it may, get this through your obstinate mind: I'm not even going to try to find the original source for my claim (although, more likely than not, I have the original journal/ magazine here at home). I stand by my claim and I've given you other sources to find the same claim. Take it or leave it; I will offer nothing more.The real question is this: can you refute the claim? That's all that ultimately matters.Now, here's another claim: Americans landed on the moon on July, 20, 1969. I can't cite my source for that claim either, but I could direct you to some other sources, if you'd like.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.... Ad Hominem attacks are not proof of the strength of your position, but rather demonstrate it's weakness. I did not ask you to provide study results from memory. I asked you to provide a reference as to your claims of these numerous studies.Burden of Proof Reversal Fallacy: Laying the burden of proof on those who question a claim.Ad Hominem Fallacy: Attacking a person's character, instead of the argument.You are the troll. I simply disagreed and asked for a reference. You have been squirming around trying to deflect instead of simply linking to one. If you had, then we could have had a debate, instead you reveal you are unwilling to do that.Also, dangerous links? Seriously? Dude, I am a computer programmer. You are full of sh*t. Sure, it is a possibility, but since I can read urls before clicking them I think I will be ok. Like say, if you linked to a research organization, foundation, university site, etc why should I fear following it? And if you provide a link to some ridiculous unprotected website AND I fall for it, my browser will ask me if I trust this site which has (99.9% certainty) no certificate of trust. Give me a break. You have no argument, just an opinion. It is nothing but that since you are providing scant logical points buried within logical fallacies and zero sources when asked for a citation. Your absolute rejection of easily providing one leads me to believe you cannot find one to lend credence to your claims.</comment>

<comment>Standardized test data disproves your wishful thinking. The outliers that do above average are children of Indian and east Asian immigrants. </comment>

<comment>Your first sentence contradicts your second sentence.</comment>

<comment>You apparently do not understand what outlier means.</comment>

<comment>I understand completely.Do you understand "average"?</comment>

<comment>Of course. And do you understand that Indians and east Asians are only a subsample of the entire population? Or that they are not recipients of the "bilingual" education that you defended earlier? The overall average is pulled down by much poorer performance of the larger population of non Indian/Asian immigrant children.</comment>

<comment>You have a poor understanding of statistics.First, first generation children of East Asian and Indian immigrants are a small percentage of the total number of all children of immigrants. Even if ALL of those Asian and Indian children outperformed American children, their influence on the average would be very tiny (unless perhaps they are outperforming Americans a thousandfold).However, we can be quite certain that not all Asian and Indian children outperform American children, so their influence becomes even tinier.The much larger population of first generation children of immigrants are latino and for the overall average to be still higher than American children, those latino children must be holding their own.Perhaps (although there is no reason why it should be thus), latino children only perform equal to -- or even slightly lower-- than American children, that would still be remarkable and would still negate your idea that the children of immigrants display an "appalling lack of English acquisition".Let's look at this this way:Assume we have 100 immigrant children (first generation descendants of non-English speaking parents). 10 may be Asian or Indian. Another 15 are from some other ethnic group/ nationality. 75 are thus latino. (Of course, I'm only estimating, but I think you'll agree it's a decent rough estimate for illustrative purposes.)Let's assume that 7 of those Asian or Indian children score 120 on an English proficiency test and the other three score 100 (100 being the average for American children). Then assume the children of the " other" group score 100 each.The average score for Asian/ Indian children is thus 114.The average for all non-latino children would be 105.6.So, in order for the average to drop below 100, the latino children would have to be 98.Therefore, even in this scenario, latino children perform 98% of the American average. Hardly an "appalling lack of English acquisition".</comment>

<comment>Your first paragraphs are actually in agreement with my point.Your original contention: "on average, they [children born of non-English speaking parents] later will outperform the native English-speakers."This population is majority Latino. Only in the minority subpopulation of Indians and East Asians is outperforming native speakers even remotely true. The Latino majority of immigrant children, and the overall population of immigrant children as a whole, continues to lag behind native born in English proficiency.If you have data showing that the majority of immigrant children are actually not Latino, I am happy to look at it. But you and I are of one mind in this respect.Your statement: "Perhaps (although there is no reason why it should be thus), latino children only perform equal to -- or even slightly lower-- than American children," How about a reason such as the truth? The educational bureaucracy in this country has obsessed with closing "the gap" between Latino students and their peers. Instead of made up numbers, here are some real data.http://www.pewhispanic.org/fil..."Among students that graduate from high school on time, Hispanics are much less qualified for college."PS, I have a graduate degree in electrical engineering.</comment>

<comment>Herrenstein and Murray showed, in the bell curve using pain staking multiple source data, that the IQ gap for Hispanics didn't  decrease significantly even in the 4th Generation.  Current SAT data shows this as well.Intelligence is a heritable characteristic.</comment>

<comment>You didn't really just cite "The Bell Curve", that disreputable, debunked piece of shoddy research.The critiques of Herrnstein and Murray's analysis are myriad, but one very fundamental problem stands out:The authors assume that intelligence can be reduced to a single, linear measurement.Beside that, IQ tests are by design culturally biased.I think it is reasonable to surmise that there is a genetic component to intelligence, but hardly the 60- 80% that "The Bell Curve" states.I suggest you read some of the criticisms of "The Bell Curve". </comment>

<comment>As the English say "The proof of the pudding is in the eating" and "The Bell Curve" has stood the test of time as all of its predictions ring true despite two decades of expensive educational intervention.There aren't many criticism's of the Bell Curve, there are however a lot of  polemics against it.We know g exists because IQ tests taken as young as 6 (older is better 15 is best) has such good predictive power.   It predicts your future income, SAT, stability of your marriage, number of accidents you have.It must be horrible to be forced to sit in a class room, not keeping up, the lessons not sinking in.  Day after day the new material seems more incomprehensible.  The worst of this is that rather than being taught competently skills you can absorb lessons that can't be absorbed are taught."g" is the concept of general intelligence, usually it is measured in terms of IQ which is based on average score on  a standardised tests on 15 year olds.   Older or younger performance falls of and correction factors are added in.g or IQ usually measures 16 factors of intelligence, roughly half in the visual spatial field and half in the verbal linguistic field.You or I could have very similar IQ scores but the weighing of the various factors are quite different.If you really want to dig further you'll find the weightings between races vary as well but these findings are politically incorrect as well.Because some people cannot bear to admit that human intelligence is genetic in any way, let me point to pages 652-653 of the book The Better Angels of Our Nature by a Harvard psychology professor named Steven Pinker. Pinker, author of several books and surely the most famous psychology professor in the United States today, says this about general intelligence, which is often abbreviated as "g": "General intelligence, moreover, is highly heritable, and mostly unaffected by the family environment (though it may be affected by the cultural environment). We know this because measures of g in adults are strongly correlated in identical twins separated at birth and are not at all correlated in adopted siblings who have been raised in the same family. General intelligence is also correlated with several measures of neural structure and functioning, including the speed of information processing, the overall size of the brain, the thickness of the grey matter in nthe cerebral cortex, and the integrity of the white matter connecting one cortical region to another. Most likely g represents the summed efforts of many genes, each of which affects brain functioning in a small way.'IQ tests were very useful to the military in the first half of the last century because many intelligent youth hadn't been well educated and in was important to identify who could perform best in challenging rolls such as electronics technician or guiding a fighter interception.</comment>

<comment>"There aren't many criticisms of "The Bell Curve".I'm not sure how many you consider to be "many", but the majority of researches on intelligence find the findings, and much of the theoretical underpinning, of " The Bell Curve" to be deeply flawed.The validity of IQ tests depends entirely upon what the researcher (and the culture in which he lives) considers to be "intelligence". Naturally, someone who scores higher on a test of what his culture considers " intelligence " will also perform better in that culture.I do not deny that there is a genetic component to intelligence, but that the effect is smaller than Herrnstein and Murray assume. Even Pinker, in your citation above, says "..though it may be affected by cultural environment."That is the key. Of course, the distinction he draws between "family environment" and "cultural environment" must be examined further. A family is a culture that exists within a larger culture.That aside, the distinction often drawn between "genetics and environment" is often characterized as "nature vs. nurture", as if the two are not interrelated.But gene expression is influenced by environmental factors, thus "nurture" affects "nature".One obvious way in which the "cultural environment" affects intelligence-- which may not be seen between families within the same culture-- is the effect of nutrition --both of the developing child and of the mother during pregnancy-- on the child's brain development.A child born in the United States enjoys a diet much more conducive to brain development than a child in, say, rural Guatemala. (As an aside, it is interesting to note that children born here of Guatemalan parents tend to be significantly taller than their Guatemala-born parents. Even something so strongly genetically determined as stature is affected by "cultural environment").Twin studies will not generally account for these differences because twins separated at birth often are raised in cultures at similar levels of economic development. It would be a bit more instructive if we compared a child adopted from a place such as Rwanda with his twin who remained in Rwanda.I don't know if many, or any, such studies have been done.Nutrition is not the only factor. We must consider exposure to chemical contaminants, such as lead, which negatively affect brain development;  the amount and quality of sensory stimulation the child is exposed to; and many other factors which affect brain development that vary not only between cultures but also between different socioeconomic milieux within a culture.A child raised in rural Alabama or inner city L.A. has a vastly different exposure to nutrition, health care, sensory stimulation, chemical contaminants, etc. than children born in Malibu or a wealthy suburb of Boston.If one takes random samples of all black children, all latino children and all white children in the United States, the latino and black children from impoverished environments would be highly overrepresented compared to the white children.Brain development-- regardless of educational opportunities-- may be more predictive of IQ and later successes, etc. than genetic inheritance. Again twin studies will not sufficiently control for this because the most crucial period for neural development is the during gestation. The prenatal environment-- and the mother's nutrition, exposure to contaminants, etc.-- is critical.Studies of intelligence-- the more fundamental issue of validity notwithstanding-- would have to control for all these factors that influence neural development. Comparing only black and latino children raised in highly similar physical environments-- and born of mothers with comparable nutrition, exposure to contaminants and access to prenatal care-- as white (and Asian) children would yield better results, but even then there are variables that are difficult, if not impossible, to control for.I'm sure you would agree that there are many black people, latinos, etc. who are indeed highly intelligent. Similarly, there are many white Europeans with very low IQs. This tells us that the racial difference between IQ scores CAN'T be merely a function of race. Yet even flawed studies such as that of Herrnstein and Murray only find a small variance in the average IQs of subjects.Sampling is everything. I have strong doubts that the sample of subjects used in the tests Herrnstein and Murray used were representative and weighted for all the confounding variables. </comment>

<comment>Spiffy Black Uniforms For All! Trump 2016!</comment>

<comment>Don't mock the sleek uniforms (chick magnet) and the cool rituals. That's actually one reason that many young men in Germany chose the "national solution" over the "international solution" when they were split between the two. Things like that matter. The people need that kind of thing to satisfy their emotional side-you must address passion.Some of the lower level German Communists realized this and suggested incorporating German nationalism (and they did, considering that the left was far from immune to the hyper-nationalism that was reality in 20s Germany), but the bigwigs insisted on copying Moscow's turgid rhetoric and eschewing spit and polish, which failed to attract those that weren't already converts.</comment>

<comment>My name is SgtKardashian, I'm afraid of telling the truth when it is inconvenient to my extreme egalitarianism. I am also ok with racism when it is against whites and jews and sexism is acceptable against disposable males.</comment>

<comment>The truth isn't your own biases being said.I'm not for anti-Semitism and racism against whites and sexism against men isn't real.</comment>

<comment>You can't discriminate based on color of skin if that skin is white or sex if that sex is male? Yeah. You are racist and a sexist by even claiming that. If you can't understand that VERY simple fact, well, I don't know how anyone can take you seriously. Male Tears coffee mugs aren't sexist because...reasons? Here, take anything you think is ok to lob at guys or whites and simply replace for women and blacks. Does it become offensive? Then it was ALWAYS racist or sexist. Just admit it. You think racism and sexism are fine against certain groups of people, that is why you claim it doesn't exist. Because if it DID exist, it would make you a racist and a sexist hypocrite.....which you are.</comment>

<comment>No. Sexism and racism have nothing to do with achievement or power, nor is it a politically judged issue. It is a moral and ethical issue. It is simply discrimination based upon biological and/or social characteristics.And because you brought it up, let's take an "academic" approach to defining our terms:Racism: "the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races."Sexism: "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."Your 1984 duck-speak redefinition of words serves no interest towards peaceful coexistence or mutual understanding.</comment>

<comment>Tribalism (Racism) internally cannot be completely voided from the human psyche as it is what helped us to survive. This is true even before we were the only remaining deviation of our evolutionary chain. Therefore it is only actions which can be seen as discriminatory. Speaking bluntly about an issue regarding race so as not to be a patronizing worm is righteous if done without hate. Ignoring and therefore expanding problems one tribe has with another, when legitimate and current, just to be polite, well that is the true evil. "Sticks and stones now break my bones when the words would have never hurt me"</comment>

<comment>Your use of the 'academic definition' of racism and sexism is obviously where you went wrong, and it also highlights the intellectual bankruptcy of our academic elite.  If one human being hates another human being based solely on their gender or skin color, that is sexism or racism.Adding power dynamics to the equation results in discrimination, which the current set of racists and sexists who are not in power will do once they do achieve power, or which is already happening.</comment>

<comment>My name is David Democrat, I'm afraid of White people in the US, so let me support autogenocide.  Let's bring in people from all over the world even if they hate us and just exterminated all the local Christians, have misoginistic attitudes to women, don't have many skills and cut up the VJs of girls.   That's kind, compassionate and they vote democrat.  Then when they resort to crime and fail at school we can simply blame White privilege and give them free stuff.  I'm crying already.  When they blow people up we can blame that on a reaction to xxxxphobia.  That's the way to build social cohesion!</comment>

<comment>That's something absolutely every generation says about their wave of immigrants. We said it about Chinese laborers moving into Little China and Chinatown, both of which are now American icons and tourist destinations. There were so many Germans in Pennsylvania that until WWI, German was America's de facto second language. Heck, so many Irish came over that we now celebrate Irish holidays in the form of St. Patrick's Day.And you know what happened? We all mixed in. Each of those groups are now American to the core. And Hispanic and Muslim immigrants will be no different. We'll eat more Tex-Mex and we'll add Cinqo de Mayo to our calendar of unofficial holidays and we'll speak a bit more Spanish in some areas, and in others we'll have little reserved prayer mats for daily prayers that Muslims perform, but it will still be seen as America because it will be America. Faith manages.</comment>

<comment>You can take it back further than that: the colony of Rhode Island was founded by Roger Williams, who was exiled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for having slightly different protestant beliefs than they did.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and the protestants would hang a Quaker on sight.</comment>

<comment>Great differences in tolerance over small distances: Newport, Rhode Island had a nascent Jewish community at the same time Salem, Massachusetts was having its infamous witch trials less than one hundred miles away.</comment>

<comment>Ah, Salem, MA: when a group of  hysterical women were running around accusing people of crimes, and the only proof was the girl's say so. Which, according to certain people of their time, was more than enough to convict and hang someone.My my, aren't we better these days? Wait, another campus rape claim?......</comment>

<comment>It's just a bit more complicated than that (or than Arthur Miller's The Crucible).  Stacy Schiff has an excellent new history of the time out called "The Witches."  I haven't finished it yet, but it's worth a read if you are interested in that piece of American history.</comment>

<comment>Maybe, maybe not. I look at the 1980s hysteria regarding satanic-day cares in the U.S. and the present-day rape-hoax hysterias and hate-crime-hoax hysterias on college campuses and can easily see a pattern where one group of people is viewed as beyond question and sacrosanct and their accusations turn into mass mob rule.</comment>

<comment>I recall reading a monograph or something once that posited King Lear was anticipating agrarian reforms in 1970s Peru.  You're kinda reminding me of it at the moment.</comment>

<comment>lmao. if you're so dumb as you can't see the connection between multiple historical and current instances where one group of people's wild claima of a crime was all that is required for conviction----well, you're just being ignorant.which, being a leftist, is your default position.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>So separate beliefs and separate people required separate states. Exactly what we are arguing today.</comment>

<comment>Germans, Chinese, Italians, Jews, Hispanic folks... list goes on and on.</comment>

<comment>Except that the only time you hear options is for spanish. As in "Press one for English", "Presione 2 para Espanol".We dont hear that for the other immigrants or descendants.The reason being that while most other waves of immigrants came because they hated their countries of origin whether for political, religious, liberties reason, they were escaping that past and so becoming Americans, the fastest the better, was a goal.Not so with Hispanics. The main reason for the immigration is economic, not cultural. Yes, they are trying to escape the corruption and thuggery of the powerful elites; but most latin countries are democratic (save for Cuba), so its not like there is a political persecution. Far from wanting to "disconnect"from their past, as other waves of immigrant did, they want to extend it in here.</comment>

<comment>You are correct about the history of assimilation in this country, but wrong about how it currently exists, or does not.  Today, there are labels and instructions for products in up to FIVE different languages, multiples of cable channels in Arabic, Spanish, Hindi, Chinese, Korean, etc. . .Entire cities, Dearborn, MI, run and governed, AND practicing Sharia law, women only swim times at the high school pool, etc. . . I just moved from Sterling Heights, MI, just north of Detroit starting at 14 mile road, where I spent since 2008 watching it turn from English speaking to Lebanese, Albanian, Chaldean(Aramaic), with plenty of Musulmans thrown into the mix and even some Maltese and Kurds. . .(and don't think there isn't hate BETWEEN them all as I have heard it and witnessed it myself), all with businesses having ONLY their language on the signs and menus.  They no longer have NEED to assimilate and they do NOT WANT TO!</comment>

<comment>RE: Dearborn, MI: That story has long since been debunked.See http://www.snopes.com/politics...</comment>

<comment>All of this romanticism of the past ignores the key differences between prior waves of immigration versus today's. Numbers are of the essence. Today's immigration is unprecedented in the context of the rate and proportion of foreigners settling in the US. 20-25% of Mexicans actually live in the US rather than Mexico. At no point in our history did we attempt to absorb 20-25% of the population of another country, be it Germany, Italy, Ireland, China, etc. </comment>

<comment>They also had a crapload of undeveloped land they needed settlers for. The immigrants were seen as a mean of securing the government's hold on the midwest and, later, the west-- because the fear was it would be lost to Indian tribes, Britain, Mexico, Spain, France, Russia, or any other power that established a colony and put people there.today we don't have a huge swath of unicorporated land we need to hold with colonies. so the times really are different.</comment>

<comment>cheap labor isn't "needed;" ---that's an illusion created by giant corporations to justify them getting immigrants at lower wages.  When we had very strong private unions in this country, their high wages (and strong border/few immigrants policies) went hand-in-hand with economic prosperity. (Indeed, the case can be made that there is a strong correlation to the 1925 immigration-closing--which cut off the supply of immigrants, and thus non-union competition---and the fact that unions started behaving like loyal, law-abiding Americans. We definitely had a lot fewer union-violence problems post 1925 than pre.).It's actually quite a simple concept that you non-Trump supporters don't get: his followers believe the American government should look out for American jobs and American interests. Most people can see how illegals take jobs away from their church members and family, whether white or blue collar. And we don't like it.</comment>

<comment>How many Chinese, Irish, and Italian terrorists did we deal with and was their a global jihad stemming from that demographic? What was FDR's reaction to WW2 and immigration from Germany and Japan? What did Eisenhower do with illegal Mexican immigrants?</comment>

<comment>Blacks have not assimilated, and are hostile to the culture. Mexicans are not assimilating, but loyal to Mexico. Jews are loyal to Israel first, America second. And China has a program encouraging mothers to fly to America and have anchor babies---confident those children will be loyal to China, not America.And those immigrants that did assimilate? The Irish took American politics from a thoroughly just affair to the squalid conditions of Tammany Hall--the Progressive movement took a century to actually get semi-clean elections again. The Irish, Italians, and Jews made inner cities into no-go zones, turning downtown New York into a violent place of crime, where bodies were found daily out in the open. The non-immigrants rose up, and began demanding assimilation forced down their throats----cutting hair, losing the old language, pledges of allegiance, loyalty oaths, election reforms, heightened police activity, Victorian morality laws, and prohibition....You can pretend reality is other wise and wave some children's-story-fable  about melting-pot b.s., but you're as ahistorical as claiming the Egyptians were black. You're spouting a fantasy that has no basis in reality.Grow up, dummy.</comment>

<comment>This is not new.  Immigrants have long clustered in neighborhoods where they can live with other immigrants from their own countries, speak their own languages, continue their own traditions, shop at their own stores, worship at their own churches/temples/mosques, etc.This lasts about a generation.  Their kids learn English, get educations and jobs, and join the mainstream.  Economic forces drive this transition.  By the third generation, they're assimilated.Most of the Hispanic folks you're complaining about are relatively recent first generation immigrants.  So it's no surprise that they cluster in certain areas, speak Spanish, and generally stick together.  Prejudice against them may even slowing down the process of assimilation.</comment>

<comment>lol. right. it's *our* fault for not being nice to them that they aren't assimilating.I forgot how no one in the past ever suffered dislike until us.No, Mexicans are not integrating. They are remaining loyal to Mexico. One famous one boasts about voting in Mexican elections!The melting pot is a myth.</comment>

<comment>For vast majority of the immigrants, their intentions are simply irrelevant here. Even for the most hardcore immigrants, their children will almost always be exposed to the US realities around them - be that in school or later at work. Their children's children will inevitably become Americans.</comment>

<comment>lol. nope. History is pretty clear: a large group of immigrants that the government takes no strong steps to force assimilation upon will remain a hostile power.See: the Gothic immigration into the Roman Empire. The Goths caused Rome to fall.</comment>

<comment>LOL. yup.Did you check the state of Roman Empire before the Goths showed up? It was decaying for centuries at that point.</comment>

<comment>lmao.oh yes, the gothic invasion had NOTHING to do with the fall of the Roman Empire. They NEVER sacked Rome, NEVER marauded throughout the empire, NEVER set up their own kingdoms, NEVER ravaged the land. (/sarcasm).*giggle*</comment>

<comment>If an immigrant is unlikely to become middle class and he/she has many, but many, cohorts balkanization seems assured.http://www.pewhispanic.org/fil... Nearly three-in-ten (29%) have less than a ninth-grade education; an additional 18% have some high school education but have not completed high school. The proportion of unauthorized immigrants with either less than a ninth-grade education or less than a high school education is roughly double the share of legal foreign-born residents with those educational levels. It is far greater than the share of U.S.-born adults—only 2% of those ages 25-64 have less than a ninth-grade education, and only 6% have additional years in high school, but no diploma.</comment>

<comment>It is just in your mind that people are anti-Muslim, they are just anti getting blown up. If stopping or slowing or controlling Muslim immigration keeps them from getting blown up, they like that.The other part is a myth created by Trump's detractors who are desperate to label him a bigot, fascist, etc. That want to turn what is possibly a good idea which needs discussing into something that will benefit them by damaging Trump. Apparently you have bought it. </comment>

<comment>So well worded, greatest comment of the day. </comment>

<comment>and how many muslims have been terrorists in the past decade in the US? How many mass shooters have been christians? How many jailed people are christians? Osama Bin Laden would have a field day if he could have witnessed how the land of the free became this!</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the American Society of Mitigators. A is bad but B is worse so A is less. I don't buy that. Technically we lost only 3,000 people in the 9/11 attack or 0.0000093 of the total population. So, that should have been worth 2 minutes on the news and on to the business report. But life is not like that.</comment>

<comment>Seems like so far, I am in a greater danger of being blown up by a white Christian than a brown Muslim. I am looking at statistics of the last 10 years.</comment>

<comment>So?</comment>

<comment>So being anti-being-blown-up, I would vote for closing any radical Christian churches, as well as Fox News. Those seem to be closely related to Christian terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Radical Christian churches? How radical? Where? Sounds interesting.</comment>

<comment>This guy comes to mind:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... - supported Trump, by the way.Also this one:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... - yet another Trump lover.</comment>

<comment>So, you have links to two ministers who hate Muslims, homosexuals & etc. Have they recommended killing anyone? Have they ever suggested bombing synagogues or mosques?You can't see a greater risk from Muslims who actually kill people and actually blow them up? To me, THAT is radical. Frankly I think you are beating a dead horse here.</comment>

<comment>> Have they recommended killing anyone?Yes.> You can't see a greater risk from Muslims who actually kill people and actually blow them up?No, I don't. Because as the recent attack on Planned Parenthood shows, Christians also actually kill people.</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the Amecian Society of Mitigators. I find it difficult to equate a few people being killed by a lone gunman at a Planned Parenthood clinic with the killing of 3,000 Americans (now more), the destruction of the Twin Trade Towers the blowing up of the Pentagon. But, Mitigators are good at that.</comment>

<comment>That's cute. Now please explain what is it in Trump's policies that attracts this kind of support from the violence instigators?</comment>

<comment>I don't understand that question. Are you asking why people support restricted immigration? I guess the answer is they think that is a way to reduce the chance of getting blown up.</comment>

<comment>No. What I am asking is: Why Trump, out of all the candidates, is the most popular among the radical crowd?</comment>

<comment>If you are more worried about getting blown up by a terrorist than dying in a car accident, you are a fool.  You are also behaving exactly the way the terrorists want.  Do you think the ISIS fighters are ready to abandon their values or call for a new stategy whenever 14 of them get killed?</comment>

<comment>Dear mitigator, you are rather audacious to tell us what Muslim fanatics think. What they think has nothing whatsoever to do with what you think or hat America, Europe or the world thinks. God has told them what to do and they are going to do it.ps this thread is about Muslim immigration, not car accidents. More people die from bee stings than shark ticks but people are more afraid of sharks. So what?</comment>

<comment>Most people call the Muslim fanatics terrorists, which means their aim is to create terror.   If you were to realize it is less likely to be blown up by a Muslim fanatic than killed in a car accident, maybe you wouldn't be so frightened, and then that aim would fail.</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the Society of Mitigators! Are you a new member? A is bad but B is worse so A is less. I don't think so.The 3,000 people killed on 9/11 were just 0.0000093 of the American population. So, using your logic, they should have got 45 seconds of news and then over to the business report. People just don't think that way and you sure aren't going to change them--or me.</comment>

<comment>But I will sure keep trying.  Our own over-reaction to 9/11 created far more misery than the terrorists ever did.  4000+ soldiers killed, 1 million wounded, trillions down the drain, half a million Iraqi's killed (no wonder they don't help us out against ISIS), all to create a breeding ground for ISIS, and all the horrors that has brought.  Yes, we would have been far better off to have gone right on to the business report.The 3000 peopled kill on 9/11 were about what we lose in a month on the highways, brutal unexpected deaths to innocent men, women and children, most of which could be eliminated simply by lowering speed limits.  But, we put up with it for the convenience of getting around faster.  We are capable of coping with tragedy.   Let's not make it worse for ourselves or let demagogues exploit these events for their own aims.Obama is on exactly the right track.  Patiently beat them down without a lot of fanfare.  Let them collapse from the weight of their own backward ideology.  If we lose a few 100 more people to terrorist attacks, life will in fact go on.</comment>

<comment>This will probably be a war of 30-100 years. the Crusades lasted 200 years. We can't fight like WWII which lasted 4-yars. We can't bomb the poop out of Middle East for 100 years.Obama's strategy is right on. Its main fault is  it can't be made into a "Gone with the Wind" because it has no leading man only stealth, one-at-a--time killing, drones and such.Maybe we could fluff up the hunter-killer teams, sort of a militarised Mission Impossible. It would b really really foolish to underestimate the enemy. Americans are gonna die.</comment>

<comment>As long as we stop letting Christians in too then.</comment>

<comment>Of all the groups suffering from the Muslim fanatics, it is the Christians who are an endangered species in the Middle East. Just 5% remain of the population that lived there after WWII. More than 1.5M have fled in the last few years, not to mention those killed. But in your strange world of fairness, they should be treated equally to the very people who did this to them.</comment>

<comment>1) I do not live in the Middle East, but the United States, where I am FAR more likely to be killed by Christian terrorists than Muslim terrorists so Middle Eastern (or European) security concerns play little factor in my concern for personal safety. 2) ISIS kills FAR more Muslims than Christians: http://www.thedailybeast.com/a...Shocking news: terrorists, be they Christian or Muslim, are not the friend of moderate Muslims or moderate Christians.But to go back to the original point, if we are going to start excluding refugees, tourists, and immigrants on the basis of religion, yes, I would like to exclude the religion that is more likely to kill me if we are excluding the one that is not. For the record, we could also just behave as Americans, and real Christians, and welcome all people who seek a better future. As we have done (with a few exceptions, like Jews during WWII) since we first emigrated here some 300 years ago (and then killed everyone who already lived here).</comment>

<comment>Being high-minded is fine, being blown up is not so good. A wise people worry about being blown up first and being high-minded second.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. This is why, to the extent I worry, I worry about Christian terrorists. Similar to the way that if I need to worry about travel, I worry more when I am in a car than I do when I am in a plane. But in addition to the statistics, some of this is attributable to me personally since I work for a huge hospital system, and deal with tons of Muslim physicians, none of whom seem likely to kill me or my thousands of coworkers, whereas I know the propensity of Christian terrorists to shoot and bomb healthcare providers.</comment>

<comment>I spent 15 years in Muslim countries of Africa and the Middle east as a health care provider mostly for WHO. I used to joke and say, "there isn't a Muslim I know I haven't cut."  My best friends are Muslim. I have never been treated better. But, the people who treated me so well are still there. They are not trying to enter America. they are still doctors in their hospitals.I have a high regard for my Muslim friends and we sit around drinking coffee and we are just as amazed an confused as everyone else about what to do. But, my regard for them does not stop me from seeing the faults of their religion and the danger it poses.</comment>

<comment>Well then you know better than most, there is nothing to do other than screen as best we can. If you really are a doctor, you also know that's all we can do for people who will end up committing violence born here, Muslim, Christian, or otherwise. The faults you find in Islam exist in all religions. (Lord help us all if anyone takes the bible's recommendations re. stoning people to death as a battle cry). Some Muslims are going to kill people in the name of Islam. In all probability, they are already here. Some Christians are going to kill people in the name of Jesus. They are definitely already here. There are 1.6 billion Muslims on Earth. To cast a net over all of them is decidedly un-American. We could of course simply limit everyone's access to weapons of mass destruction, but as seen recently in California and Colorado, we have little interest in doing so. Since we won't do that, we just have to live with the fact that every extremist living here is just a quick purchase away from being able to kill dozens of people with relative ease. That's the country we as voters collectively choose to inhabit.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, you are dead wrong. The Christians were violent after the Reformation but after several hundred years of warring amongst themselves they stopped. The Muslims haven't. They have been told by Mohammed thru the Koran and Hadith to wage jihad. the ISIS people are NEVER critisized as apostates. No Muslim would dare to do that because ISIS is well-rooted in Islamic theology and they are doing EXACTLY what Mohammed told them to do. You cant shame facts into changing.We were once in the souk in Saudi and we were rounded up and forced to watch an execution. It was a couple convicted of adultery.  They were put into garbage bags and thrown off  minerette.Yes  minerette of  mosque. Seen any Christians do that?"we just have to live with the fact that every extremist living here is just a quick purchase away from being able to kill dozens of people with relative ease."Wrong again. We may have to put up with the terrorists who are already here, simply because they hide but we sure can keep more from making trouble by ending Muslim immigration. You can take the moral high road and try to shame us into being stupid but the moral high road is the road to getting blown up.</comment>

<comment>A different source:«Fr Rutler adds that “Christians are not a significant part of the immigrant tide flooding Europe from the UN camps in Syria, Jordan and Turkey because Islamic terrorists have driven them out of those camps for refusing to convert. …You almost never hear of the plight of Christians as a group within the wider refugee question. But as fellow Christians we should be aware of it. Do we not owe some loyalty to thembefore our general humanitarian response to the other 90 per cent? This is not to be hard-hearted, but to recognise that we have deep and ancient affinities with persecuted Christians in the Middle East that we do not have with Muslims, because the former share our faith and the latter do not.»Being nice and stupid sometimes end up being the same thing.</comment>

<comment>As a female, I am also against accommodating or normalizing a religion that is anti-woman. In Islamic countries, Muslims do not accommodate religious or ethnic minorities but actively persecutes them or kills them.  I'm living in the United States because my grandparents were kicked out a country that was intolerant to its Christian and ethnic minorities yet we are supposed to welcome people of a faith that does not welcome other faiths and people with open arms.</comment>
