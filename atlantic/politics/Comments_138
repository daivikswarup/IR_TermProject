<comment>I'd have greater faith in hoping a self created billionaire could spend his fortune wisely than in a government spending his fortune wiselySometimes it feels as if people just want to hate billionaires- they're bad when they have a lot of money because ostensibly they earned it at the expense of poor people, and they're bad when they give it away because they don't know how to give it to poor people effectively enough</comment>

<comment>Some of your points are true, but the billionaire in question has a long history of doublespeak and flat-out dishonesty.For example, Facebook publicly opposed the CISA act, and at the same time secretly lobbied to support it: https://twitter.com/snowden/st...Another example: Facebook's Internet.org charity is little more than a tax exempt front designed to place more eyeballs in front of FB's advertising. Its PR propaganda claims Facebook is providing internet connectivity and resources for poor, third world web developers.But as with all things Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, you need to read the fine print. These aspiring programmers can't use Internet.org's infrastructure to create modern webpages, rendering it useless for its stated purpose, but they *can* use it connect to Facebook and its data hoovering APIs, which in turn means Facebook makes money from this so-called "charity" -- serving ads, reselling private information, etc: http://bit.ly/1RvAX3a</comment>

<comment>I would venture to say if MZ had developed a cure for cancer, you would still be denigrating him because he was rich, and you are poor and stupid.</comment>

<comment>qaz zaq resorts to name-calling, whereas glasskey provides concrete arguments. I would venture to say that glasskey is using critical thinking skills, while qaz zaq is not.</comment>

<comment>I'd venture even further out and say that qaz zaq should just be dammed happy that the USA's greatest socialism construct, our esteemed Military, was willing to take his/her/it on. Helps keep her off the streets and gainfully occupied. An imperfect solution to what could have been a multi-million dollar problem (preemie crack babies; a life of crime and/or incarceration, at far greater cost to both public and private sectors...)</comment>

<comment>MZ's level of duplicity strikes me as about average for a tech billionaire--about the same as Bill Gates, a little better than Larry Ellison or Steve Jobs, a little worse than Larry Page or Sergey Brin. Compared to most politicians, it's definitely below average.It would seem that, if you want to help the poor, it's pretty inevitable that the money will pass through the hands of some pretty dishonest people.</comment>

<comment>Yes, too bad Zuckerberg and Chan are the exception rather than the rule when it comes to billionaires. But even that kind of giving depends on what mood the giver is in: Perhaps their worldview is as colored by their own biases and prejudices as Andrew Carnegie's was.There are rich churches in relatively affluent areas to which $10,000 means one thing, and poor churches with poor parishioners to which it means quite another.Or, to put it another way:One Monday morning I was trapped in my dentist's chair when I heard a quiet, shy young man approach the receptionist (hat in hand, stuttering -- I couldn't see him, but could imagine). He had been told that Dr. B saw emergency cases on Mondays. To which the receptionist replied, You heard wrong: You'll need an appointment, insurance...are you even a patient?The thing is: I could tell the boy was in great pain. And Dr. B DID see walk-ins on Mondays. At least, I had never had a problem. None of us here have ever had such problems. The kind that just keep piling up until it is almost impossible to dig out.Let the private sector handle it? Fine, if it will. But as we've seen in the way it runs the United States of Corporate America, we both know it cannot, and it will not.</comment>

<comment>The US is a corporatist, crony capitalist state, not a free market one. You cannot blame its failing on capitalism in the laissez-faire variety.</comment>

<comment>Laissez-faire tends to degenerate into crony capitalism given time. Ironically without a strong state to protect competition in the market you end up with corporations becoming the state.</comment>

<comment>That's a pretty controversial statement. Could you provide evidence? We have a far stronger state now than we did in the 19th century but I only see more crony capitalism than then (and contrary to popular perception the 19th century was hardly the lost golden age of laissez-faire).</comment>

<comment>By a strong state I mean one that carries out the national interest. Bigger does not mean stronger, though strength requires some amount of size. For example you could be a 300-lb. obese person (our current state), or a 220-lb. athlete (a strong state), but not a 100-lb. weakling (a minimal state.)</comment>

<comment>That's a strange definition. Totalitarian states are pretty strong. Do they carry out the national interest? Define 'national interest' by the way. Nations are just different people living in an arbitrarily designed boundary with a vast array of different interests and personal projects. Apart from 'Well everybody living here probably doesn't want to be invaded and killed' what common interest can you think of?</comment>

<comment>> Totalitarian states are pretty strong.They are deceptively weak, and prone to erratic violence. I would compare them to steroid users in my analogy.>Apart from 'Well everybody living here probably doesn't want to be invaded and killed' what common interest can you think of?That is for the people living within the state to decide. A prosperous economy, good infrastructure, education and health care are probably the things that most inhabitants would want. Some states, like the US, will add a "destiny" interest as well (melting pot, etc.) Others will not.</comment>

<comment>I suppose you meant deceptively strong. But surely you can imagine (indeed you can find examples from history) of stable tyrannies. The idea that a state is not strong because it serves narrow interests is misguided.Yes sure we all want to be richer rather than poorer. If you're talking about public goods, yes. I wouldn't put education or health care there since they are neither non-excludable or non-rilvarous and those are the two characteristics of pubic goods in economic theory. That does not mean there aren't other reasons you'd want to provide some measure of health care and education.</comment>

<comment>What are some stable tyrannies? Even the Soviet Union only lasted 70 years. I can't see N. Korea lasting much longer either.</comment>

<comment>I see, you're speaking about long term viability. It's a different metric but I take your point.</comment>

<comment>By definition, a "strong state" is strong enough to force taxpayers to subsidize favored corporations or impose regulations falling unevenly on large and small businesses.No matter how cleverly designed, the wealthy class has both motive and means to corrupt any political system, using it to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of us.A government too weak to do that, on the other hand, is unable to suppress competition to these favored corporations.What's the point of corrupting politicians lacking power to grant favors?</comment>

<comment>A weak state will inevitably be taken over by a stronger one, or by the strongest corporation that will set itself up as a de-facto state (i.e. East India Company)</comment>

<comment>I think you're conflating military weakness with decentralized political power.  There are many militarily weak countries that haven't been "taken over" by stronger ones, so there's nothing "inevitable" about it.Ultimately, national security arises from potential enemies seeing military invasion as costing more than can be recouped by looting.In any case, what does government being denied the power to dispense political favors by forcing one group to subsidize another have to do with resisting invasion?What difference does it make who controls the state if it has no power to suppress competition?  The East India Company is not an example in support of your position.  It was backed by the military might of the British government (the empire on which the sun never set).The British government ruthlessly suppressed competition (giving up only when it became too costly).  Government is the source of monopoly.</comment>

<comment>>There are many militarily weak countries that haven't been "taken over" by stronger ones, so there's nothing "inevitable" about it.Only in modern alliance systems, which are always anchored by strong states.>Ultimately, national security arises from potential enemies seeing military invasion as costing more than can be recouped by looting.Requiring some degree of military strength at least!>What difference does it make who controls the state if it has no power to suppress competition?Such a power inevitably arises.>  The East India Company is not an example in support of your position.  It was backed by the military might of the British government (the empire on which the sun never set).I think you have your history a little backwards there. The British military only moved in once the East India Company had gotten into trouble and was no longer profitable, but India had become strategically important to Britain by that point.</comment>

<comment>Something I learned in the early sixties from The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer is even Nazi Germany (with extremely centralized political power) had to engineer public opinion to start a war.  When's the last time a democracy (with far less centralization of power) invaded another democracy?In any case, conflating military power with centralized political power misses the point.  What you're arguing is centralized government is necessary to stop corporate power, but that merely exacerbates a bad situation.Any political system, no matter how carefully crafted, is vulnerable to corruption by big money interests.  (The Founding Fathers did a remarkable job.  It took a long time for Constitutional protections of individual rights to erode.)The reason centralized power cannot protect us from corporations is because whatever power government has is co-opted by those same corporations and used against the rest of us.  Doesn't this seem inevitable, given their motive and means?The solution is to reverse course and radically decentralize power.  A good starting point would be ending the thing that makes corporations different from fancy partnerships:  non-consensual limits on liability.If government is denied the power to impose regulation, then said regulation will not fall more heavily on small businesses.  If government is denied power to suppress competition, then the problem of monopolies disappears.Regarding the East India Company, if it "got into trouble and was no longer profitable," so it had to be bailed out by the taxpayer funded British military, how does that not support my position?Clearly, the East India Company was unable to impose its will without the centralized power of a state behind it.  The remedy you propose for limiting corporate power, instead of tightening their leash, gives them the tool to be more abusive.For example, didn't the East India Company have a salt monopoly?  If government didn't have power to enforce that monopoly, what would prevent others from getting into the business and forcing prices lower?Centralization of power is not inevitable.  What's necessary to decentralize is for enough people to understand the cost to them of centralization.  The more clearly they see that the system enriches insiders at their expense (and more importantly, understand why this is so), the more willing they'll be to support true reform.It all rests on consent of the governed.</comment>

<comment>Why didn't YOU offer to give up your place and pay for this poor guys treatment?  Well I will tell you.  It is easer and more fun to complain about the "rich".   Rich being people who are smarter and work harder than YOU.</comment>

<comment>Stupid knee-jerk anti-government reaction. The author's point is that charitable contributions from the wealthy didn't address poverty, but public policy did, and quite successfully.</comment>

<comment>That depends on what you mean by "addressing."If government programs ended today, poverty in America would be at worse levels than it was before government ever got involved.  Government does a good job of providing a salve, of lifting people (barely) above the poverty line, but these programs don't sustain themselves, because they don't address the underlying reasons why people are in poverty to begin with.And of course, government has applied resources on a scale that all of the philanthropists together can't dream of.  The federal government spent 74 billion dollars on SNAP ("food stamps") in 2014 alone.  You'd need 1.5 Zuckerberg fortunes a year just to sustain that program, and we're not even talking about housing, education, health care, etc which are also large expensive outlays.The best use of private money is in looking for either very cost effective programs that government isn't addressing (say, the Gates foundation's attempts to make mosquito nets ubiquitous in Northern Africa in order to fight Malaria), or by experimenting with non conventional, unproven ideas that government can't rightly touch.</comment>

<comment>"If government programs ended today, poverty in America would be at worse levels than it was before government ever got involved."  Pure fantasy, you have no proof of this.  For example, if Medicare was abolished, a more efficient mandatory private system could take its place (but then the government couldn't hijack its funds).  Were Americans starving to death before food stamps?  Show me the headlines.</comment>

<comment>This is fantasy.  If Medicare goes away no private system will replace it, because no insurance company will charge anything approaching an affordable rate to elderly people who consume far more medical services and have more medical needs than the rest of the population.  The elderly, as a group, are the most expensive customers a health insurance company can have, I doubt they would take on these customers unless forced, or bought off in some way.And the idea that a mandatory anything healthcare related would get through the current congress is a nonstarter. What is this more efficient private system?  Euthanasia?</comment>

<comment>My Medicare costs are about the same as my current insurance with a private carrier.  Part B is $104  part D is $18 and part N (to cover the gaps is $130. All per month.  My Private policy is about ($225) with the same level of  coverage. In other words they are about the same.  You have no idea what you are talking about.  Medicare part A is free but coverage is very limited paying only for limited time hospitalization.  I will stay on my private insurance until I am forced off.  I do not trust the government, and since you are obviously a young fool, I suggest you shouldn't either.</comment>

<comment>Until I am forced off. Ah ha. And why will that happen?  Eventually the risk is too much for them.  You obviously are still healthy, but that will end one day, often without warning.  And I really wonder what kind of private policy my in laws would be able to get, since they're seeing doctors all the time for a variety of chronic issues, including a couple of hospitalizations totaling several weeks last year.  No private carrier would want them.I have plenty idea what I'm talking about.  I know what heath insurance costs in the priate market for healthy people who only need to see a doctor a couple times a year.  I know what the government pays for Medicare, 14% of the federal budget, roughly $500 million, and that your part B is cheap because it's subsidized by the government you hate while you gladly take its benefits.  Wee bit of  cognitive dissonance here.If private companies had that business, there would be some savings, as Medicare can't negotiate prices, but not that much because of the need for profit and administrative duplication of multiple companies. If the Feds were not in heath care, it would be a crushing expense for old people, and life expectancy here would decline. You're the one that doesn't know what you are talking about.I also know a lot more people frustrated by ridiculous coverage decisions made by private carriers (before and after the ACA) than people disappointed by Medicare.  Private insurance is no panacea.  </comment>

<comment>Unfortunately statistics bear out that poverty in America is exactly the same percentage of the whole as it was during the Great Depression.Nothing has changed for the working class.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. Public policy perpetuates poverty. The greatest forces behind poverty today- the war on drugs, mass incarceration, bad government schools, a vast array of misguided wage and labor market regulation- are products of the state.</comment>

<comment>And don't forget government regulation driving small business OUT of business.</comment>

<comment>Thank god it isn't at 30, 40, 60% or more, and widows, orphans, and disabled vets aren't begging alms on the streets. Yet. In all fairness, the power elite probably do the best they can with the Tax Code and their bought-and-paid-for politicians.

<comment>The reason why government is inefficient at getting some things done is because of the people who make the decisions, not because inherently government is unable to execute.  Think of private citizens like Zuckerberg a government with only one political party.Rather than focusing on its inabilities, imagine what we could accomplish as a country if we demanded that our political leaders learn how to function and execute or face being replaced.</comment>

<comment>Right, one party systems , like the USSR, worked much better.  LOL</comment>

<comment>That's not what I'm suggesting, at all.  I am saying that one of the reasons why corporations are perceived as more efficient is because they have a unified vision and goal.  There isn't an "opposing party" to convince, negotiate and compromise with.</comment>

<comment>Never been to a stockholders meeting have you?</comment>

<comment>Nope.  I have sat in on board of directors' meetings before though.  And although boards may disagree, they are not actively taking steps to ensure inaction, unlike political parties.</comment>

<comment>This has nothing to do with hating billionaires or thinking they don't deserve their wealth. It's that it's in the best interests of the country, for everyone, if there is a strong state that supports workers rights, from fair wages to health and safety, that allows for even its poorest citizens to get decent education and healthcare. This benefits everybody, including the rich because they'll have a thriving, productive, population to take care of them when they're old.Charity is a wonderful thing and everyone should give. But it's no substitute for a strong state, in the same way private security forces aren't a substitute for the police and the courts, and building and maintaining your own roads aren't a substitute for the federal highway system. In other words, you seem to like a string state just fine when it directly benefits the rich.</comment>

<comment>Yes, lets triple US workers wages, so everything will be made in China.  I love their egg rolls.</comment>

<comment>Everything IS made outside the US (increasingly not in China, actually, as China becomes wealthier). Globalization and automation have changed the face of the labor force, just as the industrial revolution did two centuries ago and the slave trade did before that. But at no point in human history has any country said, "That's it then. Civilization had a good run, but now let's just let everything decay." You're the first who wants to welcome that attitude.</comment>

<comment>Wow, tell me you thought I was serious.  What the heck is your point?</comment>

<comment>Anything someone like Mark Zuckerburg and his wife can do to help those less fortunate is just fine with me. Can they reach and help everybody everywhere I doubt it but at least they are trying as their hearts are in the right place. Others with enormous wealth may not giving a flying a fig about giving back as they fall into the category of what's mine is mine and let others fend for themselves no matter how impoverished they may be. The Zuckerbergs and others like them deserve five gold stars in my book. That's what life is about helping each other even if in only a small way that small gesture or act of kindness could change a person's life or in some cases even save it. Isn't that WJWD?</comment>

<comment>Actually Jesus condemned the wealthy. Remember the camel and the eye of the needle?</comment>

<comment>Billionaires give where THEY want, NOT where WE need. So they end up distorting a lot of issues and giving undue weight to their pet hobbyhorses. We have beautiful buildings in the midst of appalling illiteracy, great charter schools in a decaying public school system, lots of Apple computers in schools with too few human teachers. So I am against billionaire giving, Let's tax that money and use it for the public good: get rid of hideous poverty, shoddy or non-existent housing, create a real healthcare system, rebuild the public school system, and so on. Why should we be grateful that those pathological money hoarders and profiteers who siphoned off the fruits of our work give us back a fraction of their immoral gains?</comment>

<comment>Get rid of hideous poverty?  The Govt has spent half a century trying to do just that, but here we are.  You cannot get rid of something you continue to encourage.  Heck, we import and harbor poverty from around the globe by the millions.  Legal, illegal...we don't put an end to it.Poor people tend to make decisions that will keep them in poverty for their lifetime.  The Govt cannot solve that problem because the Govt is afraid of telling people what they don't want to hear.</comment>

<comment>Meh, tis a flawed system to be sure, but it's the cheapest we've found so far.Love,The One Percent</comment>

<comment>The government hasn't really tried to eliminate poverty, merely to regulate it and make it so that the well to do can look at themselves in the mirror.  Anyone who looks at so-called anti-poverty programs knows that. Other countries around the world have managed to almost eliminate poverty.</comment>

<comment>It's true that America's 'social safety net' isn't as well funded as a percentage of GDP as it is in the big Western European welfare states.It's true that, despite a massive growth in government spending in the US over the past 15 years, in the most developed European welfare states (like France), government spending as a percentage of GDP is much higher than in the US. As are taxes.It's also true that median income in the poorest American state (Mississippi) is 118 per cent of what it is in France, with a significantly lower cost of living.One more time on that last point. Median income in Mississippi is higher than it is in France, with a lower cost of living.To say that 'other countries have managed to almost eliminate poverty' relative to America is absurd.What would be more accurate would be to say, "Global trade, driven by large corporations, has significantly reduced abject poverty in the developing world at an unprecedented rate, and so long as government stays out of the way, we can expect abject poverty around the world to be all but eliminated within 10 years thanks to free market capitalism."</comment>

<comment>You are cherry picking your statistics. Here's one for you--Poverty rate in Mississippi (2011): 20.6%; Poverty rate in France (2012): 8.1%. So, yes, France has done a better job in eliminating poverty than Mississippi, as well of 44 other states in the U.S.</comment>

<comment>Silly, strawman argument</comment>

<comment>What would it take in todays economy for the poor to be no longer poor?  A color TV, air conditioning, food, shelter, medical care, cell phone.  Virtually the entire country has this.  I don't recall reading about anyone starving or freezing to death other than drug addicts and alcoholics.  Perhaps they should all have Cadillacs?  Is it OK if the rich have a summer house?</comment>

<comment>Hey, I'm poor and I had a Cadillac once! I bought it an an estate auction. I guess no one wanted to buy a car that day. I hadn't planned on buying one either, but when I saw how cheap it was going, I figured why not?! It was a beautiful car ... seven or eight years old, not a thing wrong with it. Originally I'd planned to flip it and make a couple grand, then I started driving it and went ... whoa! So I kept it and ran it for a couple of years until the transmission blew up. That was right around the time gas prices started going up, so I scrapped it. (I had two other cars.) Nice ride while it lasted, though!</comment>

<comment>Glad you rode the high life!</comment>

<comment>Best $1250 I ever spent, lol.</comment>

<comment>You should walk a mile in their shoes. To not be poor means access to good food, healthcare, housing that doesn't drain their resources.  You have no idea.  I think you would possibly have empathy if you went among the poor and saw how they live. You can get a second hand TV, a car that barely works, barely afford the rent on a house full of rats and inadequate plumbing and insulation, a cell phone you "refill" when you have money, an old computer, and MAYBE air conditioning (I think you should realize many poor people DON'T have AC which is why they tend to die in heat waves). To have "something" is not to have new things.  And that you don't READ about people suffering doesn't mean they aren't. It just means it isn't being talked about or reported on. Or, since I have seen articles about poverty here in Denver, possibly that you just choose to not read about it. I would prefer to believe otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Last week I saw a minority couple drive away in a Mercedes after buying ice Cream and Sushi .  I doubt they were off to the Country Club, but probably to watch the game on their wide screen TV.  Maybe we should pay for their Country Club initiation fees?  What do you think?    PS  The last census proved you wrong, poor people have all the basic necessities.  Sorry, I don't feel their pain of their having to watch a used TV. Maybe you could use YOUR money to pay for new TVs for the poor.  By the way, my father was a janitor, and I worked my way through school. Don't lecture me about doing with out, you Liberal idiot.</comment>

<comment>Fiscal cons/libertarians/Teaparty leaders aren't actual conservatives. Their economic policies are what are called "liberal" in other countries.

Others of them support the far-left on culture. Very few have an appreciation for and interest in preserving Western Civilization: almost all are philistines. They aren't conservative in the least.</comment>

<comment>While there are definitely some ideologues, the primary job of fiscal con front people is to help the wealthy make more money. The positions taken by cosmotarians would, oddly enough, help their Koch benefactors make more money.Everything else is window dressing.Something like not ending welfare or a make-work program might be better for social stability, but fiscal cons won't have that.</comment>

<comment>When the rich need money they get it for free directly from the Federal Reserve per the law;In 2010, Section 13(3) was modified by the Dodd-Frank bill, which replaced the phrase “individuals, partnerships and corporations” with the vaguer phrase “any program or facility with broad-based eligibility.” As explained in the notes to the bill: Only Broad-Based Facilities Permitted. Section 13(3) is modified to remove the authority to extend credit to specific individuals, partnerships and corporations. Instead, the Board may authorize credit under section 13(3) only under a program or facility with “broad-based eligibility.” What programs have “broad-based eligibility” is not clear from a reading of the Section, but it isn’t individuals or local businesses. It also isn’t state and local governments. –Ellen Brown Ellenbrown(dot)com</comment>

<comment>She calls them hoarders while announcing that she is against giving! The economic illiteracy is painful.</comment>

<comment>Bwahahahaha way to miss the point.</comment>

<comment>Please do enlighten me. Why don't you start by explaining how billionaires 'hoard' their wealth. Do they pile it up in the backyard? Fill up their pools with 100 dollar bills and swim in them?</comment>

<comment>Here, allow me to Google that for you:"How the 1% hoard their loot offshore; super rich hide $21 trillion offshore; offshore banks, there's the ticket," etc., etc.</comment>

<comment>They take the money out of circulation?  Making everyone else's money worth that much more?  The fiends!</comment>

<comment>They are also helping those wonderful socialist countries in Europe.  Little Fritz will now be able to buy shoes for school.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't even matter.  Obama would just print more.  Ever heard of Quantitative Easing?</comment>

<comment>I dunno, Obama seems pretty pissed at them.  They're not "doing their fair share."</comment>

<comment>If it is hidden offshore how do they know it is $21 trillion, and say, not $17 trillion?</comment>

<comment>Fill up their pools?  That's silly.What they actually do is hoard it in underground vaults and then wait patiently for inflation to erode its value.What you apparently fail to grasp is rich people don't think like the rest of us.  They prefer not to spend money because they already have too much stuff.You would understand this if you just took the right combination of drugs.</comment>

<comment>??</comment>

<comment>The fact that you find this confusing tells me you haven't taken anywhere nearly enough recreational drugs.Seriously, though, your comment about "economic illiteracy" is well  taken. Those who don't grasp that money is a medium of exchange tend to focus on it and ignore what is being exchanged.It leads to fallacies, such as thinking "hoarding" money negatively impacts others.  As Doctor J observed, if rich people actually did take money out of circulation, it would create a transfer of wealth from them to the rest of us.</comment>

<comment>Hahahaah. Okay good we're on the same page.</comment>

<comment>They hoard or in offshore tax havens, like the Cayman islands </comment>

<comment>Right tax avoidance but that's not really hoarding. They still spend huge chunks in production, investment, hiring, and consumption.</comment>

<comment>That is exactly hoarding. </comment>

<comment>Really? So say tomorrow some already low tax state decides to lower its taxes even further and people find all sorts of way to 'work' in that state. Hoarding?</comment>

<comment>You're talking about Obama's economic illiteracy?</comment>

<comment>"a fraction of their immoral gains".Yeah, I suppose it's technically accurate to call a mere 99% 'a fraction'.  And I'm sure he has other assets as well.  But still, 99% is a rather significant fraction, wouldn't you say.He doesn't have to give ANY of it away.  To complain that he's only giving a fraction, and that he's daring to give it where HE wants, instead of where we (i.e. you) want, is a bit much.</comment>

<comment>I don't think donate is correct. Direct his shares put into an LLC is more so. Donate would mean to give. There is nothing here to prevent giving back to himself. Read all about it. The fine print means something.</comment>

<comment>I did see the LLC info later.  I think they added that after I wrote you, when they changed the wording on the title.  Or did I just miss it the first time around?I think we need to wait & see what they do with it.  Are you sure they can simply take it back?  I wondered about that.In any case, I still think 99% is a pretty respectable fraction!  And if they do end up giving it away, I still think it's OK that they get to choose where.  Though the lesser restrictions on applying it towards politics makes me nervous.  Again, we'll see.BTW: I accidentally hit the 'vote-down' flag when I was hitting the 'reply' button just now.  I am sorry.  (What is that button for anyway?  They already have the flag available for inappropriate remarks.)</comment>

<comment>I think the billionaires should give ME their money.  I WOULD SEE TO IT THAT IT WAS WISELY SPENT.

<comment>This.  Mark Zuckerberg could help more of the poor by helping them get the skills his company requires and preparing them for low level jobs of the future.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>Nice cult-of-personality story about a glorified tax dodge scheme which has been in existence for a long time. As long as we expect anyone (especially our extractive elites) to solve everything for us, we remain disempowered. Zuckie won't lose any of his money, and you won't get any of it either.</comment>

<comment>This is utter BS. It's infuriating how ignorant you are. Take a moment to look at what the Gates Foundation has accomplished. Then take a moment to look at the advantages available to Zuckerberg (outside of tax savings) of setting up an LLC rather than a charitable foundation. An LLC is much more agile, far less restricted, and can accomplish so much more.But beyond all that, the idea that he might save 300 million in taxes this way should be praised. That's 300 million dollars that gets used with purpose, that's overseen by results-oriented people with a track record for success. 300 million given to the government is just another rounding error down the rabbit hole.</comment>

<comment>You pursue your version of rabbit down the hole and I'll pursue mine.  One thing we can agree on is that the money will definitely get used with a purpose.  The use of large sums as grants to support (but never influence, right?) "non-commercial" enterprises such as NPR, or perhaps "non-profit" lobbying groups in DC, for example. Once, again, we should expect nothing of true consequence to ourselves (or the Zuckster) from this as it is just business as usual from substantially disconnected elites.  Ignorance can be amusing as well as infuriating. I am sure the world  benefits hugely from that seed bank up in Novaya Zemlya even as we (and Monsanto) speak . Meanwhile, may the gods protect me from those who say the are here to help me.</comment>

<comment>Zuckerberg's 45 billion is just a drop in the ocean compared to the problem of poverty.  However, one thing that billionaires can do that government of a large nation can't do easily is to experiment with non conventional approaches.Hopefully, the Zuckerberg fortune is not going to be pissed down a hole spending more money on ideas and methods that only take some edge off of the symptoms without really attempting to cure the disease.  If they're just going to do the same things that have already been tried, then it's a waste.  Might as well buy yourself a mega yacht and call it a day.NO ONE has so far managed to "solve" poverty in America, or in the world.  The idea that we could just get there if not for these pesky do gooders is silly.  I applaud Zuckerberg, and Gates, and Buffett, and any one else who has these massive financial means, for trying to use that power to make the world a better place.  Whether or not they ultimately provide the magic bullet to cure cancer or wipe out malaria or break the poverty cycle, they're trying in a way that they don't HAVE TO.</comment>

<comment>"The U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at no cost." -Ben Bernanke Chairman Federal Reserve</comment>

<comment>This is a terrible, heinous article and the author should be ashamed.Zuckerberg, Carnegie, Gates, Koch, and other billionaires got that way by exchanging something of value. It is the accumulation of all those exchanges that creates economic growth that alleviates poverty.All the trillions of dollars of government spending on anti-poverty efforts have been worse than worthless. In the USA, the data is overwhelming that the War on Poverty measures started by LBJ have made the problem substantially worse, and we have far more people living in squalor in America than we would if we had no trillion-dollar war on poverty programs at all.In contrast, the billionaires whose businesses create wealth have made tremendous strides to eradicating poverty on a global scale in my lifetime. The number of people living on a dollar a day or less worldwide is a fraction of what it was 20 years ago, and that massive decline is not due to any government welfare program, but rather, the magic of capitalism and trade.Zuckerberg should do whatever he wants to do with his billions. The fact that he wants to follow in the footsteps of Bill Gates is admirable (the Gates Foundation has been a far more effective champion of eradicating TB and malaria than any government). If he wants to build libraries, parks, and museums, that's admirable too.But beyond all of this, we should recognize that Zuckerberg made his billions by creating a business that enabled voluntary exchanges of mutual benefit that make all of us better off. As a small business owner who advertises on Facebook (and finds the FB ad platform more effective at present than any other channel), I feel particular admiration for what Mr. Zuckerberg has created.</comment>

<comment>I strongly suspect that it's not that the great society programs didn't work, but the war on drugs and crime started by Nixon which the government double down on in the 80s 90s and ever since that sabotaged these programs with the effects of drug prohibition (violent street gangs running the black market, mass incarceration). </comment>

<comment>...next time boot-licking toadies to the power elite say they don't hate their own kind, refer them to comments on these types of stories by THEIR ideological brethren.</comment>

<comment>I don't know who the 'boot-licking toadies' are. As a libertarian, I see that much of the wealth in this country is unfairly acquired through government secured and sanctioned privilege. Look at the bailouts and corporate subsidies and the like. What I'm arguing against is the tendency to demonize all wealthy people, to more or less suggest that it's unfair for anybody to be very wealthy.</comment>

<comment>It's as wrong to characterize the poor as "inherently lazy and stupid" as it is to stereotype the rich as greedsters, or as having somehow unfairly gotten their gains.I like libertarians, up to about the point where they see, for instance, that it's wrong for Big Agri-business to horn in on farm subsidies originally intended for small family farms. When they enter Tea Party territory, that's about where we bid our adieus.</comment>

<comment>I agree.Well the libertarian position is that subsidies don't make sense for anybody but yes indeed we believe that it's especially egregious when they go to the already wealthy. We simply don't need farm subsidies at all.Now as for the TP, that just seems simplistic. I mean some people in the TP are  strongly non-interventionism, opposes bank bailouts, and are even skeptical of the war on drugs. That doesn't seem bad. If your concern is the social issues, well there libertarians are not only in tension with what can arguably be fairly characterized as the dominant strain in the TP but even in tension with the mainstream of the Democrat Party in terms of how live and let live we are.</comment>

<comment>All sorts of hilarious comments about billionaires got rich by 'exploiting' the poor. Some sure, through the state they want to further empower of course (see bankers and their bailouts, corporate subsidies, and all that). but how did Mark Zuckerberg exploit poor people? He didn't of course. It's just generalized class warfare contempt.</comment>

<comment>The details will come out at trial, if there is one, but it's pretty clear that Mark Zuckerberg did not himself build Facebook. Not only has he been accused of stealing the idea, he's also been accused of outright fraud. Baseless accusations? The judge in the case has refused to dismiss the case several times, so it's not a frivolous suit. Besides, it's well known that Zuckerberg is no coding genius.So let's set aside the fiction that Zuckerberg deserves to be a billionaire on merit alone. He got lucky, and he's been getting lucky since birth. That explains his success, not some bullshit John Galt type of story.And more to the point, you don't have to personally exploit poor people to benefit from a system that privileges wealth above all. Zuckerberg comes from an upper middle-class family with a yearly income easily in the $500k range. That's not billionaire money, but it's a definite head start against the schlubs whose dads drive buses for a living.</comment>

<comment>Do you believe anybody deserves to be a millionaire or billionaire? Does JK Rowling deserve to be a billionaire for example?We're all lucky in some way. I have a friend who works construction and makes little money compared to another friend who is lawyer but the former gets more dates because he's better looking, taller, and very funny.Yes certainly. But no truly free society can perfectly equalize opportunity. Societies which prize liberty first of course tend to get a great deal of widely enjoyed opportunity and prosperity. Unfortunately, America is moving further down the road of corporatism and cronyism (or socialism for the rich if you will).</comment>

<comment>Well, we certainly agree about the direction America is moving in, and I'm glad that neither one of us likes it.Does anyone deserve to be a billionaire? Considering what a thousand million dollars is. You could spend $10 million a year for an entire century. And even if you did nothing to grow what remained at least as fast as you spent it, after inflation over 100 years, your final $10 million would still be around $430k, an amount that puts you in the upper 0.5%. So I'd say that no, no one person benefits humanity to the tune of a billion dollars.Nobody has asked to perfectly or even imperfectly equalize opportunity. The issue isn't that we're mostly there, but we can't be perfect. No, the issue is that wealth is concentrating (opportunity is becoming less equal) at an alarming rate.This is not even a liberal or conservative matter. We really, really don't want to live in a country where the middle class barely exists, the working class lives hand-to-mouth, and a tiny elite of very wealthy people lord over us all. I lived in a country like that, and believe me, the nice beaches and the nice weather didn't make up for it.As for "Societies which prize liberty first," we have never been such a society. What we have have really prized is privilege. We tell ourselves that's freedom, but it's a hypocritical definition of freedom.</comment>

<comment>But Robert how did these people get a billion dollars? Well, in some cases, there's no question it was through the government acting coercively and taking money from the general population and giving it them, directly or indirectly. But in other cases it was through the creation of value in the marketplace. I asked about Rowling because it's such a clear example: her stories have enriched the lives of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people. They voluntarily parted with their money to buy her book, go see the movies, and so on and so forth. How can you possibly claim she didn't benefit people if the way she got rich was by them voluntarily paying her? The money she has is the proof of the benefit. Anybody who gets rich through voluntary trade has obviously benefited people to that extent or else they wouldn't have that degree of wealth.I agree with you, in part, when you speak of the US as a society of privilege, though I think it's a little pessimistic.</comment>

<comment>There are several problems with this angle. One is that the marketplace is a very manipulated, rigged game. We have many examples of products and services that range from very poor value to outright fraud and which, nonetheless, are successful in the marketplace. We also have many examples of inferior products succeeding over superior ones based on the marketing power of the inferior producer.In the case of Rowling, there is plenty of criticism pointing out that, objectively, she's not a great writer. What she managed to do, however, along with her marketing team of course, was to capture the zeitgeist. She and her team successfully induced in consumes an irresistible desire to purchase her books.That's really no different from handing out heroin samples to build a customer base. You could argue that heroin is "bad," but most of its badness comes from it being illegal. And why is it illegal? Because it's bad -- circular reasoning. And how is "Harry Potter" good? It's not literature. It's just pop entertainment. The writings of Aristotle, Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, all wrote about ideas and concepts that would come to influence humanity far more than anything Rowling has written, and yet they didn't die billionaires.Zuckerberg has been rewarded even more richly than Rowling. How is Facebook "good?" It's not. It's a horrible thing that appeals to some of the basest human motives.Finally, trade is rarely truly voluntary. The fact that people can't resist buying is proof of that.</comment>

<comment>Oh dear. 'Objectively not a great writer.' Robert I'm sure your the Shakespeare of our time but how can you say that? According to who? I don't believe in the idea of 'objectively bad writing' first of all. But for you to just assert that? Sure hundreds of millions people adore Rowling's prose and stories and happily paid for her books but it doesn't count because Robert thinks she's an 'objectively bad' writer based on his incontrovertibly sound criteria.An 'irrestisible' desire to buy her book? They're basically meth. You cannot be serious.Ah Facebook is bad too. I mean people spend huge amounts of their on it but it's bad because Robert said so. What's becoming very clear here is that you don't like capitalism because it allows people to get rich by providing choices to others you don't think they should have. It allows people to choose for themselves and that we can't have. To promote 'freedom' we should empower the state to point a gun at people's heads, seize their resources, and re-distribute them for 'objectively' good aims.</comment>

<comment>Goldman Sachs funded his startup and they receive billions a year in taxpayer subsidies.</comment>

<comment>Oh come on. By that logic, nobody deserves anything. You know you got guys who were raised in Cuba in total poverty and tyranny who manage to escape and come to the USA and play baseball and make a great deal of money. But you know some of those franchises get money from the city to build the stadium and that's not really a free market. Since everything is related to everything else and subsidies and privileges are a part of the system everything is tainted and therefore nobody really has a claim so let's just have a much more powerful state. Does that really sound logical?</comment>

<comment>Goldman Sachs received 814 BILLION in taxpayer assistance since 2008.</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about Zuckerberg, not Goldman Sachs. If you want to argue GS is tainted in a big way, absolutely. But to say anybody who they give any money to at any point is.. well that I don't buy.</comment>

<comment>Goldman Sachs funded Facebook. Without Goldman there would be no Facebook.</comment>

<comment>That's highly contestable. How much money did they provide? Why should we think no one other source would have come through?</comment>

<comment>The reality is that the best way one could possibly help the most poor in the most significant way would be to open up a sweat shop in some poor village which doesn't have any yet.   The false premise of this article that the need is to to save the poor from "oppressive capitalism" is patently retarded.</comment>

<comment>Yes. Fortunately for the rest of us, there are plenty of businesswomen and men who are willing to take on the risk and effort required to expand operations into the developing world. In the 1960s, Southern China was a wasteland of rice patties and tropical disease, with an average lifespan under 50 and a high rate of infant mortality. Today, thanks to global trade, Southern China is first-world, with a life expectancy approaching 80.That's a region of half a billion people.Similar success stories abound in India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, and Eastern Europe. And the cycle is always the same. A region of abject poverty and subsistence levels of existence opens a sweatshop with sweatshop wages. The left decries these sweatshops as slave labor, yet people travel from far away for a chance to work there. As they work, the people build savings and skills. Over a few years, the low wage sweatshop becomes a high wage sweatshop. A few more years and a middle class starts to develop around the sweatshop. Home ownership, restaurants, a service sector. A few years after that and there are highways, skyscrapers, public transit, and 1st world health care. In the span of a single generation, a region with a million or more goes from abject poverty to median incomes comparable to US $20K a year or more.Global trade, capitalism, and 'sweatshops' have saved the world.And billionaire philanthropy has helped fill in the gaps. The Gates Foundation has vaccinated millions of people in the developing world, spending less money than many government efforts to do the same, all of which have failed, because government money is so easily stolen through corruption.Everything about this column is dead wrong. The author is akin to a quack promoting Thalidomide as a pregnancy drug, or Burnside telling his troops to charge into the crater.</comment>

<comment>Remember this every time some idiot spouts that "Capitalism has pulled more people out of poverty than any other system." It's bullshit. What pulled people out of poverty was labor activism. Factory jobs under capitalism paid no better than sharecropping under feudalism. It was only when the workers said hell no and organized that capitalism began coughing up some of its ill-gotten gains.And now that our ruthless capitalists have managed to defeat labor, we are returning to Gilded Age conditions -- abysmally low wages, workdays gruelingly long, bouts of unemployment, and destitution in old age are all on the rise.</comment>

<comment>It takes two to...commerce. How about assuring that people everywhere are paid a decent living wage so that they can buy, and Buy, and BUY, as people are wont to do? Rather than continue to reward greed and avarice, as the new Capitalism, American Style, dictates we do?I have more faith in the people clamoring to buy all the fashionable people commodities than I do the 1%-er crocodiles who, Buffet, Zuckerberg, and Chan excepted, tend to horde and offshore the loot, which doesn't do a whole helluva lot in the way of "commerce."It worked in the 1950s. It can work in the 2020s. We've got a whole generation out there who doesn't even know what it feels like to have a little extra folding money to spend.</comment>

<comment>"How about assuring that people everywhere are paid a decent living wage?"You go ahead and tell me how you're going to accomplish that.I'll tell you that history's lesson on how to accomplish this is quite clear: Free and unencumbered markets provide the highest wages to the most people.</comment>

<comment>You can't back that up. At all.</comment>

<comment>Should I back it up with consensus economics? I could start with Adam Smith, move on to Alfred Marshall, then David Ricardo. I could ask you to read The Wealth of Nations, Principles of Economics, and The Monetary History of the United States. All explicitly back my proposition.Should I back it with data? How about a correlation between wage rates and countries that are closest to a free market economy? Every year, the Heritage Foundation maintains a list of economies that have the fewest interventions in economic activity. The top of the list this year goes: Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore. The bottom of the list is: Venezuela, Cuba, Zimbabwe, and North Korea. When economists study the correlation between economic freedom and prosperity, they get a correlation rating of 0.80.Should I back it up with history? Do you want to start with the industrial revolution in Europe, or would you prefer growth in 19th century America? Would you like a comparison of Western Capitalism versus Eastern Socialism? How about a study of Sweden during its mostly free market period (18th century thru 1970s, a period that ended with them as the 4th richest nation in the world?) or their experiment with a giant welfare state that made them the darling of the left, but saw their ranking drop from 4th to 14th and has quietly resulted in a return of free market reforms pushed by the business sector (since 1993, leftist darling Sweden has chosen to slash taxes on business on corporations, on income, and on capital gains, all because the growth of welfarism coincided so closely with economic malaise).I could go on and on, but I don't need to. The burden of proof is on YOU. The economic consensus is with me. If you want to argue with it, get started.</comment>

<comment>I see your fax for fat katz and raise you with contradicting facts for other cats, thankyouverymuch."The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state." Hmm. How quaint. Adam Smith.</comment>

<comment>You overstated your case, and/or are building a straw man. You said 'free and unencumbered markets", which leads me to believe you are a free market fetishist.Every author you cited states that free markets lead to the greatest growth, the 'biggest pie', which is correct. The free market cares NOTHING about the distribution of the pie, and is not designed to. They all either state that society needs to account for distribution through some other means, or simply ignore distribution, because it isn't what they are talking about.Which economists find this correlation? Correlation does not mean causation. Also, how does one define 'prosperity'? Most often, economists define it as the 'biggest pie possible' concept. Again, it cares nothing about distribution or overall well-being of society.I don't have time to provide you with the proper context for each country, but you referenced two city-states that had their infrastructure and governmental system developed by an imperialist parliamentary republic. Once all that was in place, their free-market policies flourished upon the bedrock that central-planning and massive government subsidies provided.Yeah, North Korea sucks. I don't see many arguments for a command economy coupled with a repressive military regime.Your historical examples of the industrial revolution led to massive growth, and it was labor unions and government regulation that allowed some of that prosperity to actually benefit a majority of citizens.Capitalism is the best at what it does; growth. It does a poor job of everything else. That's why a system of free markets regulated by government is the best system. Correcting badly designed policies, or good policies that are no longer applicable to changing conditions, is the name of the game. But your "the freer the market the better, always and for ever, is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen" claim is just flat wrong.</comment>

<comment>Baby-boomer here: I know what "free and unencumbered markets" get us: Banks to be bailed out; savings & loans to be bailed out; banks to be bailed out AGAIN; CEOs and board rooms run amok with plenty o' opportunity to line their own pockets with the highest recompense possible, without even the piddling oversight of an overworked, underfunded governmental agency to check the larceny.Thanks, but ixnay on the "free and unencumbered markets."</comment>

<comment>What's a "decent living wage" for a single mom with 5 kids and a GED?  40k? 45k?50k?</comment>

<comment>Don't you mean what's a "decent living wage" for a mom with five potential FUTURE SOLDIERS to raise for the State, and oh, by the way, if she could dig her way out of the poverty her current woefully inadequate minimum-wage job(s) and EBT card keep her in, maybe she can get a BETTER education, a BETTER job, and then certainly get off public assistance?Is that the "decent living wage" to which you refer, binky?</comment>

<comment>Damn. You wrote about a lot of stuff I didn't mention and called me names but you didn't answer my question.The term "decent living wage" implies that companies should pay people what they need to live comfortably, or at least, reasonably.  I was merely using an example to ask what this means in practice.</comment>

<comment>Oh. Sorry. So used to having Reagan's "welfare queen" thrown at me for the past 30 years, I just didn't realize you were asking a legit question...Mmm, decent living wage for a single mom with 5 kids and a GED? I guess that would depend on where she lived, the COL, how many kids she's willing to pre-enlist in the military (or Peace Corps, etc., for the conscientious objectors, etc.).The important thing is, we don't let any particular region or country have an unfair advantage over the others by allowing them to offer their workforce for LESS than that region's Decent Living Wage. That way, everyone has an equal shot at First World status, and all that comes with it.No one should be allowed to get a leg up on the competition by offering cheap child labor, or free prisoner labor. It's a veritable race to the bottom. Under the current system, the house (the power elite) will generally always win, while the 99%, 99% of the time, will lose.</comment>

<comment>Do you know what a single mom with 5 kids needs?  A husband.</comment>

<comment>Let's assume we took all the money from all the billionaires and gave it to the "poor".  It would come out to a payment of about $2,100.per person.  Poor being the bottom 30% of all Americans.  If we took the wealth from the top 1% and gave it to the lower 30% it would come to about $4,300 each, about the cost of a really cheap used car.  And, I can assure you, those getting the checks would waste it on cr*p in about 2.5 days.  THERE WILL ALWAYS BE POOR PEOPLE.  "Poor" is a relative term, as is "rich", but stupid, is an exact term, and best describes the writers of this magazine.</comment>

<comment>Oh, thanks for dumbing that down for us: We're all on the exact same page now.EXCEPT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT TAKING "ALL" OF THE MONEY AWAY FROM "ALL" THE BILLIONAIRES!!! Like the NRA's argument -- "they're coming for ALL your guns!!!" the premise is flawed, idiotic, and only the daughter of a white-collar middle manager would espouse it...shortly after hearing the sermonette from daddy at the dinnertable, natch.The debate is, and always has been, How richly shall Capital be rewarded? Or rather, reward itself? Also, how well shall we pay the hired help, so that they can pay it forward? You see, more people work at Wal*Mart than at the yacht-yard, dahling.I think we all know what the answer to that one must be, at least in this new-ish "United States of Corporate America, Inc., LLP" economy.</comment>

<comment>OK, divide all my number by 2.  Happy now.  The poor are poor because they are lazy and stupid (like you) and there is nothing anyone can do about it!  Can you name a society past or present where everybody was rich?</comment>

<comment>Almost none of the big names actually give their money to charityBill Gates, Buffet, and people like that give their money to population control programs in third world countries.  Birth control, sex ed, and so forth is where almost all that money goes.You can say that helps but it's not really charity in any traditional sense.   It's actually pretty dark if you think about it.</comment>

<comment>No, it's really pretty bright. If we don't have the means to help sustain a growing world population, via either jobs or charity, why not help stem the tide? I thought even most conservatives could get behind mere birth control and sex ed--anything but that old demon rum, abortion. No?Anyway, I like it. It's almost as good as spaying and neutering pets, as well as the merciful pink juice for older pets. As a matter of fact, if we're just going to throw up our hands and say, "Bleh, the poor are with us always," I'd urge Zuckerberg and Chan to use their wealth to help assure spaying, neutering, and the merciful pink juice for older humans. Beats dying on the road trying to scrounge a morsel, eh?</comment>

<comment>Pretty dark though.Getting into eugenics territory</comment>

<comment>Yes. then. It's probably dark, but only in a sort of "A Modest Proposal" way. Sure hope Zuckerberg and Chan have reread that one lately.</comment>

<comment>Zuckerberg, start at home, literally, let the word and spirit of H-1 visas be.In politics many of these people support such views by increasing the amount of -not true in a relative sense- poor, but the poor geographically close coming into this nation  increasing the amount of poverty in this nation and, thanks to anachronistic immigration laws- will increase the amount of poor in a reality where lack of human capital (no matter government transfers) seems to doom us to poverty, even in the next generation.I would support by fact (if I had 1/100 of their money) such views on addressing international poverty but making the human  and social capital of this nation worse can be seen as disingenuous or, at least, short sighted.</comment>

<comment>It’s frankly amazing that people don’t know the real story behind Zuckerberg’s (and Gates’) donations to schools, and how those donations are literally doing more damage than doing nothing would have.In Zuckerberg's last attempt at donating billions for the public good, he didn’t even try working directly with Newark public schools to see how effective and useful his donation would work. He came in, imposed a program that benefitted his friends, didn’t ask teachers or students what they needed or wanted, made assumptions about the place and the people, then got angry when he didn’t get his way. He threw a tantrum demanding to know why people weren’t doing what he told them to do, even though they couldn’t for a number of pratical and legal reasons. One big example was that he wanted to “give” computers to a school that couldn’t pay its electricity bills, had no IT staff or budget, and no one to teach the kids how to use them. Oh yes, and they “fell off the truck.”This is why he (and these billionaires as a whole) should just give the money to people who know what they’re doing and have actually studied the underlying issues.</comment>

<comment>But that takes work and a plan.  Those may not be tax deductible. (Sarcasm off)</comment>

<comment>Zuckerberg congratulated himself on Facebook for Newark Public School's increased high school graduation rate, ignoring the fact that the high school graduation rate has increased across the entire country.In the past five years several states have eliminated their high school exit exams.  Many kids who fail classes are allowed to take bogus online credit recovery classes that can usually be completed in two weeks.  Some schools are giving diplomas to kids who refuse to do assignments or even show up to the school.</comment>

<comment>Maybe he gets off on seeing the poor suffer...</comment>

<comment>Blacks and Hispanics don't receive the same benefits from education that whites and Asians do.  https://www.stlouisfed.org/pub... http://www.sciencedaily.com/re...Zuckerberg has no intention of hiring the kids that he is educating.  Facebook is 1% and 2% black and Hispanic respectively.  http://www.theverge.com/2015/8...Chan Zuckerberg are giving money to schools that promote personalized learning which means kids sit in a call-center like room and work by themselves at cubicles.  This model drastically reduces the need for teachers, a profession which until recently had been a way for blacks to enter the middle-class.  Here is an example of a personalized school: https://youtu.be/-s_O65rWV10?t...</comment>

<comment>Same thing with Wal*Mart (et al) and all the self-checkouts. Some of the clerks are so brainwashed and under their thumb they actually see the self-checkouts as an improvement for *themselves* and not for the bottom line.Poor things. They sort of remind me of some of Capital's cheerleaders hereon.Spoiler Alert: "To Serve Man"? It's a cookbook!</comment>

<comment>Could it be that Facebook needs to hire people with a higher than average IQ?  Public companies are not charities, so why would you expect Facebook to have more than 1% black and 2% hispanic employees?</comment>

<comment>Of course Facebook needs to hire people with a higher than average IQ.  However, Zuckerberg is spending his fortune from his "public company" on black and Hispanic students.  What is the point of spending ninety-nine percent of your fortune on kids you don't think have the ability to work in your own business?At least  when the Walton Family donates to charter schools I know that they just want more drones to work at Walmart.   Where in the world does Zuckerberg think his kids will wind up?  Is he that stupid and self-absorbed that he hasn't given it any thought?</comment>

<comment>"Is he that stupid and self-absorbed that he hasn't given it any thought?"Yes, that is the liberal mind.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Not the liberal ones, who are hopelessly foolish to believe that you can actually help people that can't be helped, nor help themselves.  He already flushed $100 million down the toilet trying to help students in Newark.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>If you compare the net benefit, yes.   If you look the example of Newark, there was zero benefit to Newark, and one could argue a negative benefit.  If he had used the $100 million instead on champagne, coke and whores, he would at least have had great personal satisfaction.</comment>

<comment>well, I don't think he has the ability to appreciate Champagne, which requires some sophistication, and Coke is very disappointing and destroy lots of people's lives in the process of producing it. Whores are most often exploited women, at the mercy of cruel and brutal system that maltreats them until they die.The Newark thing is exactly the point, people with excessive wealth use it to play with people's lives and futures, either with good intentions or with bad intentions. I'm not sure of Zuckerberg's intentions, maybe he gets off on seeing minority children suffering, because that is exactly what he got. This is why excessive wealth is a problem for a democratic society.Maybe Zuckerberg should spend his money on beer, Disney movies and Chan Zuckerberg?  Or better yet, throw it from a helicopter...</comment>

<comment>I can see giving away 99% of your money if you hit that level of multiple billions. You literally can't do anything with that much money in several lifetimes. Why not?</comment>

<comment>It still leaves him or his heirs $450 million.</comment>

<comment>https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Here we have a profoundly narcissistic man who is gloating about abandoning his wife and seven(!) children, and that he is now free to pursue his sexual fetish full time. In a sane society, this man would be flogged and publicly shamed- not lauded as a "brave" woman (or girl, by his lights) who is on a quest to express "her" true, authentic self. This is abuse and neglect, and it is grotesque. The fact that it is being celebrated should make any rational person upset.On the other hand, I think stories like these are a kind of portent that we are witnessing "the end". It is hard to say precisely what it is that we are at the end of (modernity? liberalism? multiculturalism? global capitalism? who knows?), but increasingly even regular people are beginning to affirm that we are in a civilizational and spiritual twilight. Almost every month, it seems like one of the old certainties crumbles away (just look at the rise of Trump, or Paris, or the migrant crisis). This is both frightening and exciting. I believe there is a silver lining to disasters like Stefonknee Wolscht. After all, no society that suffers this madness is long for the world, and every end comes with the potential for new beginnings.</comment>

<comment>What a freak show.</comment>

<comment>How about donating that money to Bernie Sanders and the next candidate who proposes to bring about some economic justice?  Otherwise it'll just be a 45 billion dollar bandage.  We don't need charity, we need fairness.</comment>

<comment>Economic justice?  I wonder if you can even explain Bernie's actual plan?</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure you know what Bernie's plan is going to look like.  If not, https://berniesanders.com/issu... I think he'd try to reverse the slow slide towards the US becoming a rich banana republic.  What much of the GOP, and some of the Dems (see Clintons), don't seem to realize is that our economy (and democracy) are dependent on a vibrant, well paid middle class.</comment>

<comment>And the way to create a "vibrant, well paid middle class" is to confiscate money from earners and hand it to them?</comment>

<comment>Like I said, the GOP has a very limited view of history, the virtuous cycle of paying the middle class better, then having them buy goods with said pay.  Outsourcing, relocating your 'headquarters' to tax havens, buying politicians (on both sides);  I'd say some of those earners are confiscating from their employees.</comment>

<comment>That was incomprehensable and a total non-answer.  Do you believe that a "vibrant, well paid middle class" can be created by confiscating money from earners and handing it to non-earners?</comment>

<comment>Define "non-earners." Are you talking about those inheritors of great wealth who then piddle and pisss away most of their inherited wealth, only to end up -- through sheer dumb luck, multiple bankruptcies, etc. -- still much better off than most of the rest of Americans who received no such leg-ups?P.S.: I understood badfoot perfectly well...and I suspect you did, too.</comment>

<comment>Non-earners my friend is not a complicated concept.  Non means - did not and earners . . . well I trust you understand that part.  So, for those of you in Rio Linda, if the government gives a person money, they are a non-earner of that money.  In order to do so, it is definitionally required that the government seize it from someone who did earn it.Also, just so you know - the hypothetical people you spoke of who "piddle and pisss away most of their inherited wealth" don't really exist but if they did, the piddling and pissing would be SPENDING that would benefit the receivers of that spending.  So the yacht builders, the gold jewelry sellers, and the real estate agents who are on the other end of the deal are the beneficiaries of that "piddle and piss" except I'd bet they don't call it that - they probably call it INCOME.The progressive idea that money is just burnt or stored in mattresses is comical.   It is spent.  The debate is about who should get to decide how it's spent - the government or the person who earned it.And finally, you also ranted forever without answering the very simple questions I posed.</comment>

<comment>Actually there is quite a lot of wealth being stored, not in mattresses, but in banks i.e. on the sidelines because the wealthy can only buy so many yachts/estates etc.  Middle class purchases, in large numbers, are required to make the economy spin.  So it isn't just higher taxes that are required, it's higher wages (and better benefits).  Somehow I don't think we're going to come to any agreement on this issue.</comment>

<comment>Money in banks is held by the bank in a vault?Nonsense.  The money received in deposits by banks is used to cover operating costs, i.e. to pay their employees and leveraged in the banks primary business by loaning it to other mostly middle class and entrepreneurial types which are the true drivers of the economy.Like I said, progressives don't get it.  The only argument is who should decide where to allocate the money.  Should it be allocated by 100s of millions of Americans doing with it what they deem best or should the government seize it from them and allocate it according to their "we know best" system of allocation that is wrought with the choosing of winners and losers, cronyism, corruption, fraud, waste, and abuse?Method of allocation is the sole argument and progressives time and time again believe that the government is a better allocator of resources.  They believe this despite the fact that every allocation they have ever done has failed miserably and when taken to the extreme, drives the entire economy into free fall collapse, ie the USSR.  It's classic Einsteinian insanity.  Over and over again you propose the same thing that didn't work last time but somehow expect a different result.It's all about allocation of resources and whether the government or the market is a better allocator.</comment>

<comment>well, or forcing them to pay their servants a higher wage. The government then doesn't actually have to 'take' the money. Raising the minimum wage, increasing rather than decreasing workers rights etc doesn't involve taxation. It would mean rebalancing what one 'earner' gets and what the other 'earner' gets. The government does this all the time. For instance, there are protections on patents, copyrights etc, that the top earners benefit from at the cost of keeping out lower earning competition. I cannot start a company, call it Facebook and take all of Zuckerberg's business- so maybe he shouldn't be able to get his house cleaned, or his burger baked under $15 an hour.</comment>

<comment>So increasing the minimum wage and abandoning patent and copywrite protection would eliminate income inequality?Pharsical.Both would have the exact oppodite impact as those at the bottom become unemployed en masse.</comment>

<comment>Zuckerberg already wasted $100 million of his own, and $100 million of matching funds on trying to help the city of Newark.    It's his business where he throws his money away, but he may as well burn the $45 billion because it will not help anyone other than those who are in the supply chain.</comment>

<comment>If you want to read an article about failed attempts to remedy poverty, read the above article except replace Zuckerberger/billionaire with "progressive wealth transfer policy."  Then you'll learn something.I'll also note that this article is very good at portrying a very basic underpinning of progressive philosophy - we are smarter than you so give us your money  - we can spend it way better than you.</comment>

<comment>...which sounds hauntingly similar to the conservative philosophy: We are smarter than you, and we deserve most ALL of the riches this land (isn't your land) has to offer. Oh, and P.S.: From 18k gold toilets to pricey nose candy for Junior to corporate jet flights with a single passenger -- our beloved poodle, Buffy -- we can spend it WAY better than you can!Love, your friends,we really, really mean it,America's New-Style Capitalists</comment>

<comment>Well I suppose the main difference would be that one philosophy (conservative) doesn't rely on oppressive and confiscatory government to take earned money from one and hand it to a non-earner while the other believes that the individual is incapable of succeeding on its own ("you didn't build that") and that salvation lies in the arms of a loving and kind government.  Funny.</comment>

<comment>...and the other philosophy (progressive) doesn't want to have to continue to watch as an oppressive and confiscatory ruling class grabs all of the cream off the top, with the complicity of its employees, the poli-hoors, leaving only weak whey water for Labor/Consumers. You know, the class whose feet actually hit the cold floorboards to go and do the work.What part of ***450 BILLION Dollars*** isn't registering? And 450B is nothing compared to some of their horded fortunes. Who needs that much money? Tell me, whose time is worth 4k of every second of every hour of every day of every year, for eleven years?</comment>

<comment>That they cannot spend it entitles you to take it from them?That they earn it stops you from earning?There are no "horded fortunes."  The money is being spent or invested.  It's a progressive lie that money is kept out of circulation.</comment>

<comment>you're doing it wrong: it's:  "the workers have no right to a minimum wage. Hitler only got into power when the Weimar republic had a minimum wage.", "Unions are evil Mafia infested organizations, because Jimmy Hoffa!" and "Zuckerberg is actually really poor- he doesn't get any welfare! The Welfare Queens in the inner cities are the real 1%"  And then some stuff about Donald Trump being the messiah.</comment>

<comment>Nonsensical diatribe.</comment>

<comment>exactly.</comment>

<comment>With so many poor neighborhoods in the U.S., and these philanthropists are helping other countries instead of their own.  Just look at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  I'd be happier if Bill Gates and Zuckerberg had STOPPED spending millions lobbying for more and more h1b foreigner visas.</comment>

<comment>to be fair, Gates and Zuckerberg do spend a lot of money on education in the US too: the common core program is in part paid for by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation</comment>

<comment>Given that they're spending MILLIONS lobbying to keep and increase the number of h1b visas so they can give the tech jobs to foreigners right here on American soil, it's obviously not enough.  They're scum.</comment>

<comment>***BREAKING NEWS***Mark Zuckerberg announces creative tax vehicle for sheltering his money from the poor and working class.</comment>

<comment>Most "philanthropy" is just to dodge taxes.  </comment>

<comment>Billionnaires rake in the profits by channeling them into their own pockets rather than raise wages and then purport to remedy the mess they've created by choosing their own deserving poor and what they decide they should need. It is spitting in the face of democracy. Only an elected government should pocket taxes and give equal access to whatever welfare or educational programs are needed. What is happening is privatization of all aspects of life in the hands of a very few.</comment>

<comment>This article is flawed because the poorest people in the world are not in the United States, but in developing countries. Those countries often lack basic public health and education, so improving health and education is actually vital to improving their economies and reducing poverty. Improving labor standards, building a safety net, etc. does not help the world's poorest people. But private charitable donations to evidence-based health and educational improvements do help those people. I would be willing to bet that the average dollar of private charitable spending reduces poverty more than the average dollar of government spending.</comment>

<comment>And yet in these countries too, there are structural changes that would, or do already, have much more of an impact than either charity or government aid. Think work place safety laws, unions, minimum wage etc. Look at Bangladesh as an example. It is great that the garment industry has sprung up there, as out means that men and women have gainful employment. What would help even more though, is a higher minimum wage, a strong union,  proper bureaucracy, and accountable police and government. So we should ask ourselves, do we want to give a dollar to a school or a health clinic or, alternatively, to a union, an opposition party, an independent newspaper? I would posit that the latter choices have more long term impact on poverty than the first. This may indeed partly explain the difference in success between the Marshall program and foreign aid. Through de-Nazification, the Marshall program invested heavily in a civil society in West Germany, which became the engine of Western Europe\s post-war economy. (You could also think of the Atlee government in the UK, or indeed of its role as occupier and writer of the the West German post-war constitution, with its worker councils.)</comment>
