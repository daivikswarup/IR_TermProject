<comment>Donald. Trump so far is dominating the states that people thought would bring about his demise. The Republicans are finally seeing and I guess accepting the fact that Trump is serious. Donald Trump so far as never laid out a plan on how he will be able to accomplish preventing immigrants coming in. The only thing he has been saying is that he's going to build a wall at the border. Trump does not have the knowledge to build a wall. Trump is feeding off People's fear.Trump is a loud mouth ignorantly ignorant. His mantra throughout this epic masquerade has been, I'm going to build a wall,,  I'm going to make America great again.  Yet, he cannot say how he plan on making America great again.   </comment>

<comment>He's just gonna do it.</comment>
