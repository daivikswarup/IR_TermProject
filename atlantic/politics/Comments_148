<comment>Anyone who thinks Republicans actually care about deficits should see Donald Trump's doctor to have their head removed from their a55 .</comment>

<comment>I agree. But I remember the Dems saying that deficits were a big thing when Reagan was President and then when Bush II was was President. Obama gave a passionate speech on the subject when he voted no to increasing the debt limit. Then, after Obama, became President, deficits didn't matter and the Dems ran $1T deficits.So, the truth is both parties use the deficit as a political weapon as it suites their political needs.</comment>

<comment>Democrats do care though, which is why they raise taxes. They're stupid for doing that, as it has electoral costs. They should just be like Republicans and not care.Secondly, Obama inherited a 1$ trillion+ deficit and an economy in freefall. Focusing on the deficit was the wrong thing to do for the first two years (see Europe), as it is the Dems turned towards the deficit way too quickly.</comment>

<comment>That is complete nonsense. The Dems use the deficit as a political tool to expand the size of government. They don't increase taxes to cut the deficit, they do so to expand government. This is why the Dems have never seen a government program -  except the military - worth cutting.I am not say the military budget is sized correctly and that it should never be cut. However, defense is unambiguously a legitimate role for the federal government. Yet, it is the only thing Dems are willing to cut. </comment>

<comment>Could that be because expanding the military when we already have the largest spending on by a factor of 10+ makes no sense, when we also provide the lowest level of government services to our citizens in the major industrialized world?It makes sense to cut the largest expense, and increase some of the lowest expenses that help the greatest number of people.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the apologia on the 2009 deficit. You will notice that whatever deficit Obama inherited he added to it. He didn't reduce it, he added to it.Second, you will also please notice that the analysis of the deficits in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 are missing. There were trillion dollar deficits in,  I believe, 3 of those 6 years.You will recall that I said neither party cares about deficits, showing me that Bush contributed to the deficit doesn't tarnish my argument. I am fully aware of that. I am also aware that deficit spending exploded under the Dems when the controlled spending. </comment>

<comment>So it was never about deficits, just pork for big donors while screwing the constituents? Surprise, surprise.</comment>

<comment>Republicans care about the deficit?that's a good one</comment>

<comment>About the same as Democrats care, it turns out. That's why one of the most dangerous terms affecting all Americans over the past 40 years has proved to be "bipartisan majority", a/k/a whatever corporate lobbyists dictate.</comment>

<comment>Actually the Dems are better since they're willing to raise revenues to pay for their spending more often</comment>

<comment>ROFL. Democrats raise taxes and then spend even more than the new taxes bring in.</comment>

<comment>Only a Republican apologist (or someone uninformed) would make the old case, "both sides are the same...".This is the worst display of negativity, obstructionism and phony economics the public sector has ever endured from the GOP, their leaders, their media and their bribed representatives in government..</comment>

<comment>Hilarious.The Obama Deficit has been the theme for six years.Now--pfft. Gone.Dick "Deficits Don't Matter" Cheney is back in charge of the Republican Party.</comment>

<comment>Did you hear Tax Cuts are actually free</comment>

<comment>Right, they pay for themselves when the trickle down fairies sprinkle growth all over your country.</comment>

<comment>Lawmakers of all parties, like Americans, have the "spend first, save later" mentality. That's why it would be nice to have some actually fiscally responsible politicians. Too much to ask, I'm sure, but at least our current President managed to pull the deficit down.</comment>

<comment>Austerity works in helping make ends meet for workers and their families.Not so, with government spending.  In fact dropping money from helicopters (stupid spending) will create prosperity.Wise spending, for example the return of funding to the NIH and CDC will return several dollars to the treasury for every dollar spent.In addition, infrastructure spending reduces energy use, improves peoples' live, and employs the labor sector hardest hit by the lack of government investment in bridges, highways and schools.</comment>

<comment>Well, you're half right.Wise spending has a multiplier effect—yes.Austerity helps ordinary people—no evidence for that. The evidence is to the contrary.</comment>

<comment>I mean living within means as opposed to debt and quick money schemes common when money is tight.</comment>

<comment>I wasn't railing against Keynesian deficit spending during a recession. Rather, I'm just saying that maybe spending $1.01 for every $1 we collect no matter what isn't a sustainable path forward. That applies to things like multi-billion dollars wars more than extending unemployment insurance.</comment>

<comment>Sure, after increasing the debt by more than all presidents combined. But don't let that fact get in the way of your cherry picking.</comment>

<comment>Correct. Around half of it was sustaining government spending levels in a massive recession. Do you think it was a bad idea to continue funding Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, and our major defense programs at current levels when the country was bleeding tens of thousands of jobs a month?</comment>

<comment>They haven't forgotten about it.  They're pumping it up so that in 2017, with Jesus' help, Pres. Ted Cruz can use this new, higher deficit as a pretext to slash social programs.  Pretty much the same thing they did from 2001 to 2007. Create a crisis.  Frame the only solution as screwing the poor.  All while starting a new war in Syria.Because that's what Jesus would do.</comment>

<comment>LOL, you just blew a hole in my cynicism budget for the next decade.</comment>

<comment>I was worried my cynicism was out of control, so I went to a Cynics Anonymous meeting. But I saw through it. It was all a big scam.</comment>

<comment>hilarious!</comment>

<comment>Your first hint was "Join us a the Secret Cynics Anonymous Meeting, tonight!"</comment>

<comment>Paul Ryan being in the picture for this is greathis Medicare destroying budget took like 20 years to get anywhere with the deficit anyway even with totally made up numbersand he's the posterboy of debt concern?</comment>

<comment>The damage these people do is incomprehensible.  Dumb as rocks.  No sense of wise spending, no sense of responsibility to anyone but the moneymen.One more Republican President and this country will never recover.This makes me furious.The incessant demand for the Fed to raise rates is even more stupid.  Who does that help?  It will result in even more of the $200 billion spent just on interest on debt.</comment>

<comment>The incessant demand for the Fed to raise rates is even more stupid. Who does that help? It will result in even more of the $200 billion spent just on interest on debt.Your answer is embedded in your question. It helps the people who stand to collect those higher interest payments on the national debt and on all the other loans whose interest rates are pegged to the Fed's prime rate.Shorter answer: it helps the rich, at the expense of the middle class and the poor. That's pretty much the shorter answer for any question at all concerning Republicans.</comment>

<comment>It helps savers - and they're not necessarily rich.</comment>

<comment>Sure- just like professional basketball players aren't necessarily tall. Personally, I'd love to meet just one of these these middle-class "savers" that the GOP keeps yammering about and ask them why they've never heard of an index fund. My savings account at the bank pays 0.03%.It's not the job of the Fed to guarantee "savers" (wealthy or not) a risk-free return on the backs of American taxpayers.</comment>

<comment>Bill is likely referring to the elderly, along with the bulk of Baby Boomers beginning to retire, along with older Gen X who are trying to save for retirement. Their self-responsible pro-active saving has yielded them next to nothing since BIg Banking wiped them out  in 2008 - some after Investment Banking already diid that the first time in 2000. It is the job of the federal govt. to regulate banking, which it hasn't done since 1999. And it is the job of the federal govt. not to stand on the neck of the economy for nefarious purposes. </comment>

<comment>We're talking about saving - not investing.  Index funds have risks and are thus only suitable for the latter.  But I suppose the fact that savings accounts pay very little has led people to invest money they otherwise shouldn't be investing.  If so, that's the benefit of the rate increase.  People can put their short term cash in CDs again.And I don't see why the rich would be any more predisposed to saving than the middle class.  If anything I'd expect the rich to have less savings and more investments.  They typically have the income to cover moderately large expenses (cars, college, etc) without saving for them and by virtue of their wealth they can deal with volatility in their investment earnings in a way that middle class people (retirees mostly) can't.</comment>

<comment>No, they're not dumb, they know exactly what they're doing It's the old "Fiscal train-wreck" trick they've been doing since Reagan, and the same voodoo economics. The dumb ones are the people who keep voting these bought sociopaths into DC. If you're a fiscal conservative, you should vote Democrat. They have done more to balance the budget , with Clinton and Obama. If you're a free-market proponent, you should vote Democrat, because the GOP is all about protecting the cosy billionaires, closing the door for everyone else. The GOP should have the vote of 0.1% of the population, the ones who benefit from their policies. The rest are all duped.</comment>

<comment>One more Progressive President and this country will never recover.Fixed that for you</comment>

<comment>We DID recover barely from Dubya.  Ask anyone.</comment>

<comment>If we continue to elect most of the same people to congress every time they will do the same thing every time. Let's clean house and start over. It can't get any worse.</comment>

<comment>Hmm.  I'm not nearly so sure.  In 2010 and 2014 we got a whole lot of new congressmen,  and things have gotten decidedly worse! </comment>

<comment>No use changing the musicians, if they always play the same tune. You need to change the system, not the faces of the system.</comment>

<comment>It's not the musicians, it's those who run the game of musical chairs and then force the taxpayers to pay the band.</comment>

<comment>The problem is REPUBLICANS.</comment>

<comment>They are all greedy and can't wait ti get their hands on that lobbyist money.</comment>

<comment>I see your point, but it's actually the other way around, either you're a billionaire, or you have to suck up to the donor class, just to get in the race. It's no longer "The  Gov of the People, by the People, for the People" , and Citizen's United is bedtime for Democracy.</comment>

<comment>Why not both?</comment>

<comment>Both, sure, that's the idea. But first, focus on the system. Only then can new faces make a difference.</comment>

<comment>We need to ban high class prostitutes for congress members until they get the budget deficit down to 0. Who's with me?</comment>

<comment>Law of unintended consequences.  Pity the poor congressional pages and attractive lobbyists.</comment>

<comment>Eliminate the state altogether.</comment>

<comment>Sold!</comment>

<comment>Democrats have traditionally been much more fiscally responsible than Republicans, despite the empty rhetoric that comes from "deficit hawks" in the GOP.  We all know this is a lie.  But with Bernie Sanders in play, the game changes radically.  We know progressives have no philosophical quandaries when it comes to budget deficits and inflationary polices.  In fact, they welcome them.  Trump and the GOP in this election cycle are a disaster when it comes to the deficit, but since Clinton is being pulled so far left, this removes the Democratic party's traditional advantage.</comment>

<comment>I really don't carethe debt is like one of the least pressing matters this country has to deal with right now</comment>

<comment>You are far from the first progressive on-line who has told me this.  When people work hard and save their money, they do not need a paternalistic, authoritarian government. They become the enemies of the progressives.</comment>

<comment>That has little to do with the deficit</comment>

<comment>So you have no issue handing this massive debt burden to the next generation?  $19 trillion.</comment>

<comment>Best solution is to grow out of a deficit.I'd also like to give the next generation decent healthcare and some form of social safety net too</comment>

<comment>The way it is going, everything in life is being promoted as a form of healthcare. Back in the day, the European elites needed "rest cures" in the Alps that lasted months, even years.   Now, health care includes marijuana. The cost will never stop going up.  The "costs" of healthcare are very similar to the "costs" of college education, nothing is excluded.  Your entire food and housing budget soon enough will be considered a healthcare cost.  We'll also have people on life support at the end of life in perpetuity.  This cannot last.  It will not last.  We do need a universal program that really is insurance.  Everyone should be covered for catastrophes, and otherwise HSA's with high deductibles.  This is what we'll have in the end anyway.</comment>

<comment>True universal health care would save money in the long runnot crappy high deductible HSA supported nonsenseunless we're very serious about price controls no healthcare costs.</comment>

<comment>"price controls"?  There must be 100 million different items to price already in healthcare.  Simply hiring the bureaucrats to set these prices would cost a trillion.  The costs to administer this would be mindboggling.  It would not work.  These things cannot be controlled. IT WILL NEVER WORK.</comment>

<comment>Then why do countries with truly universal coverage pay less per person than we do?The answer is they control the costs</comment>

<comment>If someone has the money, and wants to pay for it, then they should be allowed.  There is no way we are ever going to have rationed health care. This is not an option.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.  Again,  we have rationed health care in the US right now.Read more.  With comprehension.  And post less. </comment>

<comment>We do not have rationed health care in the US.  You are lying.  If you have the money and a provider, you can buy whatever you want, as long as it is not prohibited by law. If you mean that it is rationed in terms of whether or not you have the money, then you are changing the definition of rationing.</comment>

<comment>That's rationing dude. Rationing by money instead of time.</comment>

<comment>Health care is rationed.  Before you can have a knee replacement,  gastric bypass operation,  a set of dentures,  or anything else,  it has to be reviewed and approved by your insurer.If you're fabulously wealthy, you can have anything.   If you're a working poor fifty-five year-old waitress in Texas,  you don't have Medicaid,  you can't afford insurance,  and you're just going to have to keep standing on those two bad knees for another ten years.That's rationing! </comment>

<comment>:-)   That is 100% NOT rationing.</comment>

<comment>Then,  why can't she get knee replacements?You don't think she can walk into the emergency room at Dallas Memorial and say,  "My knees hurt.  Quick,  get me replacement surgery right away!",  do you? </comment>

<comment>Hands down the silliest comment I have ever read.</comment>

<comment>You need to go back and read some of the doozies you've posted in the last hour.   I think you're selling yourself short! </comment>

<comment>It is rationed by price and access. Just because a hospital has to treat you if you show up in the ER bleeding from a gaping gut wound doesn't mean that healthcare isn't rationed. God, you're stupider than dirt.</comment>

<comment>Why do you have to be rude?  Your comment is not worth responding to otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I have to be rude, because you are persistently awful.</comment>

<comment>Flagged.</comment>

<comment>A bit thin-skinned for the internet, eh?</comment>

<comment>Not at all.  As if I don't fend off 100 times more attacks than you or anyone else. Who ever attacks you? You do a blatant drive-by on the definition of the concept of "rationing". There is absolutely no serious debate on what this word means, anywhere, but I am "stupider than dirt" for claiming we do not have healthcare rationing in the US. I write elsewhere here that I support quite liberal universal programs, well to the left of the majority of Americans, yet I am "persistently awful" in your estimation. This is just hate, pure and simple, and harassment and I will flag this from now on. I can understand you getting all hot and bothered about a race article, but this is about economics and you crossed the line.</comment>

<comment>Flagged</comment>

<comment>Whatever.</comment>

<comment>I will just keep flagging you when you act that way, don't expect a response.</comment>

<comment>It's rationed for all intents and purposes bro.  the idea that you can jsut pay for it if you want to is highly unrealistic.Unless you're a millionaire you don't have the cash on hand to pay out of pocket directly for serious medical care.</comment>

<comment>Are you a socialist?  This would only be considered a form of "rationing" to a socialist.</comment>

<comment>So if someone says the price for something is a quadtrillion dollars do you consider it to be on sale?</comment>

<comment>You can have both universal public healthcare and a private healthcare industry side by sideworks in the UK</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I am open to things like this. I'd like to see free clinics like the kind I had in college.  I would go there and see a doctor within minutes and got good service.  Now, I have to go to the ER and spend $1,500 and subsidize the people who also go there who pay $0.</comment>

<comment>Hmm.   Did you know that Medicare already HAS a Master Charge List of every medicine and medical procedure?   Did you know that it's considered the benchmark for private insurors' negotiation with the health care industry?.Your statement that "it would cost a trillion" to create it is not only hilarious,  but it thoroughly exposes you as a know nothing when it comes to health care.Read more.  Post less. </comment>

<comment>Reimbursement rates relate to what you can charge a patient, not what a procedure costs.</comment>

<comment>The master charge list states the actual calculated cost of all procedures.Again,  you don't even know what it is.   You've never heard of it and don't understand.  You're running around this forum making a fool of yourself and deflecting with inane "definitions" that you make up as you go along.I'm sorry.   I've got no more time for you. </comment>

<comment>It states the cost of the procedure to the patient, I agree.  This is like saying the price you pay for a car is the same as the cost to build it.  I am not sure you should be allowed near a keyboard.</comment>

<comment>You've gone from declaring that it would cost a trillion dollars to create a master charge list of all medical expenses that is already freely available (and that you didn't know existed an hour ago) to saying you're now an expert on what it is and what the numbers represent.Your level of stupidity is breathtaking. Let me guess... Ted Cruz is your man! </comment>

<comment>I thought you were done with me?  You are a socialist anyway.  Not worth my time. You think charging money for something is "rationing".  I appreciate your candor though.  I always learn a lot here.</comment>

<comment>And I appreciate your "candor," too.So,  when you post ""price controls"? There must be 100 million different items to price already in healthcare. Simply hiring the bureaucrats to set these prices would cost a trillion. The costs to administer this would be mindboggling. It would not work. These things cannot be controlled. IT WILL NEVER WORK."I'm just beside myself with Socialist glee,  eager to point out that we already have single-payer universal health care for seniors.   It already has a national (and regional)  charge list,  and it already has been administered for over thirty years,  it's been working for that whole time and seniors love it.Oh,  but cost,  you ask.   Well,  private insurers,  prior to the ACA,  which capped overhead at 15-20% based on the size of the insurance company,  ran from 15% to over 30%.Since its inception,  Medicare overhead has run a steady - - wait for it now---TWO PERCENT!!!!Where do you think economists come up with the $5 trillion in savings that Bernie Sanders universal health care plan would facilitate?  It WILL WORK.  It's simply Medicare for all.Now, you can go back and start rethinking all of the other idiotic positions you've been hoodwinked into believing.   I have to work. </comment>

<comment>but it's impossible!</comment>

<comment>How many people would it take to price 100 million inputs?  How likely will this result in "cost reductions".</comment>

<comment>Medicare does it.  Virtually every first world economy but the US does it.Every insurance company has their own separate system that does the same exact thing too!computers do amazing things these days</comment>

<comment>Healthcare companies, for the 100th time here today, have schedules for what they reimburse.  This has nothing to do with the costs of healthcare.  These are rates they will reimburse for certain procedures and office visits.  A doctor or a hospital has millions of individual line items that combined form their cost to deliver services.  The rate charged per visit to see a doctor is a NOT the cost!! How is it that I need to teach you this?</comment>

<comment>Right and why do medical procedures cost more in the USA than elsewhere?</comment>

<comment>LOL.   Free markets allocate resources very well.  Bureaucrats do not.  Last I checked, this country takes a free market approach.  I will side with the people.  You can run off and stomp your feet all you want to.</comment>

<comment>Not with healthcareIts a product you can't price out and have no choice if you want to buy</comment>

<comment>Get trounced,  change the subject.   Okay.The " free market approach" to health care.   Ahem.  There isn't one.Hospitals charge wildly different prices for the same procedure.   They never advertise "Knee replacement surgery--half off this week only!" yet the price differs wildly by hospital.  How do you know?   You don't! How do you choose hospitals?   You don't.   You choose a health insurance plan and they dictate which hospitals and doctors you can use.  There's no "free market"  to it.Again,  you're utterly clueless about health care.   Quit embarrassing yourself! Here,  read this.http://www.nytimes.com/interac...®ion=CColumn&module=MostViewed&version=Full&src=mv&WT.nav=MostViewed</comment>

<comment>You're way out over your skis on that post! </comment>

<comment>God forbid you have an actual rebuttal.</comment>

<comment>Next generation won't care about our deficit, just as we don't care about our parent's and grandparent's deficits. Our children and grandchildren will produce so many cars and tvs and cheeseburgers and a bunch of other stuff and all of it will be distributed among those alive at the time and none of it will be sent into the past to pay for our deficit. What we need to do for our children is provide them with the education and infrastructure - physical and social - that will enable them to create their own wealth and prosperity.</comment>

<comment>Gee whiz,  I'm sixty-six,  own two businesses,  totally debt free and work hard to pay that 15.3% payroll tax in addition to all of the other taxes and I'm voting for Bernie Sanders.Your "model" of political inclinations appears to be seriously flawed. </comment>

<comment>I've noticed too, that the reactionaries, even when they think their politics is "standing up for business" offends, alienates and harangues people who happen to be customers, or potential customers.You can tell from the way they treat people, they wouldn't make a go of it in any small business I know of.Dyspeptic crabby folks aren't helping business.</comment>

<comment>Its the Fox News narrative that the only people who vote for Democrats are needy minorities</comment>

<comment>don't worry about Hillary getting pulled too far left.  Remember she is DLC all the way, and her Wall Street supporters won't let her get too involved in Sanders-type fiscal politics.</comment>

<comment>Since Bernie Sanders' policy proposals are all accompanied by detailed funding analysis,  it has been easy for economists to analyze and conclude that we could have-- universal health care without premium or deductibles -- free college tuition to qualifying students at public universities -- expanded Social Security benefits-- paid family leave for all AmericansAnd we'd still save about $5 trillion over ten years.What's missing?  Oh,  taxes would go up on millionaires and billionaires and Republicans would have to sit down with their top contributors and explain to them that,  under a Sanders Administration,  billionaires couldn't just "have it all"  as they were hoping. </comment>

<comment>But, but, what about growth?!!? We need growth!?!?!?!</comment>

<comment>Seriously,  universal health care ALONE would provide American businesses a $1 trillion dollar a year stimulus simply by eliminating their participation in worker health premiums.   One trillion dollars a year.If they can't grow that,  I don't know why they're still in business. </comment>

<comment>"$1 trillion dollar a year stimulus"And there it is!  Thanks for playing!</comment>

<comment>I am sure somewhere out there you will find a highly respected study that proves money grows on trees.</comment>

<comment>For God's sake,  don't look closely at his policy proposals! Make some idiotic statement about money and trees,  hold your copy of Paul Ryan's Road to The Fancy Feast Senior Cat Food Banquet,  close your eyes and mutter,  "My trickle-down moment is coming,  I believe,  I believe,  I believe!" </comment>

<comment>There is no difference between the Keynesian idea of stimulus spending and trickle-down tax policies.  They are both equally dubious.  This is why we should simply agree to balance the budget and have no debt.  Debt should be used for a specific purpose.  Let's say we know a railroad is going to bring in $100 million in revenues to the government over 20 years.  Therefore, it makes sense to borrow $100 million to build the railway network.  Anything else is either trickle-down or Keynesian shenanigans.   Let's throw out all those charlatans.  Do we have a deal?</comment>

<comment>The bulk of the worlds economists disagree with you</comment>

<comment>Really?   I hear this fallacious argument all the time.  "The American people think..."  "All doctors agree..."  " Historians are in agreement about..."  "The mullahs are united in the belief that...".   My statement is very true in a pragmatic sense.  The budget is a political football.  Both sides abuse it and have nothing but hypocritical rhetoric.  One dollar to cut taxes has the same impact to the budget as a dollar to cut spending.  Probably 95% of economists get a liberal or progressive education.  This is consistent with all non-technical degrees.   Of course they will be Keynesians for the most part.</comment>

<comment>Macro economies are much bigger than just a plus or a minus.  Even on the most simplistic level they're not the sameLike you cut a persons taxes that money goes one place.You issue debt to fund a road project that money goes very different places.Like it or not our government is a integral part of the economy.  How and where it spends money has ripples effects that can change things in huge ways.</comment>

<comment>Since there will never be agreement on these things, and since there is never going to be anything remotely like a "proof" one way or another, it makes sense just to balance the budget and go into debt for programs that can be tied to future revenues.  Or, emergencies like a catastrophe or war.  I do not believe for one second that deficits bother you.  Keynesians love deficits.</comment>

<comment>Not true at all.  Keynesian thought actually says government spending should be used to balance out the economic cycle.Meaning spending should be increased during downturns and cut during good times</comment>

<comment>I know that in the US, Bernie is some kind of deranged Communist, but from this side of the Pond, he looks like a very boring centrist to me. Paid family leave, only two countries in the World don't have it : the US and New Guinea. New Guinea ! LOL ! Talk about falling behind !</comment>

<comment>Over there, you have the VAT, but more appropriate to the USA, you have a tiny tax on all large value stock trades.That tax here would generate 20 billion dollars a year- less if market traders cut back on speculative options, but still enough to fund free tuition at every public university.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the Tobin Tax. It varies, depending on the Country, but it's roughly 0.1 to 0.2 % on stock trades. And we still haven't turned into North Korea, apparently. Vat isn't a flat tax either. There's a mininum rate, for essencial goods, 3-6 %, a medium rate, 10-15% , and the high rate, that targets luxury and "bad" goods ( imported, pollutent, etc). Oh, and Estate Tax, don't forget the Estate Tax ! The GOP called it "Death Tax", and got rid of it. Who wants a Death Tax, right ? Well, WE DO !</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your constructive interest in the USA.</comment>

<comment>I've gotta ask: What would stop the "millionaires and billionaires" from simply buying their own country, shifting their wealth to said country, and renouncing their citizenship? In the Internet Age, actually being a citizen here isn't all that necessary.</comment>

<comment>Well, they personally could do that, except that to make money their businesses would have to be here and thus be taxed whether or not the owners of said businesses were citizens.We tax on income, not wealth, so their moving their wealth to another country would have no effect at all.</comment>

<comment>They could relocate the company's headquarters outside of America, and then pay the wealthy person from a country with very low income tax rates. Yes, they would pay sales taxes and other costs of doing business in America, but effectively a non-US citizen would be working for a non-US headquartered company.How would his income be taxed by the IRS?That's the point. If we're banking off taxing the "millionaires and billionaires", they could effectively leave.</comment>

<comment>Why certainly!  Move all of their money to a nice spot run by a petty despot and buy him off.  Some Americans did that many years ago.  The despots took their money and swung them from a rope.</comment>

<comment>Are you saying Clinton has been pulled left because of specific changes she's made from past platforms? The few changes I've heard from her are on social issues, but maybe I'm ignoring something she's done to appear more economically leftist</comment>

<comment>Step One.   Lower taxes on the very wealthy,  the NASCAR owners and horse breeders.  Label the program "The Path to Prosperity."  Hope no one notices that the truly wealthy are already down that path,  past the dock and on a yacht to the Cayman Islands.  This is just bon voyage pocket money.Step Two.  Claim that you had no idea that slashing revenue would,  gasp,  lead to greater deficits,  then look down and your shoes and say,  "Shucks!  It looks like we can't afford Medicare!  Those college kids are gonna have to pay 12% interest on their loans and seniors can't collect Social Security until they're seventy!"It's the only responsible thing the Republicans could think of.Or, vote for Bernie Sanders! </comment>

<comment>Rinse, repeat process in ten years like it never happened</comment>

<comment>You forgot step zeroIf a surplus is generated, refuse to use it to pay down the debt. Instead demand that taxes be dropped, because 'the fact that there's a surplus is proof that the government has too much of your money'</comment>

<comment>Step 3)  Be a progressive and think spending at 21% of the GDP is sustainable.</comment>

<comment>It depends.  Do the arithmetic smartypants:GDP=ConsumerSpending+GovernmentSpending+Investment +(Exports-imports)18T against 40T of assets is not an overly burdensome debt, IF we can reduce what we pay for healthcare.</comment>

<comment>The math shows the average revenue collected since WWII is 19% of the GDP.   21% < 19%.</comment>

<comment>Look at the reasons for said increases.  Frankly Obama has little to nothing to do with it.  Government Outlays increased and revenues decreased during the 2008 crash.Only in about 2013 did we actually start to hit the same revenue levels as 2008 again</comment>

<comment>Simple solution, raise taxes to 21% of GDP. Problem solved.</comment>

<comment>Show me were the US has collected more than 21% of the GDP no matter the tax rate.</comment>

<comment>Rule One) Be fiscally conservative when the democrats control Congress, raise a ruckus and blame the debt on them. When GOP retakes control, spend like mad because you can always blame it on democrats. Fox news will never say anything different, that is where you get (almost) all your support, isn't it??</comment>

<comment>"[Republican] deficits don't matter."  --Dick Cheney</comment>

<comment>Looks like the progressive left agrees with Dick Cheney.</comment>

<comment>so does the Republican Congress.</comment>

<comment>Which side squealed like a stuck pig over a 2% sequester.  Be honest.  The left does not care about debt and deficits.</comment>

<comment>who does?  Show me them and I will believe.</comment>

<comment>and the Right does?</comment>

<comment>Every time they try to cut anything, the left squeals like stuck pigs.</comment>

<comment>not Defense</comment>

<comment>now that they're in power they don't seem to care about it anymorefunny how that works</comment>

<comment>Remind us of what the Republican Congrress and Republican president did with the surplus they inherited in 2000?</comment>

<comment>Remind me when the dems wanted to balance the budget.</comment>

<comment>No.  Taxes need to be raised for every increase in war spending.Reagan's 39.6 should be put back at 50% or even 70% where it was.But you keep cutting and telling us how well it's working.  I don't know which is stupider, "trickle down" or "destroying the big bad government".  Never a kind word about saving us from banksters or helping those ground under the wheels of greed and offshoring of profits and jobsPlease don't destroy the housing market again.  Republicans have cost private families TRILLIONS in lost wealth from their shadow banking shenanigans they have not recovered from.</comment>

<comment>There is no correlation between top marginal tax rates and revenue.  Zero, nada, none.</comment>

<comment>What's deceptive about the graph?</comment>

<comment>It compares tax rates to the overall percentage ratio of total revenue to gross domestic product.  It's mixing apples (top marginal tax rate) and oranges (ALL tax revenue as a percentage of GDP.)It's an asinine,  meaningless comparison.Compare total  tax revenue of taxpayers in the highest bracket (remember,  they go through EVERY tax bracket on their way) by year.   Adjust for inflation.Uh,  it'll look like higher tax rates produce more revenue.  Next question! </comment>

<comment>LOL...that's how you normalize the data by year.</comment>

<comment>How do you gauge top bracket receipts by dividing the total revenue for ALL TAX PAYERS by the GDP?  It's a completely bullpuckey manipulation.  If you want to graph the tax revenue of the highest earners juxtaposed to the top taxable percentage for any given year, the percentages are the x axis and the revenue is the y axis.You have percentages as the x-axis and the y-axis is ALL taxes, not the revenue from the highest bracket, and it's diluted further by calling it as a percentage of GDP for that year.  That's completely NUTS!  The other posters are correct:  you're living proof that figures don't lie, but liars figure...complete with pictures!</comment>

<comment>Judicial Watch? Do you know that the people from judicial watch are not scientists, economists or probably not even lawyers but paid hacks and paid handsomely to push propaganda and smut for Wall Street, Big Oil ,Pharma, Lobbyists and the 1%. They don't give a rats a** about you or the issues they claim to care about!! They're all about their money. They will say and do anything for enough ca$h. When people should be hearing and learning about important issues, they'd rather have you concerned with gossip and hearsay. They'll rile people up and make their own news, the GOP have had more hearings about hillary clinton's emails than we had for the 9/11 commission. I don't care (most people don't) about who sent what email to whom. I do care that I can barely make my rent, haven't had a raise in 4 years, have to worry about call off sick for a week because of the flu. All the while the people at the top would rather I concern myself with who's emailing who.</comment>

<comment>Very true.</comment>

<comment>You're getting your memes confused.  It's "tax and spend" liberals;  "borrow and spend" conservatives.</comment>

<comment>Ronald Reagan quadrupled the national debt as a number, $1T to $4T.Doubled it as a factor, 1/3 of GDP to 2/3 of GDP.</comment>

<comment>Obama will bring the debt from 10T to 20T.</comment>

<comment>Healthcare repeal will dump some more debt on us.Your party is the most selfish, ignorant and greedy in history.</comment>

<comment>LOL..The GAO said they can't even score this one.</comment>

<comment>Obama will bring the debt from about $12T to $19T, less than doubling.Also, slightly less than GDP to slightly greater.  It hardly moved.GWB took it from 2/3 GDP to 1x GDP.======Edit:Actiually I used 12 years for Reagan: 8 Reagan + 4 GHWB.12 for Obama and Hillary to 2020 is a national debt of about $22T, still less than double.</comment>

<comment>It was 10T when Obama entered office.</comment>

<comment>You need to count 2009 to Bush since that fiscal year was determined under Bush, not Obama. Just like the first fiscal year of the next president will be Obama's not Clintons.</comment>

<comment>I did it that way.   $1.4T was borrowed in 2009.  You are right.  Conservatives won't accept this.</comment>

<comment>What really blows their little minds is when you remind them that the last Republican president, Bush, entered office with  $400B surplus and left with that $1.4T deficit.</comment>

<comment>it was 10T when Obama entered office.</comment>

<comment>Please, do illuminate us on what specific policies that Obama proposed or approved lead to this.Or was it already baked into the system under the previous Administration and GOP congress?</comment>

<comment>Spending increased under the Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Still not paid!The U.S.S. Missouri, an obsolete if famous battleship, was refurbed at Reagan's behest, and still needs to charge admission at Pearl to try to pay the costs of keeping it afloat.crazy spending on Star Wars shouldn't be forgotten.  Dubya revived even more spending on it.</comment>

<comment>Scotch Scmotch...I'll have some of that schmotch!</comment>

<comment>Republicans were only "serious" about the deficit and debt when they thought it was a political advantage. Knocking a trillion off Bush's last deficit took away that line of attack. The strongest evidence it was just empty rhetoric was former Speaker John Boehner's statement that tax code reform had to be "revenue neutral."I have a hard time seeing what Republicans stand for anymore, other than protecting hedge-fund billionaires from paying another penny in taxes.</comment>

<comment>Well, they do hate gays, Latinos, and Muslims, so there is that.</comment>

<comment>Also single women, retirees, union members, college graduates, the old, the young, people who live on the coasts, the upper middle class, and the poor. . . basically, anyone who won't be physically present at the Republican National Convention (and, come to think of it, a whole bunch of people who will be).</comment>

<comment>It's instructive to read what George W. Bush said about the Republican economic philosophy after his election. Democrats warned at the time that it was too risky to cut taxes, increase spending on seniors and education, and expect to still pay down the debt, as Bush promised. See: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bu...</comment>

<comment>Thank god. Our country's big problem is that the deficit is too low to produce adequate demand. The Republican desire to increase the deficit via tax breaks for the rich is probably the worst possible way to do so, but getting to a place where we don't have to act like the deficit is something to be concerned about is definitely a positive step.</comment>

<comment>You weren't expecting principle, were you?  These are professional politicians after all.</comment>

<comment>Let's get serious about terrorism and war.  Real debate in Congress about what should be done, then special war graduated income tax, military families exempted, to pay for it all in real time.  Victory gardens for poor military families.  All military armaments regulated for war purposes only.  90% tax on war profiteers.  Energy corporations based in the Middle East 90% tax on profits till the Long War is over.When pigs fly, and the American people put their money where their mouth is, realizing finally and for a good score of years the distinction that the Supreme Court apparently does not between money and talk.</comment>

<comment>Why "military families exempted" from the war tax? Soldiers these days tend to vote "pro-war"--why on earth shouldn't they have to pay for it too?</comment>

<comment>They are not in control of the whole government.  In the end any bill have to be signed the executive branch.</comment>

<comment>I have no idea what that means.</comment>

<comment>You wouldn't.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't what?</comment>

<comment>Cut spending.</comment>

<comment>A balanced budget takes lots of cuts.</comment>

<comment>How does a bill pass with out Obama singing the bill into law.</comment>

<comment>Are you high?   Has the House ever passed a bill they knew never stood a chance of being signed into law?  Why, yes, many times.  And they did so citing a responsibility to their constituency, blah, blah, blah.I'll ask again: what prevents them from proposing a balanced spending plan now?</comment>

<comment>Dumb ass....that's the reason the government gets shut down.</comment>

<comment>So you are high.</comment>

<comment>Yes Congress has forgotten about the deficit. Only stupid people don't know that we must always accumulate more debt or the system fails. And we have to accumulate debt until the system fails.The system is designed to fail. It is only propped up until the rich bankers that own the Federal Reserve steal all the wealth from the nation possible. Then they collapse it and start a new system of mass theft.</comment>

<comment>Actually, we don't have to accumulate more debt. We just have to be sure to not pay off all of our existing debt.  We have to have NEW debt, not more debt. That was the biggest fear when Clinton managed to have a surplus on paper.  The entire global financial system is based on US debt and the interest rates associated with it.  If we paid off all of our existing debt and then sum, suddenly that very important anchor point that everything is based off of is gone.  That would be very very bad.We can pay off almost all of our debt, but just have to be sure to leave some around so we have to keep issuing new debt on the interest.  We have to keep the anchor point in place for the financial markets.</comment>

<comment>Do the math.</comment>

<comment>Wait, are we still pretending Republicans genuinely believe in fiscal responsibility and limited government?</comment>

<comment>"While deficits are projected to remain stable for the next few years, the budget is nowhere close to balancing,"Actually it is, if the deficit this year is only $439B, then it would only take a combination of $220B in cuts and tax raising to bring it into balance right now.Of course the dirty little secret is that having a balanced budget does not matter to either party, so lets please stop pretending that it does.</comment>

<comment>Only?The point the author is making is that the long term picture is markedly worse than what we see over the next couple of years due to continued increases in spending that outpace increases in revenues.</comment>

<comment>The point I am making is that we are close enough to balance right now that we could cut enough spending and raise enough taxes to balance the budget next FY if we really thought this was some worthwhile goal. But we don't. Neither party. Nor do you apparently. I know I don't.</comment>

<comment>"Let's not bicker and argue about who is going to pay for who, this is supposed to be a happy occasion!"</comment>

<comment>Of course they have, deficits don't matter under Republicans. Deficits are a thing of the past when a Republican is in power money can be spent and not accounted for that's how they roll. When Democrats are in power the deficit is so very important and they will bang on about if it forever how high it is and how every penny spent must be accounted for it's pathetic. The public you'd think would be wise to their antics by now.</comment>

<comment>Republicans have been very clear about this.  Surpluses belong to the American people and need to be given back in tax cuts, deficits belong to Democrats, and Republicans are just innocent guys trying to balance things.  Or so they keep telling me.</comment>

<comment>Bias in reporting, whether liberal or conservative, works best when it is subtle and operates just under the reader’s level of conscious awareness. The Atlantic should keep this in mind next time they publish something that sounds like it was written by aDNC staffer.</comment>

<comment>"It was only a few years ago that trillion-dollar budget gaps and the ever-rising national debt were the singular preoccupation of lawmakers in Washington—particularly Republicans. "And it was only a couple years before that when every Democrat was scandalized by Bush's abhorrent spending.  "He sold our children's future to China!," was the common refrain, at least among my associates.  One young up and coming senator from Illinois, caught up in the moment, even promised a "net spending cut" in a Presidential debate (!).  So adorably naive.  He promptly forgot about this when elected.  He had good reason to, of course.  Even bigger obstacles were afoot... although the complete nonchalance that the issue still receives from that side  7 years later worries me a little.   So now, with a little taste of power it is time for the GOP to forget about what they pretend to care about.I'll be darned if I have any idea to resolve it.  Heck we've been spending like gangbusters for a decade and a half and it doesn't seem to have much bad effect so maybe there's nothing to worry about!  I suspect it won't matter at all until one horrible day when it matters very much.  I hope I'll be dead then.</comment>

<comment>Spending under Bush 43 as a percent of GDP was pretty restrained, certainly relative to current norms.</comment>

<comment>And killing little kitties is less bad than killing little puppies.  But they're both pretty darn bad.</comment>

<comment>"Whether the legislation that Congress ultimately passes is that large remains unclear. While Republicans want to make popular tax breaks permanent, Democrats are balking at its size and cost, which is not offset by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts."Am I in opposite land?The sheer double think I'm seeing among people worries me.</comment>

<comment>Not really. The difference is that republicans control both houses of congress now, so it's not politically expedient to rail about the budget any more. The republicans only care about the deficit and high spending when they are not in power.The democrats have always been the more fiscally responsible party since Reagan, so their continued concern is not surprising.  Republicans always cry about the "tax and spend democrats," but the democrats increase taxes to pay for the increased spending over time.  Republicans just increase spending, while lowering taxes.  Then the democrats regain power, increase the taxes to pay for the increased spending, and the republicans are back to campaigning on taxes being too high.  It's an obvious cycle to anyone paying attention to the actual numbers and not the rhetoric.</comment>

<comment>The legislation, which is still being negotiated along with a $1.1 trillion year-end spending bill, would make permanent and in some cases expand tax credits and deductions that lawmakers usually revisit on an annual or biannual basis.Another example of why DC cannot be trusted on the budget.  Not because of the price tag cited by the author but because the "cost" of this bill is nothing more than accounting gimmickry.DC extends these tax breaks every year at a cost of $70 billion or so.  Now they are going to extend them forever at a cost of $700 billion over 10 years.  How is that different?Only in the stupid world of baseline budgeting (for revenue) where analysts assume that popular tax breaks won't be extended.The only real change in this bill is the delay in the Cadillac tax for a couple of years.  Other than that, only the time frame has changed.Note, I'm not a fan of all these tax breaks.  I would kill most of the things in the bill but to pretend this bill is somehow a major, budget-busting departure from history is simply factually inaccurate.</comment>

<comment>Deficit Schmeficit. Republicans have never reallycared about it, and Democrats should stop pretending to care about it. All the predictions of the deficit causing inflation have not materialized.</comment>

<comment>It is inevitable that the deficit will result in inflation some day.  It's also inevitable that no one really cares about that because it doesn't help them win elections right now.When Paul Ryan is considered to be the super serious budget policy guy, and even HIS proposals result in perpetually increasing deficits, then you know the reality of fiscal conservatism in Washington.  It simply does not exist.</comment>

<comment>Republicans in Congress only care about the deficit when a Democrat is in the White House.Otherwise, they're more than happy to pair tax cuts for rich people with reckless war spending.This is why if you're a fiscal conservative, you should always, ALWAYS vote for a Democratic president, and Republican congress critters.  It's literally the only way you're going to see even a token effort at budget restraint.</comment>

<comment>Deficits, per se, don't matter; their size relative to the size and direction of the economy matters, and their structure matters. That said, the GOP and the Dems, broadly speaking, have different attitudes toward them.(Let me clarify that I'm really just talking about the respective party strategists, not the widely diverse grassroots in each party).The Dems in principle are okay with borrowing for infrastructure that they think will pay for itself, and prefer not to borrow for income and wealth transfers, but actually to raise taxes on the wealthy for that purpose. Not that this distinction matters, since the money in the budget is fungible. However, when increasing taxes on the wealthy are not politically feasible, the Dems are willing to do the spending anyway, perhaps on the theory that *eventually* the deficits will have to shrink, and *maybe* the Dems will be in a better position later than they are today to make sure that shrinking the deficit is more about increasing taxes on the rich than about cutting the wealth and income transfers.The pro-corporation wing of the GOP is in principle okay with deficit spending for for the same reason it's okay with Johnson & Johnson issuing bonds. But it's also hugely in favor of using the tax system to transfer wealth upward. One way to do this is to allow the debt to increase to the point that radical changes become necessary, and then to lobby to make sure those changes come in the form of cuts to the services that the poor and lower middle class use and not in the form of increases in income taxes (especially on capital gains or dividends). It's okay, though, to have tax increases in the form of payroll taxes (corporations like to cut jobs anyway) or in the form of fee-for-service taxes. In the meantime, this wing of the GOP (and it's the one to which I belong) has no scruples about grabbing unsustainable tax cuts *now* and using the burgeoning debt *later* to force cuts in services that we don't personally use anyway.In these goals, we're aided by the Jaysus wing of the GOP who conflates welfare spending with the expansion of Secular Big Government, and is highly receptive to our "starve the beast" talk on tax cuts. And though we don't like war, we can even (if we hold our noses) do business with the Neocon War Hawk wing of the party, because all the spending on military hardware, as much as we hate it, a) increases the dividends paid by companies in which we own shares; and b) expands the deficit and thereby, eventually, helps us make the case for restructuring Medicare and Social Security into forms that pay us dividends, instead of their current forms. (Anyway, what else can we do? It's not like we could win *any* elections without support of the Jaysus wing and the Big Military wing; so we compromise).The punchline of all of the above, naturally, is that any analysis of how our views on deficits have "changed" tends to err on the side of missing our entirely cynical approach to political discourse.</comment>

<comment>dangerous honesty</comment>

<comment>Tax credits and deductions tend to increase collections, not reduce them. We've known that since JFK did it in the early 60s. Reagan did it later and increased collections significantly by growing business and increasing personal wealth.</comment>

<comment>I watch institutions and business corporations increasingly thumb their noses a Federal regulations which amounts to not obeying law. They do this because they know that across the board the federal government and its agencies do not have enough personal to adequately enforce the laws of the land. For fifteen years the cut and gut mantra of too many legislators has been successful. Here in Florida in the new housing boom I am watching developers ignore wetlands regulations because they know enforcement is weak or none existent and they can fill and build as they please. If the nation is revenue strapped it is because legislation has been designed to extract taxes from the citizens who can least afford to pay taxes and fees while large concentrations of money and wealth become more exempt from economic responsibility too the nation. The whole concept of deregulation and small government has become effective to the point of corruption. The idea of government efficiency, which is a legitimate concern, has been trampled into the dirt by the idea of business anarchy(unfettered capitalism) which means allowing business to do as it darn well pleases without government intrusion. Those who adhere to the idea of business anarchy are blind to the fact that the end results of such an economic fallacy will be rampant corruption to the detriment of the whole nation.</comment>

<comment>The national debt is meaningless.</comment>

<comment>The deficit has been used by both Democrats and Republicans to scare voters.Rush used to mock Sen. Hollings in a mock southern accent ("ah wahnt to lower the DAFicit") when the Democrats were beating Reagan up over this.It's another scare-'em Boogeyman.</comment>
