<comment>Compared to the states, the feds do a good job. At least when they get infrastructure money they actually do spend it on infrastructure.States, on the other hand, are notorious for siphoning off money from supposedly dedicated infrastructure funds, and using that money for politically sexier things and to paper over other budget holes. Then they go back to taxpayers hat-in-hand crying poverty - and, in Democrats' case, how those mean old Republicans won't invest in infrastructure.I figure a federal gas tax hike would be okay IF AND ONLY IF states are required to cease the funny business with their own gas-tax revenue, tolls and vehicle fees - and if they don't, they don't get so much as a spoonful of asphalt from Washington.</comment>

<comment>In California, we take the money and waste it on high speed rails that no one will use.</comment>

<comment>Now,  Sarge,  you're sounding a bit like Yogi Berra.  "Nobody goes there anymore,  it's too crowded!"High speed rail isn't even up and running yet.   Might be premature to handicap ridership,  no? </comment>

<comment>It will literally be over a decade before the damn thing runs from Sacramento to San Diego.In the meantime, our highways and roads are actively falling apart, at the same time that funds were diverted from counties to balance state ledgers and costs were shifted down to the counties. Jerry Brown can go drown himself in his father's aqueducts.</comment>

<comment>No true.In the first month every attention craved celebrity will ride it and they will have caviar and champagne just to be seen.After that, you're right. They'll be empty.</comment>

<comment>The feds in Washington DC blackmailing states creates dysfunction, not function.  For example, federal highways funding is tied to laws about drinking age.</comment>

<comment>Apples/oranges.States get to set their own gas taxes, registration fees and so forth - and the feds do not cause state legislatures to play fast and loose with their own tax revenues to cover for their previous overpromising and budgetary shell games.</comment>

<comment>And iirc the states hamstrung themselves with balanced budget requirements. If I'm wrong about that, do post a reputable source, please.</comment>

<comment>this is indeed a serious and overlooked problemwhen the highway trust fund was created, the money was actually spent on the interstate highway system ( which includes the routes through major cities used by commuters as well).now -- localities use that money on parks, bike paths and in many cities, commuter rail boondoggles  ( to be clear -- rail works well in certain high density metros -- but outside of those, they are vanity projects that serve only to enrich developers along those routes, but are money holes for the city)the blog post above notes the gas tax hasnt been raised in 20 years -- as if increasing the rate of tax is the natural order of things ( and I get that in the progressive mind, it is) -- but on a volume basis, we are buying far more gas today than we did 20 years ago.   The real cost of maintaining a mile of freeway hasnt gone up faster than inflation ---so if the gas tax is producing more revenue in real terms than 20 years ago, and the price of road maintenance is no higher in real terms than 20 years ago  -- where is the money going?     That is the question the post needs to ask.</comment>

<comment>But the gas tax isn't producing more revenue in real terms than it was 20 years ago. It's a flat tax that hasn't kept up with inflation. So where is the money that is supposed to be used for infrastructure going? It doesn't exist.</comment>

<comment>You are incorrect, the gas tax is not a rate, it is a fixed amount. So the rate of the tax is actually going down, as we are still taxing the same 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993.</comment>

<comment>but you also have a significant gasoline volume increase as well ---   so in real terms on total tax proceeds -- government is getting the same fundingnow-- looking prospectively, gasoline usage has declined in the past couple years --- so we likely have a prospective issue on how to fund --but lets not blame "not enough money" on past low infrastructure spending</comment>

<comment>Isn't there also an increase in maintenance costs associated with the significant increase in gasoline volume?</comment>

<comment>Cars have gotten, and are continuing to get, more fuel efficient, so whereas before a gallon of gas may have taken you, say, 15 miles, putting wear and tear on 15 miles of road, now you're going, say, 30 miles on that same gallon of gas, and putting wear and tear on 30 miles of road. The federal government is only collecting that same 18.4 cents, but now has to repaid twice as much road with it. And there are more cars on the road, which causes more wear and tear.Having the same amount of funding to maintain more miles of road with more wear and tear per mile isn't really that helpful.And "not enough money" can absolutely be blamed on past low infrastructure spending. That's like saying that the fact you don't have enough money to rebuild/replace your engine has nothing to do with the fact you were unwilling to spend any money on oil changes or other maintenance. We wouldn't need as much money now if we had spent more in the past. The savings from not spending the money accrued, but the amount of repairs needed also accrued. Just because we didn't do all the necessary repairs last year doesn't mean we can just forget about them this year. Now we just have to do this year's repairs and last year's, too, except last year's will now be more costly and urgent. Now, more roads, bridges, railways, etc., need more repairs, with more urgency, will cost more money, and will need to be done simultaneously, rather than spaced out. And some of them will be after catastrophic events, like bridge collapses, or train derailments, when they're most expensive to complete, and when they will have an outsize impact on the economy.</comment>

<comment>Congress has the power to create new money, they do it all the time for the Pentagon.  At least this money will be backed up with productive assets, the very definition of capital.</comment>

<comment>Take Grover Norquist down the hall and drown him in a Men's Room urinal.Take all of the ridiculous pledges for no tax increases of any kind and make the signators flush them down the toilet.All legislators then wash their hands of lobbyist influence,  return the Chambers and pass a dynamic Federal Fuel tax that adjusts for Fund needs annually so that they don't have to change it again.One more Republican call for a corporate tax holiday for multi-national corporate tax cheats as a means of funding our roads and I'll be expecting all of them on their knees with one taxpayer's hand on the back of their necks and the other on the urinal's lever pressing hard. </comment>

<comment>Again, tax primer 101: the task of the party in power is to get the voters of the other party to foot the bill. You are way too idealistic.</comment>

<comment>David,  that's a false equivalency.   An increase in the gas tax falls on fuel consumers,  regardless of party.   Only ONE political party is channeling Norquist. </comment>

<comment>Neither party wants to vote for an increase in the gas tax.  It is a vote looser.  Officially Republicans are against it because it is a tax. Officially Democrats are against it because it is a regressive tax.</comment>

<comment>It's not a regressive tax,  it's an excise tax on the consumers of fuel.   Democrats support raising the Federal Fuel tax to claw back the losses from fuel efficiency to the Highway Fund. </comment>

<comment>Drown him in a bathtub. Maybe he'd get the irony in the last seconds of his life.Although poetic justice would have him dieing when a bridge he was driving over collapsed do to lack of maintenance.</comment>

<comment>How can this writer claim that this issue is "bipartisan" and go on to list partisan line votes on infrastructure maintenance and improvement? As usual, we have a revenue problem, not a spending problem. And there is only one party ideologically committed to privatizing public services and deregulating private industry.</comment>

<comment>He means 1 GOP lawmaker and a whole bundle of retired or ex Republicans support the issue. Yay, bipartisan!</comment>

<comment>Let's talk about "repatriation of corporate profits". I live overseas. If I withdraw money from overseas assets or have income that never sees the U.S. I am still required to pay taxes immediately.  The repatriation tax is actually a lower rate given to encourage repatriation. Why are we doing this? Why not tax corporations like people so that the system doesn't encourage corporations to hide profits overseas. We are in a unique position because our economy is so important as a market that corporations cannot withdraw. </comment>

<comment>Do as I did, become not a resident but a citizen of the country you do business in. What I make in Costa Rica, stays in Costa Rica. Learn from your corporate brethren like Apple.</comment>

<comment>After two years and not if you earn income in the US.</comment>

<comment>If we truly get open borders or at least porous borders and if the tax code does not change, I can envision returning to the US undocumented and leaving undocumented. If I live only 30 days out of a year in the US, I get a big ole exemption on income earned in the US.My US export business earns a slight profit, which is offset by tax credits. My Costa Rican business makes the profit.  Structuring is everything.</comment>

<comment>What the article does not delve into is specifically how the money we have had was dispenses and used or most likely misused.There has always been plenty of money to fix and change our infrastructure. The problem is politics and management.The Amtrak crash was a perfect example. The safety mechanism has always been available and it was never a matter of money. It was bad management. It took this crash to install something that could have been installed well before and it was not a matter of money.What voters should be looking at is line by line how this fund has been used for years -  on what projects - and to what resulted. Unfortunately political patronage plays too much of a role in how these funds get distributed and used.Before going to the knee-jerk reaction of raising taxes to be s superficial answer, we should be able to see how the money has been used and see it better management and oversight will correct the problem.</comment>

<comment>Most of the money was spent on new infrastructure projects rather than maintenance. I agree that this is poor management and we could use better oversight. Unfortunately, due to all these new ribbon cutting projects we are now overbuilt and need more money to maintain them.</comment>

<comment>The sad reality is that no politician ever got reelected for increasing taxes to spend money on things we've already built, perhaps because a critical mass of voters don't/can't understand that maintenance costs are a real thing.</comment>

<comment>It's because maintenance isn't 'sexy' There's no big ribbon cutting ceremony where the big pol gets to claim 'I did this' (even though the project started years before he got elected to the big chair and he voted against it when he was a backbencher nobody.)</comment>

<comment>We actually have term for that here in Texas. It's called Grammstanding, after former senator Phil Gramm. He was notorious for fighting tooth and nail against federal projects and then showing up at the ribbon-cutting and taking full credit for the creation of the project.</comment>

<comment>If you've ever talked to a free market libertarian, found mostly in the Republican party, you will come away with the idea that magical elves, come and maintain our infrastructure at night. No need for money for maintenance.</comment>

<comment>They really are like zombies, only they murmur "There is no free lunch, there is no free lunch" instead of "brains, brains."</comment>

<comment>A lot of conservatives think the problem is exaggerated in order to justify more spending. I wonder how bad the roads have to get before they realize the problem is real. But that's kind of like their attitude about climate change. They think the severity of that problem is hyped up too.</comment>

<comment>Republicans don't get their votes from cities, so they don't care about infrastructure to improve transportation through cities. Republicans are all about the suburbs and so they're typically all about new freeways so their voters can drive to work in style. These Republicans voters then cross the crumbling bridge to their jobs in the city, complaining that liberals are incompetent because the bridges in the Democrat-run city are falling apart while the freeways to their suburban homes are brand new.Its a vicious cycle of arrogance, incompetence, idiocy and selfishness. Its what we get for having a political process that rewards throwing $#!t at people, like monkeys in a zoo.</comment>

<comment>Well stated. I agree 100%. It's the same with schools too. Cut funding to schools in the suburbs and they'll get upset. Cut funding to schools in the city and they'll be happy. Let's not overlook the racial dimension to all of this. Who lives in the city? Minorities. So why give those people nice roads and schools, right?</comment>

<comment>Its a real tragedy. The suburbs wouldn't exist without the cities and in many ways, their success is directly tied to the success of that city. If the city turns into Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, the problems will inevitably find their way to the doorsteps of conservatives. But the primary motivation among today's Republicans isn't addressing actual problems, its shifting blame. "Chaos is a ladder", to paraphrase.Republicans just don't get the concept: if you're on a ship at sea and part of the ship is on fire, that's YOUR problem too, not just the people in that part of the ship.</comment>

<comment>In the DC area, Virginia gets its damn revenue from the DC suburban/exurban counties.  Federal contracting dollars pay for  the salaries of many who use the highways, but not enough is allocated to service a system that heavily serves the most congested parts of Virginia (who is getting 6 new stations in the next 3 years).</comment>

<comment>We need to clarify just what transportation projects are a Federal responsibility.  People are more worried about local projects and the money should be distributed at State level. The Federal Government should not be involved in any project that does not have direct National Security or Constitutional implications such as local bike paths and other such nonesense.</comment>

<comment>No, you are wrong.  Your "solution" is just another way to do nothing.</comment>

<comment>It's almost like you don't understand how the federal government actually works.</comment>

<comment>No, it's actually like 'statist' aholes like yourself don't understand.</comment>

<comment>You're the one conflating what you believe government should be doing with what it actually does, much to the detriment of your and -- tragically -- others understanding of what actually occurs.</comment>

<comment>This failure is sadly intentional and 100% self inflicted.It's not really bi-partisan at all, it is mostly the conservatives that oppose it, because they oppose the necessary tax increases on the wealthy and on corporations that would be needed to pay for infrastructure. There's really no other way to say it.One of the things I've noticed in the media is that the failures are often blamed as "bi-partisan". Often it is mostly one party that is the problem. The Republican Party in particular has been obstructionist on many issues since Obama took office, although the Democrats have not been a great party either.I suppose the construction lobby does not have enough campaign contributors, unlike the defense industry lobby, the fossil fuel lobby, or other industries with more powerful presences on K-street. I wonder how much money for infrastructure has been misspent or "appropriated elsewhere". Meanwhile billions are spent (no, wasted really), on things like the War on Terror.That and I hate to be so blunt, but voter apathy is part of the problem. Infrastructure takes money to maintain. Any politician that doesn't want to spend on anything that does not make them look good needs to be voted out. That requires a well informed public I am afraid.</comment>

<comment>Well perhaps if Liberals weren't in such a hurry to piss away every penny that comes into the coffers Conservatives would be more receptive.</comment>

<comment>Really? Who is it that keeps pumping more money into the military? That's the Republicans.</comment>

<comment>The Military is probably the one thing we get value for our money out of.</comment>

<comment>Sure, all those weapons systems that turn out not to work.</comment>

<comment>ROFLMAO. The military is the biggest waste of taxpayer dollars. Tell me why we need another fighter jet or aircraft carrier.</comment>

<comment>BWAHAHAHAHAHA You mean the F-35?Wait...you're serious...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, all those brand new tanks and airplanes, coming off the assembly line and going straight to the graveyards in the desert, are sure a great value for the taxpayer. The Pentagon doesn't even want them all, let alone need them, but Congress keeps the assembly lines running anyway. It's a jobs program disguised as military spending.</comment>

<comment>Defense spending is 20% of the federal budget.   Social security is 20% medicare and Medicaid 20% and interest on money we already borrowed is 20%.  So we spend 3 times more on social programs than the military.   Read our budget.  Except when the democrats are in charge and don't produce one for 3 years to hide what they are spending money on</comment>

<comment>I'm fine with spending on Medicare and SS. Tell me why we need to spend so much of our budget on the military. Show me another country that spends 20% of its budget on the military. As for paying interest on money we borrowed, who's responsible for increasing our debt? Reagan and Bush, wasting more money on weapons and wars we didn't need.</comment>

<comment>How is interest on money we borrowed a social program?</comment>

<comment>American politics is very simple: I try to tax the those who voted for the other party when my party is in power. Do not look for the solutions from the previous generations when Congress came up with reasonable solutions.  Have you opened a bank account lately? There was less paperwork to secure a mortgage 20 years ago.</comment>

<comment>Thank for you pointing out the media's role in all of this. I get so tired of the media trying to blame both parties for inaction in Washington. There's only one party that's guilty of doing nothing. It's the GOP. How is Obama supposed to work with a party that doesn't even bring bills to the floor for a vote cause they're too afraid the bill will pass?</comment>

<comment>Anyone who wonders about the problem should listen to some Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works hearings from the last few years, as archived on C-Span. The problem should soon become obvious.</comment>

<comment>The roads in California are really falling apart, the doubling of population in the past 40 years is taking their toll. Also they are filthy and filled with trash as no one has money to clean them up. Looking like Sao Paolo.Raise the g*d dam gas tax and pay for the roads you use folks. Stop expecting you get something for nothing, and stop being such cheapskates.</comment>

<comment>California is free to raise its state gas tax to pay for California roads.</comment>

<comment>It already has. The interstates are federal.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>All those make sense to raise funds, but a gas tax is a classic Pigovian tax with environmentally good side effects.Raise it by 50 cents a gallon and pay for the externalities we are causing by driving fossil fuel machines.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The middle class derive most of the benefit from roads, surely they should pay for most of the roads.Too long have politicians told us that one group can enjoy greater services, and another group will have the increased taxes necessary to pay for those greater services.</comment>

<comment>We'll also need an electricity tax for roadways too given the future prevalence of electric cars.</comment>

<comment>America is spreading itself too thin making international military adventurism a top priority while the domestic infrastructure is crumbling. The area I live in here in Western Colorado has a secondary state highway that is literally sliding off of mountainsides in places. 70 miles of mountain highway is built on an outdated too narrow road bed that is moving in the unstable geology. CDOT has projects underway here and there, but it's a drop in the bucket - this is symptomatic of an empire in decline ...</comment>

<comment>Conservatives think this is yet another myth invented by "the liberal media". When they hear stories about the nation's crumbling infrastructure, they think it's exaggerated in order to justify more money being spent on roads. I've had a number of conservatives point to construction workers who were just standing around and say "that's proof that we don't need to spend more money on infrastructure." In their minds, it's just another way of giving taxpayer money to people who don't need it. And since conservatives have such low respect for blue collar workers, it's easy for them to think anyone who works construction is just getting a government handout.I also think this is just an extension of their hatred of government and their religious belief in the private sector to solve every problem. Along with privatizing schools and retirement, I'm sure they'd love to privatize transportation as well. Let the wealthy use roads. The rest of you will just have to find some other way to get around.</comment>

<comment>Conservatives really should be all for raising the gas tax to pay for roads. The simple fact is the users of the system don't even come close to paying for the use and maintenance of the system. It's the tax payers that pay for all this. It costs the typical household around $1100/year in addition to what they already pay for gas taxes, tolls, etc.If that isn't a government subsidy then I don't know what is. Aren't conservatives all about hating government interference and subsidies?</comment>

<comment>They're just fine with government interfering when it benefits them. What they have a problem with is when their tax dollars go to help someone else.</comment>

<comment>All of this wrangling to find a way to pay for domestic priorities like infrastructure, meanwhile the War on Terror racks up huge deficits and nobody--here's looking at you, fiscal conservatives!--blinks an eye.What a farce.</comment>

<comment>The solution to congestion is not more roads. The solution to congestion is user fees, transit and density based zoning reform, all of which are non-starters with the majority in both houses of congress.It is better to do nothing than to build more roads.</comment>

<comment>We're not talking about funding the BUILDING of new roads, we're talking about properly funding the REPAIRING of existing roads/bridges/train tracks ... Learn to read properly.Yes sometimes the repair requires a total rebuild, but its not necessarily an EXPANSION of service, just making sure the existing service doesn't fall apart while you're driving on it.</comment>

<comment>Then why are so many new roads and highways being built. So many lanes being added to highways? Take that money and fill the potholes.Take the new Tappan Zee bridge. It is new, but it also has more lanes. Do I want a bridge to collapse, no. Would it be ok for that bridge to have the same number of lanes, yes. Are there instances of decrepit bridges that we should just close and not rebuild, definitely.</comment>

<comment>You are so part of the problem of why nothing gets done ...</comment>

<comment>Sometimes "nothing getting done" is better than something bad being done. In those cases, I support inaction.</comment>

<comment>Empty generalizations are the mark of a charlatan.A few years ago my county built a bypass around a heavily congested stretch of road running through two towns. It works. It's been great. The only problem is it still dumps out onto a one lane road that becomes impossible around 5. But the bypass made it better either way.Ideologically opposing all construction is foolish. Especially considering you're still ignoring maintenance of other roads. Highways need upkeep. City roads need upkeep. Your ideas about density won't do any good if people can't safely drive in the cities.</comment>

<comment>But "nothing getting done' will kill people.</comment>

<comment>So many people die in car accidents. Building more roads just encourages more driving so that more people die. We should be discouraging driving. If suddenly a person's trip to the Grocery store takes 5 minutes less they are going to go to the grocery store more often rather than planning your trips wisely. That will increase collisions, mileage, fuel use and congestion.I am not pushing to keep bridges in service that are about to collapse. Some of them should be reinforced/rebuilt and some should just have a "road closed" sign placed in front of them.</comment>

<comment>You are on the verge of being a blithering idiot.</comment>

<comment>That is the first true thing you have said in this entire discussion.Coherently: The US has too many lane miles. We should slowly reduce the number we have to 1) reduce road maintenance spending and 2) reduce automobile dependence.It would be stupid to do this quickly, but it should be a long term (50 years for a 20% reduction in lane miles sounds good) priority.</comment>

<comment>How about maintaining the ones we got. They were built 50 years ago, their natural lifespan is coming to an end. Do you think you build something and just walk away and all is fine?</comment>

<comment>The problem isn't only more roads. The problem is maintaining the ones we have. Not to mention bridges, rail, etc.</comment>

<comment>When Republicans controlled the congress and the White House in the last decade, they spent money on infrastructure like a drunk who just won the lottery. Unfortunately, most of that spending was on bull$#!T projects to buy votes in home districts, not improve the overall quality of our highways, ports and bridges. So we got rural freeways to nowhere, Alaskan bridges to nowhere and harbors built in the middle of nowhere.When Republicans are out of the White House, they're so determined to create gridlock to thwart a Democratic president that they just keep upping the voltage to their supposedly anti-government base of pi$$ed off loons. Every bridge or tunnel or highway is a conspiracy to bring about a police state - or its a waste of money, better spent on tax-cuts or defense increases.Bottom line: Republicans are terrible legislators.</comment>

<comment>The Sewall's Falls bridge, used to illustrate this story, is being rebuilt and will reopen in 2016.</comment>

<comment>Because they enrich themselves and corrupt all under the watchful eye of the rich fat cats while showing the giant middle finger towards average hard working middle class Americans.</comment>

<comment>Until Republicans move away from their anti-tax, anti-government ideology we're going nowhere effectively and will continue the cycle of deficits and debt.Republicans and the media love to tout total federal spending, which includes Social Security payments, to point to out of control government spending and "big government". The reality is far different than the propaganda.Reciepts and outlays for the Social Security System have always run a surplus, which is currently in the $150-$200 billion range annually.Discretionary spending, which is what congress actually authorizes, has trended downward since the 1980's as a percentage of GDP. Currently, discretionary spending is 30% below the average percentage of GDP of around 8.25% for the last 40 years and 40% below the average percentage of GDP during the 1970's, which was around 10% of GDP.Clearly the problem isn't so much spending as it is revenue and what that discretionary spending is spent on.Common sense and observation tells us that spending on education and infrastructure have declined for decades in real terms much less keeping up with inflation.That means that increases in defense spending and tax reductions, primarily related to major corporations, is where the deficits and increasing debt is coming from.We do need major tax reform and it needs to focus on corporate taxation, especially relating to global corporations, so that corporate tax revenue is back at historical averages of around 4% of GDP. Corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP since the 1980's is well below 2% of GDP.There's also room for higher taxes at higher income levels since they are about 75% of where they've been historically.We also need budget reform but it needs to focus more on defense spending than any other area.</comment>

<comment>Infrastructure can be a double-edged sword.  We  create it to facilitate development.  But, if it is well-designed and well-executed, land price inflation near improved infrastructure can chase development to cheaper, but more remote locations.  When infrastructure is extended to these remote locations, the cycle begins again, chasing development even further away.  The resulting sprawl destroys both our environment and our budgets -- due to the wasteful duplication of expensive infrastructure.Fortunately, some communities have found a remedy.  They have converted their property tax into a value capture fee.  This is accomplished by reducing the tax rate on privately-created building values while increasing the rate on publicly-created land values.  The lower rate on buildings makes them cheaper to construct, improve and maintain.  This is good for residents and businesses.  Surprisingly, the higher rate on land, by reducing the profit from land speculation, helps reduce the speculative demand for land and helps keep land prices more affordable as well.This tax shift can help make infrastructure financially self-sustaining while encouraging infill development to reduce sprawl and keep per capita infrastructure spending more affordable.</comment>

<comment>17 trillion in debt and military stationed in 140 countries. How are they going to fix the infrastructure? i don't think congress has ever known what it's doing.</comment>

<comment>The problem with infrastructure is that everyone wants to use it but no one wants to pay for it.  With the gas tax implemented in 1993 having only 50% of the value it had in 1993, there is simply no way to cover the expenses in today's dollars with yesterday's tax.  That's the simple reality of life.  So will continue to rot  as everyone bickers and whines and stews until were a 3rd world country and still nothing will be done.Everything is political and no give and take exists and so therefore nothing happens concretely (to fix the problems).   Like concrete, our government is permanently set and all mixed up and the only result will be bickering with compromise being impossible.Obama is a big part of the reason for this.  He is adamant to get everything his way.It's time to abandon BOTH the Republican and Democratic parties as being obsolete.It's time for a revolution in this country.</comment>
