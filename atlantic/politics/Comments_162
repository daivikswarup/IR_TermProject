<comment>What Flint needs is more diversity. Let's bring in a million Syrians. That will make Flint so strong.</comment>

<comment>One use for immigrants is as a tax base. This is a consideration with a contracting population. The alternative to expanding population, or raising more revenue from the existing population base, is the planned and orderly dismantling of sparsely populated neighborhoods which we can't afford to keep in clean water and electricity. You can see the obvious problems that will arise here. No one wants to give up their home. Some will stay on without their creature comforts like heat and clean tap water, rather than pay higher taxes.</comment>

<comment>The best immigrants are the ones with no money who can't pay taxes and costs loads in social services. They are so vibrant. Triple immigration now.</comment>

<comment>Tax base requires people with money to pay taxes.  Since 51% of immigrants are on some form of welfare and I suspect many of the rest are earning low wages, commiserate with their low skills and low education, I don't see how that helps.  Plus many of them have children and every school aged child is going to cost taxpayers around $10,000 to educate in a public school which offsets anything a minimum wage job earner would contribute in taxes.</comment>

<comment>John says: "I suspect many of the rest are earning low wages, commiserate with their low skills and low education..."I commiserate with whomever tried and failed to teach you English.</comment>

<comment>You know perfectly well the word I intended to use was commensurate, meaning in proportion to.   Now, how about you address the actual point instead of using logical fallicies to avoid it?</comment>

<comment>I know what word would have been correct. I see you claim in another post to have a "bachelors of science degree." Is that anything like a "bachelor's degree" or a "bachelor of science" degree or just more BS? As for your actual point, I doubt whether you or anyone else knows how much money immigrants make or how many of them receive money from the government. I do note that most so-called welfare programs are not available to people not here legally.Here's something to chew on: If you find yourself in a nursing home someday, there is a good chance the person wiping your sorry butt will be an immigrant.</comment>

<comment>Since you seem to be such a stickler on spelling and grammar, let us go see your record:smslaw: "We just need to build a yuge wall around Illinois."You seem to have an awfully "yuge" ego for someone that can't spell huge.  I'll let that slide because I was amused by Joe Pesci saying "the two yoots".smslaw: "But due process simply means that there is some sort of hearing other process"Hearing other process?  All I'm hearing is hypocrisy. Having fun yet?  See why being a jerk about spelling and grammar is unproductive?smslaw: "Typically, We got a few minutes"Typically, we only capitalize the first word of a sentence, proper nouns and adjectives derived from them, and titles before a person's name.  OK, I'm bored now.  We've illustrated enough of you mistakes.  I'm approaching 13,000 comments and don't pick on people for spelling unless provoked.  What's your excuse?https://disqus.com/home/discus...https://disqus.com/home/discus...https://disqus.com/home/discus...Also, I've been to the nursing home visiting grandma.  The nurses and aides are all mostly black and don't have accents.</comment>

<comment>I was provoked by your vile comments suggesting that somehow the people of Flint are responsible for their plight. "Decaying people?"</comment>

<comment>They're certainly more responsible for it than I am, having never had any dealings with the city or any of the people in it.</comment>

<comment>Wow, bigot much? Population replacement with third-world people has absolutely nothing to do with first-world cities turning into third-world cities. Racism is never correct despite what "statistics" or "observing behavior" might suggest.</comment>

<comment>How the First World fades to Third World  - refusing to pay for infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>We need to check our First World privileges.</comment>

<comment>But building infrastructure would require having taxes.  And that would destroy the economy Don't you understand economics?</comment>

<comment>It would require spending some of its tax money on infrastructure...Flint collected billions in taxes but chose to return most of it to its Union masters instead of the residents.</comment>

<comment>what the hell does this have to do with unions you doltthe emergency manager decided to poison the city rather than pay a little more for good water</comment>

<comment>The only reason the "good water" was too expensive for Flint is because the other emergency manager, the one in Detroit, decided to price gouge to help his own budget.  Dueling emergency managers both pretending municipal government should be run like a business.  This is what you get.  This is Snyder's vision.  He owns everything about it.</comment>

<comment>Yupof course the Feds will probably end up cleaning up their mess.Someone needs to go to jail for this.  they knew exactly what they were doing.</comment>

<comment>Even if you assume they thought the Flint River was a viable temporary solution, they knew almost immediately thereafter that it was a huge mistake.  It is unconscionable that they allowed it to continue.</comment>

<comment>Flint has an emergency manager because it ran its own affairs into the ground! The fact that they need to pipe in water from 150 miles away, when they live on a river speaks volumes... 50 years of criminal leadership put them in this spot!</comment>

<comment>Boston pipes its water from almost that far. Ditto for many other cities.</comment>

<comment>Water is definitely going to be more of a problem in the future than it is now, especially if we can't get our management priorities right.</comment>

<comment>Heh.</comment>

<comment>Flint doesn't have the money to pay for new infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>Heads should (proverbially) roll for what's happening in Flint. Anywhere else, there would be resignations left and right. But this is Flint, and this is Michigan, and no one in Michigan outside of Flint cares about Flint, so the officials ultimately responsible are likely not at risk of losing many votes.</comment>

<comment>The ones responsible are long gone...</comment>

<comment>this is what happens when you put emergency managers who don't have anything to do with a city in charge of said city</comment>

<comment>I'd ask you how responsible the previous city officials were if their decisions resulted in a financial emergency.</comment>

<comment>At least they didn't poison the whole city!</comment>

<comment>Actually this is an interesting thread because this is home of Fords auto industry, where the automated assembly line was created. That basis and foundation of industry which, well, polluted America in its rapid growth and singular focus. We also had the mafia up here. They ran heroin through the teamster's trucking in return for labor union protection. The mob also ran a few toxic waste dumps - still around. So all in all, it is just how we are, just our history. Now - there was a time where different values and priorities were held and the water and the air were clean and pure and that was the time of the Native Americans. Since then, well we kind of got our values a little messed up. Seventh generation lives not for oneself, not for the moment, but also for the seventh generation, for the children. Guess we forgot about them. Heck, we don't even know how to take care of ourselves.My point is, this is how we are, we just don't care and we are trashing our water and our land everywhere. While people may think they can get away with it, they are leaving a horrible legacy and eventually there will be no place healthy left to go to. Time to get back to old values. Leave it better than you found it.</comment>

<comment>When many of your big employers leave town, taking jobs and tax base away, that's what happens. Same thing happened when textile jobs went from NH to the South and from the South to Asia. It isn't always the fault of the locals.</comment>

<comment>Budgeting is always the responsibility of the people spending money.  If I lose my job does it stop being my fault that I can't make my car payment? Of course not, I still spent beyond my means.  It isn't my previous employers fault.</comment>

<comment>A 33 square mile city that doesn't have one grocery store.</comment>

<comment>They kept getting robbed and vandalized out of business.</comment>

<comment>I looked on Google maps and I see two Kroger, a Meijer, and a Super Walmart.</comment>

<comment>What about bringing in Cher as an emergency manager?</comment>

<comment>She probably can't do much worse. Snyder's emergency manager law is a literal disaster.</comment>

<comment>It is, Flint should be left to die, no Police, Fire etc... shut it down and put the city on COD!</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure Cher wouldn't poison people for fun, other than aurally.</comment>

<comment>I've never heard of legionnaire's in drinking water.  It's often in HVAC systems and worse in debilitated people.   So I'd guess it's not the river, but poverty plus aging, neglected air handling systems.</comment>

<comment>And yet another example of a Republican governor defecating on his constituency.</comment>

<comment>They've been defecating in their own bed for decades......Snyder is an idiot for offering them any help!</comment>

<comment>Help?  Who is he helping them?  by knowingly poisoning their water supply to save a few bucks</comment>

<comment>At best it's a mercy killing given the sad state of the people that live in Flint.</comment>

<comment>They're not his constituency. You can tell by the colour of their skin.</comment>

<comment>Legionnaires disease...what's next Scurvy? Cholera? There a Sudanese cities with better infrastructure!  We need to relocate the entire city and bulldoze it!</comment>

<comment>You beat me to it. I was gonna play the "cholera" card ...</comment>

<comment>Errrr, scurvy is on the rise in Britain, cholera already lives in benthic systems all over the planet, all it needs is warmer water to become poisonous to humans. Zika is on the move north and has been confirmed in Houston. Mosquitoes that can carry malaria are spread across about 2/3rds of the US already, the carriers of yellow and dengue fever are also either here or coming here.No matter how many walls we build at the border, we're not going to keep disease out. Too bad we don't have a robust single payer system to mitigate this easily predictable result of climate change.</comment>

<comment>Well we're down to literally murdering your peopleThis emergency manager program needs to die.  Everyone knew it was a terrible idea when it was passed and now we can see why</comment>

<comment>Well, we did vote it down in referendum.  But the killer nerd just got v2.0 passed with an appropriation so it couldn't be voted on again.</comment>

<comment>How the state courts haven't stuck it down as blatantly undemocratic is insane.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, it is democratic as it was indeed democratically elected legislators and governor who created the law.  And that's not a valid reason to overturn a law.  The only remedy is to vote in better representatives.</comment>

<comment>#LeadContaminationInAChildCanCauseDeath#JailIndictandImprisonRickSnyder</comment>

<comment>In their drive to save a little money, they've poisoned several thousand kids with lead, which is proven to stunt development and limit intellectual potential and probably caused themselves significant financial issues down the line. Then again, this is the same crew that keeps turning down money to build a proper bridge to Windsor because of regulatory capture/"all taxes are bad". Penny wise, pound foolish...</comment>

<comment>Here in SW PA, the only people who get Legionnaire's are the unfortunate veterans who are forced to seek care at a VA hospital.</comment>

<comment>Shh, we're can't blame that on Republicans so we aren't going to talk about it.  Instead we'll pretend that the government is only ever irresponsible and inept when one party is in charge of it.</comment>

<comment>Third World America.  Welcome to the future.</comment>

<comment>That's racist!  Over 50% of Flint's population is of African descent.</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot who can't even play the race card effectively.</comment>

<comment>I just played it effectively, because I implied that your "Third World America" comment was because of the racial makeup of Flint instead of the actual problem which is decades of bad governance that continues to this very day.  That is precisely how the race card works, by ignoring the actual issue and instead making it about race.</comment>

<comment>Michael Moore has been retaining a lot of water lately.</comment>

<comment>It's a decaying city full of decaying people.  I'm honestly more surprised that the outbreak isn't cholera.</comment>

<comment>You're OK with calling children "decaying people"?   It's shameful.</comment>

<comment>Based on their test scores I think it is an accurate assessment.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  Let's see your test scores so we can decide whether you're worthy of a decent life.  Based on what I've seen of your comments, you're in big trouble.</comment>

<comment>My test scores were good enough to get me an Bachelors of Science  degree, which I think proves my capabilities beyond what most folks with business and liberal arts degrees had to prove.</comment>

<comment>Don't actually care.  You're an unimpressive human being if you think poor test scores make children less human.</comment>

<comment>I'm not the one saying that.  I called them "decaying people".</comment>

<comment>Yes.  "Decaying people" as in rotting corpses.  Not one bit dehumanizing.</comment>

<comment>No, "decaying people" as in "to fall into ruin"http://www.merriam-webster.com...</comment>

<comment>Children.  Jesus Christ.</comment>

<comment>Anything to blame the recipients rather then the actual perpetrators.</comment>

<comment>I find that heartbreaking.</comment>

<comment>I find it predictable.</comment>

<comment>Yes. I know. It still breaks my heart.</comment>

<comment>I was describing more than just children, hence the use of the unqualified term "people".  Do you really want to argue that people doesn't also describe children or do you use language as some rhetorical technique to make people appear as helpless victims?Child.  Noun.  Defined as " young person".Person.  Noun.  Defined as "a human being"People.  Noun.  Defined as "human beings, persons".All definitions from http://www.merriam-webster.com</comment>

<comment>Can it. Everyone on this thread is aware you're  a pos already. </comment>

<comment>No.  There is no recovery from that. None.</comment>

<comment>Believe as you will, but the truth doesn't care.</comment>

<comment>No, the actions of the people that placed children in that situation are shameful.  Since none of them are mine, since I don't work for a school, and since I don't live in Flint or in Michigan I can safely say it isn't my fault.  You should direct your judgement or derision or disappointment or whatever it is that you have on the people who are having children they can't support or educate properly, not on me.</comment>

<comment>Chicago wasn't installing lead pipes in the 1980s. The article cited said up to the 1980s, but I seriously doubt any new lead pipes were installed that recently, given how much more expensive lead was than the alternatives, primarily iron or plastic.</comment>
