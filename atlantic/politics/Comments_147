<comment>...now tell me the story about how Donald Trump's campaign "is over".I NEVER get tired of hearing that one!***TRUMP 2016***...because "voting is the best revenge"</comment>

<comment>SMH.</comment>

<comment>you sad human being</comment>

<comment>Personally, I think you should have gone with "When you vote, you are exercising political authority, you're using force. And force my friends is violence. The supreme authority from which all other authorities are derived." But I guess that would have been a little TOO on-the-nose, eh?</comment>

<comment>Serious question: is there anything that Trump could say about Muslims that would cause you to doubt him?</comment>

<comment>Should we believe everything politicians say?</comment>

<comment>No.  But what does that have to do with my question?</comment>

<comment>how about..".islam follows after the Truth.. and is at core a "religion" of peace"!?..</comment>

<comment>You are correct that Donald Trump's primary campaign is far from over.  His prospects in the general election are long dead (look at his battleground state poll numbers vs Democrats), which is why the RNC, Paul Ryan, and most other Republicans with a brain are in a panic.  For the less intellectually gifted among conservatives, Trump's star has never shown brighter.</comment>

<comment>It was a small "r" republican that popularized, "Ya can't fix stupid".</comment>

<comment>People who want Trump to win are actually too stupid to remember to show up to vote. Wait for it.</comment>

<comment>My brother works with dudes who almost universally adore candidate Trump. They also don't vote because they think the system is rigged and thus voting is pointless. Kind of like electoral Darwinism, really.</comment>

<comment>"too", not "to"......and you are calling other people stupid?</comment>

<comment>It is every democrats dream that Trump is the republican nominee.</comment>

<comment>Oooh! Republicans just "lost" the vote of 2.1% of the population. (Well, not really. They actually lost the vote of the Muslims who are old enough to vote.) But wait! I thought, according to the media, that Muslims are NOT a monolithic block? Yes? No?No one cares about the "white" or "black" working-class vote, so, why should they care about the Muslim vote?Is there a Christian vote? One might think so, going by the media bias against Christians for at least the last 50 years. The so-called "Christian 'right'", as if there are no "liberals" who are Christians.It's funny, isn't it? I mean, how can the media think that all Christians are "conservatives"? Do not liberals believe in treating others as one wants to be treated? Do they not believe in the dignity (and rights) of the individual? Do they not believe in the acceptance and inclusion of everybody, regardless of "race", creed, etc., etc,?Guess what? The above basically originated with Christ's teachings. Doubt me? Study the past. Do you think the ancient pre-Christian Greeks and Romans cared one iota about the "rights" and dignity of individuals? That is, individuals who were not of the ruling classes, and, in the case of the Romans, the ruling "Patrician" class?It is an ironic phenomena that many modern humanists and so-called "liberals" today do not understand that many of their values originated with Jesus Christ and his teachings. (Granted, some of the teachings also of Confucius and others.)</comment>

<comment>Your premise is faulty, for most liberals in america know full well they are the ones who are advocating for the poor, the needy, the ones Jesus called "least of my brothers".   They also realize that most organized religions today are more about the perpetuation of the sect, putting it before they are doing the work of Jesus. Most liberals are also keenly aware that some sects have been hijacked by slick haired con men in $5000 suits who twisted the words of the bible to fit a bigoted world view.</comment>

<comment>I think many of them are advocating for the poor, and just as many of them pretend they are advocating for the poor and dispossessed.But remember that Christ IS not a politician, and Christianity is not a political party, nor is it a political ideology.</comment>

<comment>i did not imply either</comment>

<comment>Didn't mean to suggest that you did imply either. I was simply being emphatic. :)</comment>

<comment>"Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing", as Christ, according to the Gospels, said.Nothing new there!</comment>

<comment>Sorry, can't be a "progressive" and a "Christian" at the same time. That is unless of course you're a "pro-life progressive" and don't support the redefinition of the sanctity of Holy matrimony, which I've never personally encountered, but hey maybe you're the first one.Also, "advocating for the poor, the needy, and the ones Jesus called the least of my brothers" for reasons of political expediency and attempting to secure votes in the same manner that liberals have nefariously secured their base, the black vote, won't necessarily reserve you a spot in Heaven, if you believe in that sort of thing. Jesus helped the poor and indigent out of pure love and genuine kindness, not because he was politically-motivated like every liberal in the last several decades has become.  But that's fine, the Democrats can have the Islamist vote, they're obviously not picky, they'll eagerly take whatever they can get come Election Day. And maybe the Muslims are even ok with the concept of voting more than once per individual too. </comment>

<comment>Yeah, what you said</comment>

<comment>Haha!</comment>

<comment>Well, it made sense!</comment>

<comment>LOL!!Right on.......well it certainly does to me too! :-)</comment>

<comment>Sure, if you're mainlining Fox entertainment channel all day.</comment>

<comment>FOX News? Hmmm, where do you receive your "news" from now that the "Jon Stewart Prog-Tard Variety Hour" has since evaporated?? Has Comedy Central replaced it with another source in which you're able to yet again retrieve daily injection(s) of obtuse lefty cynicism and one-sided current-events from as of yet??</comment>

<comment>I don't watch TV, wouldn't dream of it.  I know how much the right loves their hate radio and Fox entertainment fixes where they get their orders on who to hate that day and the exact language to use.  Must be nice not having to think lol.</comment>

<comment>Well see, there ya go, we actually have something in common. I don't watch [much]TV either. Nope, iTunes and the interwebs are my outlets.However, the notion of "reality" has bizarrely morphed into "hate", for some. In fact, rather than be faced and logically deal with it, "reality" for some has caused them to seek out "safe-spaces"......You do know that "progressivism" is the culprit for this national spate of butthurtism and further absurdities, yes, no, maybe??</comment>

<comment>Like the "War on Christmas"?</comment>

<comment>So true. When a "news" channel tells you how to think, it's no longer news.</comment>

<comment>"Sorry, can't be a "progressive" and a "Christian" at the same time."Unless, of course, you're the Pope.</comment>

<comment>I think "claims to be Christian" is what we often times run into.But see I can "claim" whatever I choose, but that doesn't necessarily make it true.But I feel fairly safe to assume that God is and will continue to be the better judge. </comment>

<comment>"But see I can "claim" whatever I choose, but that doesn't necessarily make it true."That is quite obvious.</comment>

<comment>I agree.Let's look to Barack Obama for such an obvious example, shall we. </comment>

<comment>Was I too subtle?</comment>

<comment>Nah, I think you were right on point. :)))</comment>

<comment>Vote dhimmicrat!!! Bwaaaahahaha</comment>

<comment>VOTE PROG-TARD, YHM!!!Haha, 'sup, my brotha! </comment>

<comment>Lol......Ridin' the storm out my patriot friend. Hope all is well?!</comment>

<comment>Oh man doin' the exact same thing! And other than forcibly witnessing the sheer lunacy of the moment-by-moment left-wing-revolutionaryism on full display these days I'm doing exceptionally well, considering.And I do hope the likewise is true as well, home-boyeeeee!! :-)</comment>

<comment>It's becoming unhinged. I could write a novella about the shifting paradigm that's emerging within this nation today. I'm not close to picking a horse for 16, but I absolutely love the deep angst the Donald is causing amongst the prog filth. They can't fathom, let alone stomach the cold, hard truths he is putting out there. Every time I wince it turns into laughs because he doubles down like the dhimmicrats do and it jacks them up big time.</comment>

<comment>I am enjoying the ride.  He's not my cup o' tea, stylistically, but he sends both the left and Establishment GOP into spasmodic convulsions of St. Vitus' Dance so hard I have to laugh.</comment>

<comment>You are so right man, SOOO right!But you know how it is these days brother.....truth for many equals "hurtful rhetoric", which in some circles is cause for a 911 call. Lol.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry. Your trigger words have made me seek my safe space....lol</comment>

<comment>I think my OWN words make me seek a safe space....... :-[)</comment>

<comment>Now I know why I like you! @,@</comment>

<comment>LOL! Dittos on dat, my friend! :)))</comment>

<comment>Actually, one idiot does not bother me. Seeing a significant portion of the American population being led around mindlessly by idiot bigoted bluster, that does bother me. I thought ya'll were better than that, but no: we have the makings of a real nativist, Know-Nothing fascism here. Ignorant, and proud of it.  It'll bother anybody with ideals.</comment>

<comment>derp, lol.</comment>

<comment>Nice post but you should probably google the Democratic base before you make a stupid comment like the base is black Americans.Not every African American votes democrat. That should be very apparent by the fact that a black guy is running for the republican nomination. By making such an uniformed comment you are ensuring that those who may open to a conservative message just ignore it because they feel that conservatism is against them on a racial level.I would like to win this election. What that requires, based on the last two elections, is to strip off some of those voters from the democrats. It is a really close thing. I suggest you remember that right now.</comment>

<comment>Wow. Ok so I'm firmly aware that not ALL black people vote Democrat, in fact, the gentleman I'm conversing with above is a black man who doesn't vote Democrat. And I believe it's safe to assume there are others as well, although few and far between.Hey look man, the fact that the Democrats have a base, the fact that a demographic of 13% of the populous is "black", and the fact that out of 13% of black voters the predominately VAST majority of them vote Democrat, it's merely a matter numbers.......these voters are indeed a Democratic base, and have been for decades and decades. And they will continue to maintain their Democratic plantation status-quo as metaphorical "slaves" until they decide they're tired of being taken advantage of, treated like pawns, and perpetually held down by Democrat-offered entitlement packages in exchange for their votes.So go scold someone else, sir, cause you're obviously mistaking a realist and politically-incorrect-extremist for a racist. </comment>

<comment>I apologize - I thought you were making the claim that the democratic base was black people, when in fact the base is still white. Of course you are right that that African Americans vote for democrats far more than republicans - but if we can reduce that I would like to. Our message is better.Im just being defensive because I'm afraid that the party may take a big hit in the general election based on some of the talk going around. We will not get the presidency if we turn off every group that's not white of Christian. </comment>

<comment>All good, sir. No need to apologize, but thank you and surely accepted just the same. I too am passionate and want to win this election......we appear to be on the same, and RIGHT side of things. :-)</comment>

<comment>Listen to the lecturing Christianist claiming to speak for Jesus, lol he was always crystal clear about self appointed, deluded charlatans like you.It can't be that people vote the way they do because they simply prefer fact based public policy solutions and Presidents who don't spout bigotry and ignorance.No, it has to be because of your arrogant, deluded  explanations that show how much you live in denial - desperate fantasies about voter fraud and the rest of the ridiculous storyline you people tell yourselves rather than face facts.If Obama won by five million votes in three hours flat in 2012 due solely to "give aways" to African Americans (such disgusting bigotry), then why are Asian American overwhelmingly Democratic voters? Jewish American? Women? Your falling back on the tired racist cant spouted in the right wing media about black Americans speaks volumes.Your self-serving, totally politicized right wing blather is about as far from the work of Jesus as it gets. You do not speak for Christians in any sense of the word. </comment>

<comment>Where did I ever claim a religious affiliation???Kinda blows your whole theory/hypothesis of me out of the water, huh. Hahaha, but fantastic tirade though. ***APPLAUSE***Maybe take a Valium, human faces probably shouldn't turn that shade of purple. </comment>

<comment>When you're lecturing people what they can and can't be according to you and be a Christian, it's safe to assume you under some delusion that you're qualified to do so. You aren't.Good to know that you realize you speak for no one (and can't be bothered to respond to anything I said - but please don't, I do not care a whit what you "think" about anything).</comment>

<comment>"......it's safe to assume you under some delusion that you're qualified to do so. You aren't."Well, let's see, you don't know WHAT my qualifications may or may not be, now do you, Jill. [rhetorical, of course you don't]But be that as it may that's not really even the point anyway, because opinions tend to be "subjective", and whether you like it or not and contrary to such obligatory wishful-thinking, it's actually ok if you're not the only person in the world who has them, know what I'm sayin', dear?Although my opinions generally tend to be "objective" too, but I digress.  </comment>

<comment>my memory of the bible ain't so great. But I'm pretty sure 'am I my brothers keeper' is what Cain says to God after killing Abel. And the answer is that yes. You are your brothers keeper.</comment>

<comment>I always get a kick out of this conversation, as it happens rather frequently.But yes, biblically-speaking regarding brothers Cain&Abel you are correct.But the reference in which I've chosen to be my Disqus username isn't biblically-related.It simply means that I'm only responsible for myself, my own decisions and actions, and those whom I choose to be responsible for other than myself.I've noticed an awful lot of personal non-accountability and self-responsibility over the last decade or so, and so this is what it's in relation to.You wanna willfully make and continue to make bad decisions, look elsewhere for sympathy, cuz I ain't the one. </comment>

<comment>"isn't biblically related"It's a quote from the Bible.  Do you have a hemispheric disconnect between the two halves of your brain? Look, logic breakdown for you:-A is quote from B-"is quote from" is a relation- A is related to BLet me know if you need help understanding this. Or, you know, bluster ignorantly and with pride, like your hero.</comment>

<comment>YOU are relating my username of choice to the bible, something, something about Cain and Abel, and yada, yada, yada. And that's fine. But from my perspective the references aren't related.One, some guy evidently kills his brother, the other concerns my personal belief about personal accountability and responsibility, and how it's up to me rather than a government faction as to who's actions I choose to be held accountable for, other than myself.It's a "redistributive" thang......Your misinterpretations are in no way my responsibility either. </comment>

<comment>The Humpty-Dumpty approach to communication, always followed by blaming others for misunderstanding. Classic, carry on.</comment>

<comment>If there's an issue with communication then it must be on your end. If you didn't understand my position then it's not my duty to accept responsibility for that. Maybe some further higher-education is in order, but I digress. </comment>

<comment>God forbid the government actually does something to help people</comment>

<comment>"Special welfare" is not the governments job, it's the churches. </comment>

<comment>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of ...</comment>

<comment>LOL! Yes, thank you for proving my point. "General welfare", not "special welfare", is what the government is constitutionally-responsible for providing The People.Providing "general welfare", consisting of the military to protect our sovereignty, which by the way is currently being done by way of the bare minimum these days, items such as emergency services, public educational services, etc, etc. "Special welfare", items such as cell phones, Internet, even EBT/food stamps is NOT the governments responsibility, nor does it have the legal authority to take taxpayer funds and redistribute them in any extraordinary way it sees fit, ESPECIALLY not to fund the many massive entitlement programs currently afoot. You need food and/or clothing, etc., go to a church and/or a privately-funded food-bank like those I donate time and money to......this is in no way the federal governments job/responsibility. Everything else up and above "general welfare" is an "entitlement". </comment>

<comment>i don't think Jesus appreciates you using His name to bash Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Why? I'm political, Jesus wasn't. </comment>

<comment>Liberals do not advocate for conservative poor.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't seem to make sense. How would efforts to help the poor fail to help the conservative poor? (Most of the poor conservatives I know are pretty happy about their Social Security, Medicaid, etc.)</comment>

<comment>If Christians were more like Christ, liberals probably wouldn't be in high demand among many groups in this country.Just something to think about. </comment>

<comment>agree with your assessment.  Gosh!  The Muslims are no better nor worse for that matter than any other ethnic or religious group in America.  When they come here they have a duty to assimilate and incorporate into their value systems the same value systems of American traditionalism and ethic. Why the wingnut liberal elite media is so bent on defending those who oppose this is beyond me.</comment>

<comment>It's beyond me too. And why the Millions of Hispanics who have invaded our country for the last 40+ years are allowed to get away with NOT assimilating is puzzling.But I know one reason they are allowed to do so is because of the false guilt that, "we 'stole' most of Mexico from them".</comment>

<comment>Hispanics have been in the country in large numbers since Texas was added to the country. They maintain a distinct sub culture in some ways but it's not true that they don't assimilate. New arrivals get jobs, and learn English after the second generation.</comment>

<comment>In point of fact, Hispanics have been in the country in large numbers since well before it was a country.</comment>

<comment>assimilation isn't a requirement and you can't force them to</comment>

<comment>They have a duty to assimilate? I'm not sure who wrote that rule but it is patently false. American culture is comprised of the influences from all the various waves of immigrants. On Monday, we has spaghetti at our house. Tuesday we had tacos with corn chips and guacamole. Tonight will be stuffed pepper soup. I don't think any of the founding fathers, or even Lincoln ate any of those foods.We will put up our tannenbaum this weekend and get our cards out. At the rugrat's birthday party, we even had a pinata. Again, something they didn't do 230 y/a.Did you know it took a Scot/Canadian to popularize the word "hello" in English?  Yup, Alexander Graham Bell.</comment>

<comment>Analysis of different demographic groups doesn't imply that those groups are entirely uniform in their behavior. Using the terms the religious right or the Christian right isn't saying all religious people or Christians are right-leaning, it's specifically referring to Christians who are right-leaning.Candidates and parties shouldn't necessarily care about catering to every demographic. But when voting outcomes show you or your party have alienated entire groups of people (Muslims, young adults, whatever grouping you can quantify) there's value in looking at why that happened.</comment>

<comment>Guess what? The above basically originated with Christ's teachings.Absolutely!  Unfortunately Christ's teachings and Christianity's teachings have diverged.</comment>

<comment>Actually, pre-christian ancients were more concerned about the individual than post-christian kingdoms which were mostly monarchies.  The dark ages were post christian.  The worst forms of slavery were post christian. For nearly a thousand years muslim countries were more egalitarian than christian ones.None of that means anything today, but for you to believe christianity holds some kind of monopoly to decency is ignorant.</comment>

<comment>Are you claiming that there isn't a Christian vote?</comment>

<comment>Recent Muslim immigrants, most of whom are on welfare, would be unlikely to vote Republican, which is, of course, why the Democrats want to bring in large numbers of them.</comment>

<comment>Bless your heart Zach, we would love to see some proof of your assertion, but most likely this is just your gut talking, not the result of legitimate research.   most recent muslim immigrants are here on H-1B visas, professionals with desired skill sets and not on welfare.  </comment>

<comment>... yes, corporate fat cats are bringing immigrants on H-1B visas to undercut American wages and replace American workers - an economic issue ...</comment>

<comment>And work visas aren't corporate welfare?</comment>

<comment>You clearly have no understanding of USCIS visas.</comment>

<comment>Apparently you don't. The H1 visa program has caused many Americans to be fired so cheaper imported talent could do the job.</comment>

<comment>Look up how much companies that sponsor the H1 applicants have to pay on an annual basis for the "imported talent". It's not the cheaper alternative.</comment>

<comment>No, not really....The cheap labor your talking about is not of the desired skill set...The are indentured servants who will not switch jobs for better wages and take less from the out...Get a clue...Plenty of stats to back that up but you have to want to really KNOW.</comment>

<comment>Recent Muslim immigrants probably disproportionately work in the tech sector, make six figures and have a STEM degree. But of course, white trash convenience store workers assume all non-white people are welfare-seeking freeloaders.</comment>

<comment>"most of whom are on welfare..."Cite?</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure it's the only reason ordinary liberals like Muslims.  I think ordinary liberals like Muslims because they'll side with anything that hates the U.S., regardless of how misogynistic, how nefarious, how sadistic, how murderous that anything is.However, I definitely think the Democratic Party leaders want to flood this country with Islamics for votes.</comment>

<comment>Think about this: if the Democratic Party were to launch an immigration scheme intended to bring them in new voters, who would their best options actually be?Their best bet would be Europeans, Australians,and Canadians, all of whom are overwhelmingly to the left of the Democrats on the political spectrum.Just a quick reality check for you.</comment>

<comment>True, but there's one little problem.  Up to recently, Europeans, Australians and Canadians were happy in their own little paradise and didn't want to come here.Now that their leaders are turning their own countries into Shariahland, things might change.UNLESS Obama has his way and turns this country into Jihadi Central.</comment>

<comment>I've seen this kind of claim before, but haven't had a chance to ask how this could even remotely seem plausible to anybody.  If this were pitched to you as a movie script, would you be like, yeah, the whole nation is so totally gonna suddenly replace all law with draconian, unConstitutional religious rules, that nobody wants, on everybody, and we'll just be stuck with it because of their clever dastardly tricks!  Totally plausible!I have GOT to know what makes this seem plausible to you.  What causal mechanism, exactly, do you envisage that makes a 77% Christian country slip on a banana peel and get all stuck in ShariaLand?</comment>

<comment>You said:  "I have GOT to know what makes this seem plausible to you.  What causal mechanism, exactly, do you envisage that makes a 77% Christian country slip on a banana peel and get all stuck in ShariaLand?"Let me ask you a question.  Did you ever visit London 20 years prior, and have you visited it recently?  London is a really excellent example of the transformation from a cosmopolitan, modern place, as it slowly is replaced by uneducated monsters who want to live according to the camel herding dictates of the year 610.  A visit every 10 years and some videos would make an excellent documentary of the sad pro-Shariah transformation that Muslims have waiting for the entire West.But you continue on in liberal dreamland.  It's so pleasant, liberal dreamland, isn't it?</comment>

<comment>No chance people from those countries want to move to the USA today. The whole country is full of xenophopes and gun-toting nuts.</comment>

<comment>It's only natural Progressives and Muslims would join forces, both hate These United States of America and the US Constitution. </comment>

<comment>No they don't.</comment>

<comment>To say that "progressives" hate their own country is a stretch.I'm politically "progressive" in many ways, and yet, I'm a staunch, rabid supporter of the Second Amendment and what that amendment really means:The right of INDIVIDUAL (law abiding) American citizens to keep and BEAR arms.</comment>

<comment>"The right of INDIVIDUAL (law abiding) American citizens to keep and BEAR arms."Very few disagree with you, but remember that the right preserved by the Second Amendment is subject to regulation and restriction.  As Scalia explained in Heller, "[l]ike most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited."  The majority opinion went on to make clear that "nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."</comment>

<comment>Libs dislike its past, they dislike its present, and they want to make darn sure they destroy everything that has made it great so that it has no future.</comment>

<comment>You don't seem to have much respect for religious liberty.</comment>

<comment>A hate group has the freedom to hate but we have a duty to call them a hate group, even if its a religion. Being a faith isn't an excuse to preach hate. Islam is full of calls to murder Jews. How can you support that?</comment>

<comment>I do call out those Muslim groups who do that. </comment>

<comment>That would be all of them since its a central part of Islam. </comment>

<comment>No it's not. They co existed with Jews until quite recently. I blame the rise of the ethnic nation-state dating back to World War I for starting the problem. It's true that some extremists have run with it and made it their own since then.</comment>

<comment>Tabari 7:97  The morning after the murder of Ashraf, the Prophet declared, "Kill any Jew who falls under your power."orSahih al-Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 52, Number 176:Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:Allah's Apostle said, "You (i.e. Muslims) will fight with the Jews till some of them will hide behind stones. The stones will (betray them) saying, 'O 'Abdullah (i.e. slave of Allah)! There is a Jew hiding behind me; so kill him.' "and there are many other passages like this. And you can't possibly think Jews are safe in Muslim nations.And then there are the calls to kill apostates, and Christians, and non-believers, and homosexuals. </comment>

<comment>This is just flat out wrong. The Quran is very clear in that Muslims cannot take up arms against those who are not being aggressors.</comment>

<comment>Deuteronomy 13:13-19 NLT</comment>

<comment>Yup, many passages like this. Jeremiah 51:20-26</comment>

<comment>"Being a faith isn't an excuse to preach hate."Please tell that to Kim Davis et al.</comment>

<comment>Who's Kim Davis?  And is she a jihadist who has "taken out" a lot of innocents?</comment>

<comment>Islam is full of calls to murder Jews.And the Jews carry guns as they take the Palestinians land. The Jews drop bombs on the Palestinians. They kill and imprison them. And if the Palestinians dare shoot back, the Israelis go all out death and destruction.Americans are almost as bad as the Israeli Jews. Except we drop bombs from drones. We destroy weddings and funerals. And if the Muslims retaliate; we call them murdering SOBs. How can you support that?I don't. From either side. Put into perspective, it is wrong to kill. Just stop claiming one side is all bad when your side does the same thing.</comment>

<comment>I never suggested Muslims couldn't practice their faith in the US, I simply stated they hate the US and the Constitution. Just like Progressives.</comment>

<comment>Did you jab yourself with your "made in China" American lapel flag pin again?</comment>

<comment>Yep that's why his nappy is all in a twist.</comment>

<comment>After the Progressives get their trade agreement passed, that will be the only kind of American flag lapel pin available.</comment>

<comment>After who gets their trade treaty passed? I know Obama s for it but it was one of the few of his policies that had GOP support. Most Dems are against it.</comment>

<comment>They do.</comment>

<comment>Enough of this PC, multicultural voting sh!t. Trump will fix this by denying Muslim Americans the right to vote.Trump '16 "Git, Er, Dun"</comment>

<comment>We just need to stop importing this hate group. We don't need to do anything like you are proposing. The KKK is another hate group we have had to deal with. We dealt with then by calling them what they are, a hate group. Islam is also a hate group. We just need politicians who are brave and honest to call Islam what it is.</comment>

<comment>If Islam is a hate group, then by consequence, Christianity is a hate group too.</comment>

<comment>Where does Jesus say we should murder Jews?This is just one example of many in Islam: Tabari 7:97  The morning after the murder of Ashraf, the Prophet declared, "Kill any Jew who falls under your power." </comment>

<comment>Homosexuality is punishable by death in the Bible, so the Bible just hates another group.</comment>

<comment>I see, and I can only think of one religion that takes that seriously and is actually, well killing homosexuals...You know who that is? Nah, didn't think so...Wake up.</comment>

<comment>I do know who that is. Christianity in Africa. Just because it doesn't happen here doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  All religions have their murderous extremists.</comment>

<comment>> You know who that is?Durr, other groups in poor regions of the world are killing people, so it's okay what religious extremists are doing here! You need to get your helmeted head out of your derriere and stop repeating the wingnut mantra of "it's worse somewhere else, nothing to see here!"> Nah, didn't think so.Straw manning your opponent just makes you look like a knee jerking moron. Maybe do a little more "think so" next time.Wingnut stumper of the day: if you don't follow the Bible so closely, are you being bad to God?</comment>

<comment>Not true. Have you actually read through the Quran to make these assertions?</comment>

<comment>What is the global Christian movement killing people by the thousands, raping, beheading, FGM, stoning rape victims to death, hanging homosexuals, has State sponsorship etc.. Where are the fellow Christian groups then supporting said things? The absurdity of people who try to compare said groups or any other to Islam is beyond the pale...</comment>

<comment>Who is comparing? There are bad seeds in the Muslim movement and there are bad seeds in the Christianity movement. The horrific actions of the bad seed Muslims vs the actions of the bad seed Christians are not the object of my comment. That said, it could be debated that the Iraq war and drone attacks are just as violent (and Christian nation approved) as any beheading the muslim world does.Radical Islam is a problem, as radical Christianity is a problem. If you think that ugly racism isn't a major problem of Christians, just because the KKK doesn't exist officially, then we have nothing more to discuss.</comment>

<comment>Is it true that swing voters are non-existent?  It seems to me like there's a decent number of socially liberal, fiscally conservative people who are skeptical of government's ability to get things done who could potentially vote either way.</comment>

<comment>"Is it true that swing voters are non-existent?"About a third of US voters have no party affiliation.  The statistics, however, vary greatly by state.</comment>

<comment>That would include me: "socially liberal, fiscally conservative". I think Hillary will be an excellent president and when she is thru America will be pretty much the same and so will it's trends: 500 people will still own 50% of the wealth >65%, 10% will own 80%>95% and everyone else will be scratching. Most companies that can will have moved offshore. Most low skilled people who haven't committed suicide will be on the dole. People will still get to vote and the oligarchs will still get to rule.So, the real question is: how angry are you? Are you angry enough to venture into the Terra Incognito of Donald Trump? Do we need a Hail Mary pass or more of the same? As Dirty Harry said, "Are you feeling lucky?"</comment>

<comment>I think it's the swing voters who stay home in disgust and leave the voting to the hardcore partisan voters. That's how you end up with people like Sam Brownback or Greg Abbott -- 30 percent voter turnouts.</comment>

<comment>It will be business as usual, and Bush was not in office because of the Muslims, he was elected because of the other 298 Million people in the country too.    And the only Muslims affected are the ones who don't live here anyway (ban: Immigration, not "Deport all Muslims".    However, Jimmy Carer (also Democrat) deported Iranian students when Iran took American Hostages.     Food for thought.This is just more media spin.  I'm new to reading the Atlantic, but I'm starting to feel like I'm tipping to the left when I read stuff like this.</comment>

<comment>"he was elected because of the other 298 Million people in the country too"Technically he was placed into office by 5 Supreme Court justices, but I know people like to gloss over that little bit.</comment>

<comment>Justices who were duly appointed and confirmed, glosser.</comment>

<comment>Lawful appointment and confirmation don't necessarily confer legitimacy.  Historically, the US Supreme Court passed Dred Scott (African-Americans are not citizens and can be enslaved) and Korematsu (Japanese internment).  The point isn't so much about Bush v. Gore, but that even under the law injustice can prevail (contra your assertion).</comment>

<comment>Because we dislike the decision does not invalidate the court. Many decisions are a stretch, but end up the law.</comment>

<comment>I would not suggest the court is invalid, at all.  The point, in relationship to mr. courageous (blah, did i just write that?) is that even the law can be, to quote Dickens' Bumble, "an ass."  Again, the cases I cite prove that very thing -- injustice can be codified.  You are right, we don't have to like it.  But we also don't have to stand for it either, and injustice can be legally rectified.</comment>

<comment>whoops, thought i gave a response earlier.  you are correct, and i don't dispute that.  however, it also makes sense to challenge that unjust ones, legally, as has been done in the past (such as the ones i mention).</comment>

<comment>Technically that is liberal BS .</comment>

<comment>No, it's history. Seems this link would be helpful to you in particular: http://www.dummies.com/how-to/...Money quotes: "The presidential election of 2000 had been decided, in essence, by the vote of one Supreme Court justice." And: "That split decision, 5-4, suggested that Bush v. Gore was a political, not a judicial, decision."</comment>

<comment>Are you really this stupid or do you just enjoy arguing with strangers and/or yourself?

<comment>When did the electoral college meet? Oh right, after the Supreme Court told the Florida delegation how to vote.</comment>

<comment>You are a silly person to cling so tightly to the myths that have been disproven many times over.</comment>

<comment>... still waiting for some sort of evidence to support yours (and others') blind and very stupid assertions ...</comment>

<comment>The evidence is that the Court stopped the counting of ballots and ordered the Florida Sec. of State to use what had been counted earlier.Your ignorance clearly demonstrates you hate America.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but that was only after the election in Florida was effectively tied.  The vote was so close that there was not an unambiguous winner based on the inexactness of the vote count standards.In our system, the effective tiebreaker in such a case is the Supreme Court.  It was not the outcome I would have preferred, but I think the overall process had quite a high level of legitimacy relative to other historical situations where two people staked a claim to an executive position.  It is a credit to the American system of governance that we had a peaceful transition of power (to a competing political party, no less) during a time of genuinely ambiguous voting results.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for a thoughtful answer instead of "hurr-durr thatz not wut happend yur a dumb librul!!"I agree, it's not the outcome I would have preferred, and it was (and will always remain) a messy and questionable end to things (and that's not even getting into the 8 years of disaster the justices unwittingly set into motion), yet I too am impressed that our system was capable of a peaceful transition through such a fraught moment.</comment>

<comment>Outside of the Iraq War, I don't think that Bush was that bad.  Probably in the slightly below average range.  People still underestimate just how awful the decision to invade Iraq was.  We'd have been better off taking $3 trillion and just lighting it on fire.  And the whole process to get us there was unconscionably awful.The response to Katrina was bad, but that was largely a product of the creation of DHS, another really bad idea, but one that would have been very hard to fight politically.  IIRC, the Bush administration was opposed to it at first, but the political need to be seen to be "doing something" was just too strong.9/11 and the economic collapse were not Bush's fault.  Bush's tax policies were bad, but again that is what a lot of voters wanted.  Legislating away the government's ability to negotiate with drug companies on prices was another terrible decision, but that was a bipartisan agreement.I'd probably give GWB a C+ for his time in office excluding the Iraq War, and a D overall when you include the Iraq War.  It's a shame that Bush stood by the hacks in his administration like Cheney and Wolfowitz and let them run out the talented people he had like Powell and O'Neill.</comment>

<comment>"Outside of the Iraq War" is an *enormous* mulligan considering that it essentially swallowed his presidency whole. Add to that, the right-wing policy establishment has seemingly learned nothing from that adventure, and is clamoring for more wars in the Middle East (their favorite answer to problems caused by previous applications of force and all of the unforeseen consequences thereof).Presumably there would have been a 9/11 under President Gore, but there are nonetheless a lot of what-if's surrounding the W administration's inattentiveness to matters of terrorism prior to then. As for the financial collapse, it's true that it cannot be blamed on W, but one also should remember that the administration's favored policies did their small part toward inflating the housing bubble, to say nothing of the whole 'self-regulation' farce that blew up so mightily in 2008.By and large, Bush's policies were failures, though it's hard to even remember most of that given the disaster he willingly embarked upon in the Middle East (one which is still unfolding today, and probably will for years to come).</comment>

<comment>I agree about going into Iraq being a disaster, hence my lowering his grade from C+ to D on that single basis.  I really don't blame Bush for being inattentive to terrorism at the time.  We all were as a nation.  And imo, we were actually better off for being some inattentive.  Now we waste money all over the place on security theater and military missions with (arguably) some short-term benefit but also a long-term cost that is ignored.I also think Bush did as well as possible managing Iraq from about 2005 - 2008.  He botched the early post-invasion period, particularly disbanding the Baathist Army.  That was a decision that we could never truly recover from.  The 2007 "surge" actually worked surprisingly well, even if it simply amounted to bribing the Sunnis to fight for us in the short term (and so was never part of a workable long-term solution).  But like I give Bush a pass for creating DHS and his initial round of tax cuts (because the American public wanted that), I likewise give Obama somewhat of a pass for mishandling the removal of troops from Iraq (because the American public wanted that too).  Still, Obama never understood the fluid situation on the ground in Iraq or elsewhere in the Middle East, and that has hurt his foreign policy.  Fortunately for us, though, those failures of Obama are much less bad than the decision to destabilize the entire region with a massive land war and subsequent occupation.</comment>

<comment>In light of the horrible candidates the GOP is running this time Mitt and even W (agreeing with the Iraq fiasco) are looking pretty good.</comment>

<comment>I wasn't aware the Judicial Branch (appointed by a sitting President) had any authority in that.    The president appoints justices, that in turn appoint a president?  Tsk Tsk.... it's the electoral college, always has been.   Come on now!</comment>

<comment>Are you people all seriously this dumb, or just so historically ignorant that you don't remember how the 2000 presidential election ended? For the love of jeebus: Bush v. Gore, look it up.</comment>

<comment>The way I remember it was that there was the inability to count the votes properly.   After a few recounts, what they should have done was taken a good look at the education in Florida instead of humoring a sore loser in the election.</comment>

<comment>Your memory is fuzzy. Recounts could have continued, but due to a varying amount of f*ck-ups at the county and state level, the result would have been dependent on whatever standard was chosen for how to count votes. Most of the contemporary analyses concluded Bush would have won, but most subsequent analyses conclude Gore would have won; the Supremes mooted that when they handed it to W.>what they should have done was taken a good look at the education in Florida instead of humoring a sore loser in the electionWTF does that even mean? Learn to literacy, dude. Regardless, in retrospect I wish Al Gore had been more of a sore loser, though I don't blame him for wanting to put it all behind him. The failures weren't educational, they were in the use of bad ballot designs and shady activity on the part of the Secretary of State relative to the voter rolls. And let's not forget Republicans' blatant use of intimidation to help sway the result: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>What are you even rambling about?     I recall the highlights on TV... Florida recounted, recounted, and recounted and one side just wasn't happy with it."Learn to literacy, dude. Regardless, in retrospect I wish Al Gore...."     aside from your previous jab about what seemed to pertain to the article, I was a little lost in the rant afterwards.  If you are referring to my remark  which had "education" and "ability to count" in the same statement, then I just can't explain it to you.</comment>

<comment>The author is  the 'phobe'  here  by promoting the idea that  one's beliefs and actions should be dictacted by   how someone else  might 'feel'  about something - and I emphasize  'might'.  It's very presumptious on Graham's part to project his viewpoint onto others.</comment>

<comment>He is an opportunist who wanted to become president and, as a salesman, finds anger and insecurity most easy to exploit, which may propel him to a prominent place in the general election. His past record says he is certainly not averse to supporting, at least publicly, registered democrats and his presence in this race will make this cycle considerably more difficult for the republican party should they want someone else to occupy the office.So as much as you may dislike the show, he's doing more for the democrats than any of their candidates have done on their own.</comment>

<comment>There is a continuing lack of foresight being exhibited by the GOP's national figures.  Whether it's the intransigence on AGW, hypocritical economic policy, ignoring infrastructure, or recognizing the ever-changing demographics of the electorate.  This brand of "present only" thinking - feeding the desires of the core constituents - will get these pols votes, but only at the expense of the party's long-term credibility/viability when it comes to producing leaders.</comment>

<comment>You should be proud of the GOP.  They go right along with Obama</comment>

<comment>That's senseless.  If anything, President Obama is overly concerned with long-term goals and has been adamantly wedded to incremental progress with his policies.  That overarching, "slow and steady wins the race" mentality is what has cost him so much support with many in our "I want it now" society.Step out of partisanship and look objectively at the Administration's progress on myriad issues it deemed important.</comment>

<comment>And what would it take to appeal to Muslims? Should Trump instead start throwing homosexuals off buildings, having mass beheadings, or stonings? Islam is a hate group. Why do you want to import this ideology and why would you want to appeal to it? </comment>

<comment>i''m a progressive independent, vote for the dems as the lesser of, but think that Trump's notion may have currency if these domestic attacks continue.  Contrary to what most commentators here and elsewhere say, the State Department could easily enforce such a temporary ban, and it would send a message for more cooperation in IDing these murderers.</comment>

<comment>Peter Spiro lays out a solid argument for the constitutionality of immigration bans, writing:"But under a line of rulings from the Supreme Court dating back more than a century, that’s irrelevant. As the court observed in its 1977 decision in Fiallo v. Bell, 'In the exercise of its broad power over immigration and naturalization, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.'"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12...That doesn't mean it's a good idea.  Stupidity borne out of fear is still stupidity - just sometimes easier to understand in hindsight..</comment>

<comment>Talk to me about this matter if the killing attacks by Muslims continues.</comment>

<comment>Continued attacks are likely...but even more likely if the conflict is seen as Western civilization vs Islam. Common sense seems to have disappeared lately.</comment>

<comment>you're dancing too quickly here, Dance.  Not sure what point you're making.  I think the conflict IS between Islam and the West?  What else would it be?</comment>

<comment>" it would send a message for more cooperation in IDing these murderers"How do you see this working?</comment>

<comment>The Muslims here will be pushed to start actively cooperating with information and preachment.  Did you have something else in mind if this were enacted?</comment>

<comment>Is the State Department going to enforce this ban against the Saudis and Emiratis at Georgetown and in Beverly Hills?</comment>

<comment>Again, the issue is about incoming Muslims.  Incoming, not the ones who are here already.</comment>

<comment>There isn't a single liberal democracy in the world that has survived having a large Muslim population. If you get enough people who support the Islamic ideology then you inevitably lose democracy and liberty. Islam is basically a hate group built on the teachings of a pedophile. So yes, its hard to see how they fit into US politics because they will eventually replace our liberal democracy with a caliphate.</comment>

<comment>INDONESIA DOES NOT EXIST!</comment>

<comment>Indonesia exists and its not a liberal democracy. Go to Indonesia and start publishing images of Mohammed and see what happens. Trying being a gay apostate in Indonesia.</comment>

<comment>Where have entire democracies died as a result of Muslims again? I don't think you have much of a sample set to extrapolate your theory from.</comment>

<comment>Iran. Shiites don't care about that.</comment>

<comment>You're missing an "i" there, my dude.</comment>

<comment>So Iran is a liberal democracy in which you can live safely as an apostate homosexual who draws images of Mohammed? </comment>

<comment>You added to your question. Draw Mohammed? Yes.Apostate? No. Gay? no.</comment>

<comment>Freedom of association is central to a liberal democracy. So being acceptance of apostates is critical. Islam doesn't have this. Nor does it have separation of religion and state. </comment>

<comment>Modern liberal democracies are all secular. Before, when they were parochial, ya, they were pretty brutal. Burning Jews and heratics was pretty common.http://www.jewishvirtuallibrar...</comment>

<comment>Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, the list is long.  The best democracy in south Asia is India, majority Hindu.</comment>

<comment>Most of those weren't full fledged democracies. And all were already majority Muslim, which doesn't lend much support to your theory that upon reaching a Muslim critical mass, democracy fell apart.</comment>

<comment>Ah . . . . you need to follow the argument.  No they are not full fledged democracies--my point!!The rest of your paragraph makes no sense.  those countries and their lack of democracy is strong evidence of the Mulsim presence in the political sphere.  What else can I say?  You don't respond to what the argument is.</comment>

<comment>The original argument posited that as a population reaches a critical mass of Muslims, democracy fails. Evidence for this would require instances of democracies which started out without this critical mass, and then acquired it, and then lost democracy.</comment>

<comment>Ah, I was only referring to my own argument here.  I hope you don't breathe fire on me for the disparity, Drag.  Lol.</comment>

<comment>Yes, alternet for instance is quick to ban views they don't like on their commentaries.  Not so Atlantic, although they do get tendentious at times.</comment>

<comment>Most of the progressive sites won't allow free exchange of ideas. They won't accept decent. So I can see how they would support Islam since it doesn't tolerate desent either.</comment>

<comment>Hilarious to see the pedant fail twice at spelling a basic word from the English language.</comment>

<comment>Interesting observation. I don't think most of my fellow progressive realize how backward most Muslims are in the areas that matter--political and human rights.  Then of course their fundamentalism as regards the Koran is far more literalistic than anything in the Evangelical wing of Protestantism or the absolutist bureaucracy of Holy Mother Church (Rome).</comment>

<comment>Islam is also about 700 years younger than Christianity. Both Judaism and Chritianity were still pretty barbaric, violent and intolerant of other faiths at that stage in their development. There maturation is being forced plus disrupted and interfered with by Western imperialism and then the imbalancing influx of sudden wealth from oil. Their cultures  were well ahead of ours in the sciences etc at one point and then Western culture had the Enlightenment.</comment>

<comment>Muslims do go on about their early enlightenment, forgetting to admit that most of their knowledge came from the pagan Greeks, Byzantium, pre-Islamic Persia, India (for math especially).  True they codified a lot of stuff and sold our present numbering system to the Europeans as "Arabic numerals," when in fact it was invented in India.I don't quite get your point about Islam not being very old as a religion, nor Christianity.  Wanna try that one again?</comment>

<comment>No, read my other comment below. And I wrote that before reading your response. Ideological comments with no facts or logical hypothesis to back up the ideology can't be discussed. I will change my opinion, if you make sense or your logical conclusions make sense. "Trump 2016" comments is just propaganda. They bring nothing to the table. I want to understand people who would vote for Trump. "Trump 2016" gives me no insight.Anyways, I'm off. Hope everyone takes a second to put themselves in other people's shoes, sometimes. The world would be much better if empathy was more widespread.</comment>

<comment>Unreciprocated empathy gets your country invaded and people destroyed. Please look up the biological concept "reciprocal altruism".</comment>

<comment>Who says empathy needs to be beneficial to myself or others?I can put myself in other people's shoes and understand when I am a threat to their wellbeing, or even just a threat to their ego. If my destruction is in someone else's benefit, I want to understand why? Ideology, like white supremacy, I can understand, but don't try to pass it off as blacks are lazy and all that BS stuff.</comment>

<comment>I think most people who are labeled white supremacists aren't actually so. Similarly I don't think Malcolm X was actually a black supremacist. I just think people should be allowed to form their own places and generally shouldn't be forced by their politicians to accept immigration, especially when it makes them a minority (whites) and an even smaller minority (American blacks) in their own countries. I think globalization is a force that is destroying cultures and it must be stopped or modified.</comment>

<comment>IMHO, it's not a culture issue, but a power shift issue. Immigration gives opportunity for people who are not of our culture to share or overtake the people who are currently in power, which makes for a stronger human race.This situation forces the culture in power (whites, in this case) to adapt or be overtaken. Which is an easier transition to the eventual evolution that will happen, compared to isolationism, which breeds extinction, since other cultures will have meshed to evolve into better cultures, who will dominate the isolationists.Don't see it as destruction of cultures, but mutations of cultures.</comment>

Like on too many comment boards I have read, lately.

<comment>There used to be some good discourse and lots of folks with interesting, quirky perspectives, with long discussions where each side was taken seriously.That was back when the current trolls were still too stupid to have figured out how technology works.  But after a few years, they eventually found someone to show them how to use a comment board to post their inane attempts at thought.  And it's too cost effective to bother monitoring the boards, so their drivel remains.Eventually, somebody will find a way to monetize discussion forums that are moderated, and we'll have to pay to have intelligent conversation.

<comment>You have to come back after working hours. The right wingers like me actually have normal jobs unlike sweetjazz and the other paid commenters on here.</comment>

<comment>Not to sound escapist, but I find the best articles in sources that don't stress commentary, such as the NY Review of Books (less so the NY TImes Book Review), the London Review of Books, some of the more stodgy ones, like the new republic and Harpers.  The Nation can get tendentious, but it works for me.  Then there are the specialty ones, if you don't mind academic types.  I don't mind them.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should stick to the New York Times.</comment>

<comment>The white nativist tendencies of the GOP are a big turnoff to a lot of non-white voters, and not just Muslims.  Asian-Americans and Hispanics -- family oriented, conservative values, many with anti-communist legacies -- and yet voted in such huge percentages for Obama.  Karl Rove complained that Asians must not be capable of clear thinking politically -- this despite Asians being, generally speaking, a highly educated, well renumerated group.Not a sound strategy going forward as minority majority states emerge.</comment>

<comment>dig your online name, Fools, but I think if these attacks continue people here will start listening to Trump's notions, especially as a lever to get more Muslim cooperation against terror.  The stats on what US Muslims think is also not so squeaky clean as most liberals would like.  Most want Sharia law and so on.</comment>

<comment>I really really feel that's the path to less cooperation. That's certainly how I would react to being isolated and reviled. A lot but not all Muslims think they should be allowed to use Sharia law in civil matters - such as marriage and divorce.</comment>

<comment>I disagree.  I think we need to start leaning on them a bit.  also instead of glamorizing them, we need to start dissing their motives, their medievalism, their ignorance, and their murderous orientations.  This is obvious.  Let's also start critiquing in a serious way their fundamentalist religious notions--so far untouched by the US media.</comment>

<comment>A Muslim is not a race. Its a follower of Islam which is an ideology. You can't be racist against an idea. </comment>

<comment>But that doesn't stop one from being a pedantic a-hole.</comment>

<comment>Hitler proved that, yes, indeed, one *can* be racist against a religion. Seriously: it's possible in the real world, even if not in theory.</comment>

<comment>Racist, xenophobe, nativist, bigot etc....All you really have to contribute, like most of the lemmings...You want to celebrate a party, aka the Dems who count votes by skin color and groups, fine...That is the American Left...</comment>

<comment>The GOP loves counting votes by skin color. That's why you're trying to take away Hispanic' voting power in Texas with Evenwel v. Abbott, and with the new voter ID laws that only seem to effect minority communities.</comment>

<comment>Sorry big guy, that is both political parties...Nothing more pathetic than watching an old, rich white guy pretend to like hip-hop but there you go, must be a Democrat...Plus, only one party pits people against each other based on race, gender, class etc....Can you say DEMOCRAT....Carpetbaggers all...</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't Carpetbaggers have been Republican?</comment>

<comment>Republican party, several candidates of color. Democrat party, old rich white people hmmmmmm</comment>

<comment>If Trump gets the nomination or goes 3rd party the GOP is going to have to use those well honed voter suppression tools on their own base.</comment>

<comment>'White nativist tendencies' are what is responsible for the freedoms you enjoy today.  Importing medieval theocratic  tendencies is foolish.The indoctrination runs deep in you, You need to take a time out and get honest with yourself.</comment>

<comment>Actually the Civil Rights Movement is responsible for the freedoms all Americans enjoy, including the 1964 Act and the 1965 INA that allowed more non-whites to become Americans.  1964 is the year we became a true representative democracy.That is not a white nativist movement.</comment>

<comment>If we're a "true representative democracy", then how come One Million- strong Rhode Island has the same number of senators as 37 Million-strong California?Because we're really a true constitutional republic (with democratic organs).</comment>

<comment>They are a turn off to a lot of white voters too.But they have a short team strategy based on appealing to people's fears and the worst parts of human nature.  And they benefit from the lack of ideas and directions from the Democratic Party.  I generally vote Democratic (if I don't vote third party) over Republican, but primarily because they are less worse.  Like many Americans, I'll change my vote if the other side gets better.  If the Democratic Party keeps focusing on a short-term strategy of "vote for us because the Republicans are crazy!" rather than a long-term strategy of "vote for us because we are coming up with new and innovative solutions to the problems we face", they should not be surprised if some voters like myself desert them if the Republicans ever get their heads out of their bums.</comment>

<comment>That's the exact GOP problem: the Republican Party faces a golden opportunity in taking on an uninspiring Democratic candidate with huge negatives, yet that opportunity is being squandered in a contest to see just how downmarket GOP politics can get.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, they should win the general election by about 5 points, but right now, they are at best tied and probably in serious danger of losing.  But -- the big caveat -- a lot will change between now and November 2016.</comment>

<comment>See I don't get this.  I see Democrats coming up with solutions to things over and over and again. Next up the party is going to be focusing on student loans, pre-K, climate change and maybe strengthening unions.  Probably none of it will get done because Republicans will block it, but I don't see how Democrats are supposed to fix that.</comment>

<comment>I agree that the present Democratic agenda is better than the alternative, but I don't think they are solving many of the problems you listed.  Access to pre-K seems like the closest to a solution.  Responding to climate change requires real choices between short-term sacrifices of wealth and standard of living for long-term benefits of less deleterious conditions around the world.  At best, Democrats have made a case for taking this problem seriously.  Again, that is better than the know nothing party, but they haven't really discussed a framework for how do we get to emissions reductions goals without sacrificing standard of living.  Mind you, that is a HARD problem, but we could at least begin by acknowledging it.As far as student loans, the policy of subsidizing college education through easy access to loans -- while one with noble intents and with some economic benefits -- is ultimately self-defeating because subsidies are almost always captured by industry rather than making their way to the consumer.  In the case of universities, they are reeling from spending binges brought on by the easy flow of money into their coffers under the benign attempt to increase access to college.  On this issue, I do not think Democrats have a solution, but rather are trying to find patchwork solutions to keep the system going as long as possible.  (Again, while I am not impressed by that, I do find that preferable to the alternative of just sitting back and letting the whole thing blow up.)Partly, we may just disagree on some of the issues and what we see as the best option going forward.  In the context of our dysfunctional political system, much of what the Democrats are currently proposing is preferable to what else is currently politically possible.  But the point is that it could be that the Republican Party finds a way to ditch their nativist path (that hopefully leads to oblivion) and begins to take seriously the idea of governing.  And if they do, I'll take their ideas seriously.I want a political system where I am looking at both parties for my vote because they are each trying to out innovate the other.  I am tired of deciding whether to vote for the less awful party, or whether I should just vote third party as a protest.  I want the parties to earn my vote.  I want them talking about the challenge of adapting our society to technology and the globalized economy, not speak in empty promises of creating jobs and protecting the American worker.  If enough of us demand a higher level of political discourse for our vote, the parties will have to respond to us.  We're just so very, very far away from that right now.</comment>

<comment>"they haven't really discussed a framework for how do we get to emissions reductions goals without sacrificing standard of living"I'm not sure I agree with this framing. I don't see a big reduction in standard of living as necessary. My state at least is already around 30% renewable energy and I'd be hard pressed to explain how that has hurt me personally. The other issue is that if you have one party that doesn't even accept the premise (human cause climate change), it doesn't really make sense to try to sell something as a painful but necessary action." I am tired of deciding whether to vote for the less awful party"This is kind of a glass-half full vs glass-half empty way of looking at it though.  I see one party that will probably offer me universal Pre-K and another that will offer me deportation of Muslims.  From a certain perspective, these are both "benefits" and attempts to earn my vote. Maybe they're not the exact ones I'm looking for, but I don't know, I try to be realistic, this is America, and with the parties so opposed there's not much chance what I want is going to be a priority.</comment>

<comment>I agree that in the current political environment, the Democratic strategy is reasonable.  The thing about climate change is that whatever policy is adopted will involve picking winners and losers (doing nothing also picks winners and losers).  I won't be that hurt by the energy transition (much of which is happening largely independently of climate change anyway), but many are being hurt by it.  Some of the pain is temporary, as the energy sector creates new jobs while eliminating others.  But there will be real pain born by a segment of the population that has been losing due to globalization, since they were previously in the envious position of having high paying jobs despite low skills and that is not realistic anymore in the globalized economy.  The fact that their previous high wages were ahistorical and their current lower wages and greater job uncertainty is more in line with what is typical for people with limited job skills that quickly becomes outdated as technology improves is likely not going to be comforting to them.  The practical impact for climate change is that a large swath of American voters has a strong incentive to reject the reality of climate change and believe in the side that promises them voodoo economics but which is willing to attack other groups as scapegoats for their problems.</comment>

<comment>Great points, and also, I always appreciate your thoughtful and interesting comments</comment>

<comment>Likewise, I enjoy reading your thoughtful posts.  It's good that we disagree or see things a bit differently every once in a while.  ;)</comment>

<comment>I thought about appending that- I really like when you're coming from a different angle than me.  That's how I learn!</comment>

<comment>Somehow, climate change managed to become a political mess.  Cap and trade worked very well to deal with the acid rain problem, yet right now, the left-wing is talking carbon taxes and  command and control, and the right-wing has had none of it for a decade.I trust pro-business economists to come up with efficient solutions for environmental problems; I trust politicians to ignore those solutions in favor of inefficient messes with handouts for special interest groups.</comment>
