<comment>whatta buncha fruitcake liberal nonsense</comment>

<comment>It's amazing what Obama has accomplished despite GOP policy of self-destructive obstructionism:-He got the troops out of Iraq (a Herculean task considering the resistance of hardliners); including drawdown in Afghanistan (though over 10,000 remain). These moves saved hundreds of billions of dollars (and countless lives). -The push for domestic oil production has upended the economies of adversaries across the world (namely Russia) - throwing a spanner in their unproductive foreign policies.- the US economy is growing again, unemployment at a decade low (uneven recovery, but recovery nonetheless)- Renewables have entered mainstream (with US companies at the forefront of R&D), as has the wide acceptance of climate change.Looking forward to the State Dinner for Trudeau in March (a first for a Canadian PM in over a decade); will get plenty of positive press coverage.</comment>

<comment>1. That was due to an agreement the Bush administration signed with Iraq before Obama took office. More troops have died in that barren wasteland of Afghanistan under Obama than Bush. Taliban is currently taking vast territory. It's a lost war.2. This runs completely contrary to his desire for renewable energy and his aura of being a president that cares about climate change. I'm glad he did this, however.3. The jobs being created are, for the lack of a better word, crap. But I don't blame the president for this.http://robertreich.org/post/13...4. How on earth does a president sway the free market? If renewables are good business, then they will grow on their own. The president does not have a lever on his desk that he pushes or pulls to create better products. You're giving adulation where none is due.You forget his intervention of choice in Libya that has given ISIS another base to rise from. Runs counter to his position as a president that doesn't start wars.</comment>

<comment>Libya > Syria in terms of turnout, look at the death tolls.5,000 compared to at least 250,000.The state can, should and has swayed the free market before, that is nothing new. A lever? No, that's infantile. Create and support policies that support there industries? Yes and very easy to do.</comment>

<comment>I agree that policies can change the free market, that's beyond debate.I was saying that, for instance, if renewables are a bad product - like lead painted children's toys - it doesn't matter what the government does to support its growth. The consumers will not purchase lead painted children's toys and companies will not be researching better lead painted children's toys because they are bad. Since renewables are inherently good - some may disagree here, I'm generalizing - companies and consumers will research, enhance, and purchase them.I don't look at warfare through the lens of body counts. I prefer strategic value. There was no strategic value in deposing a secular dictator in Libya who had willingly surrendered his stockpile of WMDs and then leave without an exit strategy.</comment>

<comment>Eh... I don't really agree with that. Look at how much sugary food people eat and sugar filled soda. It's not like people don't know that's bad for them, but they eat and drink that stuff up like it's going out of style.Which isn't to say you're 100% wrong. You're just not 100% right. The free market is not filled with rational actors. This is demonstrably true. As such, the conclusions you're drawing are on somewhat shaky foundations.</comment>

<comment>His military convoy was literally within miles of killing thousands of unarmed insurrectionists in the East.Only certain kinds of American leaders can ignore an impending massacre.  Our President stepped up and helped organize a European response that saved many people from extermination.How dare you turn it into a "Benghazi theater for Republican advantage."You twisted the truth so many times your own recent history has become the victim..</comment>

<comment>With the sheer amount of propaganda, half truths, and out right lies we don't know that for sure. And were they 'unarmed'? Place like that, no one is unarmed.</comment>

<comment>The OP partisan hack has the chutzpah to credit obama for an "Afghanistan drawdown" when Obama campaigned on the platform of DOUBLING the US presence in Afghanistan - and he kept that promise.</comment>

<comment>On point 4,, the government primed the market for renewable energy by inesting in R&D and tax incentives and at the state level requirements on utilities to include renewables. Its not at all a free market thing. Its a nudged market thing.</comment>

<comment>Our President brought the country out of the Cheney Bush oilmen's pit of war, debt, and economic collapse to this- the 21st century energy.  (It still makes them mad)[quote]-Capacity additions in the United States slowed last year, but renewable generation made up more than half of the 14,468 MW completed in 2015, according to an analysis by SNL Energy.-Wind accounted for 47% of new generation capacity, followed by natural gas (35%) and solar (14%).-Last year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted that capacity additions would begin to slow, and from 2018 to 2024 the agency believes additions will average less than 4 GW annually."[end quote]http://www.utilitydive.com/new...</comment>

<comment>Statistical hog wash.  Similar to the millions of jobs created by Obama, pure BS.  Oil prices are down because of a world wide economic slow down and overproduction in Saudi Arabia.  No one is investing in renewables unless it is heavily subsidized or mandated by government.</comment>

<comment>1.  He took credit for withdrawing troops from Iraq.  He boasted of it in his re-election campaign.  It didn't become a Bush agreement until after it went to hell and genocide was committed in Iraq by the "JV team".</comment>

<comment>1. In case you haven't heard ... we still have troops in Iraq. 2. All new oil exploration has been on private lands, the government has been very stingy with leases these past 7 years.3. Stagnant wage growth, more people in poverty ... yeah its really been a good time for the average American's finances.</comment>

<comment>It's been a frustrating presidency, but I must admit that the Obama for which I worked 2 elections and a primary pretty much delivered what I expected. Imagine the possibilities if there had been a responsible opposition. If anything, the big lie propagated by the GOP has been laid bare and it is now up to Americans to reject it or wallow in it.</comment>

<comment>Curious, what is "the big lie propagated by the GOP"?</comment>

<comment>He's a Muslim, Atheist, Communist, Nazi, Kenyan, American.</comment>

<comment>The GOP made that claim?  When?</comment>

<comment>...going on 8 years, Gingrich and Trump leading the chorus.President Obama inherited a Dubya economy in ruination with skyrocketing debt from unfunded wars and tax cuts for the rich, while Republicans called him names and blamed him for the housing crisis, the bailout, Katrina, mass shootings and the Iraq war.The principles displayed by the Republicans (and their apologists here) are those of a reptile- absent.</comment>

<comment>Gingrich represents the GOP?  Is he a party leader?</comment>

<comment>The recession was a result of bank failures caused by bad mortgage policy passed by Democrats as every noted economist has stated.</comment>

<comment>yeah, why limit it to one lie?  The GOP has told plenty</comment>

<comment>Where's the lie? (OK, he is not a Nazi, and his biological father was an American Pornographer.)</comment>

<comment>In my mind the big lie is that Obama and his socialism would bring an economic apocalypse down upon the country.The Republican morality play that if we didn't adhere to GOP principles, the country was doomed to failure; Obamacare was a job killer, debt would crush confidence, & hyperinflation was on the horizon.</comment>

<comment>Obolacare is all those things. But repubs are just as whack.</comment>

<comment>You're not correct by facts, statistics, or numbers; but by truthiness, you're right on track.</comment>

<comment>As far as being a "job killer" goes, since the law went into effect employment growth has been faster than at any time since the 1990s.</comment>

<comment>You mean unemployment growth. More people not working than ever before. I guess the Mexicans are doing it. I know the Indians are doing it.</comment>

<comment>Nope you got in wrong.  My source is a Nobel Prize winning economist.  Yes there may be a record number of people not working but there are also a record number of people working because of population growth.  That also means that there are more people who are full time students or are retired or are full time at home caregivers to children or elderly relatives but those I just mentioned are not unemployed in the sense of looking for work or discouraged from seeking employment which fact probably accounts for your confusion in addition to the probable fact that you look for information in sources of right wing opinion rather than objective sources of information.  The traditional unemployment rate has dropped to 5%.</comment>

<comment>You should stop reading what the reports "say" and what the reports actually mean. Unadjusted non farm workers gained 11,000 in December. That's the actual number and going back December was a VERY good month for job creation. But it's 11,000 not 200,000.   If you can add and subtract you can do the math yourself right from the gov. website. Start here and know this is only the tip of the iceberg of lies you eat up every day.http://nypost.com/2016/01/11/t...</comment>

<comment>You are quoting a Murdoch publication.  Like Fox network it is a source of (right wing) opinion rather than a source of factual unbiased information.  The last report showed as I recall a gain of 292,000 jobs.  So you are saying there was a gain of 281,000 farm jobs.</comment>

<comment>Numbers don't lie. Politicians lie. No that's not what it says. Read it for yourself.</comment>

<comment>Numbers can misrepresent the truth.  For example right wingers claim Republicans were more in favor of the Civil Rights Bill of 1964 because a higher percentage of Republican representatives as well as a higher percentage of Republican Senators voted for the bill than their Democratic counterparts.  That was literally true.  However, the Guardian showed that when members of Congress were separated into Northern and Southern in both geographic regions and in both the House and the Senate the Democrats had a higher percentage voting for the bill than the Republicans.  In other words the numbers hid the fact that the Democrats were more likely to vote for the bill but that fact was hidden unless one realized that this was an artifact resulting from that the South was still largely Democratic although this description was changing.There are other examples of this type of phenomenon that come up occasionally and are then exploited and distorted by partisans.</comment>

<comment>Only if you count part time jobs.  In any case the 90% of people with jobs have not seen any wage growth in the last six years.  If unemployment is as low as you claim, shouldn't wages have risen?</comment>

<comment>Full time jobs have also grown.  Wage increases have lagged but a number of jurisdictions have recently raised the minimum wage which means that all wages are starting to go up.</comment>

<comment>Obama can't wave a wand and put 92 million people to work moron. 70 months of job creation to fix the Republican ponzi scheme was about the best he could have done.You want a bullsh!t utopia that'll never happen, vote for Trump. You want jobs and progress, you vote democratic.</comment>

<comment>I'm the only one here arguing with facts, you're the one demanding facts are smoke, mirrors, & delusion.</comment>

<comment>Ponzi scheme?  Please explain you ridiculous claim.  The only government Ponzi scheme I know of is Social Security.</comment>

<comment>None of his socialist policies (except Obama care)  were ever passed, thank God.</comment>

<comment>Green stimulus, middle class tax-cuts, expanded off-shore drilling, saving Detroit, cash for clunkers... none of it existed?Amazing.</comment>

<comment>Middle class tax cuts, drilling for oil, socialist???  Your other examples are trivial and stupid, even by Obama standards.  Really amazing.</comment>

<comment>They didn't lie about it at all.In fact, they said it on national news: "Our only goal is to make Obama a one-term president."Problem is, that's ALL they focused on.</comment>

<comment>So why is that a BAD Thing for an opposition party to say!</comment>

<comment>You gotta be kidding me. You thought that was good? What are you Iranian? Give us back our people Abdul and do it now. </comment>

<comment>You won't have Obama to kick around any more!</comment>

<comment>Unless you are working for an invesment bank and you have to  suffer  through hundreds more of these speeches for which he will be getting 1 million dollars a pop - starting the day after he leaves office.</comment>

<comment>I hope you're wrong but we will see.</comment>

<comment>Just like every other president, but for some reason Obama can't because, well, we all know.</comment>

<comment>Right - the hope is that we can advance society to the point where we don't have to elect corporate puppets.</comment>

<comment>So electing a puppet master like Trump is better?</comment>

<comment>Why would a constitutional law professor go into investment banking?</comment>

<comment>"...Why would a constitutional law professor go into investment banking?...".That was a particularly intelligent and incisive comment - worthy of an Obama supporter.</comment>

<comment>They're just transitioning to Clinton instead.</comment>

<comment>We are going to kick him around for the next 8 years like you have done to Bush</comment>

<comment>Ha! Another dead ender</comment>

<comment>Ha! Another schmuck who voted for the idiot not once but TWICE!!!</comment>

<comment>Hell no, I wasn't even old enough to vote for Bush, but hell no anyways</comment>

<comment>" robust job growth has cut the unemployment rate in half over the last five years...".Yup, keep repeating that  even though we know that millions of good jobs have been shipped overseas to be replaced by Walmart-style McJobs with no union backing, inequality is way up, and Obama is still using the U3 rate in his speeches instead of the much higher U5 or U6 rates."...Cuba, Iran...".  Yup, Iran is getting 100 billion in sanctions money back for a non-binding nuke "deal".  Cuba gave ZERO concessions on any kind of political prisoners or freedom to get their deal.  Very easy to get a "deal" when one side is giving all the concessions."...Obamacare...". The health care system is just as fouled up as it's ever been.   They even spent a billion dollars on the website alone, and could not even get that to work.</comment>

<comment>You seem incapable of understanding the Cuba deal:1. The Cuba deal was only about normalizing relations and increasing economic ties. Despite this, Cuba RELEASED 53 political prisoners as a show of good faith. Much more than we got from Iran.http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/17/...2. Why continue policy against Cuba that no one supports and is ineffective? All it has done is kill average Cubans and has done nothing to hurt the popularity of the Castro regime. The embargo and sanctions are bad and ineffective policy. Ending it has made us more popular in Latin America and we've taken a tool away from Venezuela and Bolivia, two countries that despise "US imperialism" and use Cuba as an example of this.You really want to change Cuba? Open them up.Obama has no control over what jobs being made. That is more an issue related to globalization and automation. If you want stronger, union backed jobs, I'll be happy to support you.Most Americans seem to like Obamacare or at least parts of it, even the Kentucky Republicans got scared shitless when their own voters said that any changes to their Obamacare would be met with anger.</comment>

<comment>On your second point: "All it has done is kill average Cubans..."How is it the fault of the USA that average Cubans are dying in Cuba?</comment>

<comment>Partially by withholding medical technologies.Cuba had a TB outbreak, Tuberculosis in 2016. This has been mitigated by Cuba's very effective healthcare system especially in regards to cancer research. I remember reading that the US got new techniques and data from Cuba on cancer as the result of this thaw in relations.</comment>

<comment>" Yup, Iran is getting 100 billion in sanctions money back for a non-binding nuke "deal"."No.  Provided that Iran is compliant with the conditions as enumerated in paragraph 15, Annex V of the JCPOA, Iran will gradually receive relief.  And it's not $100B.  It's between $29B-$50B.  By virtue of a 15-0 vote in the UNSC, the P5+1/Iran agreement is now legally binding.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your comment.  For what it's worth:1 - All presidents use U3 in their speeches.  (U5 and U6 are both down dramatically since President Obama took office.)2 - In case you missed the news, the healthcare.gov website works (and millions of more Americans have health insurance than did when President Obama took office).</comment>

<comment>"..U5 and U6 are both down dramatically since President Obama took office....".Thanks for the misleading comment about Obama and U5/U6. In fact, U5/U6 ballooned while Obama was in office for the first couple of years and then gradually started to decline.But as a partisan, you chose to phrase your words in a dishonest way.</comment>

<comment>Well, let's look at the numbers:According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U6 was 14.2% in January 2009, rose to 17.1% by the end of that year (unemployment figures are generally a trailing economic indicator), and has fallen steadily over the ensuing six years to 9.9% last month (the lowest it's been since May 2008.  http://portalseven.com/employm...</comment>

<comment>Yeah - I just said that in my post. Do you have a point?</comment>

<comment>Just that, in fact, U6 is down dramatically (i.e., over 30%, and over 40% from its peak) since President Obama took office.</comment>

<comment>"McJobs with no union backing"Why on earth are you a Republican?  What have Republicans ever done for unions?</comment>

<comment>I have explained here many times that since the end of world war II - several factors have contributed towards the decline of unions and the middle class and the increase of income inequality.One of those factors is mass/illegal immigration. Trump is the toughest candidate on this issue. Also, free trade - Trump is good on this issue as well.Finally, the presumptive Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton - is a big corporate/Wall Street puppet - Trump is not.</comment>

<comment>What about anti-union legislation?  That seems to be the biggest issue</comment>

<comment>Case in point. Canada has about the same private sector union membership it had back in the 80s. The US doesn't. Why not? Right to work states.</comment>

<comment>yeah, you would think this would be a problem for Spud. Trump would definitely sign the "ALL OF THE USA IS RIGHT TO WORK ACT OF 2017" that the Republicans would pass.</comment>

<comment>Cognitive dissonance is a feature of the right, not a bug.</comment>

<comment>too risky.  It might help the country and then Obama would get the credit.</comment>

<comment>What in the world has illegal immigration, which is for low end non union jobs, to do with loss of union manufacturing jobs?Ironically one of the places we have had some union growth is in Nevada, where immigrants helped unionize the hotels and casinos.</comment>

<comment>Dude....many manufacturing jobs have either gone abroad or have been automated. That trend started long before Obama and will continue under any future president, even a Sanders or a Trump. And those that remain pay less, not more. People like cheap stuff. Who would have thought?Iran by the way, is getting its own money back if it complies with the agreement it signed. Cuba was sanctioned for 50 years and had political prisoners. That game had reached an end point.</comment>

<comment>All the predictions have come true!!!! We have runaway zimbabwe style inflation, socialism, sharia law, and all our guns have been confiscated! We have the black panther party running congress!! Every single prediction about how awful Obama was going to be has come true!! Just like JADE HELM!!!!!</comment>

<comment>You forgot to mention how he kept his promise to personally hand deliver hundreds of billions of dollars and nuclear warheads to Iran.</comment>

<comment>New York Times, CBS, Chicago Tribune: "Obama performs emergency appendectomy on aide"Fox News:  "OBAMA STABS MOTHER OF TWO"</comment>

<comment>Good one!But, a little close to the truth, also. Did you see the report today from CNN, where Biden said in an interview that Obama offered him a substantial sum of money for Beau Biden's family? The VP was concerned for them when it became apparent that Beau would lose his battle with cancer, because the younger Mrs. Biden is a stay at home mom. So, he and Jill Biden were thinking of selling their home in DE and giving her the money. The President said, "No, no, promise me you won't sell it. I'll give you the money". Well the right wing nut jobs commenting on that Facebook page were unreal. "Lies! Biden's trying to manipulate us to like Obama!" and "Ha Ha Beau Biden was a multimillionaire attorney general!" (He made $145, 207. I looked it up). And, "Obamacare should have paid for everything!" ignoring the fact that the VP was concerned about income for the family after Beau's death; not medical expenses. That's the "Obama stabs mother of two" crowd, and they're idiots.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You, evidently, as you commented.</comment>

<comment>Didn't Beau Biden have something called "Life Insurance" and shouldn't the children collect a Social Security Death Benefit.</comment>

<comment>I would assume so, yes, but unpaid medical - even after insurance- would probably eat up some of the insurance money. I think the VP was trying to pay off their home.</comment>

<comment>A phony law degree doesn't quite qualify Barry as a surgeon.</comment>

<comment>You should just call him the n-word and get it over with.You can hate his policies, but hating his law degree and calling it fake, really does venture into racist territory that he's incapable of achieving it unless he is granted it in a phony affirmative action way.</comment>

<comment>He has lied about almost everything  else, but that is a personal fault. Nice of you to display the racism that lies just under surface of your sophisticated liberal veneer.</comment>

<comment>Racism doesn't stop existing just because people are sophisticated.</comment>

<comment>As you have demonstrated.</comment>

<comment>Well I demonstrated my reasoning on why your comment was racist, I didn't actually display any racism. You just played the race card because your racism has no other defense.You attempt to shame intellectual discussion to shield your racism.If you call someone a racist, you better be on point, you are not. You're a racist, playing the race card to justify  it.</comment>

<comment>Obama is Bush Jr. on steroids, so I'll say the exact same thing about Obama that I said about Bush in the days leading up to his leaving office: I'll dance a gig when he takes that last flight out on Marine One.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your comment.  How, in your view, is President Obama "Bush Jr. on steroids"?</comment>

<comment>huh?</comment>

<comment>What a load of nonsense. The unemployment rate is down because millions of people have simply given up and stopped looking. The number of uninsured has little changed; Obamacare has forced million off of their insurance (If you like your plan, you can keep your plan).His inability to negotiate a Status of Forces agreement is the only reason troops are out of Iraq.I thought he was going to close Luxurious Club Gitmo in his first year.Obama will go down at the worst president in history, even exceeding Carter.</comment>

<comment>Regarding Gitmo...he still has a year left to fix that one. Restarting diplomatic/trade relations with Cuba was a great first step.</comment>

<comment>This sort of post is indicative of the modern GOP's epistemic closure and intellectual dishonesty."The unemployment rate is down because millions of people have simply given up and stopped looking."  And where is the data that supports this?  Fourteen million private sector jobs have been created.  How does that compare to the previous POTUS?"The number of uninsured has little changed; Obamacare has forced million off of their insurance (If you like your plan, you can keep your plan)."  Actually 17 million people have been covered under the ACA, and only 5-6% of those who previous had insurance have been adversely impacted by the ACA."His inability to negotiate a Status of Forces agreement is the only reason troops are out of Iraq."  The agreement that both President Bush and Iraq agreed to in 2008 was all US combat troops were to leave Iraq by December 31, 2011.  Furthermore, Obama was elected in part to end the war, and there was no popular support in this country to continue combat operations in Iraq.  What's striking about this comment is the implication that if we had just left our troops in Iraq, ISIS wouldn't have taken hold.  After trillions of dollars spent in part training the Iraqi military, and 4,400+ dead Americans, where is Iraq's responsibility in protecting itself?"I thought he was going to close Luxurious Club Gitmo in his first year."  Yeah, and if he had managed to do this on his own, guys like you would be the first to complain that he circumvented Congress and would accuse him of being a dictator."Obama will go down at the worst president in history, even exceeding Carter." Hilarious in its lack of self awareness, history, and proportion.</comment>

<comment>They are so blinded by hate they don't know they don't know.</comment>

<comment>What guys like him wallow in is Anti-Knowledge.  The Iraq accusation is particularly illustrative.  ISIS is the same thing as the radical Sunni insurgency that was empowered after we had overthrown Saddam and removed the Baathists from the government and the military.  It's the same group of people.  We had, what, 100K troops in Iraq at the war's height, give or take 10K?  And even then, we couldn't defeat that insurgency.  So what "Scott" is doing is ignoring how the Bush administration allowed what turned into ISIS off the chain to begin with.  He's also ignoring the costs of that war, both dollar-wise and blood and treasure, and instead he's blaming Obama.</comment>

<comment>WWJD?forgive them Father, they are dumber than your smartest fenceposts.</comment>

<comment>I think the right wing posters on this site are here to teach me patience. I'm failing the lesson.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your comment, but just for the record:1) the unemployment rate is down primarily because the economy has created several million jobs over the past six years; and,2) by every available measure the number of Americans without health insurance has dropped significantly.You can think---as do many---that the unemployment rate is still to high and that there are still too many uninsured people without access to decent health care, but those are different matters.</comment>

<comment>Obama is the worst president ever ...... but Hillary could top that</comment>

<comment>Could you describe the intellectual process that led you to conclude Obama's worse than his 42 predecessors (accounting for Grover Cleveland)?</comment>

<comment>Probably has something to do with his other comment- "Obama looks like_a_monkey".  That seems like a clue to his "intellectual process".</comment>

<comment>no ... it has to do with the damage Obama and Hillary have done nationally as well as globally</comment>

<comment>Obama's record</comment>

<comment>Obama looks like_a_monkey</comment>

<comment>Thanks for another brilliant comment from a Trump supporter.</comment>

<comment>Clinton raised taxes and the economy boomed.Bush cut taxes and the economy was crap. He ended losing 750,000 jobs a month.Obama raised taxes (on the rich) and passed a major health care plan and the economy has taken off. Best job growth since the 1990s.Does any of this matter to Republicans? No. There are right back were they were economically when Bush was elected, planning even bigger tax cuts for the rich. Its hard to fathom why any middle class Americans support these guys at all.</comment>

<comment>Gonna miss him. Best president ever. (But I'm sure he'll still do great things after he's left office.)</comment>

<comment>Disastrous president.  He needs to go back and finish organizing that community that he never  got organized in the first place,  but there probably aren't enough golf courses in the area for him to even consider it.  .</comment>

<comment>Does Obama really want Americans to think about the state of the union?  If they did, they might ride him out of town on a rail.</comment>

<comment>Speak for yourself.</comment>

<comment>Why?</comment>

<comment>Half the American people feel like they've got no representation in Washington whatsoever.  But the divisions are real, and they are marked.And the big reason is Barack Hussein Obama and his undisguised, now, efforts at transforming and changing this country into something it was not founded to be.  And all of this disunity, this division? It's justified, it's warranted, just like the anger associated with it is totally justified and warranted, and understandable.  And it is unique to Obama.  He has brought it about. And he's gonna sit there and try to tell the American people tonight, "If we get our politics right, it turns out we're not as divided on the spectrum as people make us out to be here in Washington, and that there's a lot of good things happening out there you just don't know about.</comment>

<comment>"And it is unique to Obama."What was Bush's approval rating again?</comment>

<comment>I want to see your "reading" list.You've put a lot of effort into this analysis.</comment>

<comment>Um....no.In an age where your namesake and the likes of Levin, Hewitt, Beck and Coulter have flourished thanks to advances in technology, their followers have been intellectually lobotomized.  Witness the twaddle you're spewing as if it's fait accompli.I don't see, for example, how any president could "transform" the country when one of our bodies -- the US Senate -- has filibustered at an unprecedented rate since 2007, which means any agenda POTUS has dies on the vine.  What is conservative about that?  Is that respectful of tradition?  Does that protect the viability and vitality of the institution?BTW...if you wish to be taken seriously, consider changing your moniker.  No serious person takes an oxy addict, thrice married, college dropout seriously.</comment>

<comment>Are you STILL unemployed?</comment>

<comment>You know what you're gonna see on display tonight? You're gonna see the president, in his eighth year, describe problems in this country that have only worsened during his tenure, the seven years that he's been in office. You're gonna hear those problems detailed as though they trace back to George W. Bush.  Those problems are going to be things that currently exist that he will have had nothing to do with.  He's going to give a speech tonight that will be reminiscent of a campaign speech he would give before the election in 2008.You mark my words.</comment>

<comment>Do you have an advance copy of the speech?</comment>

<comment>Maybe he can deliver the rebuttal, since that job doesn't seem to do anyone any favors</comment>

<comment>Bobby Jindal would concur.</comment>

<comment>I'd like to see someone who would reprise the greatest hits from the rebuttals of the last 7 years. Jindal doinf Howdy Doody, Bachman with that crazy look, Rubio and the water bottle, McDonal hauled off to prison....all wrapped up in one 5 minute skit.  I'll bet Dana Carvey could pull it off.</comment>

<comment>"problems in this country that have only worsened during his tenure"Well, the Republican party has gotten more ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>The Obama presidency is an abject failure.  It's an abject failure in the sense that liberalism has failed.  There is no utopia.  There is no growing economy.  There is no expanding private sector job base.  There is no expanding pool of wealth.  People are not doing better economically.  There are not great careers and jobs to be found out there.  Obamacare is an absolute mess and disaster.  American foreign policy is an embarrassment.  He's a total failure in representing the United States and growing it and securing it. But that's not his perspective.</comment>

<comment>haters gonna hate....*sigh*</comment>

<comment>The country is worse off now than it was in 2009.</comment>

<comment>Not in this reality.  2009- millions of jobs lost, millions of home owners lost their homes, Americans private savings suffered 4 Trillion dollars in losses.Are you a forth grader or a rich man?</comment>

<comment>Homelessness is rampant problem, and, meanwhile, we are being told every day that we got this growing economy, only 5% unemployment, that we're just surging here, economic growth and new job creation, and it's all BS. None of it is true.</comment>

<comment>Evidence?</comment>

<comment>Liberals gonna suck Obama'scok</comment>

<comment>"There is no utopia."I agree. If you define failure as "no utopia" this is obviously failure.  Success, however, seems unlikely."There is no growing economy. There is no expanding private sector job base. There is no expanding pool of wealth. People are not doing better economically. There are not great careers and jobs to be found out there."Err, OK, well, this is clearly wrong, but whatever."Obamacare is an absolute mess and disaster."ABSOLUTE, nothing good about it... uh, ok.I don't know man, you don't seem to be operating in the same country we do.  Are you talking about the USA?</comment>

<comment>Warning: Do not play any drinking games based upon how many self-references that   Obama  makes -  alcohol poisoining will most certainly be the  result</comment>

<comment>Because we are in an era when the concept of a "fact" has lost its meaning, no one is interested in objective measures of success for the Obama Presidency.  It seems to me that by any comparison, his presidency has been dramatically better than his predecessor's.  Economically, America is in better shape than any industrialized nation in the world.  The budget is in relatively decent shape, with deficits down to just 2.5% of GDP.  While still overly involved in foreign conflicts, we are less wrapped up in being the world's policeman than at any time in the past 30 years.  The homeland has been kept safe.  We have had landmark agreements with two longstanding "enemies" in Iran and Cuba, while also convincing every nation in the world (except red America, of course) to agree to take major steps to save the planet.  And on it goes.  It's a job well done, Mr. President.Obviously, the President won't be able to say anything about it, but a major part of his legacy has to be the shambles of the national GOP.  Something about him (ahem) just set off the right, and the fever just gets worse and worse.  We are now looking at a nomination contest led by a xenophobic clown and an unlikable sociopath.  In a country growing more diverse demographically and more tolerant culturally, the Republican Party continues to get more homogeneous and angry.  I'm not sure if this state of affairs is something the President is proud of, but from a purely political perspective it is an impressive achievement nonetheless.</comment>

<comment>It was his ears. The entire right went ballistic over the guys ears. Go figure.</comment>

<comment>You have to admit that with those big flapping ears and purple lips, he looks stupid.</comment>

<comment>Yeah....stupid. Bring back that genius Bush.</comment>

<comment>He was stupid too, but that doesn't negate the fact that Obama is an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Obama has nothing positive.  Obama has nothing he can point to tonight in his own seven-year resume to dispel that fact.   The world is more dangerous today than it was in 2009 and our nation is weaker and more divided.</comment>

<comment>Did Rush Limpballs tell you that, or are you just pre-determined to hate on the POTUS?I suspect you don't know anything, and so far I have been right.</comment>

<comment>Look, Liberalism is not in any way, shape, manner, or form associated with positive.  Have you ever seen a liberal optimist?  Do you ever see liberals writing books on happiness and feeling good, being better than you can be and generally that theme?  You don't.  Liberalism write books about how things are rotten and should be worse, they're gonna get worse and this is what you need to do to prepare for it.  Liberals write books and do television shows on the misery and suffering in life and how to cope with it.Liberalism is not teaching people to rise above anything.  Liberalism is not teaching people that they may be better than they even realize.  Liberalism is not about positive thinking or anything of the sort.  Liberalism can't survive in that place, in that arena.  Liberalism cannot in an argument in the arena of ideas in this country or anywhere else.  It's why liberalism has tyrants as leaders.  It's why liberalism does not like Constitutions.  Liberalism does not like freedom of this or freedom of that.  Liberalism believes that people must be controlled because basically people are incompetent and incapable of doing what liberals want them to do.  And so they must be controlled and ordered to do things and punished if they don't.</comment>

<comment>"Have you ever seen a liberal optimist? Do you ever see liberals writing books on happiness and feeling good, being better than you can be and generally that theme? You don't. Liberalism write books about how things are rotten"you, like 19 minutes ago:"The world is more dangerous today than it was in 2009 and our nothing is weaker and more divided."Am I replying to a parody troll?

<comment>Them and you.</comment>

<comment>So, Obama's going to tell the country that everything is awesome. I'm sure we'll all be persuaded.</comment>

<comment>One interesting measure of the President's success is that those who believe he has done well tend to point to specific data points (unemployment rate, job creation, deficit, number of U.S. troops fighting abroad, etc.) or specific policy achievements (foreign agreements, laws passed by Congress, executive orders, etc.), while those who view him as a failure tend to point either to vague bumper sticker slogans (America Is Weaker, The World Is More Dangerous, We Are Losing Our Values) or to make personal attacks (President is a Marxist, Kenyan, Muslim, Fascist, Communist, Nazi Manchurian Candidate).  Interesting...</comment>

<comment>One interesting measure of the President's lack success is that those who believe he has not done well tend to point to specific data points (labor force participation, anemic GDP growth, increased government spending, increased federal debt as a percentage of GDP, increased numbers on disability, lower household median income, territory held by ISIS, etc.) while those who view him as a success tend to distort statistics to present the situation in a better light (unemployment rate, job creation, deficit, number of U.S. troops fighting abroad, etc.) or to make personal attacks on his opponents (they're racists, idiots, owned by corporations, don't care about the planet, Fascists).  Interesting...</comment>

<comment>Well, at least you are referring to actual measurable things, so you get a gold star for that.  Obviously I don't agree with you on substance, but that is irrelevant to the point I am making.  Look around the right-wing comments in any story discussing the President's record and it is self-evident that my point is valid.  For the most part, opposition to the President is visceral, not rational.</comment>

<comment>You could say that about any politician. Look at the way the left treated George W. Bush (a president of whom I am not a fan). They detested him. I'd say the same applies to Ted Cruz today.</comment>

<comment>-Labor force participation rate growth is definitely a problem- Our GDP growth is actually one of the highest amongst developed economies, so while it isn't great we could be doing worse.-Government deficits have fallen under Obama.-Household median income has fallen largely due to the housing market bust  and its fallout which has its roots before even the Bush administration -ISIS territory holdings have decreased significantly since January of 2015</comment>

<comment>ISIS is jumping to Libya where they'll have lots more sand to control.</comment>

<comment>The claim by Gellieman is that ISIS territory holdings have increased. It has diminished 14% according to IHS Conflict Monitor. His claim is false even if ISIS has spread its scope</comment>

<comment>Here are some specifics...The poverty rate has gone up 25% under Knucklehead.The labor force participation rate, which measures the portion of Americans, at least 16 years of age, who are either employed or actively looking for work, has dipped to a 38-year low this past year to 62.6 percent.Oh, and the U-6 unemployment rate is at 10% and wage growth has been stagnant throughout his 2 terms.He is nothing more than a community activist with zero foreign policy and economic skills and experience, proving that you can be a total idiot and be elected president of the US.  And if makes you feel better,  Bush was an idiot too.</comment>

<comment>Conservatives are well known for their deep concern about the poverty rate, labor force participation, and U6 unemployment.  It speaks to the complete weakness of your case that these are the only data points you can point to to support your position.Still, I'll take your points in order.1. Yes, the official poverty rate has risen, unfortunately.  However, I am at a loss as to how this can be pinned on the President.  Is he the one who has relentlessly pushed for massive cuts in aid to the poor at the local, state and federal levels?2.  Labor force participation has been declining consistently since the mid-1990s, so it should not be surprising that it is falling now: http://static3.businessinsider...3. Yes, U6 unemployment is higher than other measures of unemployment.  This is not surprising, since U6 unemployment is the broadest measure of unemployment and is thus always higher than other measures of unemployment.  However, U6 unemployment has fallen completely in parallel to other measures of unemployment, so it is not clear what point you are making: http://www.macrotrends.net/137...4. Stagnant wage growth is certainly a huge problem in America, and has been since the 1980s "Reagan Revolution" heralded the modern era of deregulation, deindustrialization, and deunionization.  I agree that the President has not achieved all that he should have in dealing with this problem, but then again my preferred solutions are probably very different than yours.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that it is precisely because of conservative economic policy that stagnant wages are a problem to begin with.</comment>

<comment>"The poverty rate has gone up 25% under Knucklehead".  Post hoc ergo propter hoc nonsense.  There was a great recession, after all."The labor force participation rate, which measures the portion of Americans, at least 16 years of age, who are either employed or actively looking for work, has dipped to a 38-year low this past year to 62.6 percent."  You neglect to mention that the overall trend since 2001 is the participation rate has been falling."Oh, and the U-6 unemployment rate is at 10% and wage growth has been stagnant throughout his 2 terms."  This elides the fact that 14 million private sector jobs have been created, which is twice that of Obama's predecessor.  But this assumes that POTUS is exclusively responsible for job creation.  If this indeed were true, then according to what I'm assuming is your thinking, the ACA and the post-2012 tax increase on high income earners would have destroyed jobs.  There is no empirical evidence this has happened."He is nothing more than a community activist with zero foreign policy and economic skills and experience, proving that you can be a total idiot and be elected president of the US."  Well, considering he's been POTUS for 7 years, I think that qualifies as foreign policy experience.  And considering we have slowly but surely recovered from 2007/2008, your complaint about economic skill is silly.  "And if makes you feel better,  Bush was an idiot too."  I personalize like W, but he made some horrendous decisions.</comment>

<comment>Like I said, any idiot can be elected president of the US.  </comment>

<comment>And the current GOP field is full of them.  But here's what's truly disappointing about them.  None of them are the slightest bit conservative in any traditional, classical sense.</comment>

<comment>None...is...</comment>

<comment>What sickens me about Obama is that besides TPP I can't think of another instance in which he pushed for a rollback of government power. On every other issue, he insisted that the government should have more power and that private citizens and corporations should have less power. I don't know of a President who's had such an ideologically driven record of pushing government to expand. It's sickening.</comment>

<comment>"Absolute"?  Meaning a complete lack of intelligence?</comment>

<comment>Yes, complete.  He's an absolute idiot.</comment>

<comment>Well, here's a logical way of looking at things.Let's define complete lack of intelligence as 0.  By your reasoning, there is no way anyone could have a negative intelligence because by your own admission, 0 is absolute and analogous to 0 degrees Kelvin.  Therefore, intelligence >= 0.  Which begs an interesting question: if you're smarter than Obama, how do you explain being so divorced from empirical fact?</comment>

It is between $29B-$50B.3) Since it was Obama that had Iran by the short hairs by getting those sanctions in the first place, I don't see how he capitulated.4) How did you feel in 1983 when 241 Marines got blown up in Beirut?

<comment>That comment was rapey.  Not surprising coming from a Clintonite</comment>

<comment>Wonderful life you must lead. Tell me are you paid to run around calling Bill Clinton a rapist or is it just your hobby?It must be very gratifying work, I mean really, who needs social contact or intellectual conversation when you can randomly insult strangers. Your self-esteem must be staggering to need that rush of superiority over others, to demand you're better than them to justify breathing.You must be amazingly happy.</comment>

<comment>Well, I thought it was funny...</comment>

<comment>The scary part is that it wasn't supposed to be funny.</comment>

<comment>I meant I thought his zinger was funny.  Your response was somewhat humor impaired.</comment>

<comment>There really wasn't anything "rapey" about the comment he was referring to, it was a pitiful attempt to interject some venom into the conversation designed to shame people into hating democrats.There wasn't anything clever or funny about it other than he thinks Bill Clinton is a rapist & everyone should know. Regardless of truth, it's out of place in the context, leading to the assumption of that he's trolling because he has no socially constructive outlet.Running around calling Bill Clinton a rapist in every comment really does no good except to make himself feel better about his failed life.Regardless of whether you laughed, it wasn't supposed to be funny.</comment>

<comment>Again, humor impaired...</comment>

<comment>This is like explaining to a child why they can't make fun of a blind person.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should drop Ricky Gervais or Seth Macfarlane a line.</comment>

<comment>There's a line between harassment and comedy. I don't honestly care if you fail at understanding the difference.If it is comedy, the two of you have all the opportunity in the world to ignore this discussion, yet you don't. You demand you have the right to call others rape supporters for being democrats.</comment>

<comment>"Even now I can't have sex with a woman against her will without thinking about rape."Funny?  I think so.  Definitely black but still humor.</comment>

<comment>Dozens of women have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault.  He's a serial rapist, just like Cosby.  The evidence is irrefragable.  Even Hillary said that women should be believed.How does it feel to support a serial rapist?  You must have no shame if you put a serial rapist in the White House.</comment>

<comment>I don't support a serial rapist, but I'll let you get back to your high horse and demanding your moral superiority over others.Really, whatever it takes to keep you from killing yourself and to distract yourself over your obviously terrible and disturbing life, you do you.</comment>

<comment>If you voted for Clinton, you voted for a serial rapist.</comment>

<comment>You should really find a more constructive hobby that helps you create character and a personality that helps build social bonds.When you're socially active and happy, the need to hurt and offend others dissipates and is replaced with contentment.</comment>

<comment>Why are you telling me this?  Shouldn't be you be telling the person who is actually a serial rapist?  You think ALL of those women are lying about Clinton?  About Cosby?</comment>

<comment>I'm telling you this because you need to hear it.</comment>

<comment>"hillary years"???    You assert she will get years in federal prison?   I think you are wrong, months maybe but certainly not years.    Her influence peddling is difficult to prosecute even with some companies paying $7 Million for a few speeches.   They will cut her a deal.</comment>

<comment>I'm not even sure she'll make it years with her health problems.  She wouldn't even be elected if we got an honest account of what is going on with her.  She either suffered a stroke or is dealing with a tumor.</comment>

<comment>That's assuming that she can get past Sanders.Or that she somehow learns how to be a charismatic and sympathetic candidate.  I'm not holding my breath.</comment>

<comment>or the Bernie years.</comment>

<comment>There will be breadlines in America under Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>I'd rather go to a breadline than be pilloried, as would happen under Trump.</comment>

<comment>perhaps you should change your behavior if you live in fear of being pilloried.    Try to become a productive member of society, there is nothing funny about that.</comment>

<comment>Speak for yourself.  I've been working since I was 16 and I'm 67 next month.</comment>

<comment>then why do you fear being "pilloried by trump".   Please explain</comment>

<comment>I just see if a blowhard is in charge, he'll get us into WWIII before too long.</comment>

<comment>doubtful.    It does not make the country money.    but some people that may try and start WWIII make take a step back when they get a few hundred patriot missiles as a response instead of "please, please don't do that....    please let's just talk and be friends.."</comment>

<comment>The failure to understand the difference between Modern Sweden and the Soviet Union is just amazing to me.It's as if you can't even think up an actual insult. I can't honestly tell if that's a measure of failed education or you're just parroting Koch propaganda because you don't know the difference.I guess it's failed education either way. Unless you're getting paid.</comment>

<comment>Half of the people who work in this country make less than $30,000 a year in the Obama economy.    Wonder if Barry will mention that.</comment>

<comment>Of course not because we have moved on to MEAN income to confuse the population of uneducated voters who do not understand what it means when the median and the mean household incomes have moved so far apart</comment>

<comment>Americans are making less money under Obama, household wealth is down, there is less economic and more regulations and hurdles for Americans to find jobs or to start a business.   That's the Obama record.</comment>

<comment>well, you DO sound like your namesake.</comment>

<comment>correct.    and the mean and median income has the largest spread in our history.     The only way to spread the mean and median is by making the middle class POOR.      Mission Accomplished Obama.</comment>

<comment>Would be an improvement.   He would play golf less.</comment>

<comment>Are you aware that President Eisenhower was a member of Augusta National?  Are you aware there is a cabin named after Ike?  Are you aware that until recently that the 17th hole had a tree named after Ike that lined the left side of the fairway until a winter storm caused damage to the tree and necessitated its removal?With this in mind, don't you think it's rather silly to complain how often a POTUS plays golf?</comment>

<comment>When he plays more than any business owner in this country could possibly spare away from their companies and he is supposed to be running the greatest country in the world?   No, I do not think it is silly at all.     It may explain his complete lack of accomplishments.</comment>

<comment>This implies a couple of things.  The first is you have data on how often business owners play golf.  The second is you know how often every POTUS has played golf.  And judging from the veracity of your other posts, I find both of those scenarios unlikely.</comment>

<comment>you likely find many things unlikely.   But that is your blind partisan faith that guides you.</comment>

<comment>I'm an empiricist who is neither partisan nor an ideologue.  I'm also someone who's pretty serious about golf.  So was Ike, Jerry Ford, and George HW Bush.  Ford had a strong presence at the Bob Hope tournament for many years.  Bush 41 was an avid speed golfer.  So you cannot tell me with a straight face that Obama has not accomplished anything because he's playing too much golf.  For that would be partisan poppycock.</comment>

<comment>He has accomplished nothing because he has never had a job that demands productivity, that is another story though.   Someone that barely understands economics and has no idea the difference between an LLC and a corporation AND is president DOES NOT have time to golf.   They needed to be learning and listening to people.</comment>

<comment>Only that's not what you wrote:"Would be an improvement.   He would play golf less."Your implication is, in your view, Obama has played too much golf and therefore has not been productive.  You have not given me data showing how often executives or business owners play golf.  You have not given me data showing how often Obama's predecessors played golf.  So I think it's a fair bet that you can't back that accusation up.</comment>

<comment>bye bye strawman.</comment>

<comment>You going somewhere?</comment>

<comment>Actually he accomplished quite a long list of major things, and it is those accomplishments Republicans most hate. Stimulus, Obamacare, gM bailout, Iran deal, Climate change plan, cuba normalization........</comment>

<comment>What was the peak unemployment rate after the Reagan tax cuts?</comment>

<comment>Unemployment is at 5%. How are we going to be "saved" from that?!http://data.bls.gov/timeseries...</comment>

<comment>Obama, a president who for seven years had to deal with an opposition party who only cared about making him a one-term president, and inexplicably, they're still doing it, the economy, national defense, and jobs be dammed.</comment>

<comment>All three of those have improved.  How do you turds STILL justify your silly theory that Republicans sabotaged the economy?  You look like clowns.</comment>

<comment>You're right.They have. :)</comment>

<comment>The economy didn't collapse, therefore the GOP obviously didn't sabotage it, despite the GOP's stated intent.Fabulous conservative logic from Bill. Outcome equals intent.</comment>

<comment>Then again, they fail at most of what they do.</comment>

<comment>It didn't collapse.  It had a major turnaround with the Republican majority.  That's irrefragable.</comment>

<comment>You mean the job gains and turnaround that started when democrats controlled the house, senate, and presidency?Confidence was restored by the democratic promise to infuse $787 billion of stimulus into the economy, not some imaginary debt nonsense. Your argument was pretty easily refuted, so you might want to reconsider your wording.</comment>

<comment>So you're just insane?  The Republican majority turned the economy around.  The markets responded to the Republicans getting tough on debt.</comment>

<comment>There, fixed it for you.</comment>

<comment>Republicans had the majority.  Democrats controlled the purse strings.  Go back to elementary school.</comment>

<comment>Oh, that's not what you said in 2012!HAHA.As I've been saying all day, I love watching neocons make excuses for how well things are going. :)</comment>

<comment>Right.  Because me saying all three had improved is making an excuse.  You're the one making an excuse to get out of giving Republicans credit.  The Republican majority turned the economy around.</comment>

<comment>The markets rebounded from a lack of liquidity by a further draining of liquidity by the Republicans? Makes perfect sense.The economic collapse & the recession wasn't caused by lack of money in your ideal, it was caused by gov't debt?The collapse of the housing industry plays no part in your history, that's a factor that cannot be ignored.</comment>

<comment>Considering it was the GOP that helped put us in debt in the first place, your analysis of what the markets responded to is inaccurate.</comment>

<comment>Boo freaking hoo!</comment>

<comment>94 million Americans aren't working. That's the number: 94 million Americans are not working. People are losing their jobs. There is not an economic boom. There is not job creation going on. And this, too, is something the American people can sense. You know when the economy's booming. You can't miss it. You're in the middle of it. You're living it. Even if it's not happening to you, you see it happening where you live</comment>

<comment>Liberals create their own reality.   What they believe is based on emotion, not facts.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, which is why your namesake whips his audience up into a frenzy.  Apparently self awareness is not your strong suit.</comment>

<comment>Damn right el Rushbo!  Mega freaking dittos!</comment>

<comment>You're right.  It's all smoke and mirrors with this guy.</comment>

<comment>If you had bothered to look at the participation data, you would have noticed that since 2001, there has been a downward trend.  This strongly suggests that participation is not a function of who is in the Oval Office.</comment>

<comment>Why haven't things gotten better since 2009?   Just in terms of median household net worth, every group, every quintile is down big time since Obama took office.    White median household net worth is $141,900. Hispanic median household net worth, $13,700. African-American median household net worth, $11,000.</comment>

<comment>Youch!  You're right!  I didn't realize it was that bad.From the Pew Research Center.  As usual, Asians aren't included in the survey.http://www.pewresearch.org/fac...Just for the heck of it, I pulled similar stats from the UK.  The wealth disparity is the same there.http://www.poverty.org.uk/06/i...</comment>

<comment>Because what you leave out of your, ahem, analysis, is both the lingering effects of the Great Recession, and the fact that since 1980, middle class wages have stagnated.  Furthermore, private sector job creation since 2009 is a net +14 million, which is comparable to what was happening under President Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Everybody's losing income. Everybody's losing net worth. Throw the top 1% out. We're just talking average, ordinary, everyday Americans, which is who makes up the country. And that is the story. But they're trying to make it look like, okay, so here we have the first African-American president, right? Historic. He was gonna be different, right? How does this happen? How does the median household net worth in white America, $142,000 a year. It's 141.9. Whites 141.9, Hispanics 13.7, blacks 11. I mean, how does that happen? Why didn't Obama fix that?</comment>

<comment>So you want me to disregard a 36 year trend and focus on the past 7 years and not take into account the Great Recession?  That's what you want me to do?  That's funny.</comment>

<comment>House values, the main driver of net worth, collapsed and have only slowly rebuilt. Many people lost their homes. Some were out of work a year or 2.When you dig a deep hole, which Bush did, it takes a while to get all the way out of it.</comment>
