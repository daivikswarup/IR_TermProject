<comment>No Democratic appointees. Under any circumstances. </comment>

<comment>Let's get cookin'! Time to rollback ALL those conservative court decisions! YeeHaw!</comment>

<comment>Paul Clement. </comment>

<comment>I guess the Constitution doesn't mean any more to you than it did to Scalia -- that is to day, only when convenient.</comment>

<comment>Are you insane? Leave the court deadlocked for a year at least so you can use it as a political weapon? If Ginsburg died in Feb 2008 and Harry Reid tried this you would accuse him of treason. </comment>

<comment>They hold themselves to a completely different standard.</comment>

<comment>Yes they do.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats sat on Bush's nominations for years. Estrada, two years. Owens, four years. Harry Reid would never have let Bush fill an election year vacancy. Not a chance!</comment>

<comment>Number of Bill Clinton's judicial nominees blocked via various means, including secret anonymous hold: 66Number of George W. Bush's nominees blocked (using only the filibuster, which requires 41 Senators on record): 34.</comment>

<comment>Don't believe in the American system, do you?</comment>

<comment>Not even when the next president to be elected will also be a Democrat? </comment>

<comment>They don't care about governing, or doing what's actually best for the entire country. They already don't regard Democratic presidents as legitimate - they won't do any less for the next.</comment>

<comment>If they actually try to stall for a year they're not only going to make themselves look even worse than they already do, but they're going to trade Obama's nomination for Bernie's.</comment>

<comment>And he could nominate Obama. They'd really have a hissy fit then. It would be poetic justice. </comment>

<comment>Your post makes me very happy.</comment>

<comment>I swear, the Wednesday morning wailing after the election is going to be epic. I might take the day off just to enjoy it.</comment>

<comment>Against my better judgment, I now want this to happen more than anything.</comment>

<comment>No, no, no.  You want to wait to nominate Obama until the Chief Justice slot comes open.  THEN watch the far right's heads explode.</comment>

<comment>Hansjurg-- EXACTLY!Republicans would get a better deal from Obama than Bernie or Hillary, and at this point, this is  still the Democrats election to lose.The GOP is now in the unfortunate position of running against Obama again.  Do they really want to get their butts whipped a third time?I may stay home from work the day after the election to enjoy the butt hurt too.  I worked through the  schadenfreude in 2012. This year, I'll revel in it.</comment>

<comment>Too bad; he or she will be a Democratic appointment.  There is no way around it.</comment>

<comment>Its weird how you conservatives are always touting your love of the constitution. Except when its convenient for you.  IE: President's duty to nominate, and Senate's duty to confirm or deny. Its perfectly reasonable for the GOP to be picky with Obama's nominees, but not reasonable for them to not do their damn job.</comment>

<comment>As Tennessee's late Governor Ned McWherter was fond of reminding legislators, if you don't want to work, you shouldn't hire out.</comment>

<comment>So you want to leave the seat vacant for at least 5 years?  Sounds about right, why have even one functioning branch of the government, right?</comment>

<comment>A SCOTUS nominee hasn't been confirmed during an election year in 80 years. You quote Harry Reid, but Mitch McConnell was just as quick to state that the vacancy will be filled by the NEXT President.But it would be of a piece with Obama's delusional and partisan divisiveness to send up a nominee anyway.Antonin Scalia, R.I.P.</comment>

<comment>Why would it be in any way divisive for the sitting president to nominate a candidate?  The next president won't even be SEATED until next January, and assuming they nominate some one immediately (very likely) and assuming the Senate actually confirms them quickly and without much debate (very unlikely), that would still be a full year without that position being filled.How is it somehow divisive and partisan for the president to execute his duties under the constitution, but NOT divisive and partisan for the GOP leadership to rule out that out immediately, without even considering the candidate?</comment>

<comment>Why shouldn't politics be divisive and partisan?</comment>

<comment>Obama sees no reason why not, that is for sure. Then he gets up on his high horse and lectures Republicans for being so obstructionist and partisan.</comment>

<comment>Poor Republicans. They're the real victims here.</comment>

<comment>Because it serves no one.</comment>

<comment>If you're the GOP, why wouldn't you stall and hope that a Republican wins in November?  It's a no-lose situation since the Senate is going to stay Republican.  Either a Republican wins and you get a conservative justice, or you get to negotiate from a position of strength for someone palatable.</comment>

<comment>It might not. The republicans are defending some seats in some very blue seats in a presidential election year. That's going to be tough. </comment>

<comment>But because SCOTUS nominations can still be filibustered, it doesn't make all that much difference to the nomination fight.</comment>

<comment>It will after an election though. I don't think either party is dumb enough to filibuster a nominee after the election. They won't want the court in perpetual gridlock and they won't have anothjer election for two years. So they'll have to. Besides. The democrats won't do it to a republican nominee because it'll just be the status quo. </comment>

<comment>Why is it "dumb" for Republicans to do what Democrats have already done repeatedly?If one nominee gets rejected, the President sends another. No need to wait for an election.</comment>

<comment>No. It's dumb to do that after an election. Because it means they don't care about the courts. It's dumb when democrats do it too. Eventually someone needs to be responsible.</comment>

<comment>You know that's not even close to true, right? Kennedy in 88 was the most recent. </comment>

<comment>"You know that's not even close to true, right? Kennedy in 88 was the most recent."___He didn't mean 80 years ago; he meant 18: 2016 minus 1988.Oh, and he subtracted wrong, too.</comment>

<comment>The history from the experts:http://www.scotusblog.com/2016...</comment>

<comment>You're right, those races are about to get crazy.</comment>

<comment>Trump is getting the highest GOP turnouts in history.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a joke. If he gets the nomination he'll be lucky if 60% of the Republican voters even bother to make it to the polls. 65% of Republican women flatly refuse to vote for him under any circumstances. If he makes it to the general he will get NO African-Americans, Latinos, Muslims, Asians, Women, LGBTs... the number of people who hate him is yuge. Republicans disgusted with the GOP circus of losers are already crossing the line for a socialist...a SOCIALIST!...and you're drooling about a blowhard bigot.The left is going to have the Presidency, the Supreme Court, and if the Senate tries to prevent the President from nominating a new judge the Dems will win a majority there, too.Scream shrilly while you can, wingnuts. Your time in the sun has passed.</comment>

<comment>With SCOTUS on the line, everybody will be out to vote.</comment>

<comment>Not for Trump. they won't.</comment>

<comment>I am not a trump fan, but I would vote for him just for this fact.</comment>

<comment>Sure, they'll all turn out for Shrillary, a crook under FBI investigation who ought to be indicted -- and might be yet.</comment>

<comment>I tend to agree with you, which is why I sent Bernie another donation (my fifth) today. He's still a long shot, but it's getting shorter every week. Nevada was solidly hers three weeks ago - now it's a tie. SC is hers for now, but Bernie's ground staff in that state is ten times as big as hers and her support there is rapidly crumbling.You guys are going to lose the White House, the Supreme Court, and the Senate. For the sake of your legacy, try to lose with dignity this time.</comment>

<comment>So that's your prediction? we're going to lose the White House and the Senate and the Supreme Court, to a ticket headed by a 74 year old Vermont socialist?Can I have some of what you're smoking, please?</comment>

<comment>I remember people like you saying that we'd never see a black President in our lifetimes, that gays would never be allowed to marry, and that pot would never be legal.Your time has passed, Grampy. Go watch some All in the Family reruns and let us do the thinking.</comment>

<comment>Keep up your imaginary battles, kid. It's obvious you live in a left-wing bubble where all conservatives are Archie Bunker.</comment>

<comment>When Trump is finished making his mug the face of the Republican party 7/8ths of the nation is going to be living in that same left-wing bubble. It doesn't matter if every conservative is a racist lunatic or only 2/3rds of them are. Because of The Donald the public's perception of the GOP will be that of a howling lynch mob of hateful, violent bigots. Then we can take your guns, raise your taxes, put you in FEMA camps. dress you in pink, and gaymarry you to Serge, the undocumented gardener.</comment>

<comment>No you can't. The Republicans will throw you in jail for that.</comment>

<comment>You're vision for America is becoming more antiquated each day.The demographic clock keeps ticking away from you - tick tock, tick tock.</comment>

<comment>You don't know what you are talking about. It turns out that Trump is handily beating the GOP candidates among hispanics (who vote for the GOP) women, and based on NH might just lead in EVERY age demographic. I may not support anyone, but it is self-evident that the Trumpist brand of realpolitick is one of the most effective political strategies devised, and will guide every future election to come.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm quite serious when I express my dearest hopes that he gets the nomination. Go, Trump, go!</comment>

<comment>No.  Not in history.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  In history.</comment>

<comment>And now the profile is raised. It is not hypothetical anymore.</comment>

<comment>It's unlikely that the Senate remains Republican - especially if the Democrat wins the presidency.</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying it's a bad idea politically or even that Democrats wouldn't find a way to justify doing it if the roles were reversed, just that it's asinine for some one like azt24 to act as if the disagreement about timing is somehow reflecting a moral failure on the part of Barack Obama.It is ACTUALLY the president's job to appoint a replacement, not necessarily the very next day, but with some urgency, because the Supreme Court is pretty damned important, and already doesn't have the bandwidth to handle the number of cases that justify its attention on a yearly basis.Taking a full year off, whatever the political reasons, probably isn't a good thing for the country.  Again, not saying that Democrats wouldn't do the same thing if this had happened in the last year of Bush 43's term, just saying, whoever does it, in whatever circumstances, doesn't have any room to pretend that the OTHER side is acting in bad faith.</comment>

<comment>Because a 4-4 vote upholds in favor of the lower court ruling, equal to a 5-4 ruling.</comment>

<comment>That strategy could backfire. An open seat on election day will bring out Dem and Indie voters in a veritable flood.</comment>

<comment>It could also be another government shutdown level PR blunder for the democrats.Eta: I typoed, I meant a PR blunder for the GOP.</comment>

<comment>I don't see that. The GOP will be the obvious obstructionists, so how does blame redound to the Dems? And what if Obama nominates a Latino? A Latino immigrant? The GOP will be lucky to keep the House, much less the Senate.</comment>

<comment>I am super dumb, I totally meant a PR disaster for the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Last time I checked, the government shutdown was a PR problem for the GOP, not the Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Ah derp, my bad. Totally meant that.</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court is an even hotter issue among conservatives than among liberals.</comment>

<comment>Well, of course -- since it's in their pocket. If you had a court that empowered your fascist dreams, you'd think it was pretty hot, too.</comment>

<comment>In whose pocket? Did you miss the decisions on Obamacare and gay marriage?</comment>

<comment>Because in theory these politicians care about America and don't want the court to be deadlocked for a year. </comment>

<comment>The court can rule with 8 members. If anything it is more likely to give liberal rulings.</comment>

<comment>Things may shape up now that he's dead that those 7 swing states may swing back Democratically.  Also, time to elect some republicans who are not obstructionist.</comment>

<comment>Republican Senators up for re-election include incumbents in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Iowa.  A Republican in Florida is not seeking re-election.  Each of these states voted twice for President Obama.</comment>

<comment>It's a considerably better than 50-50 shot that the Dems retake the Senate. There are 24 Republican-held Senate seats up this year, against only 10 Democratic-held ones, and 7 of those 24 Republican held ones are in states that went for Obama twice. And they're all running in a Presidential year, with a Presidential-year turnout, about 35% higher than in a non-Presidential year, with the new voters skewing disproportionately Democratic. And the Dems only have to pick up 5 of those 24 seats to retake the majority. 4 if a Dem wins the White House, which is also better than even money.</comment>

<comment>It's beautiful to read someone who knows wtf they're talking about.</comment>

<comment>Under the circumstances, for Obama to send a nominee to the Senate this year would be picking a fight for the fight's sake, just so he could parade the filibuster around as a grievance.</comment>

<comment>Well he probably should. This could bring some attention to the judicial confirmation gridlock (which incidentally the Supreme Court can't stand). They are refusing to advance nominees to boring district courts that are recommend by Republican Senators! </comment>

<comment>What gridlock? Ever since Harry Reid used the 'nuclear option', the Dems have been packing the lower courts with liberals.And while we're deploring judicial confirmation gridlock, does the name "Miguel Estrada" ring a bell?</comment>

<comment>Blue slips in the judiciary committee is the current gridlock. Yes. And that was stupid because Elena Kagan supported him. But at least that was for the DC Circuit, and not some district court whose docket is mostly run of the mill crimes, employment law, and diversity. </comment>

<comment>Poor Republicans...the very future of american fascism shaken at the foundation.</comment>

<comment>The future of American Fascism has been occupying the White House for seven years now.Crony Capitalism is the very essence of fascist rule -- use the power of the massive centralized administrative state to pick winners and losers, so every business spends more buying government favors than competing in the marketplace.</comment>

<comment>Republicans are fascists. They have always leaned in that direction save for the Eisenhower era. They were fascists when Mussolini and gentile were children.  </comment>

<comment>Progressives were great admirers of Mussolini. And why not? He was a Socialist like they were.</comment>

<comment>Republicans are fascists, end of story. Socialism and fascism are diametric opposites.  You may be ashamed of the name but you wallow in corporatism, regardless of how toxic it is to you.  Been trickled down on today?</comment>

<comment>Fascism was a nationalist spinoff of socialism and was admired as such by the left in 1920s and 1930s. Liberals just rewrote the political spectrum after WWII to disassociate themselves from the stench of Nazism, dislodging the reactionary traditionalists & monarchists who had formerly held the right-wing end of the spectrum.But pretending that Hitler and Stalin were opposites never made a lick of sense, when functionally they behaved absolutely the same. Progressives turned the political spectrum into a circle.</comment>

<comment>Still ashamed to call yourselves fascists when you wallow in corporatism.  You're still bogged down there, and you can't escape it nor can you deflect from it.  You're a fascist and so was scalia.  It is the diametric opposite of some kinds of socialism, but you lack the sophistication needed to examine various types of either socialism or fascism.   But you do reveal that you're one confused puppy, and probably out of necessity.  That's what greed gets you.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is wallowing in more corporatism than Obama, the man who made the entire health care sector a wholly owned subsidiary of the Federal government.</comment>

<comment>you can't defend so you have to deflect. Yes, sheldon adelson,the kochs, Scalia and many others in this post rational  republican era do  indeed wallow in  corporatism as  do you, who must sacrifice more every day to that same corporatism. You're part of the unraveling  of American civilization, and it's most likely you can't control or sense it. It's part of a larger pattern than just a greed generation coming along one out of four and unraveling the works of the last three, resulting in war or revolution  or civil war.So you failed to stand your ground again, and deflection to obama won't  play in a party that considers the Kochs mainstream.</comment>

<comment>that would be socialist, not  fascist. Letting private enterprise run health care would be Fascist.  You have to maintain the illusion of greed being good and deflection since you can't defend fascism..You're nothing but a straw man demolisher who is too timid to stand her ground.You cannot defend republicanism. If you try, you immediately deflect to obama bashing.</comment>

<comment>You got the wrong country, son.</comment>

<comment>No, Obama has the wrong country.</comment>

<comment>That's why he was elected president, twice, right? Not a big admirer of democracy, are ya?</comment>

<comment>Not in the case where lying stealth socialists win elections and use their power to commit crimes and subvert the rule of law.</comment>

<comment>Loosen up your tinfoil hat dude, you have it on tighter than you usually do tonight.</comment>

<comment>The Obama who ran in 2008 called himself a conservative Democrat and was staunchly against gay marriage, remember? But Dems don't care about character, so they never mind liars.</comment>

<comment>(cough, cough) ...Halliburton....</comment>

<comment>This is hilarious reasoning. Obama should not exercise the constitutional prerogative of presidents--an obligation in fact--because why?</comment>

<comment>Because of the norms and traditions of American politics, which Obama has nothing but contempt for anyway.You did read where I mentioned this hasn't been done in 80 years, did you?</comment>

<comment>When is the last time a seat was vacant for more than a year?  Longer ago than that I believe.</comment>

<comment>Google Anthony Kennedy:Assumed officeFebruary 18, 1988Appointed by Saint Ronnie himself! In an election year!!You need to work on your math</comment>

<comment>You need to work on your incorrigible idiocy. Kennedy was nominated in November 1987, after Robert Bork had been "Borked" by a liberal defamation squad in the Senate.</comment>

<comment>So, 3 months makes a difference, azt24?Come on, man. ..</comment>

<comment>Yes, it makes a difference. It was not an election year. It only happened that late in any case because the Democrats had decided to assassinate an extremely well-qualified candidate whom they feared.</comment>

<comment>So it's OK if it's 14 months prior to the end of a term, but not 11?I'm having trouble believing you really think that. </comment>

<comment>We weren't discussing how long a vacancy was "okay" but whether Kennedy had been nominated in an election year.</comment>

<comment>So it makes more sense that we should halt all SCOTUS activity for over a year...?</comment>

<comment>SCOTUS will keep going with 8 justices.</comment>

<comment>If this had happened in 2007 you would be screaming that Bush had all the right in the world and OBLIGATION to nominate someone and that Congress HAD TO allow that person through.  Don't even try to pretend that isn't the case.</comment>

<comment>Since the Democrats habitually blocked or filibustered Bush's nominations to the bench, I would be under no illusion that Congress had to do anything.</comment>

<comment>None which took anywhere near 340 days to be approved.  Try again.</comment>

<comment>And by "assassinate," you mean they had hearings, and voted on him.</comment>

<comment>So it was not an election year then? Because democrats rejected Bork?  Fascinating!Not seeing the "unprecedented" part.</comment>

<comment>I await your apologyhttp://www.scotusblog.com/2016...</comment>

<comment>At the risk of repeating myself: It happened eighty years ago because that was the timing. Can you demonstrate that the reason it hasn't happened since then is because everyone agreed it shouldn't? Or did the vacancies in those years simply not appear during the calendar election year? The longest confirmation on record is Thomas at 100+ days. Obama has over 300 days left in office.</comment>

<comment>Non-confirmations have lasted much longer than that. Dems sat on Bush's court nominations for up to four years.</comment>

<comment>I think leaving a vacancies open for over a year would break an even bigger norm.</comment>

<comment>There doesn't need to be a filibuster, there could just be a vote. Sounds like the Republicans don't want to play ball. Almost like they're just picking a fight....</comment>

<comment>Its weird how you don't believe the President should do his job when he's a Democrat.</comment>

<comment>Obama's job is to preserve and protect the Constitution of the United States.Obama has never done his job and I certainly don't expect him to start now.</comment>

<comment>If you are referring to the current POTUS, since he has not, thus far, executed his duties under the Constitution, that is why it would be divisive and  partisan for him to attempt him to appear to be doing so now.</comment>

<comment>Nicely put unfortunately Repubs will react to your statement by figuratively sticking their fingers in their ears and bleating out nahnahnahnahnahnah because they only want to follow the constitution when it suits them and damn that document to hell and say it was interpreted incorrectly when things don't go their way. If this had happened when G.W.B was in his last year as a lame duck and the Democrats suggested it wait until after the elections the Republicans would have been up in arms and calling for Bush to immediately nominate someone and then rail against and bash anyone that tried to stall the nomination process.</comment>

<comment>"How is it somehow divisive and partisan for the president to execute his duties under the constitution, but NOT divisive and partisan for the GOP leadership to rule out that out immediately, without even considering the candidate?"___There are two very distinct ways to talk about politics. The question you're asking addresses a claim that is obviously a political *tactic*, but you're poking holes in it as if it were simple disinterested political *theory*.Full disclosure: I'm a proud Republican who will cheerfully acknowledge (as I did at the time) that the Supreme Court's stopping the Florida recount in 2000 was naked partisanship, not principle; and I supported it then, and I'd do so again.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm poking holes in what azt24 said because what he said is 100% useless bullshit, free of any fact or intelligence.There is no argument to be made, whatsoever, that President Obama is somehow putting party before country if he nominates a candidate for Scalia's vacant position.  To think so would require believing that somehow the twice elected president of the United States is less legitimate than whoever will be elected almost a year from now.  I realize that "he's not my president" is a long standing idea for many right wingers, but that delusion doesn't carry any weight in the real world.The only partisanship I've seen so far is from Cruz, McConnell, etc, who have insisted that any nomination must be delayed until (presumably) they have a stronger political advantage.  Dressing that up as "The American people should have a say" is ignoring the obvious facts that 1) SCOTUS is not an elected office, and is not intended to be and 2) The American people have voted (twice) to elect this president, and they also voted to decide the current Senate roster.I understand that partisanship is a part of politics, but what I don't understand is how any one can possibly be stupid enough to claim that the elected president is somehow engaging in partisanship if he dares to execute one of the required duties of his office.</comment>

<comment>So it is done.</comment>

<comment>It's delusional and divisive to do your job?  WTF?</comment>

<comment>Only if you're black.  Then everything you do is divisive.</comment>

<comment>Including mentioning the fact that you're Black.</comment>

<comment>As a further complication, who's going to tell Clarence Thomas how to vote now?  It's like losing two Justices on one day.</comment>

<comment>What's your point? It happened eighty years ago because that was the timing. Can you demonstrate that the reason it hasn't happened since then is because everyone agreed it shouldn't? Or did the vacancies in those years simply not appear during the calendar election year? The longest confirmation on record is Thomas at 100+ days. Obama has over 300 days left in office.</comment>

<comment>If memory serves, presidents are elected for 4-year terms. Pretty sure Obama still has a mandate. Or perhaps you would prefer a European-style parliamentary system?</comment>

<comment>Does the term "lame duck" ring a bell?</comment>

<comment>"Lame duck" refers to a politician whose replacement has already been elected, but does not yet hold the office.  Are we now expanding the definition of "lame duck" to "the last two years of any Presidency?"</comment>

<comment>Nope, it refers to the President after the second midterms, when his party's interests diverge from his own.</comment>

<comment>Nope, it refers to the President after the second midtermsDo you have any examples of this being in common usage before now?  Because this is certainly news to me, and really to anybody not already predisposed to refer to the current President in terms of weakness.when his party's interests diverge from his own.Both candidates for the Democratic nomination are appealing to the Obama base by pledging to continue or advance his major policy goals.  Let's say another Justice leaves the Court on December 1st, Clinton has been elected President, and the Democrats have been elected to a narrow Senate Majority.  Will anybody think of Obama's last two months in office as a time for mandatory inaction?  I mean, other than the right-wing voters who are already angry at him for having the temerity to continue breathing.</comment>

<comment>Yes, this is a structural thing, due to the term limits on Presidents. The whole second term is a slide down to lame-duck status. After the 2nd midterms the President is thinking about his legacy, but the Congress is thinking about their next elections. From Wikipedia:"A president elected to a second term is sometimes seen as being a lame duck from early in the second term, because presidents are barred from contesting a term four years later, and is thus freer to take politically unpopular action. Nonetheless, as the de facto leader of his or her political party, the president's actions affect how the party performs in the midterm elections two years into the second term, and, to some extent, the success of that party's nominee in the next presidential election four years in the future."</comment>

<comment>Only if they're a Democrat, and then they're a lame duck the moment they start their final term. Republican Presidents keep their full powers until the very minute their successor is inaugurated.</comment>

<comment>It's a guilty pleasure watching the Republican voters repeating 2012, gritting their teeth and telling themselves "This will all be fixed when we win the next Presidential election, because obviously the American people must agree with me!"</comment>

<comment>Yes, I'm familiar with the term. So, in your opinion, at what point in a president's second term should he/she stop exercising his/her constitutional authority?</comment>

<comment>of course you are wrong -- further evidence that facts don't matter to ring wingers. Kennedy was confirmed during Reagan's last year.</comment>

<comment>That is incorrect - current Justice Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 (an election year and Reagan's last full year in office).</comment>

<comment>I should have said nominated, rather than confirmed.</comment>

<comment>How many opportunities have there been during a (presumably presidential) election year?</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you need to check your math.Anthony Kennedy, February 1988.</comment>

<comment>That is not true at all.  A Supreme Court nominee was confirmed in 1988.  Prior to that, it was in 1968.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, about that. You need to brush up on your history.Frank Murphy, 1940Anthony Kennedy, 1988</comment>

<comment>Kennedy was Reagan's third choice. He did not fill an election year vacancy.1940 was 75 years ago under completely different circumstances.</comment>

<comment>Really?  Pretty sure Kennedy was confirmed in 1988, an election year.</comment>

<comment>False.  Try again.</comment>

<comment>Please do your homework before posting blather. In 1986 Regan appointed Kennedy who was confirmed by a Democratic Congress in Feb. '87. From the Scotus blog: In the wake of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, questions have arisen about whether there is a standard practice of not nominating and confirming Supreme Court Justices during a presidential election year.  The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election.  In that period, there were several nominations and confirmations of Justices during presidential election years.</comment>

<comment>"But it would be of a piece with Obama's delusional and partisan divisiveness to send up a nominee anyway."_____Yeah, Obama chose for Scalia to die and the seat to thereby become vacant in an "election year" (instead of one year earlier or one year later) because that's just the kind of scoundrel Obama is.</comment>

<comment>Willfully ignorant or pitiable misinformed!  .The History:http://www.scotusblog.com/2016...Fux channel lies repeated ad nauseum are easily refuted!!!</comment>

<comment>False. Anthony Kennedy, 1988.And if you count midterm elections, Antonin Scalia himself, 1986 (less than 50 days before the midterms gave Democrats control of the Senate).</comment>

<comment>> A SCOTUS nominee hasn't been confirmed during an election year in 80 yearsWell, tell us where in the Constitution that is relevant.  Aren't you people the strict Constitutionalists? And I guess the Speaker of the House doesn't become President if something happens to the President and Vice President because when was the last time that happened? Is there any line you morons won't repeat?</comment>

<comment>You can accept Obama's nomination now, or let the next dem prez nominate one to a Dem led judiciary committee</comment>

<comment>If you're so certain of the future, shouldn't you be at the horsetrack placing bets?</comment>

<comment>I do quite well with my parlays</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but when's the next Democratic president going to be elected?  2064?</comment>

<comment>'16</comment>

<comment>Maybe you missed it but this cycle's Republicans are even bigger losers than last cycle's.</comment>

<comment>This will pull the Independents to Repub side now more than ever. Stop the Dem destruction. Congress will have to Stop him.</comment>

<comment>Rank and file republicans suffer the most under republicanism.</comment>

<comment>You are really hateful. Get help! I fear you are about to shoot up your workplace.</comment>

<comment>Why are you still commenting to me. You all are pathetic and if someone who cares about Scalia, they will call you out on your irreverence. I'm surprised that y'all could stoop this low. I prefer to not speak to you again. </comment>

<comment>I don't have to revere Scalia. I look forward to you not replying to me. </comment>

<comment>Republicans have zero respect for themselves.</comment>

<comment>Nice Try trying to turn the tables. Go back to your fellow haters where you can Hate together. Classless </comment>

<comment>I don't celebrate his death, just the death of his insufferable ideology.  He had an OK run.</comment>

<comment>Color me evil.  I let out a cheer when I read the headline.</comment>

<comment>You are a true patriot</comment>

<comment>Good to know. I'm celebrating I was not born like you---born with a heart and common courtesy and reverence for the very recently deceased. </comment>

<comment>And likewise for the many 100,000 we have killed in the Middle East over these past 15 years?</comment>

<comment>Nobody was celebrating except 'American Haters'. Was that you.</comment>

<comment>Yup.  Bad to the bone, baby.</comment>

<comment>Enjoy - I'm off with my lovely family while you are here spreading hate. Yuck. Cya </comment>

<comment>How is it that no one in your family hasn't stabbed you in the eye with a fork yet?</comment>

<comment>As long as they align with your ideology. </comment>

<comment>Nope, obstruction and sloth will hasten the demise of the cons.</comment>

<comment>How do you figure that, Sarah?  People for whom judicial appointments is the foremost political issue in presidential politics -- and I am one of them -- tend to already identify with one party or the other.I am genuinely saddened by Justice Scalia's death, even though I would likely have been gladdened by his retirement.  My fellow liberal Democrats would do well to show some restraint here.</comment>

<comment>That.... makes no sense whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>Go to hell!</comment>

<comment>You are a hateful prick. </comment>

<comment>Sometimes.</comment>

<comment>Scalia is dead. Suddenly, the Constitution is now alive. That should scare any sane American.</comment>

<comment>Yes and no...</comment>

<comment>If by "alive", you mean what the progressives mean -- that the Constitution means anything they feel like inventing that day -- then that should scare everybody.All progressives care about is Power. Getting it & keeping it. They really don't care what they destroy in the process.</comment>

<comment>We liberals have successfully invented and defended America. You got dick and a fast track back to Mussolini.  I anticipate violent divisiveness.  I was born under FDR and I've never seen this much wholesale insanity from the right.</comment>

<comment>Don't you dare claim the mantle of the Founding Fathers! You hate them! You hate the individual liberty, freedom of conscience and local autonomy they fought for! You are a bunch of collectivists today. You don't even deny that you are socialists!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that anger is how the rest of us Americans feel watching you right-wing crypto-anarchists try and pull down the last one hundred years of American history.  Quit trying to pretend that the right wing loves America: You hate everything it's become since the Civil War, especially since the Depression, and only love your sanitized historical fantasy version of the nineteenth century.The Founders weren't a monolith, and I'm pretty certain that some - Hamilton, for example - would view your half-baked political ideology as a joke, a conspiracy theory for simple people.</comment>

<comment>It's because of such outbursts that no one around here takes you seriously.</comment>

<comment>Oh, calling you a socialist was an outburst? Who are your candidates? What do they propose?</comment>

<comment>Everyone hates America except you, right buddy?</comment>

<comment>you are an inexpert mind reader, and out of control angry. As a liberal I deny Divine Right and affirm Inalienable Right. The exact positions of the rebels v. the Crown. I have no need to  align with your straw men, and I never do. I know what has worked, viz. the New Deal, and what has not, the Raw Deal of Pissing On the Poor economics.Your ideology has enabled  68 people to control virtually everything  on earth as they have more wealth and power than  half the planet.You're right back to  serving the King and casting Inalienable Right aside for  Corporate rights.</comment>

<comment>Without Antonin and his Constitutional seances, how will we know what James Madison felt about telecommunication laws?</comment>

<comment>Why, why be beholden to the words of people who have been dead for a very long time and a document written in a very different time that set up a system that most Americans feel is failing. (Why is it that when Americans say they don't approve of the government, nobody considers question ing the actual foundation of the thing they dislike?)</comment>

<comment>The political timing?  The location -- away from DC on a trip?  There're no accidents in politics.Scalia was done in early, probably by Obama/Hillary's foreign allies.  Now she has an "engineered" talking-point to pull the women-voters of all age:  "You want a Republican President who will nominate a conservative SC Justice who will take away your right to chose?  Or one who will nominate a left-wing, push-over Justice? "</comment>

<comment>Lol.I think the illuminati hired aliens to do it, personally.</comment>

<comment>Lol, nothing so exotic, sport.</comment>

<comment>79 year old men never die unless Clinton engineers it!</comment>

<comment>Lol yes, there certainly is age-related "deniability" in this case,  isnt there? </comment>

<comment>There could be no other possible explanation than hillary clinton sent her ninjas into the camp to slay this great man in his sleep!!! Is there no limit to her evil?</comment>

<comment>She's not evil.  What does this have to do with the Japanese? </comment>

<comment>Outsourcing.  Damn ninjas taking away assassination jobs from perfectly qualified Americans.  Though at least part of blame falls in their union, the United Assassins of America.</comment>

<comment>Take you meds lol</comment>

<comment>Both of you are nuts. I was over on Freerepublic and have it on good authority that it was Mexicans, not Japanese.Were there any signs of rape? If so, Trump would be validated.I swear by the blood of Megyn Kelly to get to the bottom of this heinous Kenyan conspiracy!</comment>

<comment>I know, I know! Whoever heard of anything as outlandish as a 79-year-old overweight smoker dying? He was obviously 'Fostered' as part of a Kenyan conspiracy to institute Sharia law! And when is he going to show us his original long form certificate of live birth?</comment>

<comment>Like I said: great built-in,  age-related deniability.  But also health-related deniability too (thanks for that ;) .  Why would you need his birth certificate, though?  And what's with the Kenya/Sharia thing?  </comment>

<comment>RIP Justice Scalia. We can only hope our Bill of Rights survive you.</comment>

<comment>We've defeated one cancer,a few more to go.</comment>

<comment>i look at how this court has effectively gutted the fourth amendment and i am wondering how much is even left to the bill of rights about now. the next nominee will hopefully be able to reverse the damage.</comment>

<comment>The only amendment that matters to cons is the 2nd.</comment>

<comment>Good!More dog food!My dog eats meat!</comment>

<comment>The American people have already decided who they want to appoint the next justice. He was elected President 2x by a large margin.</comment>

<comment>Then he needs to appoint someone acceptable to the current Senate.Ted Cruz would be a good choice. The Senate would be happy to see him go.</comment>

<comment>Cons have immediately come out and said they won't play ball as long as Obama picks. It apparently doesn't matter who it is. They have pre emptively obstructed. </comment>

<comment>What makes you think Cruz would be acceptable to his colleagues in the Senate?</comment>

<comment>Usually Senators get an easy confirmation. But Cruz might prove an exception. But why talk about it, appointing Cruz would be like appointing a second Scalia; Obama would never do it.</comment>

<comment>I am trying to recall how recently an incumbent U. S. Senator was nominated for SCOTUS.  I think that President Franklin Roosevelt's nomination of Hugo Black in 1937 is the most recent.</comment>

<comment>They all hate him so much they'd leap at the chance to get him out of the building for good.</comment>

<comment>there is no such thing as an acceptable candidate to the republicans. so if the president asks them nicely, they are going to tell him to not choose an nominee. but the president is elected to a *four* year term, and he still has one more year to go, so president obama should still continue to do his work - in this case, that work means picking a supreme court nominee. if the republicans obstruct, then it necessarily becomes part of the political environment - but that is the republican's problem and not that of president obama because he isn't running for political office.</comment>

<comment>If the Republican Party refuses to advise and consent and a Democrat wins the White House, a Justice Obama would just drive the Republican Party into an absolute abyss of insanity.</comment>

<comment>As if they're (GOP) not there already.</comment>

<comment>This is the craziest I've ever seen the right.  Every fourth generation of Americans pull down the works of the last three, then the war or civil war starts.  Looks like it's that time again....</comment>

<comment>They really have gone right off the deep end. Go over to freerepublic.com and look at their posts. They're convinced the freaking Illuminati have crept up from Mexico and assassinated one of their heroes, because who ever heard of a 79-year-old overweight smoker dying? They're howling for the Senate to stall until they can get a Republican in the White House.....but nine years is a long time to wait for a replacement!</comment>

<comment>That would be a very short journey.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't that be great! Roberts and Obama (seriously) would get along famously. </comment>

<comment>Not quite.  The President does not appoint, he nominates.  Appointment is a joint function between the President and the Senate.More accurate to sayThe American people have decided who they want to nominate the next Justice.And..The American people have decided who they want to confirm the next Justice.</comment>

<comment>Technically incorrect. The President nominates;  the Senate advises and consents; the President appoints. That is just the language from Art II.</comment>

<comment>thanks for the language</comment>

<comment>Pleasure.</comment>

<comment>As a current law student, Justice Scalia looms large over my legal education. From originalism to pure textualism, he has been a dominate force over not just the direction of the law but legal analysis as well. In a more mundane way, he has been a forceful advocate for clear and accessible legal writing. Even as a liberal, it is still very sad to hear he passed away. Despite his conservative beliefs he has written some celebratory decisions over the years, particularly in criminal law and procedure. He will be missed. Even when you disagree, it's hard to be super partisan when one of the giants of your profession dies. RIP.</comment>

<comment>You're an axxhole.</comment>

<comment>Oh this should be interesting. How is that?</comment>

<comment>You think that your smart!</comment>

<comment>Well, I am. So there's that. </comment>

<comment>I think they mean your writing dominate for dominant.</comment>

<comment>Because I have respect for someone I disagree with?</comment>

<comment>So if you were a stand up comedy student, you'd be okay with Cosby raping all those women, because of his contributions to the world of comedy?</comment>

<comment>Jesus. That was offensive on many levels. What an absolutely awful comparison. Cosby is a serial sexual predator whereas Scalia is a conservative judge who was respected by lots of lawyers and judges (including liberals). Ginsburg was his best friend on the court! Elena Kagan went hunting with him on occasion. And in case you didn't notice, unlike rape, there are actually cogent arguments supporting Scalia's judicial philosophy that is supported by much of the legal community, even though I think on balance it is wrong. We're supposed to "disagree agreeably" in law you know!</comment>

<comment>They can't out argue him so they demonize him.It's like how they shout down and try to suppress the opinions of their opponents.  Remember Citizens United was about Hillary trying to suppress a movie about herself.</comment>

<comment>as to scalia, i am sorry to read of his death as a human being. but as a supreme court justice, i'm glad that he is gone because he has done so much damage to civil rights during his time on the court.it now becomes even more important that bernie sanders get elected the next president (as though it weren't important enough already). that said, i think that president obama should still send a nominee.</comment>

<comment>I agree with the first part.I have sympathy for his family.But Fluck him!</comment>

<comment>i guess i can't help but feel sorry that he died, i would have preferred that he resign, but i am so happy at the timing of this because it gives the president an opportunity to nominate another supreme court justice and let the republicans make even bigger fools of themselves. hopefully, when people see the circus in congress, it will make it virtually impossible for the republicans to take the white house and possible even cause them to lose the senate (hoping that they lose the house might be too much to expect, but i am still hopeful).</comment>

<comment>No, it now becomes even more important that any Republican not become elected the next president.</comment>

<comment>I haven't been this happy at the news of someone's death since...well, forever.It probably makes me a bad person.  In my defense, the only way Scalia was going to leave the court was feet first.  So it's the Constitutions fault for making federal judgeships lifetime appointments, and Scalia's fault for not retiring sooner.The important thing is that I'm not a bad person.  Well, probably not.</comment>

<comment>i feel much the same way; there is a degree of happiness about this because of all of the damage that scalia has done.</comment>

<comment>Everyone should indulge in a bit of schadenfreude from time to time.  It was something of a surprise, though..I didn't think he was ever gonna die.</comment>

<comment>I hear you.  I thought the same mad scientist that made Cheney's robot parts did the same with Scalia.</comment>

<comment>It would be very entertaining if the Repubs stall the vote to post-Obama, and Bernie gets elected.</comment>

<comment>“The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,” the Kentucky Republican said in a statement. “Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.”The American people have a voice, and that voice is President Obama, who the majority of Americans elected twice, McConnell, you hypocritical little turdle faced fuckhole.</comment>

<comment>In other words, "I should have the voice in the next selection...".</comment>

<comment>Well said Robert!  McConnell needs term limits.</comment>

<comment>Right - the American people voted for a president, who should nominate a candidate. And the Congress should then voted on the nomination.  Why would the government do nothing for A YEAR?</comment>

<comment>Well, to be fair, they haven't done anything for the last 7 years, so maybe they've got it down to an art....</comment>

<comment>Obamacare is not nothing.</comment>

<comment>They will. Obama can nominate, and both Rubio and Cruz will then have to do something they hate. Show up and vote.</comment>

<comment>If anyone needed additional evidence that  McConnell is a platinum card-carrying jackass, this is it.</comment>

<comment>"shameful abdication of our constitutional responsibility." - The funnies Harry Reid quote I have ever heard.</comment>

<comment>Cons should work with Obama to replace as soon as possible. They might have a chance in the election, and the SC picks their man. That's really the only way a con will win.</comment>

<comment>Yo Clarence.......tick-tock, muthafucka.</comment>

<comment>McConnell has already announced he won't allow an Obama  nominee to go forward.Clinton should suggest that she thinks Obama would make a great justice. Obama should suggest he'd accept. This would get Clinton many Sanders voters, while the GOP s obstruction would make it likely they'd lose the Senate. If you are McConnell, what would you rather face: Obama 's nominee, or Clinton with a Democratic senate?Scalia's death puts the GOP in a VERY tough spot.Scalia was a smart guy, though I usually disagreed with him he was mostly logical and well grounded, he kind of turned into cranky grandpa in the last five years. Sorry he's dead, not sorry he's off the court</comment>

<comment>A very sad day. He was the best. Big setback for Conservs but this will pull more independents now more than ever.RIP Scalia---thoughts and prayers are with his family.</comment>

<comment>He was scum.</comment>

<comment>Condolences to his family, but good riddance to bad rubbish.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like the Senate will provide voters with yet another example of how little Congress can get accomplished.  Let's see how that works out for them in the election ahead.</comment>

<comment>What is this congress that you speak of?</comment>

<comment>I suggest Obama nominate himself.</comment>

<comment>Hillary will nominate him.</comment>

<comment>It really would be an awesome development, wouldn't it? He is still young enough to make rulings for decades to come.</comment>

<comment>I think we'd get more entertainment value if Bernie nominated Bill Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Obama's already made it clear that he has no interest in serving on the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>His heart stopped out of shame!</comment>

<comment>I am reluctant to speak ill of the dead.  But let's not presume facts not in evidence.</comment>

<comment>Exactly- there is no evidence he possessed either a heart or shame.</comment>

<comment>He's loving this right now. He lived to be hated.</comment>

<comment>Aint that an accomplishment.A qualification?</comment>

<comment>But its true.</comment>

<comment>Or you, either, for that matter.</comment>

<comment>If I were President Obama, I would nominate a Court of Appeals judge who has been recently confirmed by the Senate unanimously.  If the Senate then abdicates its duty of advice and consent, a recess appointment would be entirely appropriate.</comment>

<comment>Sri Srinivasan comes to mind. He managed to get on the DC Circuit by a vote of 97-0 in 2013.</comment>

<comment>I don't know him. What is his record on the DC Circuit like?</comment>

<comment>He is one whom I thought of.  Also, Jane Louise Kelly of Iowa was confirmed to the Eight Circuit in 2013 by a vote of 96-0.If the President were looking for political advantage, he could nominate Kamala Harris, the Attorney General of California.  (She is currently running for the Democratic nomination for the sear that Senator Boxer is vacating, so she might not want to be nominated.)  She has sterling credentials, political acumen and electoral experience.  She is of Asian and Jamaican-American ancestry.  If confirmed, she would be the first Asian and the first black woman on the Court.  A Senator's vote against her, or a vote to deny her a vote, could carry a political price.</comment>

<comment>Kamala Harris is extremely liberal. So there would be no particular price to pay for a Republican to oppose her. It would be craftier if Obama appointed a moderate or even someone who leaned somewhat to the right; that would be harder for the Senate to oppose, and would still move the court considerably left, net-net.</comment>

<comment>Unless the Senate rejects the nomination, the President can make a recess appointment.  An ugly confirmation battle could motivate blacks and women to turn out to vote in 2008 levels, which will likely result in the election of a Democrat as President, along with shifting multiple Senate seats from Republican to Democratic.</comment>

<comment>You forget, the Senate is in GOP hands. There will be no debate, no vote unless Mitch McConnell says so.Seriously you think the lofo Obama base you're talking about even knows what the Supreme Court is?</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders. Two birds with one stone!</comment>

<comment>Nothing requires that a member of SCOTUS be law trained, but I doubt that President Obama would nominate a non-lawyer.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz does NOT love the US constitution if he thinks we should wait a year to appoint a justice.</comment>

<comment>Obama should appoint Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is a snake.  I like Trump.</comment>

<comment>He's our snake.</comment>

<comment>The Senate is free to reject a president's nomination. But to declare beforehand that no nomination will be considered, as McConnell has done, is to subvert the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>He only said 'should' not 'will'. He's a weasel. He'll cave and put it up for a vote. It won't get 60.</comment>

<comment>Shhh. Reince Priebus is mumbling something important.</comment>

<comment>To everyone here hating on Scalia:He's loving every word of it. Guaranteed. </comment>

<comment>He's dead</comment>

<comment>Good and dead!</comment>

<comment>It's pretty well established people don't feel much after they die.</comment>

<comment>How, pray, was it established?</comment>

<comment>When you poke 'em with something sharp, they don't react.</comment>

<comment>But they do flinch when you yell at them....unless...................OH NO........WE BURIED UNCLE PHILBERT ALIVE !!!</comment>

<comment>It happens.</comment>

<comment>Nobody denies that the body is dead. The open question is whether some other part of human existence survives.</comment>

<comment>And dead bodies don't feel much, which was the thrust of original comment.As to whether anything of our consciousness endures after the body dies, that's a question we'll all get answered when we die, I guess.</comment>

<comment>Why would that be open?</comment>

<comment>If you're very quiet and listen hard  you can actually hear Scalia screaming in Hell.</comment>

<comment>Do I?</comment>

<comment>He loved the mutilation of america while alive.Guaranteed.</comment>

<comment>Wonderful. He finally did something to bring this country together, not divide it. He died!</comment>

<comment>"Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement." - UnelecTed CruzWe OWE it to Scalia? Now seats on the Supreme Court are hereditary, and Justices have a "say" in their replacements? Nice try, UnelecTed.</comment>

<comment>You know how it is among the Teapubs. Dynasties are great...for Cons.</comment>

<comment>scalia was a gross hypocrite: when it was convenient to him, he proclaimed that the constitution should be interpreted *solely* based on the text of the document and that "intent" should be ignored. but when it came to issues that he didn't like; such as abortion or homosexuality; his basis of opposition was that the founding fathers never *intended* that these get protection under the constitution.</comment>

<comment>How exactly do you rule on the text alone, when there is no relevant text? What the hell is hypocritical about citing intent in such a case?</comment>

<comment>Whose intent?  Why do people pretend the Framers agreed with one another.  Read the debates among the different states or the Federalists v. anti-Federalists and then tell me whose intent we are to follow?  What did the Framers intend to do with respect to issues like nuclear energy or gene splicing?</comment>

<comment>In truth, he was a bit weird.Me being sorta a traditionalist, and finding change for change's sake distasteful and disruptive, he often ruled in favor of what I perceived to be the status quo--which is what I often favor for pragmatic reasons, and in doing so *sometimes* it seemed to me that he was a strict constructionist.But fairly often I found myself a bit queasy because I felt that there was a sort of moralistic agenda present--sorta gleeful about it, too. In these cases I feel that he departed from constructionism and just found a way to cleverly argue a decision the way he wanted it to come out.Of course, this makes him pretty much the same as maybe 80% of every Supreme Court justice who ever lived, I suppose.</comment>

<comment>Ding dong the witch is dead, the wicked witch, the wicked witch is dead. YAY!Ok do-nothing Republican Congress, let's see you do nothing for the remaining 342 days of President Obama's administration  in an election year with voters sick of Congress not working.Longest previous time choosing a Supreme court  nomination: 125 days.  </comment>

<comment>He loved being hated. Keep giving him what he wants.</comment>

<comment>Your mother is proud.</comment>

<comment>I love it too.</comment>

<comment>And we loved hating him, because he was scum.</comment>

<comment>You act like he didn't die...per the news, he did.</comment>

<comment>It must feel like crap to be you. Liberals are the most classless haters. I feel sorry for their misery. There are many of them.http://www.breitbart.com/big-g...</comment>

<comment>Fifty years ago, liberals like Hubert Humphrey were happy warriors. Now they are miserable haters. They had their "peak progressive" moment in 2009, are they any happier for it? Is the country any happier for it? No! I don't hear anybody running on "Four More Years!" Do you?So all liberals can do is find scapegoats to hate & blame.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. This shows their true colors. Such pitiful people.</comment>

<comment>Calling Liberals “classless haters” and then citing Breitbart....Onion material.  lol</comment>

<comment>Liberals are Evil people. </comment>

<comment>Who won your wars, brought you civilization usually over the obstruction of republicofascists.  Your present ideology mirrors our WWII enemies.</comment>

<comment>Then why do hardworking liberals in blue states pay so much to support the lazy conservatives in red states? If the wingnuts are so dead set against government aid and "free stuff" why do they beg for so much of it?</comment>

<comment>Enjoy your two-day weekend...</comment>

<comment>How so? I'm making $$ while I'm on hold with Intuit software while sitting on my sofa texting you. </comment>

<comment>See my previous reply.</comment>

<comment>About a 2 day weekend? I don't get it.</comment>

<comment>Clearly.The reason we have a two-day weekend is that unions fought for it.</comment>

<comment>Ok I did not know. Go unions!</comment>

<comment>Rejoicing over a good man's death is the sign of a classless hater if ever there was one.</comment>

<comment>Well, we'll see the tables turn when Stevens or Ginsburg pass I suppose. </comment>

<comment>I don't think you would see nearly as much classless cheering a death in that case.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. You would. </comment>

<comment>If Scalia had been a good man that would be on point.  He was scum.</comment>

<comment>Scalia died at a gay amyl-nitrate sex party. The last words he heard was Chris Christie saying, "you ain't going to sit (sic) right for a week."You're okay with Trump just making things up, being disrespectful, then welcome to the future where the disrespectful story trumps the truth.</comment>

<comment>What? Link please. Are you kidding?</comment>

<comment>Sarah, no one cares about the truth anymore. Follow Trumps Republican party lead, make up your own facts. </comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz proves he hates the constitution.  What a snake.</comment>

<comment>Ding, Dong the witch is dead, the witch is dead the witch is dead, Ding, Dong the wicked witch is dead!  What a week! The Bundyhole militia goes down, Cloven Bundy himself is finally imprisoned and now this!  The fates are truly liberal this week!</comment>

<comment>President Obama should withhold any nominations until January 19, 2017, then appoint himself to the Supreme Court. Screw the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Perfect!</comment>

<comment>Um, confirmation by the Senate is required, remember?Maybe Obama will just declare himself a god on the way out, after he's done selling a thousand pardons.</comment>

<comment>Bitter? Of course you are. You a Con. Its in the name.</comment>

<comment>Obama should appoint himself and let Biden finish his term.</comment>

<comment>Harriet Meyer for SC, lol</comment>

<comment>43 had to go and prove he was a nitwit.</comment>

<comment>I'm waiting for Sarah Palin to announce her candidacy for the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>She'd just quit after two years.</comment>

<comment>I fear the stache man!</comment>

<comment>I hate to speak ill of the dead, unless they were a gigantic asswipe.</comment>

<comment>Scalia's hunting trip was no doubt payed for by some right wing think tank, the Koch brothers or other scum sucking corporate pigs.</comment>

<comment>We need to find out where Cheney was last night.</comment>

<comment>I thought of that too, but so far, no indication he was shot in the face.</comment>

<comment>Wonder how many people he's offed that we don't even know about.</comment>

<comment>Well, if you start just with the mideast, its in the hundreds of thousands.</comment>

<comment>He probably wears some kind of ninja outfit when he prowls around at night.</comment>

<comment>Please. I have no stomach for thinking about what Cheney wears at night...Yewh.</comment>

<comment>He probably has them made extra fancy so his daughter thinks he's sexy.</comment>

<comment>Not Listening..Not Listening (fingers in ears).Double Yewh</comment>

<comment>Good riddance, eh?</comment>

<comment>Over/under that obo pushes a new york/california liberal?Over/under that the GOP enables it.</comment>

<comment>Preview of Trump's position for the debate." I will nominate a yuuuge and beautiful nominee."</comment>

<comment>the Trump tags the poo...He's that smart.</comment>

<comment>Uh, Mr. McConnell -- the American people DO have a voice in the selection of a new justice. We elected Obama for that purpose! Twice! And besides, be careful what you wish for -- if that seat remains open for the 2016 election, Dems and Indies are going to vote in DROVES! You know what that means for the Republican Senate, don't you?</comment>

<comment>It means they will filibuster until a Republican is in the White House or hell freezes over, whichever comes first.</comment>

<comment>They will absolutely lose the senate.</comment>

<comment>My sympathy to Mrs. Maureen Scalia and their nine children. May he rest in peace and thank you Justice Scalia for your service to our country.*************************************************************************************************************************As this news breaks, many Republican pundits and politicians are suggesting delaying the nomination and confirmation of the replacement for Justice Scalia. This is a double edged sword for the Republican Party. If they refuse to have a confirmation hearing they are basically handing the Democratic Party an issue that they will use as an election issue. It will really be an incredible stupid maneuver if Trump or Cruz is the nominee.Basically, this is a lose lose issue for the Republican Party. If they have a nomination and confirm that nomination, President Obama wins.If they refuse to uphold their Constitutional duties and refuse to engage in the nomination process, the Democratic nominee wins.Everyone is going to use the death of Justice Scalia, Republicans and Democrats, but the Democrats hold the moral high ground on this issue.Republicans, proceed at your own risk.</comment>

<comment>Several Republican members of the Senate are running for re-election in states that twice voted to elect President Obama.  If those Senators abdicate their duty to advise and consent, that will likely bite them in November.</comment>

<comment>Seven. And the Dems only need to pick up five seats to retake the majority.</comment>

<comment>Right.  Or four Senate seats plus the Vice-Presidency.</comment>

<comment>An understatement. There goes McConnell's reflexive empty threat.</comment>

<comment>If there was anyone left with any sense, they'd quietly pummel McConnell into a coma and then insist on a quick, quiet confirmation of anyone short of an out-and-out whackdoodle so that voters have time to forget the whole thing before the election. If they confirm someone more liberal than they want, they could at least claim that they were "forced" into it by that evil Obama, who knew that SCOTUS is so important that they couldn't leave a seat vacant so long. If they raise too big a stink, they risk being beat to death with their own obstructionism.</comment>

<comment>Their hardcore have already predicted that McConnell and Co. will cave and are already screaming for their heads.</comment>

<comment>What the republicans really want, IMO, is if they can win/steal the election, is to confirm another young far rrrightwinger, like Roberts, Thomas or Scalia that will be on the court for decades, just like Scalia was.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans should be hoping for a liberal nominee, they can slow walk the confirmation process, suck Hillary into the issues, tie up Washington all summer and vote down the nominee in the fall.A non-liberal would be tougher to manage but could still be stalled.McConnell should not have said anything right now.</comment>

<comment>I tend to agree with you. But McConnell is a calculating and wily obstructionist.  He might hold several hearings with long delays in between. And then he might blame not having a vote on a 'hold' by Cruz or some other 'unknown' Senator. To defeat a hold would require a successful cloture vote which is highly unlikely. And so he could run out the clock while minimizing blowback. In any event this is going to be a big campaign issue now matter how it plays out.</comment>

<comment>Justice Scalia was the first member of the Court of Italian ancestry.  If President Obama were to follow the ethnicity uber alles example of President George H. W. Bush when Justice Thurgood Marshall retired, then perhaps he should nominate Joe Pesci.Nothing requires that a member of SCOTUS have a legal education or a background in law.  Under the precedent I referenced, the successor's being fit to carry his predecessor's briefcase is disqualifying.  And Pesci did a great job playing the title role in My Cousin Vinnie.</comment>

<comment>Marisa Tomei would get more votes</comment>

<comment>She gets mine, what a babe.</comment>

<comment>A hot patootie!</comment>

<comment>Hot Italian babes are their saving grace.</comment>

<comment>"...of the Court of Italian ancestry."Of perverted mustache ancestry.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, the nomination of Alito doubled up the Italian quotient. What is actually missing from the court is a Protestant, a non-Judeo-Christian believer, a non-believer, or some believer of a different religion.</comment>

<comment>They need a Latino. Let's see the Republicans refuse one in an election year!</comment>

<comment>I can replace him. I don't care about past decisions either, unless I like them.</comment>

<comment>Sad day for Italian restaurants in DC.  Cutbacks loom large.</comment>
