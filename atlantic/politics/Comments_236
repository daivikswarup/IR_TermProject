<comment>I can't wait until this country is run by serious people like Rubio, Haley, and Ryan.</comment>

<comment>Do you mean the Gang of Eight?</comment>

<comment>If the Republicans do win the White House I would surely prefer Rubio to Trump & Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Author Michelle Cottle doesn't seem to get it."Ryan is far from the only conservative aware of the movementâ€™s image problem," she writes, but it's Ryan himself who's responsible for much of the Republican Party's current image problem among its base -- and for the voter rebellion that's given rise to Cruz, Trump and Carson.Like Boehner before him, Ryan is more interested in cutting cigar-puffing, back-slapping budget deals with Harry Reid than in using the power of the purse to nudge the country in a different direction.That's why Ryan isn't regarded as a conservative anywhere except Washington, home of a GOP establishment that would rather see a Democrat take the White House than lose its ability to continue doing business as usual with the donor class.</comment>

<comment> That masters student's heart just grew 3 times more liberal that day. Conservatives would have a lot more supporters in academia if they supported academics. Especially historians who can create narratives and are usually amiable to conservative beliefs.</comment>

<comment>"Conservatives would have a lot more supporters in academia if they supported academics."Tough call. After all, if you embrace facts and intellectual pursuits based thereon, you can't sell falsehoods and embrace the financial pursuits they open up.  With less than a third of our citizens having completed their education, being anti-intellectual sells.I did chuckle at the bottom line of the answers given:  "It's your fault."  How hard would it have been to serve up a con talking point instead?  You know, maybe something about how getting the feds out of education would open up more teaching jobs or, at least, a stab at how one Obama's out of office the economy will again prosper?  Hell, even a good, old fashioned, "Our schools, our children, and our future, depends upon conservative thinkers like you taking their place in academia."  It's not that hard to not be a dick - or, perhaps, simply pretend to be less proud of it.</comment>

<comment>What do you consider having 'completed their education' to be? Does everyone need a Masters degree?</comment>

<comment>College degree.</comment>

<comment>It's not being a dick (or anti-intellectual) to say you shouldn't take on a load of debt to learn something that isn't useful to repaying that debt.Sure, you get a college degree, but that's a network and a piece of paper.I think that's more intellectual than not.</comment>

<comment>Funny, the kid didn't mention debt."[Y]ou get a college degree, but that's a network and a piece of paper."It's also basically become a minimum requirement for most decent employment.On a related note, pushing students into STEM degrees is already beginning to create a dearth of jobs in that area.  It's the last thing an undecided high school student should be contemplating.</comment>

<comment>There's nothing wrong with steering the non-academically inclined into vocational training.</comment>

<comment>But the kid who asked the question had just completed a master's. He IS academically inclined--and shouldn't be going back to school for a vocational degree.However, I strongly agree that vocational ed is important and deserves more respect. At the same time, we need to STOP treating college degrees as if they were vocational training. Because they are not.Any liberal arts degree (from history to physics to psychology) should indicate to employers that that you have:1. Critical thinking, research, and writing skills.2. The ability to follow directions.3. Willingness to work several years to achieve long-term goals.4. The skills to solve problems and work your way through bureaucratic processes.All of which is key to any office job. This is why so many ads say "college degree required." The more specific stuff you're going to have to learn on the job anyway.</comment>

<comment>I agree completely. Critical thinking is disappearing in American society and that is not good news.</comment>

<comment>I don't think either party has good or easy answers for this young man, I do believe that the Dems are at least interested in trying to find some solutions.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but I don't think we should be labeling over two-thirds of our population as non-academically inclined.  If that is the true percentage so afflicted, we need to reconsider this whole voting thing.</comment>

<comment>Colleges - thanks to government subsidies that have interrupted price discovery - have raised prices at 2x inflation for 35+ years.  And, if this weren't enough, they admit every-increasing numbers of foreign students (who pay full price) while cutting back on full term professors.Meanwhile, they have put in place blatantly anti-Constitutional measures such as putting in place speech codes or watering down due process for alleged sex crimes.Yep - sounds like the left has destroyed yet another formerly-great institution.</comment>

<comment>Aww.  Too many thin envelopes?</comment>

<comment>Um, what?</comment>

<comment>You are a blithering, willfully ignorant, right wing idiot.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Got nothing except lazy ad-hom do ya?</comment>

<comment>I agree that many of the current developments in higher ed are pretty negative. However, not all can be blamed on "the left."The ridiculous policy of government supporting student loans is a rip off and should be eliminated. It has led to price gouging and featherbedding, just as you indicated. If we want to help students pay for school (and it makes sense for us to help poor but capable students who would not otherwise have the chance), then the government should just give them whatever amount lawmakers decide is appropriate (as in the old Pell Grant system).Many of the other bad developments, however, have their roots in right-wing calls to "run school like a business." This has led to an arms race in fancy dorms and student accommodations, growing enrollment of high-tuition foreign students, an ever-rising reliance on part-time faculty, and bloated administrations mostly devoted to fundraising and PR. None of these innovations has helped the core "business" of colleges: educating students.All of these trends are bad news. And there is plenty of blame for both Left and Right to share. Much more important than blame, would be for lawmakers, parents, and students to push for changes that will end these distractions and re-focus schools giving students an education, rather than a mountain of debt.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it's very hard not to be a dick, for some people.Some folks just cannot resist the temptation to strike a pose in front of a group of their peers, or any audience. I submit if it was easy not to be a dick, then Fred Barnes would have taken that path. I further submit that it takes self control and a willingness to put one's own self interest (making a point in from of this audience) aside and giving the young person a useful answer.</comment>

<comment>What kind of job program do you propose for the young man?  The GOP is against redundant government jobs.  They should be.</comment>

<comment>It's part of the conservative meme going around these days, that 'if we kill off the social sciences and the arts it'll destroy the left.'It's rather silly actually: There are large numbers of left-wingers in science, engineering and medicine.</comment>

<comment>I have a M.S. in atmospheric physics and an M.B.A.  Add me to your left leaning scientists.  And, I can confirm in my office that there are multiple holders of scientific Ph.Ds who are Democrats.</comment>

<comment>B. Civil Eng, and amateur astronomer.</comment>

<comment>Well they don't have a lot of time for science either. It's scientists coming up with all those pesky regulations that the bureaucracy is pushing.</comment>

<comment>Those would the "experts" whose "rule" made the lawmakers in the article so angry.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>And quite a few who never went to college, but instead work in blue collar fields. Remember labor unions (there are still some left).</comment>

<comment>His parents are also to blame.</comment>

<comment>Isn't Heritage the organization that's starting to raise accusations about Trump's violations of campaign spending laws based?</comment>

<comment>Isn't Heritage the organisation that wrote the Affordable Care Act?</comment>

<comment>Yes but not this iteration of it. Jim Demint wouldn't ever have proposed anything like the ACA. Some of the conservative think tanks used to have decent ideas.</comment>

<comment>There are 3 types of Republicans :conservatives, the so-called serious types (a la Romney and Ryan); reactionaries who aren't the least bit conservatives, just destructive (Gowdy and Inhofe come to mind); and finally the resentful populists like Trump. So in effect the conservatives are a minority expecting the rest to come to heel. Hmmmmm, like aristocracy telling the hoi polloi what is really good for them</comment>

<comment>The GOP race is between two factions.  Rubio is the champion of one faction, the fanatical open borders faction.  Rubio is a puppet and will do the bidding of the donor class establishment. He is a seal trained to bark the open borders mantra. The other faction is the anti-open border faction represented by the extreme ideologue Canadian, Ted Cruz, and the moderate, Donald Trump.</comment>

<comment>"the fanatical open borders faction"Dude...there are no fanatical open borders supporters in either party. There are fanatical deport all undocumented immigrants and shut the country down supporters like yourself.</comment>

<comment>"Shut this country down" -- it's the fear of getting blamed for such a thing that's turned McConnell, Ryan and before that, Boehner into weak-kneed, go-along-to-get-along types who'd rather cut an omnibus deal with Harry Reid than use the power of the purse to take this country in a different direction.And of course there are open-borders supporters -- in both parties. The Democrats welcome illegals because they tend to pull the "D" lever, and the Republican establishment welcomes illegals because they provide cheap labor.Why do you think the GOP establishment wing -- best represented by Â¡Jeb! -- is taking a beating at the hands of the anti-establishment candidates? Because Ryan, McConnell & Friends are regarded as sellouts by the majority of voters who put them in office. </comment>

<comment>The last time I checked, illegal immigrant didn't get to vote. So they can't "pull the D lever."Naturalized citizens are a different story.</comment>

<comment>Of course illegals aren't supposed to vote, but as this Washington Post story notes: "Most non-citizens do not register, let alone vote. But enough do that their participation can change the outcome of close races."https://www.washingtonpost.com...At any rate, I was making the shorthand point that the majority of illegals tend to vote Democrat when given what Ted Kennedy once touted as a "pahhhth to citizenship."</comment>

<comment>That is three. You just said so.</comment>

<comment>Marco Rubio is memorizing all of his responses for the debate tonight.  If he turns too far around you might be able to see the wind-up knob sticking out of his back. He is a Ken doll.  </comment>

<comment>I don't think he can win a 1-on-1 debate against Clinton.  But, I'm also not sure how many votes would be swayed.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that the GOP has a very big political fissure that can't easily be papered over, i.e. between its culturally liberal pro-business wing, and its culturally conservative working class wing (i.e. the Tea Party).</comment>

<comment>Never thought I'd live to see a conservative denigrate the study of US history as worthless.</comment>

<comment>Knowing that the Second Amendment was added to the Constitution is all the US history one needs to know. Well, that and that the North invaded the Confederacy under false pretenses.</comment>

<comment>What would a "jobs program" look like for this young man?</comment>

<comment>He could teach. He could archive. He could use his research skills towards more practical ends. He could help with restoration and renewal of historic neighborhoods, which would incidentally be a lot work for the folks doing the sanding, repairing, painting, clearing, and so on. I'd love to see that in many old neighborhoods in many cities I've passed through. They are gorgeous, they don't make neighborhoods like that anymore, a little elbow grease would let the beauty shine through. If I ever become a billionaire....</comment>

<comment>Yes.  He could teach.  So what the phug did his question mean?</comment>

<comment>Dunno, was addressing the question above. The guy himself needs to get his own mind straight if he wants a job. Nothing wrong with being educated, but it's no guarantee of a living.</comment>

<comment>I don't know that he was asking for a "jobs program' in the sense of the WPA and making jobs by direct government fiat. I think he was asking what sorts of GOP policies might improve the job situation in general for young people starting out. Which is a good question, since we are seeing a "recovery" without enough "entry level" jobs. There are lots of "internships" for young people to essentially donate labor to big businesses, but not so many for graduates looking to start a career.Since "the economy" is supposed to be one leg of the GOP "3-legged stool," his question seemed a fair one. The response did not indicate that the lawmakers had any answers they felt confident would help.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately the only support given to the economy by the GOP seems to be the 'Free Market" mantra, which if uncontrolled, has the same results as a car with no brakes and no driver going down Lombard Street in San Francisco.</comment>

<comment>The CEO of the 15 million a year consulting group I used to work for has a masters in theology. All those engineers in Silicon Valley have to design products that fit inside a cultural milleau.</comment>

<comment>I ran a weapons development program for the military. My lead finance guyâ€™s degrees were in theology and my lead weapons effectiveness analyst was a former nun, also with degrees in theology.I never had the courage to ask them how they ended up doing what they were.</comment>

<comment>Time is linear, memory is a stranger, history is for fools, man is a tool in the hands of the great God Almighty</comment>

<comment>You haven't lived to see it. These people denigrating the history degree are Freedumb reactionaries. True Consevatives are all but extinct in today's Repuplican party.</comment>

<comment>I would't say they're extinct, but they are hibernating, awaiting the return of the true spring, when compromise and moderate are no longer curse words to their party.</comment>

<comment>I do cntrl+F "immi" and get nothing, this article is worthless.  That is the single biggest divide between cheep labor obsessed establishment, and rank and file.</comment>

<comment>Glad you got home safely from the Land of Conservatism, Michelle, so that you could file this report to describe and explicate the strange and exotic natives to Atlantic's whitebread liberal readership.</comment>

<comment>This is a perfect time to finally have a third party.  The Republican party no longer exists as a single entity.  It is clearly comprised of two distinctly different sets of people with different agendas.</comment>

<comment>Don't be so sure of that . I think they will all fall in line and support whomever is nominated . To not do so means certain defeat to Hillary .</comment>

<comment>Conservatives trying to define conservatism so they can out conservative one another. Fascinating.Other than cutting funding for poor people, cutting the regulations that make products and workplaces safer, and the air and water (except in Flint) a bit cleaner, bombing the crap out of people, and cutting taxes on the rich, are there any actual sensible ideas that would make life in general for Americans a bit better?</comment>

<comment>That's establishment conservatives, best exemplified by Marco Rubio, we rank and file are done with that.  You got a similar fight on your side buddy, between your establishment that wants the rubes riled up every 4 years by gay marriage/abortion/welfare/open borders/easy on crime, etc, and once the elections are over go back to being a call girl for richest Americans and wall street, and good ol Bernie who is disrupting the apple cart.  In an election between Sanders and Rubio, I might actually vote for Sanders!</comment>

<comment>So what is it in your life that makes you so upset you want to risk the future on a Trump or Bernie Sanders? No job? Lost your home? Living under a bridge? What drives your frustration?</comment>

<comment>I am in >1% now, but have spent time in 50%, want to rid the American system of corruption that establishment of both parties are so invested in.</comment>

<comment>So you are in the upper 1%, yet consider yourself rank and file? And you don't see any contradiction in your wanting to overturn the system that allowed you to rise to the upper 1%?Can you get yourself tested on an irony meter?</comment>

<comment>I ant to keep the system that allowed me, a kid from middle class from middle of the country to get to 1%.  Irony is on you buddy.</comment>

<comment>OK. I don't know how old you are. But our system has hardly changed at all over the last 35 years. We spend the same 21% of GDP on government we do now as we did then.Again, what is your complaint?</comment>

<comment>Median family income has not changed since 1989, when I came to this country, that in nutshell is the problem.  For people in government (which I believe you have been), that has not been the problem , but for vast majority of people who toil in pvt sector, that's a killer.  From your side the only solution is to raise min wage, which while being a good thing for people at bottom of society does nothing for somene making $22/hr, which is the avg wage in US.</comment>

<comment>Raising the minimum wage wold help not only those at the minimum. nut also those within 25% of it.And its not the only solution. We need to make it easier to form and keep unions to give workers bargaining power.We can't have Republican economics and Democratic wage gains. We have to choose.</comment>

<comment>Bernie and Hillary just had a debate where they tried to out-progressive each other.But, that's different, right?</comment>

<comment>Yep. It is different. Hillary is a mainstream, left of center Democrat who has a clear lead but has to temporarily lean a bit further left to protect her flank from Bernie. On the Republican side the only right of center mainstream candidates, Kasich and Christie, are buried at the bottom and a bunch of right wing nut cases are in the lead.</comment>

<comment>You have an elderly socialist who is getting 50% of the white Democratic vote.  That's different right?</comment>

<comment>Democrats do have a choice of a neoliberal progressive or a democratic socialist.I'm not even sure what Cruz stands for, except default.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. Because that amounts to around 30% of the total Democratic vote. If he and 2 other socialists were getting 90% of the vote it would be similar to what you guys are doing.</comment>

<comment>Well - the Republicans decided to have a competitive election.  Let's see what happens when the field clears.I think it's funny that HRC's pitch to minority voters is that Bernie's a racist or something.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. 17 of them decided to run and 16 ran as far as they could to the right side of the boat.Hils pitch is Hil.</comment>

<comment>You dont seem too smart there buddy, any chance you can speak in any terms other than ignorant platitudes?Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Any chance you offer something other than lazy, substance-free insults?</comment>

<comment>Good job dean you managed to cover almost every worn out leftist BS  talking point all in one paragraph.</comment>

<comment>Oh I think I left out a lot. But I was being nice.</comment>

<comment>The folks who should be really, really worried about a total conservative sweep of the House, Senate, and White House are conservatives and their right-wing media. There goes their livings. What are the AM talk jocks and Fox News hosts and right-wing web sites and conservative authors and columnists going to gripe and gripe and gripe and fume about and sell books to the True Believers when they're the ones agreeing with their conservative heroes who have been tasked with actually governing? I suppose they all could move even further right so they could complain that all the elected GOP members are RINOs, but just how far can they push the GOP base before it falls off the edge of the flat Earth the base already believes exists?</comment>

<comment>It's turtles, all the way down.</comment>

<comment>Thank you, Stephen Hawking :>)</comment>

<comment>They can't stand the jobs expansion and the unemployment rate.  That was their biggest overt complaint about our President- that he spends too much (that the House gave him to spend) and that unemployment hasn't been this low for 20 years and wages are starting to come up.They will be hating the President forever it seems, even though the President has been pretty fair and hardly as obstructive to their ideas as they are to his.</comment>

<comment>Paul Ryan and his ilk use the word conservative like it actually means something grandiose. All it means in reality is that they want to conserve the status quo where their old failed policies that have never worked before are now being thrown out there during this election cycle as their brand 'new' message. The candidates are running on bashing President Obama and Hillary Clinton. That is what passes as a brand new message in their mind as they have no real solutions to how they would run the country apart from into the ground of course.</comment>

<comment>Blah Blah Blah ....</comment>

<comment>You seem to have used blah blah blah before if I'm not mistaken.  Are those four letters the only ones left working on the keyboard? Might be time for a new one.</comment>

<comment>No annie it is a response to your endless droning blathering you do daily .It is what I hear from you each day you come one here to make an ass of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Well if what  I say annoys you that's too bad. Others agree with me. So all you have to do is ignore me. I can ignore you just as easily.</comment>

<comment>You don't annoy me annie you amaze me at what a mindless lemming  you are repeating each day stupid stuff about how much you hate republicans . If you wish to make a fool of yourself each day go right ahead.;)</comment>

<comment>My answer to that is simple. If you don't like my comments don't read them no one is forcing you to.</comment>

<comment>My answer to you is the same . If you want to be a mindless moron keep it up you are well on your way already ;)</comment>

<comment>The difference between us is that I don't feel the need to call anyone names. You apparently do.  I have far more class than to engage in name calling.</comment>

<comment>Oh BS you have called the Republicans all kinds of names . What a lying hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>Go back and check to see where I have called you personally or anyone else a name on here!  That's what I mean. Whereas you personally attack someone. I don't as I said I have far too much class to do that.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't like me either.  I think he's angry at being a Republican, which is nearly as common as being an angry Republican.</comment>

<comment>It sure seems like.</comment>

<comment>The cognitive dissonance has risen to the level of schadenfreude. Paul Ryan is frantically promoting a "bold, pro-growth agenda," which in fact exists only Ryan's fever dreams. The pushback is rapidly rising to Boehner territory, leaving one to conclude that the GOP wants to do so many irrational things that they're more than willing to risk losing not only the presidency but the Senate and the House too.  </comment>

<comment>The GOP doesnt have a single policy or position that is either constitutional or good for any segment of the country other than the most wealthy.  They are liars and hypocrites, stating concern for deficits and total debt while refusing to agree to the tax increases among the wealthy and corporations needed to bring our finances in line.  Yes, I agree that we as a nation need to overhaul and simplify our tax code, but we also cannot allow the tens of thousands of people earning over $1 million a year that currently escape all taxes to do so, nor to allow the largest and wealthiest corporations to avoid all taxes.  We need to look at what is deductible, what our receipts are and what sorts of things we are going to allow to be tax incentivized.The Republicans have no real ideas, just a long list of things they are against and which to destroy without any regard to the consequences.  Idiots of the GOP actually suggest decreasing funding for the IRS rather than increasing funding, which in turn brings $6 back to the government in increased funding in terms of catching fraud and under-reporting.  I have yet to have heard a sane Republican in office since Olympia Snowe left and a sane GOP presidential candidate since Bob Dole.  Until the GOP can provide answers to real problems, they will never again occupy the White House.  Fortunately it will be a drat that wins this year and that will get to appoint 2-4 Supreme Court justices, which is the most important thing we are voting for this year.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Rich guy retires and buys $20M worth of muni bonds paying him 2% tax free.Another rich guy retires and buys $20M in MLPs paying him 12%, which is taxed.Warren Buffett buys KO in 1975, never sells it but then gifts it to the Gates Foundation.GE loses billions in their finance unit and doesn't pay taxes until their NOL runs out.You don't understand any of this, do you?</comment>

<comment>When are these "conservatives" going to come out of the closet and voice their support for Hillary?  She is the closest candidate to their neoconservative views that actually has a chance of winning.  I figure it will be in the general election after the establishment stooges(Bush, Rubio) are gone and it's Cruz/Trump.</comment>

<comment>Can anybody provide proof of cons being strong on defense, economy, or social issues? I can't seem to find any, and I suspect it is the reason why the PrimaDonald became so popular. </comment>

<comment>They are to an extent mutually exclusive IMOSpending on defense has terrible economic multipliers, so high defense spending results in an underperforming economy.Social issues is code for "we want women and minorities to go back where they belong and let the old fat white christian males run things".  (I'm jesting a bit with the quote but not as much as I'd like to be).  You can't have a world class economy by excluding so many from full participation in it.</comment>

Here are some history majors of note:Newt Gingrich, FDR, Richard Nixon, George W Bush, Henry Kissinger, Joe Biden, John Kennedy (more or less), Winston Churchill, Elena Kagan, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Charlie Rose, Wolf Blitzer, Bill Oâ€™Reilly, Ray Suarez, Chris Hughes (Facebook), Samuel Palmisano (IBM Corporation),Carly Fiorina (Hewlett-Packard), Richard B.

<comment>Point 8, wow just wow.  I really do not know what to say, and I wanted to say that I really do not know what to say.  To say that the conservative pitch to the younger gen (myself) needs work is a dramatic understatement.  If such trends continue, conservatives will lose a generation, and after hearing point 8 I hope exactly that happens.</comment>

<comment>Groot believe days of "conservatives" are done.Groot think people becoming radicalized.Groot happy. Groot look forward to seeing leftists hang from lightposts.</comment>

<comment>Meh, 'conservative' is just a brand name anyway.  It really doesn't mean anything specific.  Once it mean 'isolationist', now it mean 'interventional'.  They call themselves 'family friendly', but are specifically against virtually all real 'family friendly' policies like daycare, paid maternity leave and instead they are against creating 'non traditional families'.   Whenever they talk about 'personal responsibility' they are always pointing at other people.What defines a 'conservative' is as fluid as the conversation on right wing media and has nothing to do with demonstrative goal, but instead is driven by a form of 'hate porn' which creates their ratings.</comment>

<comment>The descriptive term for the current GOP is REACTIONARIES.</comment>

<comment>To be sure, there are parts of the conservative coalition that I despise, such as Trump's racist demagoguery or Tea Party know-nothingness.  The GOP, as we know, has dug itself into a deep hole with promises its leaders knew they could never keep, hence their rage.  They stand on the cusp of what could be historic losses, which we regard with glee.However, we need to somehow recognize their views as legitimate.  The conservatives represent a huge part of the American electorate, up to 40% or more of it.  We must find a way to compromise and re-build the consensus.  If we don't, it will just be more gridlock - which will damage and perhaps even destroy our institutions.</comment>
