<comment>This is a good, thought provoking article.People, Homo not-so sapiens, are basically innumerate and regularly not rational. I have been accused by some Disqus commenters of being disparaging of voters (really people generally, the common man), incorrectly IMO. As a skeptical empiricist (perhaps I’m just a contrarian) the facts are on my side.This Atlantic on-line article reads in part:"More than a third do not trust any major institution—elected officials, labor union, investment banks, major corporations, national banks—to make improvement in their lives."This is a rational position to take (as long as ‘not trust’ doesn’t automatically mean they’re wrong all of the time about everything, and that they’re just and only about taking advantage of me). However, the article goes on to state:“The only person that I can trust with my money is me … I feel that people as a whole would better invest their money for their own benefit.”And this is not a balanced rational position to take.There are two different issues in play. One is feelings – gut instinct, System 1 cognition: automatic, easy, fast & dirty, and so our default way of 'thinking' – and the other is logical probabilistic thinking – System 2 cognition: effortful, fatiguing, easily derailed and so uncommon. All people, all of us individually, use both in relatively equal proportion being mostly System 1 (>95 :<5 as a WAG). There are not rational people and emotional people, just people who are mostly emotional and sometime rational.Embrace doubt. The starting point – the necessary prerequisite – for rational thought is to consciously question our feelings, to critically and skeptically question our slam dunk assumptions. Hold our feelings in abeyance. Conduct pre-mortems: assume we are wrong and construct logical narratives that support that assumption. Collect data that supports that (contra-feelings) narrative. Then return to your assumptions and explicitly state them in detail. Collect all relevant data that supports and that contradicts your assumptions. Combine all that data with the contra-feelings narrative data, and collect more data for context, only then guess/estimate/predict which is more likely correct.Other people can see our blind spots, our errors and omissions, better than we can. That is why open-minded argumentation is so valuable. It can be a source of great contra-feelings information. Snark, digression, insult, caricature, ad hominem, tu quoque, straw man, trolling et al is worthless for that purpose.</comment>

<comment>The answer is that many of America's major institutions have proved unworthy of public trust.The banks have screwed people over and had to be bailed put. Meanwhile, they use lobbyists, alongside so many other companies to prevent much needed regulations. The political system is largely bought and paid for by these lobbyists.With the exception of a few principled politicians (I sure hope that Sanders ends up being one), most have sold out for money and career ambitions. The economic and other rationalisations seem to be just a cover up for a new Gilded Age.Would someone mind telling me why anyone should trust these organizations? </comment>

<comment>All organizations, institutions and governing bodies need oversight and regulation to function fairly and effectively. And all individuals will benefit from supervision, constructive criticism, objective advise, and support.</comment>

<comment>We're all bound to be disappointed as long as we are looking to either the big corporations or big central government to solve all of our problems. It isn't going to happen. If there is to be a change for the better in this country, then we the people are going to have to make it happen ourselves, working from the grass roots up rather than waiting for the powers that be to bestow it to us from on high.To a large extent it is a matter of personal responsibility - both for oneself and for one's neighbors needing a hand so that they can help themselves. To a large extent, it is also a matter of us coming together in an organized effort in so many different ways. There are so many groups and organizations already doing good things in our local communities, regionally, nationally, and globally, and maybe there are some gaps that need to be filled with new efforts. Each of us can't do everything, but each of us can do something. Just consider this: as bad as you might think that things have become in this country, can you even begin to imagine how much worse they would be if we didn't have this marvelous, extensive network of voluntary organizations doing their myriad of good works?Don't wait for some big change from the top - you'll be waiting until the coffin lid closes. Get up, get involved, and do something now that will make a difference.</comment>

<comment>"Don't wait for some big change from the top"If you're going to maintain concern about the power of the big corporations and big government, then your only recourse is to pit the power of each of those against each other.  There's simply no way to do that with local, volunteer organizations - unless, they're get out the vote machines.</comment>

<comment>You seem to not realize that there is a certain subversiveness that is possible by turning our backs on both big corporations and big governments and taking our lives and our future into our own hands. Both the big government and the big corporate people want nothing more than for us to think that we are totally dependent upon them and can do nothing for ourselves apart from them. Demonstrating the opposite, even in small ways, is a VERY SUBVERSIVE act.</comment>

<comment>But what do you mean, specifically? Going "back to the land?" Homesteading? Living at the margins of the economy?First, that is never going to happen in mass, and second, the corporations would like nothing better if the more malcontents disappeared.The real problem is that, despite being nominally a democratic republic, we have not shaken the mentality that "government" is something imposed on us by force from the outside. We act as if our government is not in our hands but is instead just another dictatorship. And of course, by acting that way, we have enabled it to become that way.The reason we need government is that it's the only way of marshaling and channeling our collective efforts. We could have never built the US highway system or the Hoover Dam if all we had were neighborhood organizations.Just look, for example, at the differences between public transit in the New York metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. In New York, the boroughs have regional authorities. In SF, every tiny little town up and down the Peninsula is on its own.Public transit within San Francisco is very comprehensive. You can get from any point A to any point B on the bus and not have to walk more than 1/8 of a mile between transfer points. But if you need to go from city to city, there's no system. This city's transit system doesn't talk to that city's transit system. The routes don't intersect, and when they do, the schedules don't connect. A 15 mile trip can take two hours!</comment>

<comment>Lol, you give an example of government failure</comment>

<comment>Imagine how much better those public transit systems would be if they were owned and operated by and for the public directly - i.e., with a directly elected board of trustees - instead of being run by either the government (fed/state/local - whatever) or by corporations. The people who actually depend upon and benefit from these systems would have a direct say in how they were run, and where the balance between quality of service and cost of service would be struck.We Americans have been served up a steady dose of propaganda for most of the past century. That propaganda sells the lie that there two and only two possible ways that an economy can be organized: either state socialism (where the government owns and does everything) or corporate capitalism (where free markets are good and those dominated and controlled by large corporations do marvelously). It is all a big lie. The truth is that governments do a good job in providing public goods and corporations don't; public goods actually are good and we actually do need them to at least some extent. The truth is that private enterprise - a mix of large corporations, small family-owned businesses, freelancers, worker-owned enterprises, and cooperatives, all competing on a level playing field in a free market, with worker, consumer, public, and environmental safety all protected - is an elegant solution for the production and distribution of private goods, and do it much better than do state-owned enterprises. The truth is that there is another category of goods - toll goods (many of our energy, water, and communication utilities, transportation systems, health and education systems, and financial institutions could all fit in this category) - where neither corporations not the government operate these very well, and where public ownership under a directly-elected board of trustees or some form of cooperative structure would be the best means of combining  market feedback and voter feedback, assuring the best balance between quality of service and price. The same applies for common-pool goods like electromagnetic spectra and fisheries. What I have described could best be called a mixed economy - and a rationally-mixed one at that rather than a jumble of happenstance.Neither the big corporations nor big government would welcome a move in this direction, for the simple reason that both of them lose power. It requires exposing their propaganda as a lie. Transforming the US economic system into something that works better for all Americans requires going around and subverting both big corporations and big governments; there is no other way.</comment>

<comment>I honestly don't believe that would make a difference. The problem is that it requires an engaged citizenry. Athenian democracy worked because it required free male citizens (who mostly did not work) to spend their days arguing, debating, and voting at the Agora. Free males who did not fulfill this duty were ostracized as "idiots," that is, as men who were driven by their "id," by their selfish desires.Unfortunately, that is contrary to much of human nature. People are busy. People have to rush to work, drop off kids, pick up kids, rush home, make dinner, etc., etc. Ideally, we would have a block-to-block organization with precinct captain and a whole civil mobilization hierarchy, but imagine if you were forced to attend weekly block meetings and to volunteer for your precinct. That would be labeled Communism (and not unfairly, since that is how Communism often organizes itself).What we really need are trustworthy representatives. We need a set-it-and-forget-it political system. Politics simply cannot absorb the average person's daily life. And somehow, other developed nations accomplish that.The flaw in your platform, which I acknowledge is a thoughtful one, is that other developed nations don't have to resort to it to get good results. Why is it that we are stuck with political figures more corrupt than Mexican politicians? There's really no reason other than we have not put fear into our leaders' hearts. That's what other countries do. Fifty years go by, and when the rich start feeling untouchable, a revolution chops their heads off and they start again.I agree with you about the pernicious effects of the relentless neoliberal propaganda the wealthy have unleashed since Lewis Powell's 1971 "Memo to Conservatives," but I think the solution is better government, not less government.</comment>

<comment>For the record, I'm NOT anti-government. I favor a strong, activist government within the scope of providing public goods, provided only that it operates within the confines of what most would consider to be "good government" principles.Nor am I suggesting that direct participatory democracy is going to be a practical solution for any but the most small scale and local of activities. You are right, in most cases, people are going to need to elect competent people of character and entrust to them the responsibilities of day-to-day management of both government and cooperatively-owned enterprises.My point about having activities which provide toll goods or common-pool goods be owned by the public but not by the government is based upon two observations: 1) the regulation of economic activities to protect worker, consumer, and public safety, and to protect the environment, is a vitally important public good which the government should and must provide, but there is an inherent conflict of interest when the government tries to not only do this but also to own and operate these enterprises. Inevitably, the temptation to fudge on regulation in order to maximize profits or minimize user fees becomes irresistible to politicians. 2) Most economic enterprises outside the public goods sector must attempt to operate in a way that generates at least sustainable, if not maximized profits. However, providing a level of service that is in the best interests of the general public may very well not be the most profitable option. In order to balance these two imperatives in something close to an optimal manner, you really do need two feedback loops: the market-based economic feedback loop of profitability, and the voting-based political feedback loop of direct elections of trustees who are responsible just for the specific enterprise. Only by having both feedback loops is any sort of optimal balance between profitability and public service possible.</comment>

<comment>“There are four ways in which you can spend money. You can spend your own money on yourself. When you do that, why then you really watch out what you’re doing, and you try to get the most for your money. Then you can spend your own money on somebody else.  For example, I buy a birthday present for someone. Well, then I’m not so careful about the content of the present, but I’m very careful about the cost. Then, I can spend somebody else’s money on myself. And if I spend somebody else’s money on myself, then I’m sure going to have a good lunch! Finally, I can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else. And if I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get. And that’s government. And that’s close to 40% of our national income.”-Milton Friedman</comment>

<comment>Hasn't Friedman caused enough harm yet?</comment>

<comment>Can you provide an example of the harm he or his teachings have caused?</comment>

<comment>Well, his banging the supply-side drum in the Reagan White House has led to speeding up the demise of the middle class.  His watering down of fiduciary duty rules for corporate officers and directors into a business school shorthand ripe for abuse is a significant factor in the ever increasing wealth gap.</comment>

<comment>The middle class is not in demise, and the expansion under Reagan was the largest in the modern era.And "watering down fiduciary rules"? What sort of claptrap is that? We have a large wealth gap because we are a wealthy country. If and when we actually see people moving down the ladder in large numbers I will start to be concerned about the "gap".</comment>

<comment>We are seeing people moving down the ladder in large numbers. But may it's different on your planet.</comment>

<comment>More are moving up from the middle class than are moving down, by almost two to one.http://www.pewsocialtrends.org...</comment>

<comment>Carefully read the data in that Pew piece.  It paints a very different picture than you seem to think.By the way, I like how you didn't let knowing nothing about Milty's fiduciary duty opinions get in the way of your responding to the point.</comment>

<comment>No, the Pew data supports my view. Which part of this do you dispute:In at least one sense, the shift represents economic progress: While the share of U.S. adults living in both upper- and lower-income households rose alongside the declining share in the middle from 1971 to 2015, the share in the upper-income tier grew more.Further, i am making fun of you for your nonsensical belief that corporations and their officers have obligations beyond their fiduciary duty to their shareholders. </comment>

<comment>However, the share of the poor grew too and the middle class shrunk. Which I believe was the original point "...Reagan White House has led to speeding up the demise of the middle class," which you've contested.But don't let that stop you.Cheers!</comment>

<comment>When the middle class is shrinking because more people are moving into the upper class, that is a positive, not a negative. To argue otherwise ignores reality, and it definitely proves that the majority aren't being harmed by those that supported the policies of Milton Friedman.</comment>

<comment>It's still a demise of the middle class. Maybe the upper class isn't such a great thing. Plus you seem to ignore the fact that the lower class is growing too. Why is that?</comment>

<comment>The middle class has shrunk by 11%. That does not signal a "demise". Especially when 7% of those moved up in income and only 4% moved down.Should we worry about upward mobility and the ability for the poor to move to the middle class? Of course. But this data shows an overall positive trend.</comment>

<comment>Or is it the case that the best society (or even a decent society) is one of extremes, the rich and the poor and none between?Do tell...</comment>

<comment>No, the only thing you've done is expose further your lack of knowledge of the Corp. Laws.  You don't even seem to possess a Bus. School level grasp, much less a Court of Chancery or Dissertation level one.  For example, the laws, not my belief, start with the notion that the duties are owed by D&Os to the CORPORATION.By all means, continue to "make fun" of me, but you might at least want to learn something about the subject first.  I wouldn't expect you to comprehend immediately the nuances considered by those of us who have spent many years litigating related issues, but at least it would be significantly less annoying to read your posts.</comment>

<comment>When flailing, resort to an "appeal to authority". That's not going to work this time. You are going to have to show your work, which so far you haven't been able to do.First, unless you can refute the numbers I posted with the Pew link, we can both agree that there hasn't been a "demise" of the middle class.Second, please detail how fiduciary obligations of corporate officers has lead to any sort of decline of the middle class.</comment>

<comment>* "First, unless you can refute the numbers I posted with the Pew link"No need to refute. they support exactly what I stated.  As the introductory clause to the passage you've quoted makes clear, the data has really only one positive note.  If you read the rest, you'll see the statistics like:"[M]iddle-income Americans have fallen further behind financially in the new century. In 2014, the median income of these households was 4% less than in 2000. Moreover, because of the housing market crisis and the Great Recession of 2007-09, their median wealth (assets minus debts) fell by 28% from 2001 to 2013.""In 2015, 20% of American adults were in the lowest-income tier, up from 16% in 1971.""[T]he middle class has not kept pace with upper-income households, its median income, adjusted for household size, has risen over the long haul, increasing 34% since 1970. That is not as strong as the 47% increase in income for upper-income households.""More recently, upper-income families, which had three times as much wealth as middle-income families in 1983, more than doubled the wealth gap; by 2013, they had seven times as much wealth as middle-income families."I can practically quote any passage in the piece - headings included.  Here's one more from page 6:"The wealth gaps across families in the three income tiers widened greatly from 1983 to 2013. The wealth of lower-income families in 2013 was $9,465 – 18% less than they had in 1983. The wealth of middle-income families was essentially unchanged, rising only 2% to $98,057. However, the wealth of upper-income families doubled to $650,074 in 2013. Thus, in 2013, upper-income families had almost 70 times as much wealth as lower-income families and nearly seven times as much as middle-income families."Then there's all the debt stuff, but I'll let others read that material for themselves.* "Second, please detail how fiduciary obligations of corporate officers has lead to any sort of decline of the middle class."Well, actually I said the theories have led to an ever increasing wealth gap.  Nevertheless, there is clearly overlap in the concepts.  I'll try to illustrate the link at a very elementary level.If we look at your mischaracterization above, "corporations and their officers have . . . fiduciary duty to their shareholders", we can begin to see the genesis of the problem.  Your assertion exemplifies the oversimplified shorthand.  As I stated earlier, the three duties run from the D&Os to the corporation.  Shareholders are only one faction.  Given the Delaware Courts' deference to D&O action, this "dumbing down" has provided shelter for D&O compensation, embracing globalization of production and the cheap labor, tax avoidance, and, at the most general level, priority of short term gain over long term stability and growth.  Each of these factors plays out poorly for their middle class employees, as well as the middle class consumers of their goods and services.* OK.  That's enough free education for now.  There are plenty of economics and law review articles out there for you to learn from.  Perhaps, you might want to look at some of the things still coming out of Chicago - you know, see what Aristotle and Plato have to say about Socrates?</comment>

<comment>No need to refute. they support exactly what I stated. As the introductory clause to the passage you've quoted makes clear, the data has really only one positive note.No, it doesn't. In fact, it utterly refutes it. For one, the middle class hasn't seen its "demise", even though it has suffered under Obamanomics. By any measure, whether upward mobility or growth in wealth and compensation, they are doing better.And ANY policy which has caused the majority of those leaving the middle class to move up the ladder is a beneficial one.The wealth gap is only an issue when the majority are leaving the middle class in the other direction, and that simply isn't happening.Given the Delaware Courts' deference to D&O action, this "dumbing down" has provided shelter for D&O compensation, embracing globalization of production and the cheap labor, tax avoidance, and, at the most general level, priority of short term gain over long term stability and growth.There are zero companies in existence now that would have survived in the post WWII global economy without outsourcing and embracing emerging markets. The rest of the world would have ate our lunch. To think otherwise makes you an economic illiterate.Further, you apparently don't want to factor in the growth of goverment, and its stifling regulations, taxes and hostility to cheap energy which had a much larger impact than anything you have mentioned.</comment>

<comment>When politicians, particularly Democrat politicians, talk about 'the middle class', they really just mean median income earners, not the financially independent entrepreneurial class that the term "middle class' originally signified.</comment>

<comment>I don't think the contemporary, colloquial use of the phrase has any partisan distinctions.</comment>

<comment>I'm still waiting for Marxism to die so we can try out some Friedman-omics. It won't happen in my lifetime. But hopefully my grandkids will live freely and pee on pictures of Bernie Sanders. That's all the heaven I need.</comment>

<comment>Are you aware of 20th Century American economic history?</comment>

<comment>When Friedman buys a present for a friend, he cares nothing about the content and everything about the cost? What a douche bag.</comment>

<comment>Don't get sucked in by the hyperbole.How many times have you heard people say "it's the thought that counts" after receiving a gift they don't like? Liberalism and are welfare are the cult of "it's the thought that counts". Regardless of the content, Liberals never have to apologize for their shortcomings because "their hearts were in the right place".Here's another one from Friedman:“One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results.”We need brains, not bleeding hearts.</comment>

<comment>Liberals have a greater than 90% hold on 8 of the top 10 professional industries requiring the most brains. Conservatives have a 100% hold on gator "rastlers" in Mississippi. I rest my case.</comment>

<comment>You'd actually be surprised to find that the fields of study which typically have higher-IQ students are the ones with the highest percentage of Conservatives. STEM subjects and economics are both high-IQ friendly and Conservative friendly.http://www.randalolson.com/201...http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/P...http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/...The Heterodox Academy is standing up for Conservatives in academia. There is wild discrimination against non-Liberals by universities.http://heterodoxacademy.org/</comment>

<comment>With faith much higher in state and local government, maybe it would be a good time to devolve some of the decision making back to the states, which are more accountable.</comment>

<comment>Corporations will never embrace the principle that their sole legitimate function is to promote the felicity and well being of others.   The moral imperative mandates that we unite behind Bernie the Red to recreate the glories of the Soviet economy.</comment>

<comment>It was so glorious that functionality was lost.</comment>

<comment>This is like a tribe of hunter-gatherers asking who is best suited to drive the demons that have made one poor member of the tribe very ill. No matter who they get, it's not going to work because illnesses are not caused by demons. And that's the same situation here.Asking who can fix the economy is absurd because the economy is not broken!What is it going to take you people to understand that? The economy is working exactly like the 1% class wants it to. You see? From the point of view of anyone we might select, there's nothing to fix!</comment>

<comment>"60% believe the government should focus on cutting taxes."How long is this foolish mantra going to persist?  Our infrastructure is crumbling because the gasoline tax of 18.4 cents/gal has not been raised since October of 1993.  How is this rational?  A gallon of regular unleaded averaged $1.06 at that time.</comment>

<comment>BTW,Is the American economy ever not in need of fixing? It seems like I've something akin to this headline several times in my life.Perhaps a better question might be whether the economy is fixable, period, or whether "fix" is the appropriate metaphor to use. I'm pretty sure the economy isn't a car, which can be fixed. Or a cat for that matter. It's something rather different than either of those.</comment>

<comment>"The economy" is the sum of all our transactions, built on transactions of the past. Its an organic system regulated and highly influenced, but not controlled by government</comment>

<comment>The economy can be fixed? Not likely as long as those inside the Beltway believe in government of, by and for the one percent. Keep in mind that this group and its supporters do not want to change anything.</comment>

<comment>These abstract questions are silly.OK you don't trust government or banks. So where is your money? Under the mattress? No. If you have any its in a government regulated bank.And who makes that money legal tender? The government. Who sends your SS check? The government. Who builds and maintains the university you learned your economics at? Probably the government.Grow up people.</comment>
