<comment>Ive never heard of any Baltimore city police officer  refer to themselves as "warriors" or as fighters on the front lines against terrorism.And  while some cities do probably over do the tactical gear aspect, its actually rare to se any Baltimore police in tactical gear.When they raid a house, they generally are just wearing their  regular  uniforms. Although you sometimes see police in  bullet proof vests.But that's actually pretty understandable as to why they would wear one. Cops do get shot in Baltimore on a regular basis</comment>

<comment>Whether policing is dangerous likely depends on the jurisdiction.  I've seen statistics nationwide, and on that level, policing is much less dangerous than other professions.  But absent more granular local data, I would hesitate to generalize.</comment>

<comment>There is no argument, policing is not even in the top ten of dangerous occupations.https://www.washingtonpost.com...They are above painters and construction workers, athletes, coaches, and umpires. but less dangerous than grounds maintenance workers.Some localities see a lot of athletes die while some see none. That is why they use national averages.</comment>

<comment>I'm familiar with the national statistics, but I still don't find them terribly useful.For example, this page lists officers who died in the line of duty in Baltimore.  https://www.odmp.org/agency/21...Since 2000, the death rate has been almost 30x the rate cited for national officer deaths in the article you cited. https://www.washingtonpost.com...The death rate is also more than 5x the national rate for loggers (the most deadly career nationally).  I take your point that there is variability in all careers by locality, although probably less so for loggers than police.  I just don't think that lumping together cops in, for instance, Fairfax County, Virgina, and Baltimore, Maryland, properly reflects actual risks in either jurisdiction.EDIT: See below for updated numbers.  I made a serious math error here.</comment>

<comment>I'm familiar with the national statistics, but I still don't find them terribly useful.Ya, I see that a lot. When facts don't fit the narrative, ignore the facts.Oh, and I do not see anything supporting your comment that the actual rate is 30X what the Bureau of Labor Statistics published. But then I suppose that that claim would also apply to there being 30X the number of umpires dying on the job too. Or 30X the painters.BTW, the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund estimates that 64 police have died on the job this year.http://www.nleomf.org/facts/re...That is in line with the FBI statistics.https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/c...</comment>

<comment>I haven't ignored any facts, nor am I wedded to a particular narrative.  In fact, if you look at my comments here and in other threads, you'll see that we are probably 95% aligned with respect to police abuse issues.If you look at the national statistics, you'll see that loggers have a death-per-year rate of about 90/100K, and nationally, police officers have a death-per-year rate of about 10/100K.  The page I cited shows 15 officer deaths in Baltimore since 2000.  During that period, there were about 3,000 officers in Baltimore.  15/3,000 is  0.005, which translates into 500 deaths per 100K (500/100K).  This is actually more like 50X the national officer average than 30X (the perils of doing math in your head), and it's about 5-6X the national logger average.  Do you see where I'm getting the numbers now?I have no reason to believe that umpires or painters have such regional variability, but that's not really my point.  My point is that for any given person -- and any given police force -- national numbers don't reflect their personal risks.EDIT: Ach, I just noticed that I should have divided my per year number by 15 to reflect a 15 year period instead of a 1 year period.Mea Culpa.  That rather dramatically changes the numbers.  Now Baltimore is only about 3.3X the national average.</comment>

<comment>And "the rest of the story" is that more than half, approaching two thirds, of all police in-the-line-of-duty deaths are due to car accidents. Gunfire is a far smaller risk to a cop than getting into a high speed chase or getting hit when you've pulled someone over and the next clown on the highway isn't watching where he's going. It doesn't help that cops don't wear seat belts.Of course, the real death toll is from cops swallowing their own guns, because it's a stressful job. </comment>

<comment>The poster did a pretty good job of blowing up your narrative with numbers.</comment>

<comment>Mr FusionBut the article specifically was about the Baltimore Police.And yes, Baltimore cops do face dangerous situations and deal with dangerous  criminalsThe above article wasn't about the police force of Meyersdale PA[population 2000]</comment>

<comment>DOJ data suggest otherwise about Baltimore.</comment>

<comment>I think that if stats, as Mitbert put it, are looked at with more granular local data then certain districts within certain agencies might indeed be much more dangerous than national averages indicate.</comment>

<comment>Sure, if you want to stack the deck then you can make the claim. However, remember, there are lies, damn lies, and people who use statistics incorrectly to boost a failed argument.</comment>

<comment>Cops are the boots on the ground last resort of public safety in controlling sociopath males who were not raised to be civilized and to respect other human beings. Matters not the locale, there are idiots and criminals from whom the average, law abiding innocent and vulnerable citizen needs protection. Obviously, the mean urban streets all over America need as many cops as they can hire. However, some sh*thead carjacking in a suburban shopping center is still a dangerous felon. Some sh*thead stalking kids walking to school or raping women in an office building is still a dangerous felon. The man beating up his wife and kids in the gated community is still a dangerous felon. And society expects to be able to dial 911 to summon help.</comment>

<comment>You sound like you have an internalized problem with men. I'd work on that for the sake of maintaining objectivity.</comment>

<comment>You've been watching COPS too much.</comment>

<comment>OrangepolicyMaybe   its no too dangerous   for a cop  in a small town.Are you really suggesting that Baltimore cops don't face dangerous situations on a regular basis ?</comment>

<comment>The numbers just don't support it.  I'm not saying its an easy job, but its not even close to e.g. deep sea fishing.According to the CDC "Commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the United States (1). During 1992--2008, an annual average of 58 reported deaths occurred (128 deaths per 100,000 workers"  IOW, 58 deaths in about 50,000 fishery workers, versus 39 deaths in 1.1 million police officers.If Baltimore's 3000 cops died at the same rate as fishermen, it would be about 4 per year.  Its 5 total since 2010 (i.e about 1/per year), and usually from traffic accidents.   The last gun fire death was in 2011, when an off-duty cop was shot by officers who didn't realize he was a cop. 2007 was the most recent fatal shooting of a Baltimore cop by a bad guy.  https://www.odmp.org/agency/21...,All those are tragic deaths.  But its far from the narrative that cops are being shot and killed with regularity, even in Baltimore,</comment>

<comment>I'd also add that danger, to the extent it exists, is part of the job.  They are trained and well paid for facing danger, just as we pay the firemen to go into burning buildings.  </comment>

<comment>Confronting criminals is very dangerous especially if you ask them to do things they do not want to do.</comment>

<comment>The "warrior on the front lines" is more of a mind set instead of an actual motto.</comment>

<comment>Six police officers have died of gunfire in Baltimore in the last 15 years, and one of those was accidental.https://www.odmp.org/search?na...</comment>

<comment>Construction workers die at a far higher rate than do cops.  Construction workers are injured on the job at a far higher rate than are cops.  Please, stop using the inflated stories of imminent injury or death on the job to justify lawless behavior that is animated by their sense that they are endowed with impunity.</comment>

<comment>I know a couple of BPD officers and while they don't use the term "warrior" to describe themselves, in conversations with them about their day to day interactions with residents of the Northwest District there is no doubt that they view  it as an adversarial relationship. In an atmosphere of us vs. them I can see a warrior culture existing even though it may not be realized or acknowledged. I also know of policies that are not "as a matter of fact" followed because the officers feel them to be unsafe to their own welfare. Policies, if clearly established, need to be followed- period. If certain policies are indeed unsafe to either officers or citizens then thise policies ought be reviewed and adjustments made.</comment>

<comment>TheoldsargesaysI would agree with you about the "us vs them" mentality. But think that  that is different than a "warrior" mentality</comment>

<comment>When police have to second guess all their decisions, the ones usually made in a fraction of a second and in life or death situations... we will be reading more and more about police getting killed on their job.</comment>

<comment>Unsupported supposition.</comment>

<comment>Like this situation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...AmIrite?Had that officer second guessed, clearly he would have been dead.Totally see your point. It's so obvious that it hurts.Thankfully, the guy crawling out of the car that deadly individual, is dead.Yaaaaay!!!!Way to go cops!</comment>

<comment>The most commonly cited cases are those of police shooting first and not evaluating the situation.Tamir Rice. He was shot in under two seconds of the time the police car came to a stop. Although Rice had a toy gun, police did not know if it was a toy or real, the gun was still in his waistband when he was shot.This was in Ohio which is an open carry State.John Crawford. Had picked up a toy gun in a Walmart discount aisle. The gun was not in any container, which is why it was marked down. When he was confronted by police, he was engrossed in a cell phone conversation. He was shot before he had time to react. Ohio is an open carry State.Neither of those victims were afforded any time to react before they were killed. There were no reports of either threatening others or attempting to use the toys in a nefarious manner.Then those police defenders will loudly stick up for "the rights" of Cliven Bundy.</comment>

<comment>It was several of Tamir Rice's neighbors who were in the rec center park and called 911. They reported there was a man (at 12, RIce was already 170 lb. and 5'7") with a gun walking around threatening adults and kids in the park. One caller said the gun might not be real and that the gunman might be a juvenile; the latter part was not relayed to the cops dispatched to the park. When cops arrived, Rice had the realistic looking BB pistol in his waistband. He was told 3 times to raise his hands but refused. Instead, Rice moved his hands to his waistband toward the gun. Whether it was to show police the gun or reach for it is not known, but the investigation left it with the presumption the 12-year-old was showing police the gun but still refused to raise his hands.</comment>

<comment>"He was told 3 times to raise his hands but refused. "hey liarhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...here's the video...at what point did the cops tell him to raise his hands?</comment>

<comment>You're a liar and an idiot </comment>

<comment>There was one (1) 911 call. They said it was a kid. In less than two seconds after the car rolled to a stop, Rice was shot.The police shot before giving Rice an opportunity to react.</comment>

<comment>I'm not getting the causality here--The mistrial was due to a politically ambitious state's attorney who overcharged the officer in question, and has now put in jeopardy the cases against all the officers charged in the incident.The death itself might call for the need for second-guessing of the police, but the mistrial should call into question the tactics of the state's attorney (and probably her resignation) in giving in to a lynch-mob mentality, where she thought she could gain political advantage.</comment>

<comment>I've noticed a lot of over-charging by prosecutors in these kinds of cases.  Sometimes I wonder if it's an intentional tactic intended to result in an acquittal.</comment>

<comment>Overcharging is SOP for prosecutors. It gives them leverage to negotiate a plea or seek an included lesser charge if they don't think they can get the larger crime.It basically comes down to use it or lose it. If they don't charge the higher crime, they can never charge it. But, charging the higher crime doesn't preclude them from dropping that and seeking the lesser, included crime.</comment>

<comment>Sort of related, but as an attorney you'll enjoy (if that word can be used here) Making a Murderer on Netflix. Basically, a wrongfully convicted man sues a rural county for $36 million, a woman goes missing, and local law enforcement and the DA try him in the media by releasing details from an alleged developmentally disabled accomplices coerced confession, plant evidence, refuse to investigate alternative perpetrators, and just generally railroad him. Seriously, check it out.</comment>

<comment>I've been seeing the ads for that. I thought it might be interesting. I guess I know something I'll be watching now at the end of the week.</comment>

<comment>The mistrial was due to a politically ambitious state's attorney who overcharged the officer in questionSo how do you know that? Did you speak with a juror?The death itself might call for the need for second-guessing of the police,There was no "second guessing" here. Each act by every cop was deliberate and with them in firm control. There were no split decisions needed. but the mistrial should call into question the tactics of the state's attorneyOr, the jury itself. When you have one lone hold out that will refuse to convict a cop, this is what you end up with.</comment>

<comment>It's my understanding that the hold out was FOR convicting the cop.Edit: The article I read was speculation, but so far I haven't seen any official count of the how the jury was split. So at the very least assuming that it was one juror unwilling to convict is no different than this line from a National Review article."...at least one juror voted to convict. We may never know what the numerical split was in the vote of the twelve jurors."If you can find an article that gives credence to your claim without it being speculation, that would be great.</comment>

<comment>Meanwhile, Baltimore's crime rate climbs, criminals are released by generous plea agreements courtesy of that very DA. Shameless. No wonder anyone with the means to leave places like Balmer do just that.</comment>

<comment>Sigh.</comment>

<comment>Cops never make mistakes! Their job is dangerous, so let's please stop keeping the bar higher for them; rather, let's keep it at the level of the criminal for fairness' sake.</comment>

<comment>Some have a problem with authority, others have a problem with the lawlessness caused by weak authority.  It takes all types.</comment>

<comment>So do your you wear your Brown Shirt all the time, or is that like an at-rallies-only type thing?</comment>

<comment>I have to say, if I were I cop- I would find it annoying to see armchair liberals, like the ones at Harvard ( linked to in the article) pontificating about how cops need to spend more time analyzing before they act.Here is a recent case in Harlem, NY.  African-American cop and his partner are chasing a suspect who has been positively ID'ed and was just involved in a shoot-out on the street.Clearly, the officers were more concerned about potentially harming the suspect or passersby than they were about their own lives. Why do I say this?Because they did not have their weapons drawn. Why do I say that?Because they were CHASING the suspect.  The suspect, at a minimum, had to turn around to aim and fire.  If the cops had their weapons drawn and pointed, they could have gotten off at least one shot - they would have had a clear advantage.http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10...BTW, the repeatedly violent criminal  had five convictions yet the system STILL placed him in a treatment program after his last conviction even though prison was an option.</comment>

<comment>"He was riding a stolen bike and concealing a .40-caliber handgun, the police said. As two plainclothes officers approached, he wheeled around, dropped the bike and fired one shot into the forehead of one of the officers, Randolph Holder, the police said.“It was quick,” a senior police official said. “He swung around, on the bike path; he was on the bike and he just jumped off and ‘Boom.’ Quick. No words.”"So your proposal is that the officers should have already had their weapons out and drawn, and that if that had been the case they would have been able to neutralize the shooter before he could get a shot off on them. You seem to be implying that the reason they did not have their guns drawn was because of an overweening concern for the welfare of the shooter; and you further imply that this attitude was a product of recent public pressure for increased police accountability. That's a long causal chain to try to prop up. Part of the story you sell is that the officers had a firm, positive ID on the suspect. I don't think we're entitled to suppose that on the basis of the facts given. If that had been the case, and the officers were quite certain that they were approaching an armed criminal who was actively fleeing from a crime scene, we might imagine they would have their guns drawn. I don't know. I don't know what SOP is in situations like that, I don't know when the SOP for those situations was developed or whether it was changed recently due to political pressure; and neither, I'd wager, do you.Here's another picture that can be painted from the same available facts that illustrates why it may have been the proper procedure to investigate the shooter's identity prior to drawing weapons: Suppose the ID that was issued was not so specific that they could know with certainty when they'd found the suspect. Suppose it essentially amounted to "black man on a bike." To then go about drawing your weapon on every black man on a bike you encounter, from then until the suspect is apprehended, in Harlem, is a recipe for disaster. You don't point your gun at anything you're not willing to destroy, hence, you don't point your gun at a suspect until you have some reason to believe that they are the suspect in question and that they are therefore lethally dangerous. An insufficiently specific description might be a sound basis for not pulling weapons until the ID can be confirmed. Since this might explain the officers' decision not to approach with guns drawn -- any number of things might explain that decision -- the onus falls on you to provide evidence as to why your theory is the correct explanation. Given the scarcity of information available to the public for this incident, that is a difficult task. It should also be noted that this entire danged incident is anecdotal and cannot be extrapolated to demonstrate large-scale trends in policing. But don't let that stop you, the people do so love their anecdotes.ASIDE:I suspect that reactionary police apologists might assert that treating every dark-skinned cyclist in Harlem like a potential gunman for an hour or two is exactly what should have been done. For some people, the risk that would entail to the safety of citizens is offset by the additional security it would purchase for the officers. People might reasonably counter-argue that we would be less willing to entertain the same approach if we change some elements of the case; say we move the location to the upper east side and change the description to a fit light-skinned male on a bicycle. Can you imagine every cyclist in Central Park being put on the ground with a gun in their face and searched for weapons? I sure can't. There are cases, and this seems to be one of them, in which the safety of the officers and the safety of the citizenry has to be balanced, and those will always be very difficult decisions; but what gets people riled up is when it seems we like one balance for affluent areas, and another balance for poor and minority areas. The increased willingness to shift risk from officers to citizens when the citizens have lower status seems like a very clear reflection of the differing value we ascribe to the lives and safety of different persons according to their position in the American hierarchy. Some people are quite alright with those differing levels of value; some people think the system is just and that most people are valued as much as they should be. I and many others are simply not okay with that. I don't trust society to make a fair evaluation of the worth of my life. I expect that my life will be valued just as much as any other person's when decisions like these are being made. If you think that you're a winner in the game of who-gets-the-most-deference-from-the-police, then you may be inclined to like the system as it is, but I would submit that it shouldn't take much more than putting yourself thoroughly in the position of someone who loses at that game to see why it is problematic as a feature of any modern society.</comment>

<comment>Like cops, public school teachers are subject to others' pontificating and second guessing their actions, right and wrong. Generally speaking, this phenomenon, as well as others similar to it, is the result of something called "paying taxes." I suppose that if an officer was so annoyed that his or her authority was being questioned by the public (for whom he/she works), they should find another profession that enjoys answering to no one.</comment>

<comment>Your post definitely fit your name. It stank.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry you feel that way Spud! Let me know if you want to rise above silly rhetoric and explain why you disagree. Otherwise, happy holidays!</comment>

<comment>Look, it's not about your authority being questioned. It's about armchair liberals - some of whom have power over your job - possibly interfering in an ignorant, knuckleheaded way with the way you do your job - and GETTING YOU KILLED.</comment>

<comment>Your crybaby whining is pathetic.  </comment>

<comment>What about us armchair conservatives who want police officers to follow the letter of the law that they require the rest of us to adhere to?Don't be so dramatic man.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. At all levels.The police act as the enforcement arm of the government. Governments, and thus the police, have only one source for their authority: our consent. That means we define their job, whether we admit the fact or not, by the way we choose to be policed. We choose collectively, in the laws we pass and the policies we set. As individuals we choose, when we consider a situation and decide whether or not we trust the police, and the government, enough to ask for their help.Over the last forty years, Americans have chosen to place a high, perhaps unprecedented, level of trust in the police and the government. As we see in the Black Lives Matter movement and the increasing criticism of the carceral state, that trust has begun to ebb. And as (if) the authority the average citizen consents to delegate to the state, the job of a police officer will inevitably change. Police officers who consider these changes unacceptable have the freedom to turn in their badges, just as any citizen unhappy with the rules of a majority of their fellow citizens consent to has the right to leave the jurisdiction.</comment>

<comment>As in fact they should. The police should always be concerned about the innocents they are not pursuing. That's why police have largely ended those 100 mph chases that went on for hours. Too often, one car or another would cause an accident, leaving people who were just minding their own business dead. That's also why police procedures generally don't call for drawing weapons in crowded places.</comment>

<comment>I know progressives have trouble focusing. Try to focus on Officer Randolph Holder.  This African-American man and valiant police officer is in a grave now - six feet under.Political correctness, as embodied by people like you, helped put him there - by making him overly hesitant to draw his weapon.</comment>

<comment>So? If you were a food server, you would find it annoying to read food critics saying service could be better.If you were a plastic surgeon, you would find the parade of aging women begging you to make them young again annoying too.Every occupation has annoyances, but ultimately, you do what the boss says or you find a different job.</comment>

<comment>Yeah- you know what, genius? Food servers don't normally have urban thugs shooting at them in the course of their daily work.Think about that for a minute.</comment>

<comment>Cops don't either. Barely 50 officers were killed by an assailant's gunfire in 2012. That's out of a force of about 750,000.Law enforcement is not even in the top 10 most dangerous professions, but it is very highly compensated. Any cop in any metro area of California earns between $120-250k a year. Starting wages as a BART Cop (transit cop) are $144k a year.At those wages, you don't get to whine about risking your life. Roofing is much more risky and only pays $15 an hour, so STFU.</comment>

<comment>Cops have a tough job no one is denying that, however the actions of some have been beyond the pale. Just because they wear a uniform does not give them the right to do what they like when they like if it's totally against the oath they swore to uphold! The minute anyone dares to speak out against the cops they are automatically regarded as cop haters which is so ridiculous. Cops are human beings they are not God and should not be put up on a pedestal as if they were. Majority of the cops are good decent people doing their job the correct way and not crossing the line which we have seen of late by some cops. It also doesn't help that everyone in creation is armed and dangerous! Cops don't know who has a gun in their car! Unfortunately there are far too many that do and then people wonder why cops get shot!!</comment>

<comment>A large fraction of the population doesn't agree with you. Which is odd to me, but apparently quite normal.</comment>

<comment>You wanna talk odd?  I've got three words that have recently entered the lexicon:"Donald Trump voters."</comment>

<comment>"Majority of the cops are good decent people doing their job the correct way"Then why don't the majority of those decent good cops stand up to the rotten ones?</comment>

<comment>You are quite right. Never said I didn't think the good cops shouldn't stand up against the bad cops or turn them in they certainly should. All police forces across the country would be better served if more cops came forward to root out the bad ones.</comment>

<comment>crossing the street in Croatia http://www.slobodnadalmacija.h...</comment>

<comment>An honest question:Might it be time to consider creating something in between these municipal police forces and the individual citizen? Something for each neighborhood, organized and staffed and operated by each neighborhood? Something maybe still quite a bit less than a full-fledged police force, but maybe a little more than a mere neighborhood watch?I ask because police coming in from outside an inner-city neighborhood, and especially police of a different race, seem to be generating a lot of tension and a really bad environment. This is not being stated to provide an excuse for bad police behavior. I am just asking a question: might there not be a better way?I am assuming that most people living in any neighborhood really don't want to live in absolute anarchy, where the security of themselves and their property only lasts as long as they outgun anyone else. I can also see, though, that the presence of a police force consisting mostly of outsiders is having an effect which is far from being totally benign. I am wondering if finding a way for people in neighborhoods to deal with most of the small stuff themselves might make it possible for the metropolitan police to limit their presence to just dealing with the really big and dangerous stuff. That may not be a 100% solution to the problem, but might it at least help?</comment>

<comment>How can you write an entire article about police accountability and the warrior culture and not mention Radley Balko's years of work on this area, and his book "rise of the warrior cop"?   Its like you were trying extra hard to avoid mentioning him.</comment>

<comment>because he's a lolbertarian and they can't be taken seriously.</comment>

<comment>Or because the academics want to piggy back on the decades of work by others without acknowledging it, so that they can get promotions.  As a former academic, I know that game: cite "primary sources" as a way to avoid mentioning your competitor who collated the ideas together.</comment>

<comment>So, the proposal is to judge officers inappropriately, unfairly, and unsensibly?</comment>

<comment>How do you judge cops that shoot people, acting quite legally, but got shot before they had any time to react to police orders?</comment>

<comment>What bothers me the most about law enforcement culture these days is the lack of willingness to submit to civilian control and oversight. As a Navy veteran, I learned the concept of "civilian control of the military" early on. Even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is subordinate to the POTUS, who is Commander in Chief of the armed forces.Police don't like being second guessed? Welcome to my world. Police call it second guessing, but I call it accountability. Managers second guess their subordinates routinely, especially in the proverbial annual performance review. Being second guessed after the fact by people "who weren't there" is just a part of life. Further, if I used deadly force to protect myself or my family, my actions would be put under a microscope. I seriously doubt that "he reached towards his waistband, and I thought he might be going for a weapon" would justify my killing someone.Law enforcement needs to take a hard look at the insular (dare I say "inbred") culture they have created.</comment>

<comment>So totally agree with this.</comment>

<comment>So, Alan- I am thinking that if you were in the position of NYPD patrolman Randolph Holder, you would probably not have chased the perp with your weapon drawn and pointed- and you would probably be just as dead right now, unfortunately.http://www.nydailynews.com/new...</comment>

<comment>The fact that crime exists and is real and the fact that cops indeed are killed in the line of duty does not give cops license to kill at will.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, Sherlock.  Where would humanity be without your pearls of wisdom?</comment>

<comment>Well, apparently the police and policy makers need to be reminded of that.</comment>

<comment>People who take on the job of enforcing the government's will, the collective will, also agree to obey their lawful superiors, who answer, in the end, to the public as a whole. The military accepts this without question. I remember reading the words of an extremely articulate and principled US army officer who went to Iraq and gave his life, despite some pretty clear misgivings about the wisdom of the war, because a lawfully constituted government had given the order and he had given his sworn word to serve.A police officer unwilling to take the risks their service entails has, of course, the right to resign at any time. Nobody has the right to expect the authority or the compensation that goes with the job of enforcing the rules laid down by society while at the same time refusing to follow those rules or worse, while enforcing a private version of them.</comment>

<comment>Nope.Every single time police shoot someone to death while shooting them in the back, while in handcuffs, or while unarmed, it was the right decision.Every.Single.Time.Does anyone actually doubt this?And if you can't hear the sarcasm, I can't help you.</comment>

<comment>I also don't get this blind support of cops from the public. As Alan McCarter said above, US police are an insular group, they only care about protecting each other. So I don't freaking get why people who aren't cops just line up behind them in support; because at the end of the day, if you aren't wearing a badge, you are potentially on the wrong side of a gun.</comment>

<comment>You don't freaking get why people dislike crime and relish the forceful suppression of it?</comment>

<comment>Ha, confession!! Unless of course, you're a cop, in which case you are merely toeing the line.</comment>

<comment>Erm... Forceful suppression of crime doesn't require murder.Or did I miss something.This is what I just don't get. Why do so many people have your view of the matter? If that's what you want, why not just go around and kill, well, everyone? Everyone is potential criminal, so you might as well kill them all. Who cares about the justice system or the determination of guilt or innocence? If you can just shoot them for any reason whatsoever, whenever, just start shooting. Why bother with all the rest of it?Or better yet, have a system like Japan's where they are serious about getting rid of crime. Where anyone accused is basically guilty and forget about due process, the absence of torture and so on. Quit pretending to want to have a rule of law society. At least that makes sense.Instead we get these statements of a desire for law and order and then approve of cops murdering people (pursuant to your own laws). It's completely unhinged and incoherent. Rule of law societies (The UK being the paragon of such societies) don't do it like that. Japan, not really a rule of law society as we understand it, doesn't do it like that. Why do so many Americans want it done that way? Just go out and kill whomever looks like a bad guy. Whether they are or not, who cares?John Geer is a victim of that kind of thinking. Has a fight with his girlfriend. Cops show up. He's shot dead with his hands up and everyone's on the cops side, because clearly Geer needed to die for some damned reason. It takes the movement of heaven and earth for the cop to be charged for with murder, despite the fact that the cops on scene didn't think the shooting was justified, but in the minds of many, the mere fact that Geer was shot was proof positive of his being a bad guy and deserving to be killed.It's completely f**king bizarro world thinking.Ah well. Whatevs. I don't live there and my police forces can't act like the yahoos with guns that apparent police American streets in some considerable numbers. Almost 1,200 Americans shot to death this year by cops, who knows how many justifiably (though many were clearly NOT killed justifiably.Whatever.</comment>

<comment>I suspect that you watch entirely too much television wet one.There is just too much hyperbole and silliness in that post to even bother addressing.</comment>

<comment>The answer to your question is guns. It's because the good ole days of "settling" the country are gone, but people still want to believe that in modern society a gun will help them solve their problems. It's also more than a little ironic that 100 years ago, people didn't want their law enforcement to be too strong, or too present; now brown people here have a few rights and law enforcement can't be strong enough.</comment>

<comment>What crime? In which of these police killings were the deceased murderers, rapists, or even burlglars in the middle of a heist?</comment>

<comment>The question is why people would support the institution of the police and tend to give them the benefit of the doubt, even when some lowlife gets blown away unnecessarily in the fog of war.</comment>

<comment>Physicians in hospitals have what they call "M&M" conferences, the letters standing for "Mortality and Morbidity" (search on Wikipedia). These committees are confidential and do a debriefing on all cases that went wrong, helping all physicians to benefit from lessons learned.Isn't there such a structure within police departments? It could help officers learn from experience without submitting them to constant second-guessing.</comment>

<comment>Policing is a local issue. You wouldn't want a NYC commissioner telling a Des Moines police chief how to police. The basics will stay the same, but the policies surrounding are so vastly different.</comment>

<comment>Up to a point, that's true. However -- there are basic principles that apply everywhere. In any case, why not debrief in search of lessons learned? The military  calls them "after action reports." They go by a variety of names in business, but all revolve around lessons learned -- determining what worked well and what didn't.Many killings of individuals with mental health issues illustrate how some introspection would help. One common thread is that police arrive in a crisis and seek to "establish their authority", typically by shouting commands at the mentally ill individual. The person doesn't comply, so the next step is for the police to escalate by applying force. Mentally ill individual ends up dead. Police say "person was non-compliant, procedures were followed" and the matter gets closed. Why don't the police ask themselves "could we have gotten a better outcome if we had approached this differently" instead of hiding behind existing procedure?A big question is not whether deadly force was acceptably under "procedure", but whether it was truly necessary?</comment>

<comment>That's why I'm talking about local instances, not state or national ones. Most hospitals have their own M&M committees. Could each police department, or even better, each precinct have its own equivalent?</comment>

<comment>Cops involved in any instance wherein their firearm is discharged are generally put on administrative leave pending an internal investigation and often a further review by another govt. agency in that municipality.</comment>

<comment>Many forces focus on hiring veterans.  I wonder if they screen for PTSD?   Another concern I have is the number of police that show signs of steroid and testosterone abuse which causes these uncontrollable emotions.</comment>

<comment>"steroid and testosterone abuse"That continues to be an unaddressed problem across the nation.  Drug testing policies are common, but tests are rarely administered.  When they are, they frequently have a limited number of substances that are being tested for and are announced weeks, or more, in advance.</comment>

<comment>Do you run your head into the wall daily?</comment>

<comment>Another situation where cops might want to second guess themselves is that of the recently unveiled murder of  Noel Aguilar.  One cop shoots the other cop by accident. Result is that they both shoot the guy they're arresting to death. https://photographyisnotacrime...It's a perfect situation.And of course no one is held to account. Even though it's caught on video. Because police.Eh...One day, I'm sure some cop will do a drive by from Manhattan to Brooklyn and it will be somehow justified because everyone killed deserved it, or it was an accident, or something.Whatevs...Merry Christmas folks!</comment>

<comment>"In many departments, officers have developed a pathological aversion to 'second-guessing.' There is a pervasive belief that scrutinizing officer’s use-of-force decisions will lead officers to hesitate, exposing them to dangers that swift action might have averted. ""Shoot first, Ask questions later" isn't simply a bad joke?  It's now ordinary practice.</comment>

<comment>Police officers are neither gods nor demons. Their badges and uniforms do not unmake their humanity.We should, as citizens, do all that we can to ensure that our police officers are rigorously selected and trained, and that they are held to the highest standards. We should also ensure that police officers are held fully accountable for their actions.We give them guns and the ability to use the most violent force. We should, as citizens, insist they perform their duties without resorting to violence first and cover-ups always.</comment>

<comment>Any other tedious platitudes that we have heard thousands of times already on the Atlantic?  You could be a speechwriter for Obama.</comment>

<comment>Oh ya, Obama sumptin' sumptin'. That covers it.</comment>

<comment>Don't cry when the facts destroy your idiotic view of reality you little child. </comment>

<comment>We should hold the civilian leadership responsible for the actions of the cops.</comment>

<comment>I agree. We should.Getting civilians/voters to understand this is hard. There is a lot of hero worship because "cops are the good guys."When we show that, no, they are not always the good guys; sometimes some of them are actually quite bad, no different than those whom they arrest, and the vast majority of them remain silent about their fellow officers' misdeeds, then the civilians/voters often simply retreat from any conversation, regroup, and come back again with their beliefs that "cops are the good guys."Getting people to accept facts versus myth is quite difficult. It takes continual education, step by step.</comment>

<comment>We should hold parents accountable for the actions of their criminal sons. Taxpayers shoulder 100% of that financial expense, including trial and stints in prison, with cops and their families often also shouldering the daily stress, emotional toll and funeral expenses when victimized by the violent sociopaths who walk among us.</comment>

<comment>Part of the problem, I would suggest, is that police are trained to use lies, fraud and deception as investigative techniques -- unfortunately with the blessing of the courts.  That suggests to me that an officer who has scruples about lying under any circumstances is occupationally unqualified for police work.Is there any other line of work -- other than perhaps professional wrestling -- where this is so?</comment>

<comment>I don't know. The problem is that police officers have guns and can use violence. Pro wrestlers can use limited violence, mostly faked, and don't have guns.We grant the police mythic status as "doers of good" even when video and audio evidence shows they are violent and perform acts of evil. We excuse their shotgunning of people because "good" people don't kill people randomly--hey, a guy openly carrying a gun in an open-carry state must be ready to kill me so I can kill him first and claim I was "threatened"--that's what cops are saying.I have acquaintances who seriously believe cops are under assault; even when I correct their misapprehensions with facts, they maintain they are right because "it's not just about the facts."There is nothing further that can be done with those people. They are immune to facts.</comment>

<comment>Cops are under assault like there's a war on Christmas.</comment>

<comment>Well, there is a definite kayfabe aspect of investigating police misconduct.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... Interviews are often not conducted right away, allowing stories to be scripted.  The officer(s) under investigation play the "face" role.  The civillians are the "heels".  And the outcome is predetermined.</comment>

<comment>The Police Union might disagree with you.</comment>

<comment>Freddie Gray was a drug dealer with a long criminal record.</comment>

<comment>So's your face.</comment>

<comment>If you want mourn the passing of a drug dealer, that's your right. But I support the those who defend the innocent and put away the bad guys like Freddie Gray.</comment>

<comment>Why can't I also denounce the careless, jerk-face cops too? The two aren't mutually exclusive.</comment>

<comment>Last I checked, it was not the cops job to make up punishments for those crimes.</comment>

<comment>This is an ongoing discussion for law enforcement to reflect the community they serve. My problem with it is when we gut the basics of their jobs to kowtow to certain communities or political correctness. Oh that, and we need to get rid of police unions.</comment>

<comment>It's a good point. Sandra Bland probably did kill herself: the family thinking that can't be the case doesn't change it. Family doesn't always know something like suicide is coming, and are often shocked when it does. She had a long history of depression.HOWEVER: it doesn't seem that she really needed to be arrested in the first place. She committed a ticketable offense, but that's all. Rudeness isn't grounds for arrest.There's no way to know if, absent this experience, something else wouldn't have been the straw to break Sandra Bland's figurative back. But what we can know is that the unnecessary arrest proved too much for a woman struggling with long-term depression. Actions have consequences, even if not direct ones.</comment>

<comment>She should not have been driving, period. If the state of Illinois had done their job, she would have lost that privilege. Actually, she did. They just didn't catch up to her.</comment>

<comment>In the fascist states of America the police cam arrest you for looking at them wrong </comment>

<comment>If Freddy Gray would not have run, he would have been fine. Running means your a bad dude.</comment>

<comment>Tell me, did this guy run?https://www.youtube.com/watch?...If not, why is he dead?</comment>

<comment>Yes he did, Duh that is why he crashed.</comment>

<comment>Funny, I don't see any pursuit or fleeing at all. It's not even clear that the police car has its lights on. But whatever. Clearly after the guy had stopped fleeing by crashing his car, he deserved to be shot. Right?</comment>

<comment>What does 'deserved' have to do with it?  They apprehend criminals and suppress crimes, and use lethal force when appropriate.  An action of lethal force being appropriate does not mean they are divvying out justice, or judgement, or punishment.     Perhaps the problem is that you are having a hard time with the nuance of law enforcement, and see the world in primitive cartoon garishness.   I would encourage you to mature intellectually.</comment>

<comment>Nuance implies they are not blunt instruments, which also means they'd be able to use some sort of non-lethal force to do their jobs.</comment>

<comment>Which they do, every day.</comment>

<comment>Nah... it's you who have a hard time distinguishing between law enforcement and thuggery. And "deserved" has everything to do with it. One of the founding principles of America (yes, despite slavery) was a preoccupation with fairness. That's why we have due process and a prohibition against unusual and cruel punishments.The whole point here is that the use of lethal force has indeed been inappropriate. Our police are far more deadly than the police in other developed countries. In the US, people are killed by the police literally daily. In other developed countries, police kill a few people a year.</comment>

<comment>In the US we have more diversity and thus have more criminality and thus we have more criminals killed during their attempted arrest.   What is the problem Robert?  If your nephews are being laid out by the police perhaps YOU should have an intervention and get them to fix their self destructive lives.The citizenry clearly want police with teeth.  I am not going to waste tears on some low life, come get me when a choir boy is killed while crossing the street to church.</comment>

<comment>How about a neighbor opening the door for the police to come in?http://www.chicagotribune.com/...</comment>

<comment>police do not punish, they have nothing to do with punishment, they respond to crimes and arrest suspected criminals, while taking steps to ensure their own safety and that of the public, if doing that results in someone getting killed who didn't deserve to be killed it is not 'fair', but it is justified.</comment>

<comment>Poe's Law?</comment>

<comment>No kidding.</comment>

<comment>That belief should be laughed at. There are many other professions in which swift and decisive action is continuously necessary, yet those professions are not allowed to claim an exemption to scrutiny. When a doctor's patient dies unexpectedly, we don't accept, "You don't know how it is to be a doctor."</comment>

<comment>Oh my, this article seems to just fix the world doesn't it? A LEO must be allowed to use a "reasonable officer" point of view, that is how they do their jobs. But to then suggest that their actions be reviewed with some type of "supper officer" standard is totally off the wall but it is what most criminals pray for every day.The officer that shot the poor little boy that his parents were to stupid to teach, "son, don't wave anything around that looks like a gun at anytime unless you are trying to shoot something." Gosh, the kid was waving and pointing a realistic looking gun at officers, a gun that the red on the barrel which would have identified itself as a fake had been removed or altered. Our "reasonable officer" goes in the child is shot because the officer fears for his life. He is reviewed and judged by the reasonable officer standard.Now these clowns want him reviewed with a super officer standard? What color of idiocy is that? Now he is sent to jail for doing his job because he did not stop to ask the child, "have you removed the red thing on the barrel"? Maybe the next super cop standard will next require the officer to ask "are there bullets in the gun? you need to show us it is or not so we can preform our job properly". Now we would expect sweet innocent civilians to show the officer the gun is loaded or not, or the child to lay the play gun down and have the officers inspect it for him. But guess what, the criminals don't act this way. They hide guns, they shoot officers, they kill officers, in short criminals and stupid little kids do not do what officers ask or order them to do. Our society requires that you stop what you are doing when an officer decides it is time to stop for our safety and the safety of others. Our refusal is just that, an out right REFUSAL to do what the officer has told us to do. It is not an indication that the officer needs to receive more training or that he should be reprimanded with a higher standard than he is asked to preform his job.</comment>

<comment>The judgement of cops has been repeatedly demonstrated as flawed. Cops have been repeatedly outed as liars. Second-guessing is a very reasonable request because most cops should be FIRED.</comment>

<comment>Are you ignorant or are you lying? And if you're lying, did you really think no one knows the particulars of the case?The kid, Tamir Rice, never pointed or waved anything at the officers. The officers never saw the gun, much less whether it an orange tip or not. The officers drove up, got out, and shot the kid. Yes, just like that.Perhaps they were unnerved by the report they received from 911. Maybe they were afraid for their lives. But that shouldn't give cops the authority to simply shoot people.</comment>

<comment>You'd think right?In meantime, no charges laid, and from what I understand, none will ever be forthcoming.Whatever. That's the way a lot of people want it.So it goes.</comment>

<comment>The Crips and Bloods also need to start second-guessing their decisions. It's about as likely as cops doing it.</comment>

<comment>Except cops aren't in a gang and are held to higher standards... Wait for the light bulb to go off. </comment>

<comment>Different standards, not higher standards; pigs don't go to jail when they murder innocent people.</comment>

<comment>Article is about unhinged overly violent police officers and you talk about local gangs, classic irrelevant post. </comment>

<comment>I appreciate the very difficult job that police do, and I admire and respect those who do it courageously and responsibly.The first step toward police professionalism is careful hiring of law enforcement personnel.  Screen out the bullies, jerks and poon hounds before giving them badges and guns.</comment>

<comment>The difficult part of this is that police departments do not do this, even when they have the facts at hand.My local police force hired a guy booted from another jurisdiction, a known problem with a documented history of violence towards civilians, an officer with a 1000 pages in his records of problems, and someone who was responsible for at least two court settlements totalling a half-million dollars, money that had to be paid out by the citizens of that city.After all this, after it came out that we'd hired him after knowing all this, the police chief and the mayor said that they saw no reason not to hire him, that he was "persecuted," and that they stood behind their decision.That cop is now on administrative leave, again, from our police department as they investigate yet another action of his.The basic question my fellow city residents aren't asking our mayor and chiefs is this: is there such a dearth of candidates for the job of police officer that we have to take someone with a proven track record of violence against the community?</comment>

<comment>Nobody's left. Then what?</comment>

<comment>Raise salaries to attract better quality applicants.</comment>

<comment>that means raising taxes which nooone wants</comment>

<comment>This phenomenon is only amplified when it comes to the military. The moment you question the actions of a police officer or serviceman, you are basically branded a traitor, or at best, an armchair liberal. I guess because public school teachers don't directly preserve the power of the upper class and their political cronies, we mustn't worry ourselves with trying to defend them at every step. So, let's keep on rationalizing police brutality. They have a "dangerous" job, ya know.</comment>

<comment>The military does a lot of second-guessing. The Army has the Center for Army Lessons Learned, trying to not make the same mistake twice. Aviation is heavily into self-criticism and analysis, with the National Transportation Safety Board examining every plane crash in great detail.Perhaps every police shooting should be examined by a NTSB-like organization.</comment>

<comment>You'd think right? But noooooo...That looks a little too much like "accountability" so that's not going to happen. Never, ever. No way, no how. Can't, as in CANNOT!!! have it. Not allowed.Cops will be able to gun down whomever, whenever, for any reason or no reason and won't be held accountable for it, ever.</comment>

<comment>I'm old enough to remember what New York City was like before Giuliani. Cops wouldn't patrol certain neighborhoods because they were afraid of being lynched by Dinkins and Sharpton if they said or did anything- and of getting shot up by gangbangers. I say this much- THANK YOU POLICE FOR KEEPING THE CRAP SHOE-DEEP! KEEP IT THAT WAY! If you wanna live the outlaw life, you're gonna die like Jesse James. Respect the police, obey the law.</comment>

<comment>Archie, take your blood pressure meds.</comment>

<comment>Take a trip back in time. Times Square used to be so bad you couldn't go a few feet without walking on empty crack vials, dirty needles, used condoms, tripping over squeegee men and hookers. Back then, Broadway was mostly playing pornos and peepshows. It was miserable. I support tough on crime policies. They need to be tougher. Stop coddling low life hoods!</comment>

<comment>Yes, by your logic, lets trample on rights and go after the the NRA hoods.</comment>

<comment>Connecting dots that aren't there again?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Crips and Latin Kings are definitely lifetime members of the NRA. They're also probably the most likely to deal drugs and shoot up city blocks. More young suburbanite twerps talking out their butts about things they don't know about. Keep taking a safe and sound NYC for granted. It won't last long with people like you taking the side of the poor oppressed thugs.</comment>

<comment>So the youth of today are less violent than your generation, gramps? </comment>

<comment>The only reason things are better is because of aggressive policing. No generation is any better than another, but if people let things get out of control they most certainly will. Thug trash of any sort need to feel the force of a baton every now and then to know their place.</comment>

<comment>No. You are an ignorant fool.  The police have always behaved like they do.  People are just not as criminal as your generation.  Crime rates are at all time lows</comment>

<comment>The Baby Boomers were degenerate drug user hippies. You may have a point about them, not that I am one of them. Either way, the crime wave that was started by them would be continued by their equally garbage children if not for a stronger police truncheon. We need more cops more ready to beat the snot out of these street thugs. They need to learn their place, get a job and stop thinking he world owes them something and can just do whatever they want at the expense of their communities.</comment>

<comment>Yeah that's why crime is down in every industrialized nation?  Even the ones where cops don't behave like a bunch of unaccountable thugs?  Anyway, from your comments it was clear from the beginning you were old, useless and stupid. There are a lot of dumb people on this comment section, but you are there king.

<comment>.00004% of Deaths in America are attributable to police. Why is criticism needed?</comment>

<comment>That is an entirely fabricated number.  Stop lying </comment>

<comment>No. It's an accurate number.</comment>

<comment>Which is why you provided a credible source, liar </comment>

<comment>About 500 people are killed police every year. If they represent .00004% of all deaths, as you claimed, that means that 1,250,000,000 people die every year in America. That's four times more the entire population.Assuming the percent sign is an error and the rate is really 0.00004, that's still 12.5 million people, while in fact, only about 2.5 million people die every year.</comment>

<comment>500 people aren't killed by the police every year.</comment>

<comment>That's over 12,000 people a year. Based on how many videos show the police lying and shooting unarmed people that means a good percentage of this 12,000 are state sponsored murders.Now, you may be trying to say this is a small number. But these are state sponsored executions. That is a very very different thing from a heart attack. We take things like car crashes and preventable diseases seriously in the US. And a government official murdering citizens even more seriously (at least I hope we do).</comment>

<comment>LOL. No.</comment>

<comment>Because they are public officials? Because many deaths are preventable? Because life is a constitutionally protected interest that is supposed to only be taken in extreme circumstances? Because other countries don't appear to have this issue? Because people shouldn't have to weigh whether or not calling the police will put them in more danger? </comment>

<comment>The beauty of it is that you have your own police force in your local tax region who are run to the exact specifications of your mayor whom you elect.  Now you know where and how to bring change, have at it.</comment>

<comment>"Police officers lying in court to support criminal cases is a long-standing scandal of nationwide proportions.

<comment>We need structural change in the police.

<comment>No surprises there.</comment>

<comment>A not-small part of the problem of officers resisting both peer- and self-criticism is who the cops are - some are damaged goods with mental health problems, including the warrior cops recycling from dangerous combat assignments.  Others are simply biased.  Still others lack the cognitive capacity to see situations clearly and think through - using System 1 thinking - the consequences of their actions and what choices they have.  Still others are easily threatened - often seeing any sign of autonomy as a masculinity threat - and are incapable of emotional control. The culture that works aggressively against seeking help when help is needed works to the detriment of officers and places citizens in danger.  The same cops who resist reflection and introspection are the keepers of that culture.  In short, we need new cops - smarter, cognitively better, emotionally more skilled regulating their fear and rage and resisting archetypes, and more capable of navigating difficult and arbitrary bureaucracies.  The number of citizen deaths this year, the racial skew and the apparent indifference by police executives are all signals that big changes are needed in policing, from top to bottom.</comment>

<comment>Too many idiots in the comments, I sincerely hope these autistic cop apologists get severely abused and killed by the police. And nobody will make a sound for them, sweet sweet karma. </comment>

<comment>There is a problem with your wish, one has to be 1: a criminal and 2: a non compliant aggressor during the arrest to be abused or killed by the police.  It doesn't happen out of the blue.</comment>

<comment>Really?  It sure seems like it's happening out of the blue.</comment>

<comment>The problem is system and does not star and end with police departments. This is part of American culture and it's as difficult to change as honor killings in the Muslim world.If you want to go hierarchically, it starts at the top. It's much easier to control a frightened population, and it's also much easier to scare voters than to create jobs, so politicians distract the citizenry with tales of crime and promises of keeping everyone safe. Even some of the allegedly most liberal politicians, like Bill Clinton, have pounded the table over Law and Order issues.When elected, politicians then have a mandate to spend on law and order, and of course they do it. At the local level, that leads to unholy matrimonies between city governments and their police departments. Each has the other's back -- the politicians grant extraordinarily generous salaries and benefits to cops, and the cops make the politicians look good with high arrest numbers. At the national level, you have politicians handing military equipment out like dinner mints to police departments.If you want to go chronologically, well, the very start of policing in America is problematic. In the South, it began with slave patrols, the paramilitary forces every able-bodied (poor) white man was required to join. In the North, it began in 1830 with the Boston Brahmin class demanded that the city "do something" about the wave of unruly, unwashed, dirty, filthy, illiterate European peasants flooding the city.The police mellowed out somewhat as a liberal Warren Supreme Court restricted police authority and the post-War prosperity made crime a difficult issue to credibly flog. But then came the Sixties...</comment>

<comment>End police unions.They only serve the cops who should not be cops.Every lawsuit against police should come out of their pension funds.This would give the old cops incentive to be sure the new cops are up to the job.No more ex-military hired as cops.The training is all wrong and impossible to overcome.Much shorter careers on the streets. Move them up and out before they turn on us.Policing is stressful, this would help them out and it would help us.Actual civilian oversight would go a long way to reducing  this culture of lawlessness.Not ex-cops from the old regime, signing off on every questionable shooting.Along with actual oversight would be the idea of trying and sentencing cops who lie to cover for other cops. That would thin the herd right there........And then there is drug testing.A few too many of these guys seem to be steroid abusers and it shows.At this point, a lot of us would prefer to simply draft cops out of the phone book.....</comment>

<comment>Intelligent, well reasoned article. I'm far from a "soft on crime" type, but it's easy to see how having a courteous, respectful attitude when interacting with the public is a win/win for the police. Watching the snotty cop in the Sandra Bland video needlessly escalate the situation is a perfect example of how not to treat our civilian population.</comment>

<comment>And it's also important to teach kids to respect cops and even adults are sometimes nasty to cops, inviting their own problems.  I think that won't be much of a problem, though, as long as these other steps are taken first.  Most of us know what it's like to not "own" our job, that we have to answer for our actions, etc.  It's time the cops get out of the warrior getup and into the guardian getup.</comment>

<comment>Definitely glad to see this.The informal police culture will resist any legal reforms. It has to be addressed before any sort of reformation can happen.</comment>

<comment>Great, intelligent analysis.For the foreseeable future, society will require police.in places like Britain, they go mostly unarmed.A reasonable target to aim for.Smaller but better-educated forces, de-militarized and motivated to help the communities in which they serve. Want to end the "no snitching" problem?Help residents, rather than harassing them.Don't treat them like Afghan villagers, being searched by Special Forces.Effective measures to weed out racists and unstable officers.Positive reinforcement for the brave dedicated officers who joined to make society better.An end to the corporate-style "performance" measurements for "collars" and plea-bargained, unjust convictions that serve to build prosecutors' political careers rather than create a just social order. The large numbers of convicted people being proven innocent via DNA testing should makes nature of the criminal "justice" machine evident.For sure innocent people have been executed.Fixing these problems will be a force for healing American society.</comment>

<comment>Unarmed police would indeed be a reasonable target for armed criminals to aim for.The majority of the public understands the need for a strong law enforcement, they go further than understanding and demand it.The only tears falling when johnny thug gets unnecessarily killed for non compliance with law enforcement are merely political theater.</comment>

<comment>What a dense observation. Unarmed police work in Britain. Go learn something before you write nonsense. American police department are already sending officers there to learn how that works.The public is kept fearful at a time when crime is still dropping.Ignorance is essential to your approach.Your crude, racist "thug" talk deserves contempt.People like you are the problem.</comment>

<comment>Who is dense here??  Explain to us all how unarmed police arrest our armed criminals.</comment>

<comment>It would be interesting to see how many of our criminals are in fact armed (at least such that the officers in question need drawn weapons - many suspects willingly turn over the their weapons when questioned).  My guess is less than 10%, and probably far less than that in randomn "street" stops by beat-cops vs. house raids, etc. (where a smaller number of armed officers could still conduct those operations).  At minimum, it seems there would be many "non-dangerous" beats (university campus PDs, etc.) that shouldn't be regularly given firearms.That said, I actually think all US cops should have firearms in their vehicles.  If stuff is going down and there is a call for shots being fired, etc., they can get out the gun.But for day-to-day beat patrols, I increasingly wonder if giving lethal firearms vs. non-lethal tasers, etc. is creating more trouble than it helps.  Knee-jerk lethal response doesn't seem to be helping anyone.At minmum, perhaps only senior officers should have firearms... if after 3 or 5 years the cop shows good restraint and judgement (and learns to diffuse situations WITHOUT resorting to gunfire), then they can be armed.  Same goes for officers with repeated abuse complaints...  why are we giving them guns again?The risk of another rookie cop, or another cop with a history of abuse complaints, shooting tomorrow's Tamir Rice seems a big price to pay for marginal increases</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm outraged because when you're shackled in the back of a police van with six cop, you're having a bad day, but you should be physically safer than any other time in your life.You're not a threat to THEM, and so they shouldn't be a threat to YOU.</comment>

<comment>A young person should be physically safe too, they are in their prime, but sometimes a brain aneurysm forms and explodes and they die.  It doesn't have to be anyone's fault, life isn't fair.</comment>

<comment>Uhm so being tortured to death by the police is exactly equivalent to an aneurism?   Wow, you make the original Nazis look human by comparison.</comment>

<comment>Which case are you talking about?  I assumed Freddie Gray.</comment>

<comment>yep</comment>

<comment>...  ok.  no further comment</comment>

<comment>Cops in america are armed because unlike the UK, criminals in america are armed.</comment>

<comment>And because we have a history that includes slavery and warring with the indians.  It's a guns-to-use-against-entire-populations culture.</comment>

<comment>America is plagued by its birthing in violence and suppression.And --- most of the gun violence is not directed at police, but by citizens at each other.Especially when black people are involved, the police have a tendency to shoot first.Racial stereotypes have convinced many of them that their lives are in danger, automatically -- especially if a black male is involved.However, it's be possible to tune down the violence.Education and far more selective recruiting/training, community-police collaboration.</comment>

<comment>The psychological profile of police applicants needs to be re-evaluated and held to a higher standard, starting with intelligence tests.  Apparently, you can be too smart to be a cop.  And that's not right.(Common sense Gods forgive me for citing Slate -- I'm sorry.  I will repent.)http://www.slate.com/blogs/mon...</comment>

<comment>That's ridiculous.  Many cops have advanced degrees...not just the high school diploma. To promote many require a bachelors or masters degree.   Heck I have a relative with a law degree and he said that there were 2 other attorneys in his academy class. You did not read your own link.  The smaller department was concerned that after obtaining the training the candidate would move on....to a different department that would assuredly scoop up a highly intelligent well trained candidate with prior experience.  You should check to see the lateral applications for NYPD and LAPD of guys from smaller agencies that want to come over. </comment>

<comment>Simply attaining an advanced degree is no gauge of intelligence.  It's certainly indicative of discipline and effort - that I'll give you.  But attaining a Master's in criminal justice from some night school is not out of the realm of possibilities for a motivated individual with a 95 IQ.</comment>

<comment>How about if we just hold them responsible and don't let them get away will killing people?</comment>

<comment>I wish we could do that with gang-bangers, first - instead of making excuses for their behavior.</comment>

<comment>A huge part of the problem is that for the most part, police officers are stupid thugs, who don't have the capacity to comprehend any of this. Criticism isn't going to cut it.  It just makes them feel threatened, and we know all too well how cops respond to feeling threatened.What we need is for our cowardly legislators to step up, and put these knuckledraggers on a much shorter leash. We need laws that hold them accountable, because they sure aren't going to do a damn thing to change, otherwise.</comment>

<comment>So your statement is that all officer are ignorant thugs and need to be dealt with accordingly....WOW if that is not the pot calling the kettle black...you've just committed the very offense you claim the police are guilty of.  Attributing to all members of a group the actions of individual actors is the definition of sterotyping.  Want to double down and say that because some hispanics are illegal that all hispanics are?  How about that all jews are greedy? All blacks are criminals?  Let me know when to stop.</comment>

<comment>Uhm I suspect that he's accusing police of torturing Freddy Grey to death after he was manacled in the back of a police van.And say, shooting 12 year old Tamir Rice to death, say while coasting to a stop because any black child with a cap gun should be killed.Oh oh oh, and not getting convicted for it.</comment>

<comment>Never attribute to evil what can be explained by stupidity.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that what I said?Anyhow, I never said "all cops" #NotAllCopsI said "most," but we could even just go with "some."  Do you think cops are somehow above being dangerously stupid?  Why would they be?  Like anyone else, they just need to be held accountable for it, because when dangerous stupidity goes unchecked, it tends to get worse.</comment>

<comment>Of course not. .. They make mistakes like anyone else. ... But most commentators seem to suggest malice or that mistakes are common.  I think it would be fair to say mistakes are not common but still occur more than they should. </comment>

<comment>Are police shootings of unarmed civilians getting worse? Or is this something we are only becoming more aware of thanks to cell phone videos and street protests?I ask this as one who grew up in a Chicago neighborhood in the 60s where the local cops were quite trigger happy. One even took a shot at my brother (home on leave from Nam), missed and hit another cop.</comment>

<comment>We wouldn't have police cultures around the country where they can get away with murder if this was a NEW thing.  Welcome to America.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Not. Fair.O'Malley was just another cog in the democratic liberal machine that began and kept Maryland on it's downward spiral.On a positive note there is still plenty of damage left to be done and there are enough Democrats both the electorate and the elected to make damn sure the decline continues.</comment>

<comment>Ironic since nine of the top ten states dependent of the federal government are conservative </comment>

<comment>Moronic since that other fellow and I were talking about Maryland.Troll.</comment>

<comment>We weren't discussing "nine of the top ten states dependent...." douche bag, we were discussing Maryland.If you cannot follow along then please mind your business. Oh, and wipe your chin.</comment>

<comment>"constructive criticism"What we need is a system that holds police accountable.  Where they don't have a reasonable expectation that they can get away with torture and murder like they do now.  Period.</comment>

<comment>Murder is a legal conclusion.  In the Grey case you can argue negligence...but you would have a hard time proving criminal intent.</comment>

<comment>Police accountable?Bring me the heads of Scalia and Thomas, Then maybe we can talk. 'Reasonable Expectations,' is a supreme court doctrine.  Every white person knows what they can reasonably expect from every black person in this nation.Yep.  The white officer only has to turn over the 'Fear Card' in any proceeding.If the white boy can say, "I was afraid," then the white boy can kill, then the white boy skates, then the white boy can do it again, and again, and again.  Juries and grand juries just nod their heads.Now, how does one create the system you 'need,' from the one that exists?  Scared white boys rule in this white boy land.</comment>

<comment>I know a lot of reasons to kill human beings.What I find amusing are the reasons that human beings give when they kill other human beings.Property.  Money.  Honor.  Fear.  Oh, yeah, and that invisible guy in the sky that you all claim to talk to individually gives you a license to kill.You are a sick, and funny species. I meant that word, funny, in an incredibly ironic sense.  Why we did not, at least, cull the white boys, I will never understand.</comment>

<comment>Cull the white boys?</comment>
