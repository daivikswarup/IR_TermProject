<comment>“This is Reagan’s Party” only because he won two elections. A ‘good’ story (at least good enough to be posted to The Atlantic on-line) does not equal good history. If Trump or Cruz won the nomination and then lost the general badly wouldn’t they be more Goldwater than Reagan? Would it then be “This is Goldwater’s Party”?And why couldn’t the current Republican narrative plot be as easily compared to Bill Clinton’s strategy of triangulation?While we have more confidence retrospectively in fact we are often as bad analyzing history as we are making predictions about the future. There is no rule that history repeats itself. History may only provide some insight to future events.This story is anecdote. Sample size is one. Perhaps entertaining but no statistical significance.Let me quote Ta-Nehisi Coates. “Those attempting to practice history need not only gather facts, but seek out facts that might contradict the facts they like, and then gather more facts of context to see what it all means.”</comment>

<comment>Reagan is idealized because he was the last Republican who left office not utterly depised by his party and the country</comment>

<comment>You slander HW. A good man even though patrician who did a much better job than people give him credit for.</comment>

<comment>Yup and his party loathes him for it.  He was in my eyes as a fairly moderate liberal a better president than Reagan.But he raised taxes so they'll hate him forever</comment>

<comment>Perhaps many in the party, but not the country as a whole.</comment>

<comment>The country as a whole barely remembers him. And, like peterw, I'm someone who considers him a significantly better president than Reagan.</comment>

<comment>"Barely remembers" does not equal Peterw's "utterly despised".</comment>

<comment>The public doesn't remember Bush I mostly because he just did things. He didn't make a huge public scene as did the Reagan, Clinton, or the Bush II Administrations. What he did was generally approved by the electorate.In my opinion, he was a good president. Not the best, but better than average.</comment>

<comment>Reagan raised taxes plenty of times (maybe more than anybody given the change in SS structure) but his backers are completely in denial about it. Strange.</comment>

<comment>It was payroll taxes.  Rich people don't pay those as much</comment>

<comment>He was also a big supporter of gun control.</comment>

<comment>No republican hates the HW Bush a lot were disappointed by him but all respect him.</comment>

<comment>Many Americans loathe both Reagan and his Veep who then became president in 1988. Both were "good men", just not good presidents and who came with a ton of back room baggage dating to the 1950s.</comment>

<comment>Many also loathed Andrew Jackson after the ramifications of his policies became apparent.</comment>

<comment>Do you remember the way he was seen at the time? Bush Sr. was seen as a guy so privileged, he didn't know about supermarket scanners, a guy who could barely make a coherent public speech ("Message: I care"), the guy who lied about raising taxes ("read my lips"), the guy who picked that idiot Dan Quayle ("p-o-t-a-t-o-e") for Veep, and a guy who got us into the Gulf War--possibly to prove he wasn't a "wimp."The elder Bush's stock later rose among those who follow politics, mainly because later GOP candidates and his presidential son seemed to be much less capable than he was. He looked better by comparison with the failures that followed.I share the respect for Bush Sr. that others have expressed on this thread. But I remember how he was disdained at the time he lost his bid fr re-election. The public did not hold him in high regard at the time, and most have not given him much thought since. I'm 48 and that was the 1st presidential election I voted in. Anyone a few years younger than me will not recall the first Bush presidency at all.</comment>

<comment>I am a fm few years younger than you. I remember HW Bush well.The way he was seen was not really an accurate picture of who he was. Only in Washington can I guy be perceived as a wimp when he was a fighter pilot in WWII.</comment>

<comment>Yes, shot down, rescued and then went right back to flying off of an aircraft carrier. How old was he then? 20-21? He went into the service right out of high school (well the private academy equivalent of high school). If you are a patrician, 'to whom much is given, much is expected' is highly preferable to the air of entitlement surrounding many of the very wealthy.</comment>

<comment>" he didn't know about supermarket scanners,"Yeah, it's amazing how hated you can be when the media lies about you and pretends you are impressed by the existence of scanners, rather than seeing a new and innovative one and being impressed by that.</comment>

<comment>Fist off, it's not really slander to say people didn't like him.  It's how I remember it, too.  I had to go and look to see if that was accurate or not, and I apparently remember it wrong.  GHW Bush was very unpopular (around 35%) for about 10 months right before the election, but then gained popularity after his defeat and left office with about 55% approval ratings.</comment>

<comment>Bush I wasn't defeated. Perot siphoned off the far right votes that otherwise would have gone Republican. Without Perot in the race, Bush I would have had a resounding election victory in 1992.</comment>

<comment>I agree. And being a two term President his place in history would be much higher.I wonder what two terms of a moderate Republican would have meant for that party. And where would the Democrats be absent two terms of Bill Clinton?</comment>

<comment>I take your point that slander is the wrong word. Should have said disparage.Your research confirms my memory of HW's popularity. His dip in popularity, crash really, from about 90% just after the 1st Gulf War to 35% was mostly due to reversing his public stance on taxes. For conservative Republican's that was unforgivable. For others not so much. I see it as him doing what he thought was the right thing. He knew there would be a huge backlash and did it anyway. That took political courage. And so while I'm not a big fan, I do respect the man.</comment>

<comment>I suspect  Reagan is idolized because he was the last Republican presidential candidate to have a plausible connection to the American working class.The rest have been patricians through and through.</comment>

<comment>It is because Reagan embraced the evangelical moral majority Elmer Gantrys to plumb them for votes, incorporating into his administrations polices that reeked of hatred toward working women, gays, blacks and actually poor whites - they were just too dumb to see it amid their bible banging. Nifty partisan pulling of wool over the rubes, but they still have yet to figure it out. The GOP in 1979 desperately needed to rebrand and move far, far away from both Watergate and the deeply dislikable Nixon persona. Lee Atwater was brilliant in how he did this for the GOP. </comment>

<comment>What do you mean "the rest"?  There have only been two Republican presidents since Reagan - and they were father and son.</comment>

<comment>I'm including those candidates who did not win election</comment>

<comment>McCain and Romney weren't far right wing nuts.</comment>

<comment>No but they were patricians. Romney was born with a platinum spoon in his mouth and McCain wasn't exactly working class either.</comment>

<comment>Funny, his "connection to the American working class" is, in reality, a destructive one. Reagans lasting damage to the working class won't be forgotten by some, he's the godfather of the stagnation of the middle class. </comment>

<comment>Well I despised him.  First president I voted against.</comment>

<comment>Quoting Coates on the practice of history has Shakespearean levels of irony.</comment>

<comment>Coates documents thoroughly. You could look it up.</comment>

<comment>He writes his perceived OPINION of history.    That is what history is, the perceptions of what actually happened of the author.   It is not fact and that is why you can cite two different books about the SAME EVENT with two completely different interpretations.    What happened to Trayvon Martin?   Is there only one 'history" of this event?   Which of the several interpretations are actually the "real" history?</comment>

<comment>Which is what makes thorough documentation of sources so valuable. You get the historian's expert perspective on the history and the raw information should you choose to form your own opinion.Not every opinion has equal value.</comment>

<comment>It's no revelation that everyone has an 'OPINION'. Some opinions are more informed than others. Go to source documents, first hand accounts, contemporaneous reporting. Some things are open to interpretation and others really are facts.</comment>

<comment>He would have much more credibility if he were a college graduate with an area of study dependent on bona fide research skills, instead of filtering every sentence through a derivative fringe one-note militant black male selection of topics and facts.</comment>

<comment>The psychologists tell us we're all biased; it's only when someone's biases contrast with ours do we denounce him as "biased".  Of course Coates is biased, and (obsessively, perhaps) documents the crimes against his people in making the case for reparations, rather than, say, making the equally valid case that North America ought to be returned to it's original owners, or that the Turks should pay penalties to the Armenians, or the descendants of the Romans should repay the descendants of the Carthaginians, etc., etc., etc.  To those who don't share his POV, it may seem like a sterile academic exercise - though that may be just our biases talking - but it's his bloody shirt to wave, if he wants, and to the extent that academic exercises add to our understanding of the world, they are a useful means of reminding us of our biases.</comment>

<comment>Whether one calls tacking hard to the right while railing against the GOP establishment the strategy of Reagan or of Goldwater is purely a matter of preference, because it's the same strategy. The reason why no one is comparing this to triangulation, though, is that the two have nothing in common. Triangulation is moving towards the center while working within the established system of the party.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for the correction.My thinking was along the lines of building a coalition of rather unlike constituencies, those conventional wisdom doesn't recognize, and I incorrectly used triangulation out of ignorance.The point of my original post was it's not really Reagan's Party in the sense that Trump or Cruz's campaign are following a traditional strategy originally formulated by Reagan. Other narratives could be equally persuasive stories.</comment>

<comment>Reagan won a 49 state landslide. You'll never see this country that united again.</comment>

<comment>A ted cruz map would look more like Mondales</comment>

<comment>Not really. Anyone with an R or D next to their name is guaranteed 40-45% of the vote in a general election. </comment>

<comment>Agreed.  The eventual Republican nominee could stop campaigning the day after the National conference and still win:ID, MT, WY, UT, AZ, ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, TX, MO, AR, LA. MO, MS, AL, GA, SC, TN, KY, WV</comment>

<comment>So what about the other 200 electoral votes they'd need?</comment>

<comment>Goldwater and McGovern both missed that threshold. Mondale got 40% and won fewer states than both of those though.   </comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is the only candidate that can effectively combat the Clinton machine.  It would be a close fight, but Cruz would win.It's questionable whether someone like Trump even wants to be president.  Carson only wants to sell books.  Rubio is a boy playing a man's game.  Bush... lol.</comment>

<comment>Ted is beholden to his big donors, and he has poor communication skills.</comment>

<comment>Poor enough to defeat Trump in Iowa?</comment>

<comment>The bible thumpers of Iowa haven't picked a GOP winner in 40 years.</comment>

<comment>They're all winners in their own minds.</comment>

<comment>He is also a Canadian by birth and a naturalized American. It will hurt Cruz politically in the long run.</comment>

<comment>Cruz was born an American citizen and so by one interpretation a natural born citizen. His eligibility to be president is open to question, though.</comment>

<comment>Nope. He was born a Canadian citizen. He mother filed the application when Cruz was four y/o, after they moved to Virginia.Until he was four, the US had no idea he even existed. Even stil, he had to apply for his citizenship and meet qualifications. It was not automatic.Second, just because he is a citizen, does not qualify him to run for President. "Citizenship" and "natural born" are synonymous terms.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that Ted Cruz was a U.S. citizen at birth, even if he was also a Canadian citizen, because his mother was a U.S. citizen when he was born. As I said, his eligibility to be president is open to question, because the meaning of "natural born citizen" is uncertain.  </comment>

<comment>Nope. A person must apply for US citizenship if they are born outside the US. It is the easiest form of nationalization to get, but it is still issued by the State Department through the INS. If the Federal Government gives you your citizenship, you are "naturalized".</comment>

<comment>I agree 100% that since Reagan the Democrats have been the more moderate party.  That has all changed with Bernie Sanders and the recent surge of far left populism and racialism.  I no longer recognize my old party.</comment>

<comment>You are always welcome over here DEI ;)</comment>

<comment>I don't think I will be a Republican.  Trump is a true moderate and centrist, someone who can bridge the divide.  This is why they are so afraid of him.  The attacks from the far right against Trump are worse than those from the far left.  Trump just said over the weekend he would never leave people to die in the streets, lacking health insurance.  This is in stark contrast to Cruz and Rubio.</comment>

<comment>No matter what we do, people are sometimes going to die in the streets.  The question is whether we want hard working, good people to die in the streets, or should it be the slackers, hippies, and grifters?</comment>

<comment>Well, if you ignore that most of the uninsured poor are actually employed, then it makes it much easier to pretend they're all "slackers, hippies, and grifters" and treat them as second-class citizens. And, of course, one good illness renders them deeply in debt and likely unemployed so, hey, at least you have that going for you.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a narcissist whose only goal is to gain as much public attention for himself as he can.He has no policies, only notorious slogans.</comment>

<comment>Trump has very important policies.  He will end illegal immigration, yet he is not opposed to legal immigration.  We want the entire world's all stars.  We want people to ADD to the economy.  We do not want massive influx of unskilled peasants from just one single county who are illiterate in their own language and bring abnormally high rates of crime.</comment>

<comment>You aren't very old yet, are you?</comment>

<comment>Really, how will he end illegal immigration? Let me guess, he'll get Mexico to build a wall... ROFL! Because no country on earth, except for maybe North Korea has figured out how to end illegal immigrants. Did he promise to show you the unicorns he has back at the ranch too?</comment>

<comment>Stripped of slurs and prejudice many of Trump's ideas are worthwhile ... and moderate. He, and you, would be a lot more persuasive, at least to me, if you didn't promote inflammatory narratives that are demonstrably wrong.</comment>

<comment>I think if you tallied up the major media slurs against white blue collar Americans, Americans without college degrees, and people who support Trump, versus slurs by Trump against others, you would have a ratio of 100 to 1. The selective memory, amnesia and double standards expressed by Trump haters is obscene.</comment>

<comment>That's silly. No MSM outlet is calling Trump or his supporters murders and rapists, or bimbos, dogs and sluts on their period. Or suggesting that Trump or his supporters aren't Americans, and should be registered and surveilled.That's exactly the kind of crude, hyperbolic and factually incorrect talk that undermines his credibility and yours.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a true moderate and a centrist? Seriously? Have you even been paying attention? He encourages his supporters to assault people saying he will pay their court fees. He makes racist, bigoted, unConstitutional statements all the time. Clearly your idea of moderate is far different from mine.</comment>

<comment>C'mon, after McGovern and Dukakis, Bernie should look a little familiar.</comment>

<comment>Nice analysis.</comment>

<comment>I can see why Reagan was known as the 'Great Communicator'. I downloaded an app with him saying many of his quotes. Such a comforting, insightful, yet very strong leader.  It's kinda sad to think we've  not had someone like that in my adult life. 'Reagan's Party'seemed to be good people for the most part. </comment>

<comment>There are few men like Reagan in history.I too listen to old speeches at times.  He defines American ideals and culture as I believe in them.</comment>

<comment>This is the whole problem with Reagan. You remember his speeches but not his record or policies.  He said nice things about America, so things were good then.</comment>

<comment>I remember and became a Republican because of Reagan.Was he perfect?No, but no single person could be.</comment>

<comment>I think Trump is capturing Reagan's spirit.  I now finally understand Reagan.  When I stare into the abyss of a possible Sanders America, it is pretty scary.  We need someone who loves America in the White House.</comment>

<comment>Agreed , after 8 years of why America is so bad , we need someone who believes America  is good and is the greatest place in the world to live.</comment>

<comment>Obama was an experiment.  We wanted a national healer, a reconciliation, but what we got was The Great Divider.  Obama has never known normal people.  He is a progressive academic and his whole life has been submersed in radical politics.  It was a mistake.</comment>

<comment>An experiment gone completely wrong. Perhaps Trump could get us turned around and be a bridge to a better brighter future for all of us.</comment>

<comment>i disagree</comment>

<comment>Why?</comment>

<comment>I don't believe it's gone the way you believe it has.there's no point in getting into details; we're never going to agree.  just better to leave it where it is.  we disagree.</comment>

<comment>LOL, I gotta bridge to sell you if you believe that nonsense.</comment>

<comment>The GOP made any real progress virtually impossible.Reagan was drinking buddies with Tip O'Neilcan you imagine any Republican actually being friends with Obama on any kind of level and not getting immediately kicked out of the party?</comment>

<comment>Obama hasn't tried to make friends either.  As President, it is HIS job to create that environment.  You forgot to mention that.</comment>

<comment>Tell you what, I'll be the Republican Congress and you can be Obama. Now make me agree to anything. Spoiler alert: NO!</comment>

<comment>You can't be the republican Congress because you are a big time liberal  LOL</comment>

<comment>Anyone can be the Republican Congress: NO!See how easy it is? Now you try it!</comment>

<comment>OkFree stuff for everyone and we will make those mean rich guys pay for it .</comment>

<comment>NO! We Republicans are the party of free stuff for rich people and make the poor and middle class pay for it.</comment>

<comment>generalize much? LOL</comment>

<comment>What free stuff? I've yet to get an answer on this one...</comment>

<comment>There is no way to create an environment if people on the other side refuse to cooperate. Obama went out of his way at the beginning of his term to try to cultivate Republican support, but was shot down at every level.</comment>

<comment>No he did not. When members of the LEFTWING say the same thing, you know the gig is up.  Try again.</comment>

<comment>"Out of his way"?Are you alluding to inviting the Republicans to the White House to tell them, "I won"?</comment>

<comment>The only way he could have made "friends" with you was to say "Yes Massser" every time you spoke.Give me a break.</comment>

<comment>No, he was that way to His own party as well numbnuts.            http://prospect.org/article/wh...</comment>

<comment>Actually, he did. It was not publicized much in the press much but he had Republican congressional leaders over to the White House multiple times, played golf with McConnell and others, etc. He even tried to get Republicans into his cabinet and they refused. Now, when have Republicans ever reached out to Obama?</comment>

<comment>No, he didn't. When Paul Begala, a big time lib says so, you now the gig is up.</comment>

<comment>Define 'progress'.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  I get that.  But there is always going to be a loyal opposition.  Obama was never willing to compromise or reach across the aisle.  Has race ever been a more bitter and dividing issue in our country?  Just read the comments here.  It is now acceptable to hate white people openly.</comment>

<comment>No there was opposition before Obama even proposed a single thing.Virtually everything Obama did pass was a massive compromise.The stimulus was half tax cuts and way too small.  the ACA had no public option. He didn't just let the Bush tax cuts all expire.The fiscal cliff was a suicide pact the GOP decided they'd rather go through with than compromise.</comment>

<comment>....just like it's been pretty acceptable to openly hate african americans for the past 200 years?there's hate everywhere and it certainly wasn't started by obama.</comment>

<comment>No you are right but he utilized it to his advantage</comment>

<comment>just like your party?again, i disagree.   there's no point in explaining.  we'll just go back and forth with comments and will never agree.</comment>

<comment>Kinda like Congress and Obama</comment>

<comment>yes, unfortunately.</comment>

<comment>Total lie.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure a very large segment of the population would disagree with you.</comment>

<comment>Has race ever been a more bitter and dividing issue in our country? That's a sick joke, right? You have watched Selma, yes? And you think race relations are bad now? What about the years from 1620 to, say, 1968, when MLK was murdered? You think race relations in 2016 are worse? This is why it's difficult to have a dialogue.</comment>

<comment>So you are saying it has not been this bad since Jim Crow?</comment>

<comment>Half of Americans disapproved of interracial marriage as recently as the 1990s, a position that very few people hold today. Americans today are more racially tolerant and less racially divided than at any other time in the past, not just since Jim Crow.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, he was. Re-read statements coming from Republicans around the time Obamacare was passed. McConnell realized early that people don't pay attention to the particulars of the legislative process, and enforced discipline openly and ruthlessly to ensure no Republicans cooperated whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>We had a civil war over race and open violence during the Civil Rights Era. Race relations are not perfect today, but they are much improved over the past.</comment>

<comment>You're kidding right?</comment>

<comment>Yes he lived among the extreme liberal eggheads from the University of Chicago in Hyde Park  when he befriended Bill Ayers and launched his political career</comment>

<comment>You do know that Bill Ayers thing isn't true right, and has been debunked by a lot of people... Which is why you don't hear about it anymore... At all.</comment>

<comment>Oh its true alright . I live here . He was hand picked by Richie Daley on the advice of his good friend Bill Ayers to run for the state senate . I worked for the Daley machine . It was a done deal before ANYONE including you ever heard of BHO.</comment>

<comment>The fact that he would crush any Republican in 2016 is lost on you. The plain fact is that Obama's not a crazy right-winger. The only people who hate him are angry, poorly educated white people--the Republican base.</comment>

<comment>Like the only leftwing pukes who hated BUSH? hmm</comment>

<comment>The hate for Bush didn't really start until we found out he lied us into war and put it all on credit cards the Obama administration would have to pay down.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that even the New York Times has admitted that we found weapons of mass destruction?</comment>

<comment>Really? Where's the link? Oh that's right, we didn't find WMDs, we found some decades old gas canisters... Which is not why we went into Iraq, we went in because of yellow cake uranium. But you can keep playing that old song if you want.http://www.usnews.com/opinion/...</comment>

<comment>WMDs that were supplied to Saddam by the USA to use on Iranian civilians during the Iraq-Iran war. Ever wonder where the hard feelings come from. There are no good guys in this sorry tale.</comment>

<comment>No, pretty much everyone hated him.</comment>

<comment>No, just liberals.</comment>

<comment>^^white hatred.  this is what I mean...</comment>

<comment>So why isn't Michelle running to form a liberal  Obama dynasty?</comment>

<comment>Obama has been a very good president and not an "experiment". He has created little division, this nation has been very divided for some time and this no more evident than the Republican party. Let me guess, they tried to bridge the gap when they vowed to make Obama a 1-term president at all costs.</comment>

<comment>Refresh my memory...you're a Trump guy, yeah?</comment>

<comment>Still undecided  At this point I am a "anyone but Hillary" guy  ;)</comment>

<comment>Right, right. My bad. Although, given your other criteria, seems like Trump's campaign slogan would be a disqualifier ;)</comment>

<comment>He would not be my first choice but I could live with him.</comment>

<comment>I dig. I'd say he would not be my last choice, and is pretty low on the list of objectionable candidates on your side.</comment>

<comment>My first choice would be Kasich but alas wrong time wrong atmosphere.</comment>

<comment>Let me guess, you're one of those who thinks Obama doesn't love America.</comment>

<comment>Guessing just makes you look like a moron.</comment>

<comment>I paraphrase but BHO's "Only in America could my story be true" is hardly equivalent to "America is so bad".</comment>

<comment>Yes a game-changer president is the only way at this point. I feel like Trump, although rough around the edges, has a huge  heart for America. He has since his 30s. It seems real.</comment>

<comment>Can you tell us something that shows his huge heart before he ran?</comment>

<comment>It's called cardiomegaly.  It's caused by high blood pressure, among other things.  Not sure that it's something to boast about.</comment>

<comment>Like when he told us in 2004 that we should back in time to 2003 and not invade Iraq?  That was really, really helpful.</comment>

<comment>OK, I'll agree that's one thing, and that attitude would help us and he's better than the other Republicans that way.</comment>

<comment>I mean, he was apparently against or at least apprehensive about the Iraq War from the start, but he showed zero leadership on the issue at the time.  Needless to say, he's happy to make up for that now by taking all the credit for being against it and pretending as if he took a bold stance back then.He did help get five black teens in New York City falsely accused and convicted of rape, though, so it's not that he's completely lacking in the ability to take initiative.</comment>

<comment>Things like paying off  a stranger couple's mortgage when they stopped to help his driver on the side of the road. He has helped a lot of people with various things like that.</comment>

<comment>"I think Trump is capturing Reagan's spirit."You are very, very badly deluding yourself.Reagan came across as a statesman.  Trump is just a vulgar schoolyard bully.</comment>

<comment>Trump punches back at bullies.  He is a good American.  The corrupt media is the bully.</comment>

<comment>As I previously stated, you're badly, badly, badly deluding yourself, confusing a statesman with a common boor.</comment>

<comment>Trump IS THE BULLY.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a huge bully himself. He punches back at anyone who dares to criticize or contradict him. That alone shows he is far too thin-skinned to be president.</comment>

<comment>Wow, you've gone off the deep-end, seriously. You don't live in reality if you think Trump captures Reagan's spirit. Reagan would roll over in his grave if he could hear you say that. And you don't think Obama loves America? What on earth do you base that on? Why would be become president and go through all that and do all that he has done if he didn't love this country?</comment>

<comment>you might want to do a bit more historical research.</comment>

<comment>I studied him well in school and my dad  gave me a nice coffee table book that I enjoy reading - 'Ronald Reagan A Life in Photographs'. </comment>

<comment>um, ok</comment>

<comment>That photo book wouldn't have shown you that Barry Goldwater was the ideological predecessor to Reagan.  Reagan refined and repackaged Goldwater.  But the conservative core -- Reagan's principles -- continued to have the unyielding, Western conservatism inherited from Goldwater.You Trump supporters always seem to forget Goldwater's impact on the party.  Trump has Reagan's packaging -- I'll give you that -- but not his principles.  Photos and packaging are a poor way to judge candidates.If you judge on principles, I guarantee that you would give Ted Cruz a second a look.  Yes, the packaging is less than ideal.  But please think more about the big picture.</comment>

<comment>I like these anecdotes.  We need more normal people commenting around here.</comment>

<comment>Too much hatefulness now.</comment>

<comment>I agree, so why are you still here ;-)</comment>

<comment>Look at the pretty pics, lol Sarah. Your opinion on Reagan was drawn from a picture book. Did the pics at least have captions?</comment>

<comment>go easy on her; she's young.i think.  i hope.</comment>

<comment>Yes lots of info with great photos. Your new Avi is silly :(</comment>

<comment>I'd say the avatar is quite accurate.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is the next Reagan, but better.</comment>

<comment>No, Ted Cruz is no Reagan. Not by a long shot. For starters, Reagan wasn't a demagogue that believed the best way to change the government was to first bankrupt it. Reagan acknowledged the hard work of immigrants, both legal and illegal, and supported a path to citizenship. These two men are nothing alike.</comment>

<comment>double post</comment>

<comment>He was good at communicating, so what. Honestly is that what we judge presidencies on? Iran-Contra makes benghazi look like the nothing that it is, not to mention the Beirut Marines bombing, not to mention the dirty wars in Latin America, or the increase in deficit spending. An actor was good at talking, great. Not to mention the role he played in the current mess in Afghanistan.</comment>

<comment>Reagan was the best at leadership and working well with others, strong economy & strong military. Clinton and Obama - dishonesty and scandals. Obama 'my way or the highway' doesn't work with others, divisiveness & no leadership. </comment>

<comment>A group of people who vowed to put party over country and block every single thing Obama tried to do is what set the stage for his administration.And an endless string of fake scandals that would not have been attempted on a white president didn't help.</comment>

<comment>Wow. Accusing Obama of using "my way or the highway" tactics against the GOP controlled congress is a mind boggling exercise in pot calling kettle. The man bent over backwards trying to find middle ground with a party whose only policy was to oppose him.</comment>

<comment>yet you seem to ignore iran contra scandal.</comment>

<comment>All cons do, if they dont, they go out of their way to polish the turd Reagan presidency.</comment>

<comment>and how he totally ignored what was then described as "gay cancer" (aids) practically his entire 2 terms.</comment>

<comment>Well, in fairness, he was in the midst of full-on Alzheimer's disease in his second term. We don't know what he ignored versus what he just forgot by that point.</comment>

<comment>good point.</comment>

<comment>Are you suggesting that we don't have a strong military? Reagan is from a different time, he would be called an establishment loser by Trump.</comment>

<comment>Before they were corrupt. Yes military was strong with Reagan. And it scared off our enemies. Only little skirmishes with Reagan in office.</comment>

<comment>Well, there was the whole Cold War thing that kept things in balance. Ask the people affected by Reagan's dirty wars how they feel about the little skirmishes, or look at the mess in Afghanistan that Reagan's CIA helped create with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The thing that scared off our (basically one real) enemy was nuclear war, and that threat existed regardless of who was in office. We have by far the best, and best funded, military in the world and it is not even close. What more can you really want?</comment>

<comment>But it's so outdated and scarce - look it up.</comment>

<comment>What is scarce? What is outdated? I don't understand what you mean.</comment>

<comment>don't bother with her.  i don't think she's playing with a full deck.</comment>

<comment>so you're saying our military is now corrupt?and were you alive when ronnie was president?</comment>

<comment>No it's outdated today. Alive - yes</comment>

<comment>i didn't ask you if it was outdated.  i asked you if you thought it was corrupt.   let's review:"Before they were corrupt."</comment>

<comment>And you don't think the military is strong now? Based on what measurement, exactly?</comment>

<comment>One word: Actor.</comment>

<comment>So even a B level actor can run our country better than life-time politicians. Shows how out of touch and shielded they are from reality. </comment>

<comment>I don't believe he ran it that well, and we're still paying a terrible price for Reaganomics.</comment>

<comment>Reagan had real charisma. He could insult your grandmother and make it sound comforting and inspiring. And he was also witty. The moment he really won the hearts of all Americans was when he was shot and they wheeled him into the operating room. "I hope you're all good Republicans," he joked with the doctors. The man who could say something that funny and relaxed when his life was in danger was a man most people felt comfortable following and trusting with control over the nuclear "panic button."I vividly recall watching him speeches on TV and cheering what he said, then reacting with shock when I read the words in the newspaper the next morning. "He said that? I don't agree with that!" But I found it impossible to dislike him, even when I strongly disagreed with his policies.Reagan also looked presidential. He wore beautifully tailored suits and was not afraid of bold, confident patterns and colors. Today's politicians in their uniforms and flag pins look like airline employees by contrast.</comment>

<comment>He had it all it seems. :)</comment>

<comment>Obviously not enough because Reagan was a LOT more pragmatic and less ideology driven while an incredibly positive and always optimistic.Reagan knew compromise was part of democracy, these bafoons do not.</comment>

<comment>you have no idea how tough a negotiator Reagan was, he only backed off on the things that he didn't care about.  Some of those items ended up biting him later.</comment>

<comment>I don't?Hmm.</comment>

<comment>Eh, Reagan was actually at least as conservative as today's Republicans. And at least as ideological. Who today in the Republican party says that the progressive tax has "no moral justification" and that it was "hatched in the Communist revolution" (Reagan, 1958)? Who today would call JFK a Marxist (Reagan, 1960)? If Reagan governed pragmatically it was only because he had to. Besides that, he was preternaturally talented at making compromises look as though they were forced upon him by shifty and disingenuous liberals.</comment>

<comment>I don't think he would recognize the party today, and frankly would be considered a RINO by today's standards.</comment>

<comment>no he wouldn't be.</comment>

<comment>What Reagan did in his use of dog whistling and similar politicians is that they set the precedent for candidates like Trump and Cruz.Whatever it's other failings, the traditional conservatives always kept the John Birch types and similar racists at bay. Likewise, whatever their other flaws, the Eisenhower Republicans largely accepted the New Deal and ideas like Keynesian economics.Nixon pioneered the use of the so called "Southern Strategy", pushing the Republican Party to the extreme conservative side over time. Even then, Nixon did pass quite a few things that would be regarded today as progressive.With Reagan (although to be fair, Carter also deserves a lot of blame), the New Deal acceptance changed. Economic warfare on behalf of the rich was disguised with social issues. Clinton, both Bushes, and even Obama continued that. Inequality has been rising.Over the past few decades, we've seen that worsen. Eventually, the GOP base would wake up and recognize that the Establishment had played them for fools, taking their votes for granted. Now we have people like Cruz, who reflect that demographic. </comment>

<comment>What a bunch of Progressive hogwash.</comment>

<comment>Truth hurts. Magic feels better. Studies show that conservatives believe in magic. Look it up.</comment>

<comment>Judging from an array of your comments of late,  truth and yourself have never been introduced to each other ;)</comment>

<comment>What about that whole birther thing and what it says about conservatives? Why don't you people want to acknowledge simple reality?</comment>

<comment>Oh, some of them still believe that claptrap...</comment>

<comment>Hopefully you weren't charged long distance for that phoned in comment: it's not even worth the price of a local call.</comment>

<comment>Great comment, but there is no reason to use the reflexive here.  If this were a debate, you would have lost a few points.</comment>

<comment>Cruz's nasty trick against Ben Carson proves what a SOB he really is.  Once people hear about this, it is over.  Cruz is a Canadian.</comment>

<comment>I can't believe that was done. What a low blow for Ben and others. Cruz was the one that was most likely to gain. And Trump could have been #1 - who knows.</comment>

<comment>Come on thats no worse than Karl Rove did dozens of times</comment>

<comment>I think that once everyone hears about this, it will sound like Trump whining.CNN made the mistake, Cruz's people got the work out, no one changed their vote (would you without checking?)Time to move on, this does not really matter.</comment>

<comment>Oh there you are. HAHAHAHAHAHA your boy almost came in third to Gang of Eight Rubio</comment>

<comment>I knew you would be trolling for Cruz.  Hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>I think it was genius, as all he did was forward bad information from an esteemed news source, Sure he knew what he was doing but CNN gave him the deniability, it was brilliant! Now his voter report card was pure sleeze........</comment>

<comment>He is a senator, but his own party sees him, as, well, a loser, no? I mean https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker...</comment>

<comment>No one likes Cruz.</comment>

<comment>It's better to be feared than loved.</comment>

<comment>If you want to be a dictator, then sure...</comment>

<comment>Not even his daughter https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Why are you attacking my daughter? That's low.</comment>

<comment>Anyone whose had kids knows how that goes.</comment>

<comment>Most of the children I kiss aren't so resistant.  My daughter is at that age, and her mother spoils her.  Oh well.</comment>

<comment>Man, it's not the rejection of the first kiss, it's the look of intense rage and insistent second kiss that creep the f*ck out of me.</comment>

<comment>Cruz has a sociopathic emotional response. I know exactly how he feels when denied his right and/or made to look bad by his things because I am also an emotional sociopath.We are both quite high functioning, but never mistake us for good guys.</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>Lol, she seemed disgusted.</comment>

<comment>No one, except the majority of the Republican Iowa Caucuses.</comment>

<comment>Cruz got a majority?  Must be prog math there.</comment>

<comment>Wrong again.  The governor of Iowa (sorry, buddy) and all of Congress disagree.  They prefer you over me, because they know I'd pursue TRUE CONSERVATIVE policies, while you'd give people what they want without regard to principles.</comment>

<comment>Serious question: if you abolish the IRS and institute a flat 10% tax, how do you file taxes? Seriously.</comment>

<comment>File directly with the Treasury. Use stamps and an envelope or file online.  No need for the bloated IRS gravy train.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't you then need to grow the Treasury Department to perform this function? Or do you think we should ask workers to do more for the same pay?</comment>

<comment>Do more for the same pay.  They're not doing enough as it is.  And their role would be purely administrative.</comment>

<comment>what do you think the IRS does?You'd be paying different people to do the same jobIE changing nothing but the name on the door</comment>

<comment>I think that people at the IRS harass not-for-profits, that's what they do.  The whole operation could be a lost smaller if they were just processing filings.</comment>

<comment>so we don't  have enforcement of standards?I'm sure everyone will be totally honest on their tax returns</comment>

<comment>Really, you think that is what the IRS is doing? Wow... Amazing how much the media shrinks people's brains.</comment>

<comment>How to determine the cost of goods sold in calculating net revenue? Are capital items expensed or depreciated? If depreciated, how to determine which are capital, and what is their useful life? If there is no IRS, who makes those determinations? That's how you know Ted Cruz is a lying fraud. No businessman in his right mind believes this shtick. Cruz won't and can't abolish the IRS. That's just another lie to advocate for enriching the already rich. They've given him tens of millions in donations, and they expect to make a return on their investment.</comment>

<comment>these are simple accounting questions, you don't need 100,000 people working on this stuff.the law sets the rules, anyone can program this.</comment>

<comment>Asking a serious question to a troll account is unlikely to produce the desired result.</comment>

<comment>Not a troll account.</comment>

<comment>Not really, they all hate him to the core. Listen what other people in Congress say about him, even Republicans...</comment>

<comment>I'd disagree that Obama has continued to increase inequality, he's only tried to reverse that trend.</comment>

<comment>People should be talking more about what Ted Cruz's campaign did to Ben Carson.Spreading false rumors about Carson supposedly dropping out, right before the polls opened.Is this the way a holy religious Evangelical man is supposed to behave?</comment>

<comment>It was a low blow and there is no way of knowing how many votes it earned him .</comment>

<comment>That may have made a big impact with people switching off of him at the last minute. Poor Ben. </comment>

<comment>Ben Carson is such an ethical, dignified man. It is ESPECIALLY disgusting to target HIM.I am a Trump supporter - if Cruz did that to Trump, it would be unethical, but at least Trump is willing to get down into the gutter with people like Cruz and sling mud right back. ( That does not bother me in the slightest, BTW - politics is a dirty game).But to do that to Ben Carson - of ALL people?</comment>

<comment>His legendary knife fight at the OK Corral</comment>

<comment>WTF?</comment>

<comment>You know, he stabbed someone then went on to bigger better things.</comment>

<comment>Yes, we all know that Carson was an idiot to bring up his distant past - but let's be real about this.</comment>

<comment>Especially when it wasn't actually his past...</comment>

<comment>Stop treating Ben like he's a defenseless child.   He came to the big fight, so he needs to put up his hands and stop crying for help from Trump.</comment>

<comment>Oh shut up. Nobody is saying Ben is a defenseless child.We are merely noting that Cruz's hypocrisy as a holy-roller is all the more monstrous, since he picked on a guy who is PARTICULARLY ethical and dignified.</comment>

<comment>Being holy doesn't mean playing in the sand box like a child.Flailing around like Trump while whining about a hard fight it weak sauce.</comment>

<comment>Jesus wouldn't have done Ben dirty like Cruz did him.</comment>

<comment>I'm not Jesus.  I'm a believer in Jesus who lives in an imperfect world.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for informing us that you are not Jesus.</comment>

<comment>Yes that's what the GOP need this time. Trump is better at playing their game. I liked Romney, but he was almost too nice. </comment>

<comment>This is what it sounds like when Trump supporters cry.Cruz 2016 & Cruz 2020</comment>

<comment>The fact that your avatar of a Presidential candidate you support is a play on the name of a notorious child murderer speaks volumes.</comment>

<comment>You have to crack a few eggs to make an omelette.  And sometimes you just feel like cracking eggs for the hell of it.Don't act like everything is unicorns and rainbows, libby.  Your own president cracks eggs every day with his drones.</comment>

<comment>Are you a Cruz supporter who also likes John Wayne Gacy, or just a troll. (:-)</comment>

<comment>I don't like John Wayne Gacy.  The point is that you can't be uncomfortable doing hard things, and taking hard steps.  Hilary Clinton is ruthless.  Ted Cruz is ruthless.  We need ruthless to keep the country together and to move us back towards conservative principles.Besides, people say nasty things about Cruz all the time.  Libbies call him a "psycho."  What I'm doing is re-appropriating that insult; it's a tactic the libbies should understand.</comment>

<comment>Are you assuming that Ted Cruz is a holy religious Evangelical man?  I've always assumed that Mammon and Power are his twin dieties.</comment>

<comment>you meant to say CNN starting rumors</comment>

<comment>Oh sure - that's why Cruz has already publicly acknowledge his campaign's responsibility.</comment>

<comment>they should have known that CNN was spreading lies?</comment>

<comment>How convenient for the Cruz camp. Always point the finger elsewhere.Yeah, just take a report about flying to Florida - and magically transform that into dropping out of the race.What a steaming load of horsesh*t.</comment>

<comment>this is calling it quits, the reporter knew it as did anyone in politics"Carson won't go to NH/SC, but instead will head home to Florida for some R&R. He'll be in DC Thursday for the National Prayer Breakfast."CNN reported that he quit, Cruz people forwarded, stop whining. Carson people would check anyway before changing their vote.</comment>

<comment>Stop spinning lies for evil politicians.</comment>

<comment>Where in that quote does it say Carson was quitting the race?It doesn't . Cruz was playing dirty politics. Since Carson isn't going to be a factor for much longer anyway it really doesn't matter much. I am rooting for Cruz to win the nomination. All good progressives should be.</comment>

<comment>Needs a little analysis but any political person would read it that way. No one leaves the trail for a bit and comes back.No matter who the republicans nominate, I thinks this one is in the bag. </comment>

<comment>Sounds about right</comment>

<comment>If Trump keeps this whining up, he'll be saying the same thing Nov 9th as Hillary starts her transition.Trump was outplayed on the ground, not all calls are reviewable and there are no mulligans in politics.Take your delegates from Iowa, man up and go to New Hampshire.</comment>

<comment>This isn't about Trump - it is about Cruz.  Your spin is pointless.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is fine with it and has moved on, suggest everyone else should too</comment>

<comment>WTF? Cruz is fine with it? What a dumb comment.</comment>

<comment>Sorry,  He's playing the next inning,  not worried about what's already in the books.</comment>

<comment>It isn't the way they should behave. It is the way all these mealy mouthed faux bible thumpers do behave. Keep religion out of politics like the founding fathers tried to do.</comment>

<comment>My guess is that Reagan wouldn't have believed that Obama was a Kenyan born Muslim. However, nearly half of current Republicans believe exactly that. Reagan's revolution was to tap into the magical, fact-free thinking so pervasive on the right. This thinking is the root cause of why America resembles a third world country in many respects. Fantasies die hard in cultural islands.</comment>

<comment>Revisionist history at its finest.</comment>

<comment>Please Google "magical thinking among conservatives." Truth.</comment>

<comment>Lol. Sometimes it's better if you don't touch the keyboard, dude. Your stupidity remains bottled, and you don't look like a dumb**s.</comment>

<comment>Reagen won 49 states. You don't do that with magical thinking. He was incredibly popular.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, and that doesn't mean he was a good president. Just a great spin artist.</comment>

<comment>There is one good thing about Reagan.  He's dead.  Nothing better than dead Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Just another tolerant and compassionate liberal: Tim the MFER lowlife.</comment>

<comment>Yes, because this person is clearly a troll but fits into your preconceived viewpoints so you believe it. Funny how that works, but I suspect it's because that is how you feel about Liberals. Oh don't worry, I see all the vile and hate that Conservatives spout all the time... But as soon as someone who might be a Liberal says something naughty you go all virgin ears...</comment>

<comment>Thanks Dr. Phil.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing better than guys like you showing what most libs really think .</comment>

<comment>And what they really are inside. Sickening human beings.</comment>

<comment>Sickening humans are sickening humans. Political leanings don't account for it.Maybe this is the wrong place to be reasonable, though.</comment>

<comment>Well, when  liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are.</comment>

<comment>So it's not sickening if conservatives do the same thing?</comment>

<comment>No.</comment>

<comment>Well, at least you're honest a rare quality for Conservative.</comment>

<comment>Sort of like find a honest Democrat.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who says something like that is disgusting. you can disagree about politics, but wishing someone dead is beyond the call.</comment>

<comment>That's...my point. The problem with oldboy is that he's a dick.</comment>

<comment>i'm glad hitler, stalin, and bin laden are dead.wouldn't you agree?you might want to rephrase the above comment.</comment>

<comment>Totally out of context.  You might want to try better next time in a more adult manner than a childish one.  Pathetic.</comment>

<comment>"Well, when liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."my response is in no way out of context to your original comment.sorry.</comment>

<comment>It is out of context, and it is disgusting. Comparing a Dead Reagan and Americans who are Repubs to HITLER and the other sociopaths by wishing them dead is NOT a good comparison you sick SOB.  Pathetic.</comment>

<comment>That comparison is only in your own mind.</comment>

<comment>No, it is in your actual comments.</comment>

<comment>no it's not, you idiot.next time, clarify your comment, it's not rocket science.   here's an example you can try next time you get your panties in a bunch.""Well, when liberals wish REPUBLICANS dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."you would be correct if you had replaced the word "people" with republicans."like i said; not rocket science.</comment>

<comment>Timothy Johnson  • a day agoThere is one good thing about Reagan.  He's dead.  Nothing better than dead Republicans.That is the comment that I responded to very clearly you MFER.   YOU apparently cannot read.  Wishing REPUBS dead, one's fellow AMERICANS, is sick and demented. Play your fracking "word" games elsewhere you MFER.</comment>

<comment>the comment you reposted is irrelevant to what we're discussing.THIS is what you said:  "Well, when liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."Look, it's all here for everyone to see and it's not our fault that you're unable to accept your failure at clarifying comments.</comment>

<comment>"Well, when liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."  That is right. LIBERALS wishing people dead are  happy about it is SICK you stupid imbecile. What is wrong with you?</comment>

<comment>so i'm sick for wishing hitler dead?  osama bin laden?are you unhappy they are dead?you've got to be trolling at this point.  there's no way you can't see what you're doing here. LOL</comment>

<comment>pragDem  usaeagle1776  • a day agoi'm glad hitler, stalin, and bin laden are dead.wouldn't you agree?you might want to rephrase the above comment.Your comment sent to ME. And then you typed:  " you might want to rephrase the above comment."  REPHRASE my comment about what TIM JOHNSON said that DEAD REPUBS was even better?????  You are either very confused or retarded. And then your above comment about Hitler and Stalin...as if that was some sort of rebuke to me objecting to TIM JOHNSON'S vile comment, that objecting to that is the same as what you inferred??  The only one "Trolling" is you, since you butted in on my comment to TIM JOHNSON in the first place.</comment>

<comment>um, no.last time.  let's all give this faux patriot one more chance!  (because seriously?  a bald eagle and 1776? hahahahahaha)you said:   "Well, when liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."NO WHERE IN YOUR ABOVE COMMENT DO YOU CLARIFY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DEAD REPUBLICANS SPECIFICALLY; NO WHERE.your above comment isn't objecting to tim's comment.  if it was, you would have said dead republicans and not just people.good luck, moron.</comment>

<comment>You are quite simply the most idiotic imbecile on the internet.  I KNOW what I was typing, not you, you snobbish MFER.  I am not going to modify my thoughts or how I word my comments in repsonding to other commentators in what I find objectionable! What a fucktard idiot. Go play your word games elsewhere you infant.  GOOD LUCK MORON.</comment>

<comment>Forget this moron Eagle. He or she or whatever IT is, is just ticked off you owned and slammed it's a**.</comment>

<comment>Anyone with a brain would know what you are talking about, except that dumba** idiot.</comment>

<comment>i know, truth hurts, but i have faith you'll get over it."Well, when liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."i'm a sick person.  i'm glad hitler, pol pot, and osama bin laden are dead.  looks like the vast majority of americans are sick people as well.shame on you liking hitler. :)</comment>

<comment>Which you inserted that had ZERO to do with my comment which you BUTTED in on, about some one wishing REPUBS dead, which is what I objected too.  You injected you idiotic comment that had ZERO to do with what I was making an issue about.  Idiot.</comment>

<comment>well then why did you say that?"Well, when liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."Why didn't you say Republicans?</comment>

<comment>Timothy Johnson  • a day agoThere is one good thing about Reagan.  He's dead.  Nothing better than dead Republicans.WOW.... amazing.</comment>

<comment>i know that's what he said.   and you responded:"Well, when liberals wish people dead or are happy they are dead, that is sickening, no matter where you are."do you not see your utter failure at responding to him on this message board?   do you just blithely assume that everyone is going to understand it's context?you simply could have replaced the word people with republicans using the edit function provided to you by disqus,  but no, you chose to argue with me and let that generalized insult towards people who may not think the same as you linger.</comment>

<comment>I know what I MEANT. You are the one who was confused, not me. I know what I am thinking when I type a comment.  Get lost, I am tired of talking to your dumba**.</comment>
