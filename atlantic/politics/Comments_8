<comment>This will be the last article about Iowa until January 2018. Enjoy it folks!Peace, peace at last!</comment>

<comment>GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!</comment>

<comment>The smell of pig farms and the subsidy of energy damaging ethanol from corn. </comment>

<comment>Not true. The report about the new Trump family farm he promised he would buy :)</comment>

<comment>In the case of Bernie and Hill, there is no way that the party machinery is not involved in a close tie (if tie, it goes to Hill, because it will be too close for anyone to be the wiser).</comment>

<comment>The fact that her lead is smaller than the number of delegates she won by coin flip, I'm thinking it might not be the best strategy for her to call it a win.  Humility will garner her more support from Bernie voters in the general election.</comment>

<comment>Sanders obviously won the most ungodly areas. Communism and Atheism are two peas in an immoral pod.</comment>

<comment>What a strange mix Iowa has . Evangelicals and socialist ruled the day .</comment>

<comment>As a resident of western Illinois, I can tell you that the political affiliations of Iowans, and their(the affiliations) geographic distribution is absolutely nothing like those in Illinois. It's a completely different world over there, politically.</comment>

<comment>Spoken like someone who's clueless about both communism and atheism.</comment>

<comment>Yuck! My least favorite religions.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for proving my point. Neither are religions.</comment>

<comment>No, they're diseases.</comment>

<comment>People like you are the disease.</comment>

<comment>I'm glad to see that someone who is not religious and doesn't pretend to be is doing well in this campaign. I'm pretty tired of all these candidates who say that god called them to run. It is such obvious pandering, and really should have nothing to do with electing a president. If you want to be Pope or Imam, then invoke God. If you want to be president, discuss real issues impacting real people.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, it's very difficult to get off to a good start in the GOP nomination race without pandering to the religious idiots. icons order myself a conservative, who would love to see the GOP kick the religious zealots, Warhawks and corporatist goons out of the party. You can speak to socially conservative values without performing like a baptist snake charmer.A Conservative party that is anti-illegal immigration, pro limited-legal immigration, trade protectionist, worships efficient government instead of trying to lower taxes while still spending like a drunk housewife, Anti-interventionist, reduces the absurd lifetime VA benefits for soldiers who were NOT in combat, protects basic social safety net programs and can find a balance between insuring everyone whine still involving some free market principles to provide competitive pricing and service quality, takes a easy to read stance on abortion (like, abortion is legal before 4 months, illegal afterwards except in cases of abuse, encourages free birth control as a way to cut down on the need for abortions), simplification of the tax code, while ensuring EVERYONE pays a minimum percentage, with a sliding scale based on income, so that the wealthiest are paying closer to what they've paid in the past. Spend money on the sciences, education and healthcare, while reducing fruitless weapons contracts that yield nothing after hundreds of billions and a decade of bureaucratic waste. Simplify the drug war by shooting anyone crossing the border illegally on site. Hang convicted drug importers and reduce sentences for users while opting instead for treatment programs. Cut foreign aid to every foreign nation until our deficit is erased. Only give aid when absolutely needed to secure peace and further American interests with measure able results. Cut all military and financial aid to Israel; they have PLENTY of weapons and money.These are REAL conservative values instead of the neo-con, zealot, Israel worshipping oligarch serving Warhawks that dominate the GOP today.Even people like Palin, Cruz, Huckabee etc... Who say they will fight for the little guy and defy the big corporate interests? Well, that's hard to do when they're still all WAR HAWKS and ZIONISTS.A conservative party that stops worshipping Reagan and Nixon and returns to its values as the civil rights and personal liberties leader, small government leader, non-interventionist leader etc., while also embracing some of the better aspects of the liberals such as protecting a social safety net as we have seen that a net can prevent crime and can help build people up and help end cycles of poverty, along with some trade protectionism and labor rights  is what is needed in America today to rebuild a middle class, get the lower class working productively, and return Anerica to its pre-Vietnam trajectory, where the good years have been the result of war and financial bubbles, with the exception of high tech in the mid 80s-late 90s, which was a legitimate upswing... Even though that too was turned into a bubble by over speculation.Would the values i mentioned above not be far more Christian than the values espoused by so called Christians like Cruz? What's Christian about getting involved in wars for unclear reasons? What's Christian about denouncing welfare programs, when true welfare programs atr a smaller part of the US budget than the interest we pay on our debt? Yeah, welfare needs to be worked on, so people can't just pop out 3 kids and sit around and watch springer all day, but we really don't want a society where people can't get help when they really do need it.- disgruntled independent</comment>

<comment>I never thought Satan existed until I saw Ted Cruz in action -- in the Senate and in Iowa. I am absolutely sure he is the Devil Incarnate.</comment>

<comment>Well, suddenly the video of his daughter recoiling from a kiss makes sense.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Hey now.  Can we focus on the issues?It's my right to spank or kiss the young ones as I will.  I won't have folks like you second guessing me.</comment>

<comment>I'd say it was a big victory for human-like beings.  If elected, Ted Cruz would be the first Almost-Human (TM) to serve.</comment>

<comment>It was a victory for people tired of the establishment.  The people won.  The Constitution won.  Christians won.You're scared and miserable, as you should be.</comment>

<comment>It's important, because it's the first time a winner from one party stood up to the massive corporate welfare in Iowa - the Democrat candidates, as the party of oligarchs and big business, are just fine with corporate welfare, but Cruz won opposing the ethanol subsidy, showing that it is possible to stand up for people against the corporatism that has infected both parties.</comment>

<comment>Trump voters suffered from low turnout, and a lot turned around and went for Rubio. If that trend continues in New Hampshire, the polls now look something like:Donald Trump - 27%John Kasich - 17%Marco Rubio - 14%Ted Cruz - 14%Rubio and Cruz get a big bump from Iowa. Trump does not. Trump functions off of tough talk and free airtime, and the primary is about to swing away from that. It remains to be seen if Kasich, Rubio, or Cruz can close the gap. The race is far from over, but Trump no longer looks dominant.</comment>

<comment>Ground game will not be as important in a traditional primary like NH. It will be interesting to see whose votes Rubio can pull</comment>

<comment>I think you're confusing ground game vs caucusing. Ground game is knocking on doors, it matters everywhere. New Hampshire has town halls in place of caucuses as the place where decisions get made - I think that works even less in favor of Trump.</comment>

<comment>Ground game in Iowa involves a lot more than knocking on doors, its having someone at every caucus to speak for your candidate (Trump didnt) its a get out the vote that involves busing people long distances (sometimes from other states) NH has a traditional primary, secret voting in public places with no campaigning allowed within 100ft of the polls.</comment>

<comment>Oh, I understand. Trump definitely didn't participate in the caucuses the way he should and suffered. Private voting definitely means people will be less persuaded from Trump to otherwise, but at the same time, Trump is a rally candidate in a town hall state.</comment>

<comment>Expect Rubio's campaign donations from the party establishment to soar. They all, rightfully, hate Cruz and want to derail his campaign. Rubio now looks like a viable choice for them.</comment>

<comment>Trump did not suffer from low turnout. He had the second highest vote total for any caucus candidate ever. He lost to a better ground game.</comment>

<comment>He did do very well. But he didn't meet his or others expectations. Having a bad ground game loses you elections.</comment>

<comment>So Sanders is winning among Obama supporters, the less religious, and more educated. Hillary is winning among rural, less educated, and more religious. They must think she's a Republican.</comment>

<comment>I can't imagine why they would think that given how similar most of her positions are to Sanders. In addition they're both old, both white, and both want more government spending and regulation.  About the only appreciable difference is Hillary is more likely to bomb some Middle Eastern place.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they're paying attention to what she actually has done over the years (Iraq, Patriot Act, Bankruptcy, TPP, etc.) rather than just what she now is saying she will do in the future.</comment>

<comment>Killary is the disease, not the cure.</comment>

<comment>Similar? One wants a single payer health care system, the other doesn't. One wants to break up the big banks, the other doesn't. One wants to invade other countries, the other doesn't. One thinks it's OK to accept bribes, the other doesn't. If you can't see the difference between these two candidates, then you must living in a cave or watching Fox News.</comment>

<comment>I don't know, but I'm truly terrified that an actual socialist would poll so well in a place like Iowa.  I guess "free stuff" is a compelling message.  It's too bad this isn't 15 years from now when I'm retired and won't be the one paying for it.</comment>

<comment>Iowa has been pretty much a Dem stronghold. You wont see a Republican Candidate back there until 2020.</comment>

<comment>I don't know about that, they have a Republican governor, the Republicans have a 14 seat majority in their House, and the Democrats have a 2 seat majority in their Senate.</comment>

<comment>It's a pretty solidly purple state.</comment>

<comment>Maybe within those 15 years you can learn what socialism is and not embarrass yourself. Our military is socialist, and you don't hate our troops, do you?</comment>

<comment>Our military is a command economy? So what is Lockheed and Boeing doing with them then?</comment>

<comment>We have different militaries competing with each other? We don't pool our tax money to pay for it?> So what is Lockheed and Boeing doing with them then?Is Lockheed and Boeing an official part of the military?</comment>

<comment>Just because it's funded with taxes doesn't mean it's socialism. Socialism is a controlled market, not a free market. The "customer" and the "producer" are the same thing and allocate resources.The military is the "customer" of contractors. They outsource tons of manufacturing, R&D, etc. in a regulated semi-free market. That's not socialism. A socialist military is the USSR or China.</comment>

<comment>> Just because it's funded with taxes doesn't mean it's socialism.Nope.Socialism"any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods"http://www.merriam-webster.com...Got someone more authoritative than Webster's?> The military is the "customer" of contractors.Socialist entities can use capitalist means to buy something. But until different militaries compete using private money and without the government, it's still socialist.> A socialist military is the USSR or China.I don't know of any "private" military service, so I suppose they are. We're a mixed economy, so hopefully you're not going the "we're a capitalist country" route.</comment>

<comment>I'm going with economic theory, not dictionary definitions. Socialism is not about whether or not you're the government. That's mistaking it for its political theory counterpart - communism - which is when the government is the chief socialist manager of a command economy.Socialism is an economic way of doing things: it's where the consumers of a good or service controls the production and distribution of a good or service.The military isn't socialist. Do soldiers decide where they're deployed? Do they decide what equipment the military buys? Do they decide who makes it?You can have perfectly privatized socialism in co-ops, which is the original implementation of socialism - a bunch of farmers grow crops and decide how to divide everything, and how much the crops are worth.We are in fact a mixed economy, that leans heavily free market (at least compared to most European nations).</comment>

<comment>> I'm going with economic theory, not dictionary definitions.[citation needed] And tax money is economics. Also the President, an elected official is head of the military. Also see how I've shown we don't have a capitalistic military.> The military isn't socialist. Do soldiers decide where they're deployed?Do the soldiers in USSR or China decide where they're deployed? I guess they're not socialist militaries either. Also your example has nothing to do with economics.> a bunch of farmers grow crops and decide how to divide everything, and how much the crops are worth.Sort of like a bunch of taxpayers decide to vote for representatives in how to divide their tax money, some of it for the military.</comment>

<comment>Here's wikipedia's definition of socialist economics:"A socialist economic system is characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production,[1][2][3][4][5][6] which may mean autonomous cooperatives or direct public ownership; wherein production is carried out directly for use. Where markets are utilized for allocating inputs and capital goods among economic units, the designation market socialism is used. When planning is utilized, the economic system is designated a planned socialist economy. Non-market forms of socialism usually include a system of accounting based on calculation-in-kind or a direct measure of labor-time as a means to value resources and goods."The military could be called market socialism at best, but even then there's not a consistent, clear, direct allocation of resources."Also your example has nothing to do with economics."See my other examples about how the military operates. My soldiers is example to illustrate that the military doesn't act collectively, which is a usual mark of socialism. To be more direct: soldiers don't decide how they're paid in a socialist fashion either."Sort of like a bunch of taxpayers decide to vote for representatives in how to divide their tax money, some of it for the military."The military bids on contractors independent of the taxpayers' say. The taxpayers don't vote on how to build the next aircraft carrier. They just write a check. That's not control.Tax money does not equal socialism.</comment>

<comment>> The military could be called market socialism at bestI've proven it's not capitalist, my my worst is better than your best.> The military bids on contractorsSo? The Soviet Union could bid on its own contractors too. It imports things. So in your world, nobody is socialist. The military is headed by the President, who is elected.> The taxpayers don't vote on how to build the next aircraft carrier.The tax payers fund and vote for people in charge of such a thing. Voting is control. Um, you kinda have to make a couple of checker jumps is all. And don't think I've forgotten that funding of the military is socialist. Yeah it can bid on things, but so can any other socialist entity.Do the Russian citizens or soldiers vote on how to build the next aircraft carrier? All your examples do is "prove" that nobody is socialist.Also in the military, you're paid by your ranking, and it doesn't matter what you do, just what your ranking is. More socialism.Tax money is pooled together to do things. How isn't that socialism?</comment>

<comment>"I've proven it's not capitalist, my my worst is better than your best."No, the best we've done is prove that there might be elements of both, but they're definitely not in the socialist camp."So? The Soviet Union could bid on its own contractors too. It imports things. So in your world, nobody is socialist. The military is headed by the President, who is elected."Yep, the Soviet Union started abandoning its socialist principles as soon as it was clear they were working. They were faux-communists for a long time.Does the military need a president's explicit approval to build a new aircraft carrier?" Yeah it can bid on things, but so can any other socialist entity."If you're bidding on something in a relatively free market, it's not socialist. Some economists would argue any kind of bidding is automatically capitalist, but you could try and make the argument that market socialism has bidding. But Boeing, Lockheed, etc. aren't socialists."All your examples do is "prove" that nobody is socialist."Now you're getting it - there are very few socialist systems because they break themselves so quickly."Tax money is pooled together to do things. How isn't that socialism?"Depends on what the tax money does. Medicare/Medicaid are pretty socialist programs, they interact with free/mixed markets as little as possible. EPA? Not socialist. DOD? Mostly not socialist. FEC? Not socialist. HUD? Sometimes socialist.</comment>

<comment>> Yep, the Soviet Union started abandoning its socialist principles as soon as it was clear they were workingYep, you said their military is socialist. So it's not now?> Does the military need a president's explicit approval to build a new aircraft carrier?First it needs funding from Congress (socialist). The President is Commander in Chief (elected by the people) as boss lets other people run things around the country. And does everyone need Bill Gates explicit permission to do everything?  In any system, the head doesn't necessarily make every single decision. You've proven nothing.And yeah, does the head of the Russian military make every explicit decision?> Now you're getting it - there are very few socialist systemsYes I am getting it. You're self contradictory. You stated The Soviet Union and China were socialist, but when I point out in your examples that our military does the same thing as those socialist Militaries do, we have either conclude you were wrong about them being socialist or nobody is socialist, or more likely, our military is socialist.> Does the military ...If it can also do it in a socialist military like Russia, don't bother. If it walks like a socialist military, talks like a socialist military ...> EPA? Not socialist.So there's like competing EPAs collected with private money? Not capitalist. Funded by the government: socialist.If i applied your logic, nothing would be capitalist and in fact just about nothing would be anything because we could find small exceptions to about anything. It's called cherry picking.> [anything else]Until you show me whatever government entity itself is somehow competitive and privately funded and not at all a part of government, then it's not capitalist, hence socialist. Note I said the entity itself, not some things it does.   Aren't privatization and competition the hallmarks of capitalism?</comment>

<comment>There are private militaries. Just a couple of examples:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Not that this has any real bearing on Ender's idiocy.  I'd just like to point out that "private militaries", aka mercenaries, have a long history.When Republican's suggest completely disbanding our military in favor of mercs, then Ender will have a point.  Until then, you're right.</comment>

<comment>Also, absence of competition isn't socialism. It's monopoly.</comment>

<comment>I don't make any specific statements about the nature of socialism for you to have a basis to make that claim.  Socialism is the common ownership of the means of production.  In actual practice this amounts to government controlling what gets made and who it gets distributed to.  The oldest socialist country on the planet, if you'll accept a Marxist-Leninist state as socialist, is North Korea (1948, making it slightly younger than my dad).</comment>

<comment>Calling any military "socialist" outs you as a mental retard.</comment>

<comment>We're coming to take your stuff so we can give free phones to poor people. MHUWHAHHAHHAHAAHAAHAAA</comment>

<comment>You should be more afraid of the religious fanatic who won on the Republican side.</comment>

<comment>Why?  Unlike most of the other candidates he actually opposes amnesty and supports the Second Amendment.</comment>

<comment>Whatever you mean by amnesty, there are far more important issues, such as poverty, climate change, income disparity, crime, pollution, the list goes on and Bernie is on the right track for most issues. Cruz, on the other hand, is a lunatic, who, whether he believes it or not, says Jesus chose him to run. Besides delusions of grandeur, he alienates anyone who does not share his nutty beliefs. This is a nation of millions of diverse people, not a homogeneous group of right wing Christians. The president has to represent all of the people to the greatest extent possible. Fortunately Cruz is unlikely to win the nomination, let alone the general election. As for the second amendment, not one candidate of either party has even suggested repealing it. </comment>

<comment>But don't you see the demographics of our nation has huge implications on these other issues like poverty and crime?  Look at the top 5 nations atop the UN Human Development index rankings.  They're all 90+% white. Look at the lowest.  They're all mostly black.  Look at the safest nations and the most violent ones and you'll again see race strongly correlates to this.  The implication is letting a lot of those races into your country produces negative results.http://hdr.undp.org/sites/defa...</comment>

<comment>One of the greatest assets of this country is the diversity of its population.</comment>

<comment>The UN Human Development Index rankings disagree.  Diverse nations fare worse.</comment>

<comment>We are a nation built by and for many different types of people. That is not going to change, except to become more diverse and more racially mixed. Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Not the most brilliant thing to tell a German seeing his peaceful society over-run by hordes of low skill, low education individuals with hostile attitudes and values.</comment>

<comment>We're not in Germany. </comment>

<comment>There are over 50 million Americans of German ancestry.  Consider that the entire country of Germany only has 81 million people, mostly North African and Syrian refugees (I kid, but do keep in mind not all of that 81 million are actually German).</comment>

<comment>The American people lost because none of those clowns should be president.</comment>

<comment>So you don't like Killary or Bernie?</comment>

<comment>Killary lost.She is sweating buckets of Crisco today.</comment>

<comment>The HILDEBEAST couldn't beat a whack job socialist.  Wow</comment>

<comment>Let's see what happens now. Iowa has not "predicted" a winner in 16 years.</comment>
