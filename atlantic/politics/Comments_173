<comment>Absolutely not.  I promote free speech and thick skin for all!</comment>

<comment>Partisan comment is partisan.  I'd also argue the left seems to be a bit more gung-ho about the policing of language and restricting "improper" speech.  Witness all this campus safe space and trigger warning crap.  Bossy feminists trying to stop you from calling them bossy.  The whole weird tribunals in Canada that several publishers have been pulled through.  </comment>

<comment>Right, because those weird tribunals in Canada are so essential to the article.</comment>

<comment>Those tribunals are what happens when you offend people in a place that doesn't guarantee free speech, which is something very relevant to an article about art that offended people.</comment>

<comment>I thought we agreed censorship is the purview of the left: " I need some muscle over here," etc.</comment>

<comment>I always thought the academy was a place that you shouldn't have felt "safe."  You are supposed to enter that forge and come out changed. Most people when faced with change are afraid. If you have ideas that that you feel are so right, why are you even attending?Physical safety and discrimination are not at question here (we all know that), la raison d'Ãªtre of the academy is and,  IMHO, is in jeopardy.Probably just my privilege showing. </comment>

<comment>Sorry OrangePolicy but I've come to the end of my rope on this "safe place" crap.  No one has presented any evidence that these campuses are unsafe places.  Not one frog hair of a fact has been put forward  that even suggests these are unsafe places.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That's not evidence.  It's just spreading more BS.  Those claims  are anecdotal and not evidence.  If there's a case for "unsafe" campuses then let's see it.  Surely if they're that unsafe evidence abounds.  But we never see it.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Do you know what evidence is or are you avoiding it because there is none.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Then cure my ignorance and show me the evidence.</comment>

<comment>One school, one threat is somehow proof that college campuses aren't safe?  That's a stretch and you know it. What these kids want is an echochamber of their own opinion. They don't want to be challenged or have a debate. They don't want their special little snowflake feelings to be hurt.And they are intellectually immature because of it.</comment>

<comment>You are right. We should take action against anyone who threatens others with violence!!http://mobile.reuters.com/arti...</comment>

<comment>So maybe the protest should be against Yik-yak. Maybe Yik-Yak should have tougher guildlines on what is posted and shared publically. Maybe they should have more of or hire better moderators. </comment>

<comment> Those claims  are anecdotal and not evidence.Uummm, in social setting, it is the anecdotal that add up to a societal trend. In criminology, each act is its own crime. So I would think that yes, anecdotal evidence IS prime evidence.</comment>

<comment>Don't think you quite catch the meaning of anecdotal.</comment>

<comment>I don't think reading comprehension is your strong point.</comment>

<comment>anecdotal - (of an account) not necessarily true or reliable, based on personal accounts rather than facts or research.Comprehend that.</comment>

<comment>Ya, you still don't comprehend reading very well. Nor do you know what "anecdotal evidence" means.A witness to a crime relates their "anecdotal evidence" at trial. It can't be proven, but it is accepted as fact until disproved.</comment>

<comment>Sure.  If you insist.</comment>

<comment>Ah . . . what evidence?</comment>

<comment>So if a bunch of people get together and publicly claim that they were abducted by aliens and cite examples of their individual abductions you'd be good with that "evidence"?</comment>

<comment>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Also if several people are all claiming the same thing, it might just be that they experienced the same thing.However, A "claim" and "evidence" are not synonymous. Over half of Americans believe that if they silently ask some invisible dude in the sky for something, it will come true. Lots of claims of that happening, but not quite as much evidence.</comment>

<comment>It's not about physical safety it's about emotional safety and personal insecurities. I guess some individuals and groups feel universities need to accommodate them the same way we care for the handicapped. </comment>

<comment>I see your safe place and raise you a Seung-Hui Cho. If there were a guy with a club or camera or something next to the sign..unsafe. Just a sign? Get over it.</comment>

<comment>My phrasing was bad; the reason I say physical safety and discrimination are not at question is because in today's culture it should be a given. I'm not completely blind and I'm not a mouth breather, I know special groups are still under the heel of the pressures those groups continue to fight.ASIDE from physical safety and discrimination, which most institutions have woefully neglected since forever, the academy was to challenge and shake any belief you had, unless you studied the physical sciences.Maybe the academy should use that upon themselves. </comment>

<comment>Oh stop giving in like that, paine.  you were right the first time.  These folks are equal now.  They must deal with that on their own.</comment>

<comment>Dream on Orange.  Your equal now and no longer special.  Embrace it, its actually a brave new world for those who are willing to overcome their false phobias.</comment>

<comment>I think we are all special and unique but there will always be some people that think they are more special and more unique than others. </comment>

<comment>such is human history.</comment>

<comment>"Safe space" should not mean "place where I don't have to face ideas that make me uncomfortable."If you agree with these college kids on that definition, you're just as wrong.</comment>

<comment>So what is the difference between "safe spaces" and "segregation"? </comment>

<comment>About $100,000,000</comment>

<comment>Lol</comment>

<comment>In fact, safe spaces have little to do with avoiding life experiences and education, they're just zones for minorities and other groups to go to. A safe space is a student's residence, which for some is their dormitory room and for others their flat, house, or other abode. (Those who share accommodation with others may have to make some accommodations, but that's for them to sort.) If they expect their safe space to accompany them as the wander around campus they hold an unrealistic expectation. An important aspect of education is disabuse people of self-centered, childish notions. It doesn't always work, nonetheless it is a goal that serves the university community and the larger society well and should not be abandoned by administrators. Unless they're feckless. They should be replaced.</comment>

<comment>You've hit on the heart of the matter.  Public space is public space.  End of story.</comment>

<comment>You have our permission to go into a great belly laugh over all of that--I do.  Thumbs up my friend.</comment>

<comment>The academy IS a safe place. The problem is that when these self-appointed activists use the word "safe" they don't mean 'minimal risk of physical danger', they mean 'no risk of emotional discomfort'.</comment>

<comment>So, art should only be for decoration. And, it shouldn't challenge you or make you think. And presumably, literature, theater, and music, too. The philistines are winning.</comment>

<comment>Amen. No doubt Huckleberry Finn is on the way out. Ugh.</comment>

<comment>They tried for decades to get that removed.  The greatest American novel.  So far their arguments for removal are laughable--because of the use of the n word.  Twain's theme in the famous book is of course Huck's abandonment of racial prejudice.</comment>

<comment>There are editions of the book which have substituted "Nigger Jim" with "Slave Jim".  Apparently these new editions do not understand why Twain used the word.  Twain knew what he was doing.  He uses words very precisely and with purpose.</comment>

<comment>Bawdlerization never works.  "Slave Jim" indeed.  Funny.</comment>

<comment>In a few years time the word 'slave' will be a trigger, a violation of safety, and the book will need to be removed from the shelves.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think these signs "made people think"?  Is making people mad the same as making people think?</comment>

<comment>Oh it's fairly obvious they aren't the thinking type.</comment>

<comment>See my alternative solution above.  AAs must adjust their identities now by facing the reality that they are equal to the rest of us in every way today.  Scary for some apparently.</comment>

<comment>It's kinda hard to say that when black Americans are still overwhelmingly more likely to be poor than white Americans, mostly as a result of racist policies like redlining. Whites only signs may no longer be legal, but that doesn't mean that racial disparities in opportunity are gone.</comment>

<comment>May I ask a question? Two questions? </comment>

<comment>That economic fact doesn't in itself prove bias.</comment>

<comment>Not yet fully, but after the Supreme Court overturns affirmative action they'll be that much closer to being on an equal footing.  </comment>

<comment>Not following you here, Vig.  Based on the comment I just returned to you, I took you as a pro-microagression, US is the worst place in the world sort of chap.  Need clarification.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, art is subjective and should generate an emotional response, even if it is anger.  As I said in another post, while this generated attention, I don't think it was very good at accomplishing its goal.</comment>

<comment>You assume she's sincere.  It's an art project for a grade.</comment>

<comment>Ask Robert Mapplethorpe.</comment>

<comment>It should make them think. The initial reaction was that a white person put the signs up and that it was an overt act of racism or a prank aimed at the black students.  After a few days, the artist, a black female, came forward to claim it was she who is responsible.  The tone completely changed.  It switched from expulsion of the person to the school should have a policy against art.I recognize that there are inequities in our society, but how come we can't have a discussion about them without differing (not opposing) views being labeled or dis-invited from the conversation?</comment>

<comment>But what you have described is not art; it was a social experiment.</comment>

<comment>Not much into art, eh?</comment>

<comment>Sure.Exhibit A: Here we are, commenting about it. And before we can do that we have to think about it.</comment>

<comment>It's interesting that the right so desperately wants to be cool.</comment>

<comment>Yes, in fact looking or sounding cool is the most important part of art. Try getting into a top art college with this stuff in your portfolio. My other comment argues for calling it a project instead of art.</comment>

<comment>Art should be good. All this nonsense did was convince people that racism is no longer a real problem, if students feel so comfortable using it for button pushing and to seem cool.</comment>

<comment>Can't imagine what would happen if the art student where white. Oh wait, I can imagine.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I think that's disingenuous at best to suggest that the girl "got the same outrage that the white child would have gotten".</comment>

<comment>She's still in school, is she not? You honestly think that a white art student who did that same thing would have been just shown outrage?There would be marches to have him expelled. If it were a teacher the marchers would try to have them fired. </comment>

<comment>It can't be ethnic intimidation if it's part of a class project. </comment>

<comment>Why's is that? Is that some rule I'm unfamiliar with?So if I go to art school and do the exact same thing as a white male, there wouldn't be a different outcome? </comment>

<comment>Sorry I got a little carried away with the sarcasm </comment>

<comment>No, I'm sorry. I do that all the time. It's just hard to pick up the sarcasm on the comment boards.Cheers. ð</comment>

<comment>No, if a White girl had posted a "whites only" sign, I am sure it would be read in much the same way as the lynching halloween decorations that pop up at colleges, a very much self-identified white person treating the black body as property, imposing their will and not even caring that they are doing it. As every art piece comes from an artist, only a non-white artist could claim to be doing anything different, or "artistic" with that tired piece of discrimination. Sorry to go all art theory on ya, but the context always matters.</comment>

<comment>Wait, I thought we were talking about college students. Because you said "white girl", I thought that maybe you were posting something about K-12, but apparently not. So anyway, it's okay since it was a 'black girl' that put up signs at the university?</comment>

<comment>The only thing I can tell you said, aside from cataloging how our dialects don't match, was a restatement of my point, that the art has a meaning that is different than the old bigotry solely because of the artist's identity. Yes, that is what I said.</comment>

<comment>Ethic intimidation is ethnic intimidation. Regardless if its a project, an experiment, a homework assignment or whatever. </comment>

<comment>That is not true.  Google the original stories, it was thought to be a prank or outright racism. The tone completely changed when it was determined to be an art project by a black student.</comment>

<comment>Oh wah the poor white students who were ejected from their library desks at Dartmouth by the head of the Dartmouth NAACP who said his plan was to "shut down the library" and who, as they were forcibly marched out of the library, were screamed at for being "f**king white assh*les" and "f**king white b**ches," and then were investigated by the Dean for being likely racists because they were studying while white.Let me go and get my violin, the poor white people whose poverty doesn't count and who get no set asides to help them into schools or jobs or government contracts to overcome their poverty, and who are the only people in the industrialized world whose death rate has gone up over the last 20 years, because "White Privilege."Please, tell more more about the poor white people who don't like being assaulted or shot by black people and then tell me how they should just get over their racism.  I'm all ears.  I will skip my classes today because being white and going to class is racist and I need my morning regimen of left-wing, only-black-people-have-it-tough, victim olympics BS.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? What white person is claiming they are upset that they can't put up segregation era signs?NO ONE WANTS THOSE SIGNS UP!!!!</comment>

<comment>No no, such AA protest is more laughable than anything else--you want us to be frank with you, I assume.  There you have it, a clown show of misguided and callow youth.  Worth a chuckle, or didn't you think white people do that when this sort of thing happens?</comment>

<comment>Safe zones are discrimination. It's discriminates against a particular group of people. Not sure who makes the decisions what those factors are but its discriminatory. I wouldn't use this word but many would even argue it's facist </comment>

<comment>Half of an Internet comments section is trolling, some trolls are artists, most are just pushing buttons because they enjoy the reaction.  An "artist" placing "White Only" and "Black Only" signs at water coolers is meant to provoke one to think, and it provokes me to think that $25,000/year is a lot to pay for a B.A. in trolling.</comment>

<comment>Yes, thinks that the artist is sadly out of date.  Knows she's out of date?  Probably.</comment>

<comment>I was trying to come up with a good word for this kind of stunt (stunt, not art, as far as I'm concerned) and yeah, "trolling" pretty much covers it. And while I can imagine back when I was in school there would of course have been the obligatory outrage, I have to think that most people would have taken it for the stunt that it was, and either ignored the signs or just ripped them down-- which as far as I'm concerned is just as validly performance "art" as putting them up in the first place.</comment>

<comment>South Park is the ultimate safe space.Its a show that revolves around mocking any group that tries to make society change its viewpoint, left and right.Its built on the smug and self-assured acceptance of their own biases that essentially all libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism is built on. South Park never challenges its viewers viewpoints or tests them, it just mocks groups that try to.Status quo is God for South Park, the existing norms of society are always fine and everything different sucks because I said so.</comment>

<comment>Status quo is working for this "artist" who put up the signs.  She knows that white kneejerk guilt will not call her on it with much effect.</comment>

<comment>Then let's wait for it.  Havent watched that show in awhile.  Like the chap that plays the Barry White chef character.  Funny.</comment>

<comment>About 7% of the worlds population has a college degree.  These students are joining those ranks.  They will enjoy opportunities 93% of the world will never know.  They will have to chance to earn, thrive and live a great life because of their education.  In short, this privilege will travel with them forever.  Sorry, if you are soon to be joining this 7% of the population and you choose to think of yourself as a victim, you have failed you.</comment>

<comment>But you have to wonder if their degrees will be devalued by the reputation of having attended an institution that knuckled under, sold out free speech, and demonstrated lack of commitment to intellectual debate. Oh the sweet irony. The real world always bats last.</comment>

<comment>I never thought I would feel old or outdated at 31 but what the heck is a "safe space?"  I mean I can look it up but I just don't "get it."  I loved taking any class in college that set up some sort of a debate or the opportunity to "clash" over ideas.  I am finishing grad school now and some of the highlights have been courses where we all engage in written or verbal debate over all sorts hot button issues from race to abortion to you name it.  To me, it is fun, and really one of the only true ways to learn anything and one of the VERY few ways in which to actually arrive at a point where you can CHANGE your opinion or viewpoint on something.  So please tell me what are these kids talking about?</comment>

<comment>They're speaking of Never-Never Land.</comment>

<comment>"old at 31" I laughed out loud. Thank you for the perspective. Imagine how the safe space nonsense sounds to the generation of college kids who protested the Vietnam War or marched for Civil Rights when getting busted or busted on the head was routine.</comment>

<comment>If only you guys would have realized that it all could have been prevented by placing the football team on strike!</comment>

<comment>it is a pretty genius move, you have to admit =]</comment>

<comment>Its an agenda, gman.  They assume, probably correctly, that most white people will buy into their nonsense about racism today.  behind closed doors other AAs are telling them off as full of it, perhaps having another old chuckle about dear  old whitey.</comment>

<comment>>what the heck is a "safe space?" I mean I can look it up but I just don't "get it."The idea started out as "it's good to have places where minorities can spend time and not have any chance of encountering discrimination for a while." This is obvious, and indeed safe spaces like that have long existed more or less informally.The term's gotten stretched into "minorities shouldn't have any chance of encountering discrimination on campus." Which is a great ideal, but not really practical.Part of the issue is that academics who study discrimination aren't that interested in single big events any more. A lot of recent study amounts to "lots of individually-small instances of discrimination can add up." This is a valuable finding and worth acting on. But completely avoiding "microaggressions" across an entire campus is really hard, and maybe not a reasonable expectation at this point.</comment>

<comment>Technically, everyone except the very disadvantaged has a "safe space". They have their own rooms. They have tiny pieces of private property where they can choose who to let in. On a larger level, there have always been social clubs or organizations for certain groups: women, Italians, whatever. While other people weren't excluded by law or force, it was understood that these were groups where you could have some measure of security from the outside world. There's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't mean you're excluding yourself, or not meeting other people.Of course, the big problem is the left terrible at arguing for anything, no matter how correct on the merits they may be. By arguing for safe spaces in the way they do, namely that no one should ever be exposed to a viewpoint they dislike, they should like idiots and like they're against free speech. Which is a huge problem.People grab for power any way they can. Right now certain members off the left is stuck on "I've been wronged [true] so you owe me things [false]". They see that the real powerful institutions, and people, live in a world where everything is a safe space. So some left-wing people think they can get that kind of institutional power by using a combination of rules and guilt to make others treat them the same way - essentially demand by force what the power structure gets by custom. It won't work, because that's not how power works. All it does it lock people further in their echo chambers and create an unsympathetic public face.</comment>

<comment>You assume they're really hurt, Dave.  Think again.  It's an agenda.</comment>

<comment>Disagreement does not equal disrespect, slurs do not equal bodily threats, and nobody has a Constitutional right to not be offended. The sooner many of my peers (and their older enablers) recognize this, the better off we will all be. </comment>

<comment>Oh you mean like AAs on campus?  I agree.</comment>

<comment>"Like all Americans.." Really? Nice assumptions there. But you know what they say about when you assume; it makes an ass out of you, not me. That's why the "e" is silent.Slurs and threats to one's person not being equal is my only point. The issue of their "justification" is irrelevant to this and merely deflects the issue. As to the 3rd point, nobody said that people don't have a right to critique and protest. The issue is when people try to censor and shut down speech they don't like. Your notion that a person can "use their rights against" others marks you out as someone who is woefully ignorant of what the First Amendment even means. </comment>

<comment>What are you numbering?</comment>

<comment>They do not have a right to insist that the powers that be should prevent said offensive things from being said. There is a difference between "I don't like what you just said" and "I don't like what he just said, so stop him from saying it again Mommy." You're free to complain, raise as much hell as you like. You aren't free to attempt to suppress everything that makes you uncomfortable. That's what the evangelical social conservatives that I have no doubt you despise do.</comment>

<comment>These people see themselves as Bobby Seale while the rest of the world sees Steve Urkel.</comment>

<comment>LOL. Perfectly put.</comment>

<comment>Ok, someone please explain to me how this was supposed to show "systemic racism?"  Segregation ended awhile ago and this doesn't really highlight anything except to show what it was like.  I'm not saying there aren't still issues, but I feel like there are more effective and accurate ways of conveying your point.  I agree that art can be shocking and at times should be as it causes you to think and discuss, but I think this was misguided and poorly executed.Also, I hate the term "safe space."  What does it really mean anyways?  Of course everywhere you go should be "safe."  No one should have to worry about being assaulted verbally or physically.  But it's the world, and your safety can't be promised.  We try and provide security but it can only do so much.  What is really the point of these "safe spaces?"</comment>

<comment>Darren Wilson made his own version of safe space, and he lost his job over it.  Rehire Darren Wilson!See my comment below today, Utah.  And thumbs up.  It's time for non-blacks to start saying outright that racism is no longer a problem for AAs in the US and Europe.  What remains is voluntary separatism.Let's repeat gang one hundred times for memory:"Voluntary separatism isnt racism, and its most prominent among AAs today."</comment>

<comment>Well in my post I said "I'm not saying there aren't still issues."  There are a lot of people still upset and talking about racism so there's definitely an issue somewhere and it's worth addressing.  I don't know what other people experience so I'm not going to definitively say yes or no it exists.  But I hardly think is the 60s era segregation this artist leads people to believe.</comment>

<comment>Say it Utah.  The racism today is trivial and happens also in various directions.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't go as far as to say trivial, I'll give the benefit of the doubt.</comment>

<comment>What for?</comment>

<comment>Well it used to be driving while black was a reason for getting pulled over in NJ and the State Police had to enact a rule to stop that from happening.http://www.nj.com/politics/ind...I have a feeling that it may continue, but since I am not black, I can't say one way or another.</comment>

<comment>Just because you're not black doesn't mean you cant connect the dots.  there are black people who abhor this whole silly thing.</comment>

<comment>I'm not telling you how to think, Utah.  Just keep your mind open.  I'm 67 and all of this sounds a lot like the 60s.</comment>

<comment>Simple solution: someone goes around and put up another sign saying, "and black and green and purple" right beside the white only one,  or words to that effect.  The best defense is an offense, and this one makes perfect sense.  Free speech baby.  a monologue becomes a dialogue, what universities are all about--so the other side claims.Now lets talk the issue.  Whites only signs went down over 50 years ago and never existed in certain parts of the country.  As for the metaphor of racism--well, micro-racism in places surely, but hardly anything more than trivial.  The reality is people of color are now responsible for their own destiny, perhaps a scary thing to face for some.  Whitey is now longer available to blame.No more monologue, but a dialogue.  Whites and other non-blacks need to step up to the plate now and speak out to create a true dialogue.  Why do you hesitate?  Are you falsely guilt-ridden about what you supposedly owe?  Or are you simply afraid of black people?  Let's get the dialogue going, no more monologues by one side passing itself off as an interracial dialogue.Let's get this rolling.  Reparation began in a major way with the Civil War, where more white men died in battle and disease freeing the slaves than did black men.  Moreover the material cost was staggering, not solely the human cost for the north. Contrary to what Mr. Coates of this Mag would have you believe, special programs involving money and preferences have been going on big time for decades, even before the Johnson era, for the special benefit of AAs.That's for starters, any takers for a real dialogue?  Bring it on.</comment>

<comment>Oh well, sorry for throwing you a lot of points, Orange.  I wouldn't want to apprise you of any truth there, my man.</comment>

<comment>Watch that abusive language, Orange.  Well, you just described what dialogue is, as opposed to the monologue put out by people like BLM, Mr. Coates, and these protestors.  What can I say, try harder?</comment>

<comment>My opinion is that much of this is rooted in not knowing what to do with the fall of institutional racism.  Yes, there are racists in this country of all stripes.  In fact, science has told us that most people are naturally predisposed to hold some sort of views whether overtly or in the subconscious of what we consider racist.  But that is just a human issue.//The fact of the matter is there is no more "racism" in the form they are talking about.  There is no more oppression.  This presents a problem.  Either now step up and take the new found freedoms and run with them (which presents the possibility of failure) or cry racism and oppression which provides a ready excuse for any outcome.//In case I wasn't clear, in a nutshell, the AA community has largely failed to embrace its freedom for fear of failure and has relied on imagined oppression to act as a crutch for inaction.  It is sad and I wish things would go the other way.  These kids with their made up racism are doing more to hold that community back than they would if they said hey, we are here, we are free and equal, and let's see how good we can do!</comment>

<comment>Google the Harvard test on racism.  There is a difference between personal racism and institutional racism.  You are protesting the wrong things my friend.  You should be advocating for increased participation by your community instead of fighting ghosts.  Housing, crime, education?  Not very good for the AA community at large.  Why?  People like YOU forcing this crap down the throats of impressionable children.  If you grow up thinking and being told you are oppressed and discriminated against why would you go to college?  Maybe you would start a criminal enterprise.  These things lead to living in slums.  It is a vicious cycle that you idiots perpetrate and if you would stop it and encourage people to rise up and embrace freedom you could change it.  You are an ideologue and you will never understand this though.</comment>

<comment>By telling people who are not living in oppression forced on them by way of institutional racism you are in fact preventing them from embracing change.  I never said you were shoving it down anyone's throat except and most importantly your own people.  What example are you setting for black high school children by making up a false narrative that college is a racist experience for them and that they will be oppressed?  It is false and it only encourages people to not participate in society.  And who can blame them?  You are telling them they cannot succeed because they are still living on the damn plantation.</comment>

<comment>Now that is something we can agree on.  The WOD is a joke and a jobs program for the DEA.  The moral hypocrisy of seeing 5k Mexican kids get killed so little Susy doesn't get a joint is outrageous.  However, I do not think you are correct in your assertion that the war on drugs is the be all and end all for your problems.  I stand by my statements.</comment>

<comment>Tone down your language, Orange my man, heat is no substitute for light.  And anyway you're revealing your prejudices.</comment>

<comment>Word.</comment>

<comment>Where shall we begin?  Black leaders 25 years ago INSISTED that AA thugs be locked up to improve their neighborhoods.  Hence the costly incarceration complex.War on drugs?  Clearly not working but also something that AA leaders insisted upon. Short memory, ha Orange.</comment>

<comment>And?</comment>

<comment>That is a short and very cherry picked example to score a rhetorical point.  The war on drugs existed long before that term was coined.  Go all the way back to reefer madness and the implicit racism.  Black kids who deal drugs are, and have always, gotten harsher sentences than white kids.  Black leaders pushed for harsher penalties during the crack era because crack was decimating African American neighborhoods, and even then, the penalties for different forms of the same drug were different based on the population using them.  Cocaine was mainly a white drug and generally carried a lesser penalty than crack which was cheaper and mainly used by African Americans.</comment>

<comment>Well I'm glad you agree on the black leaders part with me.  As for harsher penalties--some of that disparity has to do with resistance to arrest and so on, violence involved with drug use and so on.  White preppies may be assholes but they are less likely to do violent crime in the streets, which is what law enforcement has always gone after.</comment>

<comment>Since we seem to be congratulating each other on agreement, you seem to be acknowledging that some of the disparity in sentencing is for no apparent reason at all.  BTW resisting arrest is something cops often tack on when they don' t really have a reason to arrest in the first place.  Why were they arrested?- Resisting arrest</comment>

<comment>And maybe not, right mid?As for congratulating ourselves, save that judgment for yourself, if you really feel bad about it.</comment>

<comment>Word.  And again I say word.  See all of my comments today here, gman.  thumbs way up.By the way, it's time for the AA community to starting thanking all those dead white soldiers for dying on their behalf for freedom, on the battlefield and from disease.  Our costliest war in our history.  So far they have only honored black soldiers, far fewer than white soldiers in the northern armies.</comment>

<comment>Interesting that the African international students see all this and are puzzled.  We have so much in this country, as they see it.</comment>

<comment>That's because they have been dazzled from afar by the white patriarchy and don't yet ascertain the micro-aggression that will lead them to seek safe space. That, or they're so familiar with the genuine horrors that threaten Africa that they want to study hard and not waste time on the bourgeois political games of the American black establishment.</comment>

<comment>to begin with, Vig, most African students here in the US ARE middle class.  Wanna try again?Your language seems to indicate an ideologue.  Microaggression--sociobabble for trivial incidents, if even that.</comment>

<comment>Sarchasm: (my) failed attempt at sarcasm.  See second half of my comment...</comment>

<comment>No problemo.  Reading my comment to you before, I think I misjudged you on your point.  Sarcasm is hard to tell nowadays, since there are so many bonkers people out there, any absurdity may be expressed either ironically or as the truth.  Sorry bout that.</comment>

<comment>âThe signs are a reminder that just because you canât see racism around you doesnât mean itâs not there,â Powell said in an interview."You can't see it because it is not there except in fewer and fewer isolated situations.Colleges are producing a generation of wimps and whiners. If they want to know what institutional racism is they should go back in time and live in the shoes of blacks during the 50's and 60's - - -  go have a dialogue with Henry Aaron and the bigotry, threats, and fear he had to endure as a high profile athlete during that time.These kids seem to need to invent an excuse for the fear they have in growing up and maturing which everyone goes through.Colleges have become a daycare center rather than an institution to prepare young people for the future.If these kids want a safe space I would suggest their parent's basement.</comment>

<comment>>Colleges are producing a generation of wimps and whiners. If they want to know what institutional racism is they should go back in time and live in the shoes of blacks during the 50's and 60'Or they could, you know, go talk to any of the million of Americans, white and black and brown and everything in between, who didn't go to high schools that would send them to college, or didn't have the family resources to afford 27k a year at f-ing SUNY Buffalo, and find out what it's like when complaining to your superiors gets you kicked to the curb without a second thought, instead of think-pieces in every bloody magazine from here to Timbuktu. Privileged little prats doing everything they can to distract people - and themselves - from how privileged they are. It's a rich people thing, not really any different from bankers going to therapists because of all the harsh rhetoric against them. </comment>

<comment>Oh, they already live there.  Silly this whole thing, but of course there is calculation in it--more centers and activities for people of color, as they call themselves.</comment>

<comment>âArts are going to be controversial. But when itâs put on the wall, one should say this is art."That way, we can know it doesn't really matter.</comment>

<comment>Yes, let's have artists check with the local safe place before they exhibit their work.</comment>

<comment>Imagine Banksy doing that? Never!</comment>

<comment>Maybe the infamous Mizzou poop swastika was an art project.  The Harvard Law black tape incident definitely sounds like someone was using art to make a statement.</comment>

<comment>"Activists who say the display crossed a line insist that they are not focused on the artist or her intentions"Maybe they SHOULD focus on her and her intentions. She has admitted to doing it to be controversial and spark a conversation. They need to step back and see whats going on</comment>

<comment>Agree.</comment>

<comment>Shouldn't we have had this conversation back when Emma Sulkowicz was carrying her mattress all around Columbia?</comment>

<comment>What happened to students who saw the signs, asked a faculty member, librarian, custodian ... 'what's up with these signs?!', were told it was art, shrugged, and went about their day?Or is no one intelligent on a university campus anymore?</comment>

<comment>Silent majority...</comment>

<comment>I do hope that someone - especially someone white - had the presence of mind and the courage to whip out a marker, cross out the lettering, and write in "Liberated - For Use By ALL" That would be an appropriate response.</comment>

<comment>You would be sued for destroying someone's artistic work.</comment>

<comment>But it would in itself be every bit as much a work of artistry. And I'd love to see the jury that would have all that much sympathy with the original artist.</comment>

<comment>And you're censoring free expression.</comment>

<comment>But then when it emerged that it was the cultural expression of a persun of color, the graffitist would be shamed for imposing white hegemony on the oppressed.</comment>

<comment>Reminder that the large majority of college students are not spending all day every day focused on race, sex, privilege and oppression and generally being outraged about tweets or whatever.That 99% just doesn't make click-baity headlines."Minority student spends evening reading assignment, and then goes for beer with friends, does not attend protest." just isn't news.</comment>

<comment>Not painted on.  Removable.  Made a point.  Good job, artist.  But don't expect to make a living doing this.</comment>

<comment>Couple of points:  First, universities are full of children who are striving to become adults.  This story clearly shows that many have not achieved that goal.  Second, art should be clear about the fact that it is in fact, "art".  Assuming that the intended audience experiencing the art will understand the lengthy dialog going on inside the artist's head when creating it is a mistake.  Finally, there have been several stories about this incident.  I've re-read several of them, and I've found a pattern that must be addressed.  "The students" feel this, and "the students" want that... where is the faculty, the educators, the LEADERSHIP that a university must have in order to guide our children towards that which we are paying for?  The adults that are supposed to be in the room are not doing their job.  When the children lapse into pointless whining and endless attempts at splitting logical hairs, the adults should be stepping in and gently, but firmly guiding the children to a conclusion, and then on to other things.  This endless wrangling over a zero-sum value issue is a waste of time and money.  SUNY is not the only institution of higher learning in this country that suffers from a lack of adult supervision.  But is certainly exemplifies why tenure must be eradicated as a concept, and that customers (like me) who are paying outrageous amounts of money for mediocre returns on the educational investment should steer their money away from these money pits, and towards institutions that give value for the dollar.</comment>

<comment>I'm not a fan of art as sociological/psychological experiments.Edit, I'm also confused how this is different than the alleged poo swastika. The latter just seems like advant garde art in comparison.</comment>

<comment>I fail to see art as "aggression" as the writer puts it.  What a crock of hyperbole.  You know your case is weak when you have to make shit up.</comment>

<comment>Black people don't want to be educated by whites - whites can't understand the black experience and can't connect with their kids. Black people don't want to be policed by whites - white police officers treat black people with malice and disrespect. Black people don't want to work for white people - white people actively keep the black man down in terms of pay, promotions, and etiquette.Seems like what some black people really want is a return to the age of segregation.</comment>

<comment>A black student did something similar at UC Berkeley, putting up nooses, then waiting for a reaction before revealing himself.This is a thin line between art and activism.</comment>

<comment>And if the student happened to be Louis Farrakhan, it would be adding fuel to the fire.</comment>

<comment>I think this is brilliant! Many white folks don't want to hear about their oppressive past or be reminded of white privilege. This forces them to face it. Its the best way to educate white America.</comment>

<comment>Which whites does this refer to? My family came to the US in 1913. No slave owners or racism in my family so don't point a finger at all whites. </comment>

<comment>Really? No racism at all? Are you 100% sure of that?</comment>

<comment>Yeah. A small family at that.</comment>

<comment>I guess I could make a comment that can be interpreted as racism by some but that doesn't make me a racist person.</comment>

<comment>How about you, if you're a non-white person and not just a mere guilty whitey? Did your ancestors capture and sell slaves to the Europeans or just keep them around for domestics? Perhaps they were slave-owning black farmers in America? Or were they Arabs who continued slavery into the 20th century (if not to the present)?  We must ascertain your ancestral guilt.</comment>

<comment>You must share in our collective guilt. Our evil race needs to be punished, if not annihilated.</comment>

<comment>Boredinmin is an idiot, but the fact that your ancestors didn't own slaves (very few people actually did, as slaves were expensive) is far beyond the point. To be white is to benefit in a million ways, especially before the 1960s or so when you could by property without being subject to legal redlining. Now redlining still exists, it's just never on paper. Not to mention how the police treat you, etc.Racism is a problem in America. This isn't some historical residue but how people, today, treat other people, today.Safe spaces are still ridiculous, though. </comment>

<comment>Your a fool if you think "white" American doesn't understand its racist past. What world do you live in?Go ahead and put up segregation era signs. Who do you think is more uncomfortable about that? You want this, you can have it.We will have a school filled with signs that segregate things on campus. That's not progress!! That's regression.Congratulations on your brilliant idea to show white people what they already know. Like we somehow have forgotten about segregation. </comment>

<comment>Are you new here? Have you been living under a rock since Obama was elected? There's TONS of racism out there. If anything, its become much worse with the rise of crazy outraged conservatism. Many conservatives don't even hide their racism anymore.</comment>

<comment>2015 is the least racist year of human existence, yet people act like it's the most racist.I'd like a 1920s black guy to time travel and see that there was a black president, a black guy running for president for the republican party, and arguably the most famous couple in america (Kanye and Kim) are an interracial couple with a baby the called North. I guarantee, he would have no idea why the kids a missouri were protesting.Progress has been made, but not acknowledged. That is frustrating.</comment>

<comment>I actually disagree.  I think there are an awful lot of people who actually say and think things like "Blacks were better off under slavery" (as that fool from Duck Dynasty, or Cliven Bundy, both famously expressed).There are also a lot of people who are in denial about the conditions that black Americans and native Americans have lived under for most of this country's existence, even while they were supposedly "free."I think the students on these campuses are largely complaining that their Chateaubriand is being served room temperature, rather than slightly chilled, but I do think there are a huge number of Americans who are, and will always be ignorant of America's racist past.  In some cases because they still exemplify it.I don't think that this "art project" has made any one aware of anything though.  Whatever its intention, its effect is purely to stir racial animosity.  I look forward to hearing from students or administrators on this campus who were previously ignorant of racism in America, but are now aware, thanks to these "art" works.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think these signs are educational?  Do you think there is anyone alive in the US who doesn't know about Jim Crow -era segregation?I guess the point is: some of us, while remembering the past, are ready to move on.  Some want to keep resentment and anger over long-ago injustices stirred up.  What is the point of this?</comment>

<comment>The problem with "moving on" is that the problem persists and seems to be getting bad again. Just spend 5 minutes watching right wing media - radio, Internet or TV. Racism is rampant.</comment>

<comment>If you turn over enough rocks, you can still find racism.  If you really think racism is getting worse in this country, then you are woefully ignorant.  Maybe read and learn a bit before spouting off on the internet.</comment>

<comment>When the leading GOP candidate for President openly calls for forcing some groups to carry special ID, uses openly vile racist language when referring to another group, when his self-proclaimed supporters beat up a Latino man, identify this candidate as the reason for their actions, and the candidate suffers no consequences for it, when popular white nationalist groups openly and publicly support this man . . . I don't think you have to look for to find racism in America.</comment>

<comment>Race hustling is big business. Lots of groups and people profit from it. It's not going anywhere. </comment>

<comment>Yes, protesting threatening slurs thrown at students is "race hustling". And, demanding justice for a cop pumping 16 rounds into a young black man who didn't threaten police is also "race hustling". You want to use that term as a weapon that will take away legitimacy of black community grievances. But, you need to be awfully full of white privilege (....and power) to buy your BS.</comment>

<comment>And you need to be full of black entitlement to buy yours </comment>

<comment>If it was something that was so easily forgotten or overlooked that we needed a sign to make us think about it I'd consider that pretty good evidence it is largely irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>It was intentionally "forgotten" and shoved under the rug by white America.</comment>

<comment>collectively?</comment>

<comment>I think an overwhelming majority of Americans are well aware of our history and realize the ugliness of it.  Continuously sticking our noses in it and trying to riddle us with guilt will have a minimal impact at best and will eventually get tuned out completely.  I fail to see how any of this is being productive.</comment>

<comment>It forces conversation that's desperately needed. Just look at the recent tensions at the University of Missouri. Racial slurs were being thrown by white folks at the black students. But, the conservative right couldn't comprehend what the problem was.</comment>

<comment>I don't think so.  This incident just got the Black Student Union upset and lead to a discussion of safe spaces, not racial injustice.  I think there are better, more effective ways to discuss this topic.</comment>

<comment>Conversation is the last thing you want.  You and yours want to lecture people and then be told "you're right."  Anything less is seen as racist.</comment>

<comment>I can't tell if you're a right-wing nut job trying to astroturf or just really stupid. So good job, I guess.</comment>

<comment>Liberal. And, this nation has an enormous white privilege/racism problem.</comment>

<comment>It also has an entitlement problem. </comment>

<comment>You think so?</comment>

<comment>Know so </comment>

<comment>The missouri students protesting, how many of them were on full ride scholarships simply because of their race? I'd trade getting my student loans paid for if all i had to do was hear someone call me a cracker once or twice an academic year.</comment>

<comment>But the students who were offended weren't white.  They were largely African-American and mistook the art for actual racist hate speech because it wasn't labeled in any way.  I don't think a single white person is quoted in the entire article.</comment>

<comment>It still got enough attention that white privilege soaked students couldn't avoid addressing the issue.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure where you're getting that from, since that isn't mentioned anywhere in the article.  The only students who were moved to action were African Americans who are now calling for new public art regulations.  I also seriously doubt that students of any race at SUNY were heretofore unaware that segregation existed.</comment>

<comment>The University of Kentucky is undergoing an racially-inspired art debate too: a Depression-era fresco in Memorial Hall depicting the history of Lexington and Central Kentucky. It includes a scene of a Native American presumably stalking a female settler, and at least two scenes that probably represent enslaved African Americans: one group playing instruments while whites dance; another group working in the tobacco fields.The University President has caved, and the fresco is currently "covered up" while a decision is made about "what to do" about it.  Removal would likely destroy it; outright destruction would be politically-correct fascism of the worst sort.http://www.kentucky.com/news/l...As an architectural historian (who received his degree from UK), I was part of a student effort to fight removal or destruction of the mural over ten years ago. While I am progressive enough to see the arguments of the University's African American students, I am still interested in the preservation of the historic, even in public spaces like this.  I have long advocated that new murals, by NEW artists, be painted in the multitude of new public spaces created by the wave of construction on campus.Art, free speech, and racial diversity/sensitivity are definitely a delicate balance, but there's got to be a way to compromise: should we remove copies of "Gone with the Wind" or "Tom Sawyer" as well?  Where does it end?</comment>

<comment>That wouldn't be a very visually interesting mural.  =)</comment>

<comment>since when have Americans cared about historical preservation?  Almost all the New Deal murals are long gone.  Its a big deal among historians when one is found.  Americans just don't care.</comment>

<comment>I agree; American preservationists are a small but devoted band, often viewed as bored/boring white folks with more time and a willingness to tell others what they "should" do with their property.  With so many lost,preservation of these remaining Depression-era works are all the more important.</comment>

<comment>Minorities receive grants and scholarships and bonus points on their admissions evaluations due to the color of their skin. The vast majority of professors and administrators are ultra-progressives quick to debase themselves in front of any potentially marginalized "identities", and so give them preferential treatment. If there is any "systemic" racism in American universities these days, it is against white people.</comment>

<comment>Vote loud and proud.</comment>

<comment>No, they don't. There are a few private scholarships for specific identifiable groups, and so you have scholarships for people of Italian, Jewish, or African ancestry. These are private scholarships funded by individuals. If white people think there aren't enough private scholarships for white people, they are free to fund as many scholarships as they want. The law cannot tell you to whom you may give your money.Those private scholarships make up a tiny amount of the total financial aid, and all other grants and scholarships are race neutral. Also, most college admissions are race neutral by now too. Racists killed affirmative action, but I guess they won't be happy until they deport every last black person to Africa.</comment>

<comment>In New York State if you are black and have a high school diploma you are guaranteed admission and free tuition to any SUNY college. The money comes from either the colleges endowment or state and federal grants. Whatever the grants don't cover the college picks up the rest of the tab.  Even if you are black and come from a wealthy family you can still get free tuition. You just have to say you live on your own. These students usually use a PO Box for their mail and write down a fake physical address usually a relative or friends address. </comment>

<comment>I don't understand. A African American student put up signs from segregation era America, calls it art. Other African American students see the segregation era signs and become, rightfully so, upset.And this all has to do with racism? And racism, from what I've learned from the young African American protesters, is a problem only in the white community because black people cant be racist, it's a white thing.But there is no white people involved in this aggression. This is a black art student trying to shock other black students. Am I missing something?</comment>

<comment>This is one of the first examples throughout all these discussions that highlights the difference between a safe space and a comfortable space.  In pretty much every example provided in all these debates, nobody was actually harmed physically...they just had their little feelings hurt.  Yes, a campus should be a "safe" space, but you don't have the guarantee of comfort.  Being made to think, or grow a thicker skin, is a positive, not a negative.</comment>

<comment>Well, at least this didn't result in protests over a hate crime perpetuated by white supremacists...</comment>

<comment>If racism is so invisible and easily over-looked that we need obvious signs like this to remind us about it and make us think then I'd say that's a pretty solid evidence that it exists more as an imagined problem than a real one.</comment>

<comment>You say you're not feeling well, but I don't see anything. If I have to use some chemical test or a microscope to find that you're really sick, then I think that's pretty good evidence that you're not. </comment>

<comment>Actually the better analogy is that I feel just fine and you're trying to tell me I'm not and you lack any sort of actual test to prove otherwise.</comment>

<comment>It may be uncomfortable for some to see those signs but that was the reality for black people. We must never forget that horrible part of our history and we certainly don't want to go back to those times but sadly it seems with rules being changed by Republican governors it looks like they are sure trying to make it happen starting with suppressing voting rights!</comment>

<comment>People upset by "white only" and "black only" signs should realize that that is the point of them: how does the sign excluding YOU make you feel? It happened in our country not so long ago. Art is frequently disturbing. Think "Guernica" and many other great works.</comment>

<comment>How does an Asian fit into the White or Black only sign?</comment>

<comment>No cool, clean water to quench your thirst. Look for a puddle, I guess.Kidding aside, just keep on keepin' on. Soon enough Asians will own the utilities and then can do what they see fit. I'd say turn off the taps to both. </comment>

<comment>This is an abuse of the language for political purposes. The term "safe space" comes from the world of talk therapy. The therapist is supposed to create a safe space where the client is free to rage, to cry, to expose himself psychologically without fear of ridicule, judgment, or criticism.In that context, a "safe space" is both logical and appropriate, but to insist that universities should provide that is ridiculous. In a university, you should be judged, criticized, and even ridiculed. If not in university, then when, O Special Snowflake, will you discover that the world is a harsh place that doesn't care much about your feelings?</comment>

<comment>They are slowly coming into the workplace and my experience mentoring one was a huge time suck.  She eventually resigned from a very good 6 figure job because she couldn't handle having to interact, in person, with people who might criticize her work product, when she screwed up (as we all do when we are junior) she hid the problem instead of seeking help, and there was repeated drama that prevented her from working.  We also had a mother of one of these special snowflakes call in to talk to his boss (I kid you not).</comment>

<comment>See, I actually think that was a project with a point. It was good, if unoriginal: It jars people, makes them feel for a moment what it must have been like. Were I a university administrator, I'd commend Powell, and point out that whereas she is a natural ally for the Black Student Union, their furor over comfortable safety causes them to eat their own.</comment>

<comment>Someone should put a colored only sign at the Black Student Union.</comment>

<comment>Yawn.Wow, Millennials, please inform me, does college suck this much?When I was in school 20 years ago, it was all about (1) learning interesting things, and (2) drugs, alcohol, and sex.Now, hedonism is out and ideological goose-stepping is in.Also, does anyone think that this is good art?It seems pretty banal to me: "Racism!"There's lots of smart art that deals with race. This isn't it.  It does speak to warped self-perception: "Look at me I'm so special and provocative!"</comment>

<comment>My .02: As I recall (because I was involved with such from '03-'10), "safe spaces" were originally needed for non-therapeutic support groups, where people could depend on the specific element they were traumatized by to be exempt from the conversation, so they could relate their day-to-day issues to the group.To entertain the possibility of a global, or even non-specific safe space is to imagine a collision-prone arena, where any one person's opinion of "decency" can trump another's, as long as the conversation starts with outrage.IMO It's a troll's heaven and symptomatic of an old problem; the left loves to split.I think a good portion of the turbulence in American universities is a result of the lack of boundaries to define a safe space, but maybe there is some way that these well-educated, organized individuals see entirely self-centered--or tribal/familial--ethical matrices as capable of peaceful coexistence?It's like, I get the underlying message--people of good will and a real history take part in these safe space protests, but this is a horrible avenue to push on; it's very much like eating a grenade.</comment>

<comment>I wonder what would have happened if a white student put up those signs. would Powell, the media, her classmates and the college administration feel the same way about this situation? Would the student be suspended or expelled?</comment>

<comment>A campus should be a safe space as in safe from murderers and robbers... The idea that you should be safe from ideas at a college campus â the epitome of thought and discussion â is utter insanity.</comment>
