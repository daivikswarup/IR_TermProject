<comment>A big story that I haven't seen played up much is the complete underwhelming performance of former governors in this race, after decades of having mostly ex-governor presidents and prominent presidential candidates. I guess that the anti-establishment surges both left and right help to explain this, but aren't Senators just as guilty of being part of the establishment if not more so?</comment>

<comment>Excellent point.  My thinking is that it's due to general polarization of electoral process.  "The governors" in GOP race are clearly better general election candidates (Christie, Bush, Kasich) because they are less radical.  Running a state requires compromise and pragmatism, but primary electorate is so polarized they see them as traitors.  Senators, on the other hand, can retain better ideological purity (even easier for non-political candidates).Political polarization stems from gerrymandering and cynicism of non-ideological voters.In 2012, 10 million people made Mitt Romney the nominee.  That was about 4% of the country's voting age population.  General election turnout is better and given two party system a president is selected by roughly 30% of the eligible voters.  Unfortunately, the options we get by November are determined by a very small group of highly motivated people.  Do they accurately represent  the wishes of the general population?  Maybe.</comment>

<comment>Sarah Palin made turning from a practical compromiser into an ideological polarizer look easy in 2008. So it can be done...but maybe it's a combination of what you said and just a coincidence of personalities in the current race. Oh, and like 49/50 states have Republican governors so that's why no governors are running on the D side except for O'Malley.</comment>

<comment>Big exaggeration on the Republican governors.</comment>

<comment>racism > family valuesend of story</comment>

<comment>you'll find a lot of people arguing essentially "race is family" lately in these comments. come to think of it, I didn't really like the end of Michael Sandel's "Justice" where he argues that we have a greater duty to those immediately around us. I could say I saw that leads down a path toward racism, but I didn't make that connection at the time. I think I'll stick with utility.</comment>

<comment>Mike Huckabee lost because no one cares about Mike .... what's his name again?</comment>

<comment>Because he is a narrow minded homophobic bigoted idiot?</comment>

<comment>Good news is the old duck hunter can oil up his trusty shotgun. Snipe slaying season starts soon. Crow hunting is open again next week. Huck will now have plenty of time to blast bird.</comment>

<comment>The same reason he loses every year, Pinky - trying to get Jesus to take over the world.</comment>

<comment>Angry right-wing supply-side Jesus, specifically.</comment>

<comment>Huckabee changed from nice, amiable Mike to angry, vicious Mike. I doubt the psychotic makeover did anything other than making him look like an opportunist with no fixed convictions.</comment>

<comment>He looks like a religious nut with a tenuous connection to the Real World.</comment>

<comment>I like some of his ideas and have high hopes he's chosen to be a VP running mate.  Him or Paul.</comment>

<comment>His son killed a dog at boyscout camp.  He found a dog, strung it up by its neck, and threw rocks at it till it died - a distinctly evil act which Mike tried to pass off as 'merciful'.  The officer investigating that case was subsequently fired by then Gov. Huckabee for 'not helping my son out with that problem'.  Years later, Huckabee criticized the Obamas' parenting for allowing their children to listen to Beyonce.</comment>

<comment>For real ?  That info is most chilling. THANKS.</comment>

<comment>It's not always the parents fault.  Kids need to take responsibility for their own actions.</comment>

<comment>Not gonna happen.</comment>

<comment>I know.</comment>

<comment>He defends a Duggar who raped his own sister.  I don't need to know another fact about him.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure he has a job waiting for him at Fox News. Or he can do commercials for reverse mortgages.</comment>

<comment>Huckabee made a big mistake in 2008, he took the results personally. He thought that evangelical Iowa voters were voting for him. They weren't, they were voting for Jesus. It's just that in 2008 those Iowa voters thought that Huckabee was the eucharist candidate, representing the "body of Christ". Huckabee's 2008 victory had nothing to do with him, personally. He was just the vessel, channeling Jesus.Jesus in Iowa primaries is like the Dalai Lama. Every 4 years Jesus is reincarnated in a new candidate. Look back to Pat Robertson, who played Jesus for Iowa voters long before Huckabee. Huckabee played Jesus in 2008, while in 2012, Santorum was the Jesus vessel. Now in 2016, Cruz plays Jesus. Evangelical voters in 2016 aren't picking Cruz, anymore than they were picking Huckabee in 2008.  They probably don't even like Cruz, after all he's an insufferable, mean-spirited jerk. But he thumps a mean bible. Cruz gets Iowa's evangelical votes because he's this year's eucharist candidate. They vote for Jesus every year. In 2016 Cruz is the body of Christ, amen. </comment>

<comment>The irony of it all is that if he had decided to run for 2012, he may well have been President by now!  I'm fairly certain he would have beaten Romney, and probably done better in the general than Romney did.Whatever mojo he had back them seems to have been lost this time around.  He started off his campaign with a bizarre criticism of Beyonce (!) and never quite recovered from there.  I think he perhaps took it for granted that all the people who were there for him in the past would automatically rally to him this time, but thing have changed rapidly, and he didn't adjust.But it's like I say, the best candidate for your party is the one that wins.  You win because you're the best person for the job, and you're the best person for the job because you win.  If you can't get enough of your peers to support you, there's no shoulda/coulda/woulda - you're simply not fit to be President.</comment>

<comment>" I'm fairly certain he would have beaten Romney, and probably done better in the general than Romney did."This is political delusion on the highest imaginable level. Carrot Top would have had a better chance than the Huckster.</comment>

<comment>You say that now, knowing what we know now.  Huckabee nearly beat McCain in 2008.  He was a superior candidate to any of those running in 2012.  You forget that people were seriously considering Newt Gingrich at the time.  It's not at all delusional, it's perfectly logical.  Romney won last time because conservative voters lacked an alternative candidate to rally around.  Huckabee would have made that decision simple, and beaten Romney.  At the time, he was also a much better campaigner than Romney, and had less baggage.  Which makes his terrible campaign this time around all the more bewildering.</comment>

<comment>Did you know that Huckabee hawks "diabetes pills" featuring cinnamon as the active ingredient? He reminds me of fellow charlatan Carson and his Mannatech shilling.Huckabee is a religious buffoon who had no business running for a national office. What he wanted was ATTENTION. He obviously got yours! Bought any diabetes pills from him?</comment>

<comment>Forgive me for being naive enough to think I could contribute political analysis in these comments and expect adult responses.  I actually don't have any strong opinions on Mike Huckabee at all.  I think it's a little creepy that you do.  Calm down.  Have a beer.</comment>

<comment>This is a comment section following an article about Huckabee, yet you find it "creepy" that I commented on Huckabee. Got it.</comment>

<comment>In 2012 the Mayo Clinic stated that cinnamon is beneficial in lowering blood sugar of people with Type 2 diabetes.  The reason Huckabee stands out to me is that he hits the nail on the head in his political views.  Especially when he describes Obama's lack of effort and progress.</comment>

<comment>I still think Huckabee would make a great V.P. for Trump.  Word is that's being talked about.  Huckabee is both smart and wise.</comment>

<comment>How absurd.</comment>

<comment>Why did Huck lose? Uh -- he opened his mouth,</comment>

<comment>Huckabee lost because he is a ridiculous, embarrassing buffoon, a loopy religious nut, and a snake-oil salesman.</comment>

<comment>Thank you so much for giving us the neanderthal Commiecrat perspective.  In other words, what would you know about what would appeal to Republican voters?</comment>

<comment>Did Huckabee "appeal to republican voters" in your view then?</comment>
