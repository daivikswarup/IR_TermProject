<comment>If you can't get her with facts, might as well send in Hollywood's Beard Team Six. Go get 'em boys!</comment>

<comment>Nice to slander the Americans who sacrificed to save others.  Maybe you should call the families of the dead to call them liars like Hillary did. How is it that everyone who was actually in Benghazi, and their families are all part of a "vast right wing" conspiracy?Laugh it up until March, when FBI Director Comey will be having the last laugh.</comment>

<comment>She called their families "liars"?  And from what I hear, the families want Right Wingers to stop making their family members' deaths political, to which those honorable Right Wing freaks turned a deaf ear.Gee, Jeff, you call 'em like everyone, save dumb Republicans, sees 'em.</comment>

<comment>WHAT A BUNCH OF IDIOTS YOU ARE mARCHANT2 AND EYE HEART!!!</comment>

<comment>you two year olds shouldn't be commenting on this site...the atlantic should be ashamed</comment>

<comment>YOU NEED TO STOP KISSING YOUR CAMEL'S LIBERAL A(zz)!!!</comment>

<comment>Is crack on sale this week?</comment>

<comment>You should know, you seem to always be on it, after all you are a libby.CAPICHE!</comment>

<comment>* You should know, as liberals have a well documented penchant for engaging in illicit and illegal substances. Do you comprehend the sentiment I am expressing, good sir?</comment>

<comment>Not really because Bush was an admitted hard drug user... So what exactly is the sentiment you're expressing?</comment>

<comment>Yea, I heard Barry Obama sold him da junk back in da day.</comment>

<comment>* You need to stop following the sentiments of your liberal leader's beliefs, while simultaneously expressing undeserved adulation for him.</comment>

<comment>@robert....You've proved YOUR intellect by DEFENDING CLINTON!</comment>

<comment>LOL! Sureeeeee,,,, tel me another one libby!!!</comment>

<comment>* I find the sentiment you expressed amusing, please, present another undoubtedly witty bard, my liberal opponent!</comment>

<comment>again.. can you tell us more about the 192 Embassy personnel killed under George Bush?  WHat have you done to help those families, or expose the "truth" of how that happened?</comment>

<comment>So you are informed enough that Benghazi wasn't an embassy at all? That the Ambassador had actually requested extra security and was denied?  That this outpost was actually being defended by local troops and not American troops? As much as I dislike Bush how many embassies did he have that were defended by local Muslim troops?</comment>

<comment>How high are you right now?</comment>

<comment>not as high as you, remember your a libby </comment>

<comment>*you'rePlease, even if you are going to toss around unsubstantiated quasi-slurs, you should have the common decency to use proper grammar. It is one thing to turn red and scream about how liberals are ruining America. It is quite another to do so and display your utter lack of education in the process. Good sir, you simply damage your own argument.</comment>

<comment>You're implying they had a good or even sensible argument to begin with... I'm not entirely sure proper grammar usage would make much of difference with their nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Good or even sensible argument??? Really??So hillibilly never lied about Bengazi???She was caught red handed as for what she told the Egyptian Minister, her daughter ,and a few others.Facts,! Then to call the loved ones liars, when indeed she, Obama, panetta, and others,,,, blamed it on "An Internet You-Tube Video?????mtbr1975,,, Me Thinks The Lady Doth  Protest Too Much"! Meaning YOU!!!DO YOUR HOMEWORK LIBBY!!!! BEFORE YOU INSERT FOOT IN MOUTH!!!</comment>

<comment>Hey, thanks for the entertaining posts, man.</comment>

<comment>It is always relative towards seeing what the outcome is when you are dealing with allot of LIBBYS, that can't handle the truth about Bengazi. Take Care.</comment>

<comment>Um, I actually enjoy your illiterate ranting. But thanks all the same.</comment>

<comment>About as illiterate as yours baby doll!</comment>

<comment>Unsubstantiated?? Really??? that is what you come and say???I mean  carroll, pls. at least have the current decency to appeal in the proper ways of the liberal party of which you presume to not represent!!! It is very apparent  with your statement that one can,, let's say,, perfectly see through.And I believe that I do not speak like a LIBBY who would be an unconscionably insufferable filcher!  LIBBYS NEVER BELIEVE THE TRUTH!!!Let's just say that libby's  suffer from a shameless exhibition of genetic deficiency!</comment>

<comment>Oh Robert. You started so hopefully, besides your overuse of question marks, it seemed like you were going to express a belief in a somewhat comprehensible manner. Alas, your anger and vitriol got the best of you and you slid back into barely intelligible rage typing.  I do hope, my goodman Robert, that you find some form of medication to allow you to remain calm enough to engage in civil discourse. Even with such a terrible human being as a "libby" as myself. Please understand that, as my first point indicated, you only harm your own argument in your failure to do so.</comment>

<comment>Poor Poor Carroll, one of these day you will wake up and smell the roses!</comment>

<comment>* I disagree with you, users known as Marchant2 and Eye Heart, and question the intelligence of your posts, and in turn, in you, seeing as you are the original posters who have expressed the comments I find to be of such irredeemable stupidity. I say good day to you, sirs.</comment>

<comment>GOOD! GLAD YOUR GONE!</comment>

<comment>Funny that the family members have appeared multiple times on TV and called Hillary a liar. Funny how the democrats kept witnesses away from the committee. Funny how HRC attempted to hide her transactions on a private server.</comment>

<comment>Gee, I'd like a link to all those multiple TV events where the families would be classless enough to call her a liar.  Please provide.  Or are YOU lying?  (I have a feeling it's the latter).</comment>

<comment>sean's mother was on recently on either greta's or megyn's show.  it's probably on you tube. and she is the one who called them all liars because they all......obama, biden, clinton and rice told the families the same thing as they told the nation.</comment>

<comment>FLOWERS,,, MARCHANT 2 IS A TYPICAL LIBBY THAT WOULD VOTE FOR HILLIBILLY EVEN IF SHE WAS JUST OUT OF PRISION!!! GO FIGURE, </comment>

<comment>Capital LETTERS!You are retarded.</comment>

<comment>and your an idiot!</comment>

<comment>Also is a conduction as well.</comment>

<comment>making sure you could read it,, make sure you read this twice so you can, COMPREHEND IT!</comment>

<comment>* I was making sure you could read it. Indeed, you should make sure to reach this twice so you can fully comprehend the sentiment I am trying so desperately to express.Just trying to help out.</comment>

<comment>^^DOH !!</comment>

<comment>Don't insult the retarded like that, they're clearly a Conservative. Most handicapped folks have far more heart and intelligence than a typical Republican.</comment>

<comment>mtb 1975,,, must be when you were born..Retarded is what you are LIBBY loving Hillary  BOY!!!Besides, you remind me of a piteously obtuse malefactor of which you are collecting arbitrary dereliction of genetics! </comment>

<comment>* Flowers, the user known as Marchant 2 is a typical liberal that would vote for Hillary, whom I find amusing to derogatorily refer to as Hillbilly, even had she been convicted and prosecuted as a crime. Go figure!</comment>

<comment>When was she prosecuted and convicted for a crime, in fact, when was she even charged? I must have missed that.</comment>

<comment>When was Hitler?  Al Capone was only convicted of failure to file a tax return.  Hillary's husband was impeached and disbarred.  Many of their associates were convicted and did time in prison.  Chelsea's in-laws actually are convicted criminals.  Bill is a convicted sex offender in the court of public opinion.  Now you can not say you missed it.</comment>

<comment>^^ This is what passes for "illuminated reasoning" in the pitch black quarters of the city.</comment>

<comment>" Bill is a convicted sex offender in the court of public opinion."Can't touch that, as M.C. Hammer would say.</comment>

<comment>Your dead on qaz zaq! Great point given, but remember your taking to mtbr THE LIBBY who thinks Hillary and Billy Boy do no wrong! And also libbys can't deal with facts!!!</comment>

<comment>Of course she wasn't. I went down the list of Robert's comments and simply fixed all of them into a form of semi-decent human communication. I don't believe his nonsense!</comment>

<comment>You mean about those wmd's</comment>

<comment>Can you say Pat Tillman? talk about lying, look it up if you don't know what I am referring to.</comment>

<comment>While Pat's death and cover up is a real tragedy and another black mark on the Bush Administration this one is all Obama's and Hillary's. The truth was obvious from the beginning. To imagine that a ragtag group of demonstrators could possibly sustain a 13 hour firefight complete with pin point mortar fire based on a reaction to a childish video that no one actually saw is a silly premise. What is truly revealing is that Obama and Clinton actually believed that by deflecting the attack's root cause to a video this would get them off the hook. When in reality  it betrayed how weak the security around mission really was. In one of the most dangerous cities on the planet there is simply no excuse and regardless of budgets you either rob Peter to pay Paul or close it down. The truth is Clinton and Obama could not admit they were missing in action on this one or that their efforts in Libya had failed. So they sought to cover it up and in doing made a mockery out of the life of Ambassador Stevens and the other men who there. The incredible heroism of those that survived was likewise tarnished by an administration that puts ideology ahead of integrity and honor.Anyone who cannot see by now what a despicable human being Hillary is a foolish child.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for a civil answer and very well stated.  My point is they all do it so it seems unfair to try and target some and not others is ridiculous, they should all be held accountable.</comment>

<comment>No sane person cares about the Benghazi attacks.  Those dead heroes went their willingly for a big paycheck and they came out on the shit end of the stick.  Cover up?  Are you serious or joking?  What difference does all this bluster make now?  None.  It's just a political tool for suckers and morons of the right wing.</comment>

<comment>That just isn't true.  I believe that most Americans look at the Administration's failure and inaction and lying in and about Benghazi with horror and disgust.  It should have been cause for impeachment of Obama and it should totally disqualify Clinton as a candidate for president.</comment>

<comment>Sure, you "believe" that.  And you're wrong.</comment>

<comment>The slobbering buffoons that comment at Breitbart are not "most Americans".</comment>

<comment>I think I am the only one among my friends that slobbers.  But Kevin does have a monkey face.  (Oh, you said buffoons.  Sorry.)</comment>

<comment>^^ Amen.</comment>

<comment>and the 8 committees that exonerated clinton...are they also lying?</comment>

<comment>Johnny, I think that answer to that is there was some truth and some lies in those committees.No findings satisfactorily answered the Administration's lack of reaction to pleas for better security.  Nor did they answer the stand down (I think there is a lie there - claiming no stand down).  Nor did they satisfactorily answer why there was denial of the source of perpetrators - pretending a video was the cause.The number of committees is not an answer.  Nor am I on the other side - were I believe we should hound Obama and Clinton until they are beatenFor me, personally, I could accept errors that caused it to happen.  Those are lessons learned - and I can accept that whether this happened during a Democrat or Republican Administration.That there is a cover up is pretty clear. And becoming more so every day.  And that is what bothers most people.  Benghazi could be accepted except for the stand down and cover up.We can have an administration that makes errors.  We do not want an administration that lies to cover its mistakes.</comment>

<comment>Sure the finding was the Republicans cut the budget for security at US embassies... Funny how that works.</comment>

<comment>A child has money for lunch and a snack.  His allowance is cut, but he still buys the snack, and then complains about not having lunch money.</comment>

<comment>8 Committees utterly dominated by Right Wing loudmouths and grandstanders, constituted for the sole purpose of pillorying Clinton with everything and anything they could, perfectly willing to lie and exaggerate grotesquely about what they "found", failed to find any evidence of a cover up, and admitted as much.  Jason Chaffetz surely admitted as much, and so did Trey Gowdy.  So, anything since about "suspecting a coverup" is nonsense and, practically, slander, and in fact intended as such.  That's where the pretense of fair mindedness among the continuing accusers falls away utterly.</comment>

<comment>S.  I don't care about Right or Left Wings.   It is not about dominating - or winning.  If questions were really answered how can we have this movie even made?  The makers would look foolish!  Quit being liberal or conservative - and see that a great harm was done - and it is unresolved.I am not interested in beating you in an online debate - and defeating Hillary.There appears to have been a stand down.  And there obviously was a cover up.So far, I have perceived you as intelligent - except for thinking quips are logic.  Go ahead and be liberal, but be an honest one.</comment>

<comment>If the security was so bad then why did Ambassador Stevens go to Benghazi with only one security aid?Again, this was a terrorist attack on a CIA compound. Yet, you wanted the WH to come out and tell the world that the CIA was operating clandestinely in Benghazi.  Seriously dude, this is only a concern to those who want to make it a political scandal at the cost of American security.</comment>

<comment>Fusion, I don't know how to react to you just pretending.  The failures have been stated over and over.  I cannot see how claims of scandal or security are anything but a diversionary argument.  Good luck with it.</comment>

<comment>I'm not the one claiming all the questions haven't been answered.It was a CIA outpost. it was not a consulate or had anything to do with being a diplomatic post.The outpost was attacked by terrorists. Period. It was in an unsettled part of the world where our people get hazard pay for a reason.When the news of the attack came out, the CIA did not want its role revealed. So the WH went with the agreed story that the terrorist attack was inspired by the Youtube video. In fact, there was some evidence that it was a reason. That same day, there were demonstrations in front of 13 other Middle Eastern embassies.Even after being briefed that this was an attack on a CIA operation, the Republicans continued their attack on the Administration because they had gone with what was believed to be the reason and to cover the CIA.Now, you continue with the nonsense that "what didn't they do". This was not a State Department operation. The people involved did not work for the State Department with the exception of the Ambassador and his security agent.  Are you that uncaring about America to understand that crap happens?I know exactly where you stand. And it isn't for America.</comment>

<comment>I have not idea what you are trying to say. Lets see if we agree on these.1) An ambassador and 3 others were killed2) This ambassador had requested more security at the Benghazi site - whether it was a diplomatic compound or a CIA site. (Wikipedia calls it a diplomatic compound. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...3) The increased security was not provided - (with Democrats insisting its budget was cut, and Republicans responding that the money that should have been spent was considered discretionary - and spent elsewhere).4) When the attack happen, resources were available to fend off the attack - and the resources were withheld - told to stand down. And the fight lasted 13 hours until 4 Americans were killed5) The stand down order is disputed with some claiming it never happened - and others claiming it was ordered. (Strong evidence that there was a stand down order is that fact that no resources were deployed. Available resources and their time distance away have been debated.)6) The Administration tried to blame a video -and evidence has emerged in the last month that proves they knew it was a lie at the time of the attack.7) Family of the 4 dead are claiming the they were lied to by the administration - about the video claim.Which one of these points do you believe is made moot by your stating it was a CIA outpost?</comment>

<comment>So you have the FOX version down pretty good.http://www.snopes.com/politics...</comment>

<comment>Well, that put me in my place.  I don't like Fox or CNN.  What an asinine response.  Do you think that people cannot think for themselves?</comment>

<comment>Here is from the Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com...On Sept. 11, 2012, heavily armed Islamist militants launched an organized attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, setting fire to buildings before all U.S. personnel could escape or reinforcements could arrive. The attackers later launched mortar rounds at a nearby CIA compound. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the violence, making it the first time since 1979 that a U.S. ambassador was killed in the line of duty. On June 15, 2014That is was a secret CIA site is just plain stupid.  There is a fortified compound next to a diplomatic mission - and no one thinks its American?  Think for a moment - if it was a secret site, how would they know to attack it? Did they just luckily follow the ambassador?  And if it was a secret site, why would that excuse not securing it?  And after it was being attacked, it certainly wasn't secret.  Why would anyone not  rescue them?  What possible reason would justify a stand down?And you do know that the CIA also reports to the Administration?You just creating an excuse to justify what happen.  Then you are pretending that those who do not agree with you are unAmerican.Really?</comment>

<comment>So why do you hate America?http://www.businessinsider.com...</comment>

<comment>Fusion, CIA missions are undertaken at every embassy - in every country.  Are you really excusing that as the lack of action?Do you hear yourself?  Oh, people are shooting at us, but we must not shoot back because we are undercover.  Don't you think the cover was blown?Really?</comment>

<comment>Look, you are the one blaming Clinton for what happened in Benghazi. The State Department was a cover for a highly secretive CIA mission. In case you were unaware, Benghazi wasn't even on the list of State department missions.Seymor Hersh wrote a book on Benghazi. But you claim it wasn't a CIA operation. http://www.washingtonsblog.com...</comment>

<comment>Fusion, the CIA can run all the operations it wants.  People can write all the books they want.  None of that excuses Benghazi.There is no secret; there is no operation - weapons or not - that excuses standing down in that attack.  Would you lay there and say, "Okay, they can kill me.  Its all right, because there is an operation?  After I am gone, wouldn't it be neat if somebody wrote a book?"And in the smoke you are blowing, we are all supposed to forget Arab Spring, the video excuse, the uncovered emails, the 13 hour unsupported fight, the lies over the bodies.Oh, none of that matters.  There was a CIA operation.  Oh, and someone wrote a book.You support all this, and I am the one who doesn't think?</comment>

<comment>You are right on that last point, you won't think. You are just intent on blaming Clinton for a CIA operation.No one has answered why Stevens would go to Benghazi with only one security detail if he was so concerned with the situation, especially on the anniversary of 9/11. The detail that flew from Tripoli to Benghazi were all CIA and organized by the CIA.Neither the State Department nor the DOD had an emergency force ready to go on a moment's notice. Not in Libya. Not in Italy. Not in Germany. Not in Europe. Not even in the USA.What you really wanted was the CIA cover be blown and secret operations be revealed. You don't care if the reason for the operation was valid or not. You just want to blame Clinton.Don't go away mad, just go away.</comment>

<comment>Good luck .  But, Yes, I think I think the CIA argument is a flawed continuation of the cover up, borrowed for the excuse, the same as the video was..</comment>

<comment>You're dead wrong. There is no evidence the Obama Admin did anything wrong. NONE. Republicans have even stated as much. How come there were many more investigations over this than there was over 9/11 when there was significant evidence of Bush Admin wrong doing? Or the CIA torture, the Iraq Prisons.... Yeah, those were war crimes, no investigation.</comment>

<comment>And four dead Americans who fought a terrorist group alone for 13 hours, then died, while the administration watched is not evidence?</comment>

<comment>No, it's not "evidence".  You've probably worn your "Beau Geste" DVD to a frazzle with the repeated playing, the tear stains, and the popcorn grease.  Great, everybody loves a thrilling tearjerker.  But Benghazi was not "Beau Geste", no matter how much you want bloody romance in your life.  What you cite is evidence of nothing, and I know evidence.</comment>

<comment>S.  We don't win by the most words.  (By the way, I do like Georgette Heyer Romances.  I think they are funny.  (I also have written two books myself- YA fiction.  Not good enough to publish, but they are out on Amazon.  One Wish is about 100,000 words.   The Dancing with Emily is about 50,000 words))I suppose there is not way I can get you to quit arguing by attempting to denigrate your opponent.  You have the makings of being something - but that is a flaw.The answer to your response  is  Yes, there is at least circumstantial evidence.  And  returning to other statements by you, that is a reason those 8 committees have not satisfied all - but already believers - the unanswered circumstances are too strong.People are not stupid because they disagree with you.  As clever as you are - and I think you are, there are sound arguments against you.  I can tell so much about what you are thinking by what you argue - and there would not be space here to lead you down a line of thinking that would show you how to balance you thoughts.But I hope you know that I wish you well.</comment>

<comment>Good will wrapped in archness and condescension is always.....stirring.  Thanks !!  :-)</comment>

<comment>Or perhaps wisdom and experience.  Good luck.</comment>

<comment>^^ Has lost his mind.</comment>

<comment>When "impeachment" is your answer to every question, you've got a serious problem.  After George Bush escaped from his terms without being drawn and quartered in Lafayette Park, it's fair to say we should never hear the word "impeachment" from any Republican again.  When we do, we know we're dealing with insanity.</comment>

<comment>Sorry.. but how many millions have WE taxpayers paid so far to prove NOTHING?  They've tried everything, and there is simply nothing that Clinton or Obama did that was illegal or wrong. FFS, try another angle. Maybe you can see if she had a young male intern. You low info voters LOVE that kind of thing....</comment>

<comment>The way to save money would be to disclose.  If you read my comments you will understand I can understand the failure - I cannot understand the untruths.</comment>

<comment>What failure? There was a terrorist attack on a CIA compound operating in a war zone. Period. Yet you nimrods expected the WH to stand up and tell the world that this was a CIA operation that was attacked just days after it happened. Who effen does that?</comment>

<comment>Again, I cannot fathom what you are up to?  There is nothing hidden here,  Is the CIA argument a new twist on explaining why there was a cover up>  Again, good luck</comment>

<comment>You didn't know it was a CIA compound? Geeze, no wonder you don't understand why Hillary Clinton has been found through several investigations to be blameless. Where the heck do you think the mercenaries came from?</comment>

<comment>John, you are exactly right.  I am personally acquainted with a retired Army Ranger who went to work as a private security person in Iraq some years back.  He got shot and gravely wounded by an AK-47 weilded by another different security contractor employee.  He came back to the US and received well over a year of serious, critical medical care at a well known military hospital.  He had a terrible disability.  Within no more than a year or two, he went back to Iraq, and back to work as a security guy, with a very bad limp, I'm guessing.  But at all times, working as a private security guy after military retirement, he was paid a fortune.  I think that is why he.....they.....are called "fortune hunters".  Mercenaries.  And make no mistake, the intensive use of mercenaries by the Bush administration, and the Iraqi government, does much to subvert the morale and reputation of our uniformed soldiers.  First, a uniformed grunt has to begin to ask himself, "why am I doing this for next to nothing, risking my life, when I could get out, and make a fortune doing the same thing?"  This causes a loss of the kind of experienced soldiers that keep less experienced soldiers safer in combat.  Secondly, mercenaries running wild without the threat of military discipline degrade the reputation of America, and confidence in America's motives, when we venture into combat abroad.  That winds up costing lives.  So let's not kid ourselves, at least two of the four killed in Benghazi were mercenaries.  Period.  And the Ambassador was on an "extra ambassadorial" undertaking to arm jihadis in Syria.  Got that?  Shades of putting arms in the hands of Bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 80s.  That might not have been a great idea.</comment>

<comment>Actually what subverts the morale of the military is sequestration before all else - not contractors that used to be in the military. Cutting troop numbers, cutting out of Iraq and seeing the gains all lost - that is what has decreased the morale of the military that fought so many deployments in the past 2 wars. I know.</comment>

<comment>Typical reaction of a leftist with no soul or sense of spiritual purpose.</comment>

<comment>Something bad happened, therefore it is a liberal conspiracy.  You are a true genius, my friend.</comment>

<comment>Why did it happen?  The reasons appear to be lack of attention to threats, standing down when attacked, and lying about the cause.Conspiracy?  I suppose not in its cause.  But, yes, I think so in it cover up.</comment>

<comment>Wait, Ken, so you're talking about 9/11.</comment>

<comment>You think 9/11 was a liberal conspiracy?  Or are you just attempting a clever quip?</comment>

<comment>It WAS a "clever quip".  No wonder you missed it.</comment>

<comment>^^ANOTHER clever quip.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  I've been told I'm not funny at all.  Good luck with your endeavors .</comment>

<comment>Watch more Comedy Central.  And good luck to you too.</comment>

<comment>There was no standing down, this has been proven to not be true, over and over.</comment>

<comment>No, it has not been proven.  We have quotes for military forces who were told to stand down.  You can claim it is disputed.  Then you have to decide who you believe.Example of a claim that stand down orders were given:http://www.truthandaction.org/...Example of a claim that no stand down orders were give:http://www.snopes.com/politics...</comment>

<comment>^^^ The toxic Right Wing poisonous lie has been consumed, digested and now is a part of their very cell structure.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that was the original story, but they quickly changed it once more was known. That's how it works in the real world and why no Republican lead investigation has found any wrongdoing with anyone in the White House.</comment>

<comment>I agree that as events unfold the truth is better known.  But, in this case, it looks like there is evidence in Hillary's emails that she knew the truth before the video story was concocted.</comment>

<comment>^^^ On a first name basis with "Greta and Megyn"!!!  LOLOL</comment>

<comment>and 8 committees who exonerated clinton...are they also lying?</comment>

<comment>All the Republican lead "investigations" have not found any wrong doing let alone lying by Clinton or anyone else in the White House.</comment>

<comment>Classless?? you have a bloody nerve Hillary is the one that LIED???? just as she did when she said she ran under firebut you just don't want to believe that as she is a DEMORATdid YOU have a son that was killed during this TERRORIST ATTACK …….didn't think so you liberal GITTopen your lazy eyes and check for you yourself</comment>

<comment>^^^^^ WAY off his meds, right here.</comment>

<comment>And TRump saw thousands of Muslims tailgating on building on 9/11.  BTW, factcheck didn't name a lie of the year, it named a person the lie of the year because he is a pathological liar who lies daily.</comment>

<comment>There are many witnesses that corroborated Trump's statement but don't expect the lame-stream media to report it.</comment>

<comment>Major broadcasting outlets maintain digital archives.  None exist, hence you are a fool.  BTW, the MSM is decidedly conservative.  For years 70 80% of the guests on nSunday news shows are and have been Republicans and the major outlets are owned and operated by trans-national corporations which are definitely conservative. Your naivete is childishly charming however.</comment>

<comment>Is CBS a major enough broadcasting outlet for you?http://www.truthrevolt.org/new...Everybody knows the mainstream media is left-leaning so your assertion that it's decidedly Republican is absurd. The media was in bed with Obama and now they're in bed with Hillary and Bernie.I can't believe out of one billion sperm you were the quickest.</comment>

<comment>"Everybody" does NOT know that the mainstream media is left-leaning.  Do you have some hard fact to back up your assertion?</comment>

<comment>Just decades of observation. Here, I'll give you just one example:Observe how the Associated Press reported Hillary Clinton’s announcement to run for president. Then look at how theyreported Carly Fiorina’s announcement. “Hillary Rodham Clinton, in kickoff to 2016 campaign, embraces her potential to make history.”Breaking: Former technology executive Carly Fiorina, saysshe’s seeking GOP presidential nomination.http://twitchy.com/2015/06/14/...</comment>

<comment>Because Hillary is a bigger candidate and has a better chance of winning while Carly couldn't even get a senate seat. Get it?</comment>

<comment>Uh, no. You're the one that doesn't get it when it comes to media bias. Smarten up.</comment>

<comment>Give up, it's a "bridge too far" for the Quickest Sperm in God's Firmament.</comment>

<comment>Hillary might just make history as she may be the only candidate who may soon be under indictment by the FBI.</comment>

<comment>Could be, but even if she does get indicted, she'll probably be acquitted.</comment>

<comment>Got any money to put on that idiotic statement...</comment>

<comment>Extremely unlikely.  Moreover, everytime the "House GOP Jihadi Committee" raises the issue of whether secret information was transmitted in an unsecured way via those emails, the Jihadis themselves manage to stumble and bumble into releasing secret information themselves.  First, Jason Chaffetz, then Trey Gowdy.....who's next?</comment>

<comment>Your out of context example proves nada!</comment>

<comment>Sure, it's always "out of context" when it doesn't fit the liberal narrative.</comment>

<comment>http://www.washingtonexaminer....http://www.westernjournalism.c...http://www.mrc.org/static/abou...</comment>

<comment>If you had any smats, you'd know your statement to be outrageously false. Murdoch and Co. own about 50% of all media outlets. So if you think Murdoch is a liberal and a Democrat, you also believe Santa and the tooth fairy are Democrats.</comment>

<comment>And extremist lefty Ted Turner owns much of the rest. Regardless, it's lefties running the stations. Smarten up.</comment>

<comment>^^ I detect a Baston accent.</comment>

<comment>So you think that all of these corporate owned news outlets are out there trying to help out the middle class?  C'mon man.</comment>

<comment>Nope, quite the opposite. They're feeding the middle class and poor a load of crap.</comment>

<comment>Where is the evidence that thousands and thousands of Muslims were cheering 9/11 in New Jersey. It sure isn't in that link.</comment>

<comment>What trump and the others saw was done in Iran, not Jersey....and it's no secret that we are hated in the middle east.</comment>

<comment>ah because you say so and you saw all the city when this was happening. Typical liberal who invents things because he wants to believe it. And the San Bernadino killings were due to postpartum like the press claims, both parents, who cares what they did on facebook about ISIS....</comment>

<comment>Trump lied about personally eye-witnessed "thousand and thousand" of Muslims cheering....an all too obvious lie. Therefore, he gives liberals free feign to lie all they want and make up little fantasies that would make a Hollywood sci-fi writer jealous.</comment>

<comment>What Trump didn't do was dither in the face of an attack that left 4 men dead (for no reason) he did not lose the first Ambassador in 30 years and then lie about the cause of it to the families and the World.  Hillary is such a SOS (i don't mean Sec of State) that she even told the families that she was personally going to go after the maker of the video and not the actual men who shot their loved ones. How ludicrous and self serving.</comment>

<comment>The tiny remaining number of principled Republicans and Christians are speaking out forcefully and compellingly against the idea of a Trump presidency, and especially the idea of folks fancying themselves "christian" supporting this monster.  And they're right.</comment>

<comment>Speaking of inventing, Trump makes things up as he goes along, the fact checkers can't keep up with the amount of bullshit coming from his mouth, he is delusional and dangerous as are the fools supporting him.</comment>

<comment>What difference does that make he is not an elected official. He was not the SOS at the time of the attack. The hard left (commies) in this country now full well they have a horrid candidate in Hillary. She is not likable, she is a liar (I dodged sniper fire) and she is disgusting.So if you think deflecting this woman's evil nature by bringing up a Republican will make it all better you are a child.</comment>

<comment>Stop making an ass of yourself, Otto.Oh, and nice to see you back.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the closest to a fascist leader, but other Rapos are close behind. Republican party has become the party of extremists, hatred, and pecksniffians!</comment>

<comment>Nice try but no cigar. Even CBS reported at the time the same thing Trump and many other witnesses saw. In New Jersey.</comment>

<comment>Bullshit ,every station has denied this and that they captured footage of it, it did happen in Iran where we did see it, get your facts straight and educate yourself, anyone who supports Trump is a fool.</comment>

<comment>Too late if CBS is trying to deny it. They reported it at the time. Look it up. Anyone who supports Hillary or Bernie has the IQ of a fencepost.</comment>

<comment>No they didn't. They reported on a possible partying by a handful of people in one apartment no where near Trump's claim. He lied and you bought right into it.</comment>

<comment>And where the hell are all this witnesses? Not one has come forward to corroborate Trump's sewage lies. Hell, the right wing propaganda media has not even given them voice...because they don't exist (maybe Trump can pay a few out of work New York actors to play the roles of angry militant cheering Muslims).</comment>

<comment>http://www.truthrevolt.org/new...I guess ignorance is bliss, huh?</comment>

<comment>eight idiots dancing on a rooftop is a far cry from the thousandsupon thousands Trump claimed to have seen.</comment>

<comment>even if it was 1000 as the CLOWN claims, how can he possibly look at a video and tell what ethnicity the people in the video are?Bigotry is the only conclusion, like the Sikh Indian man that was attacked in Fresno in December by two guys who thought he was a Muslim.To me, this clown is loud and clear - HE'S A BIGOT!!</comment>

<comment>The truth does not make ANYONE a racist.</comment>

<comment>The point is, if I see a black person on TV I shouldn't assume the person is African American, he could be Brasilian, or French, or other. -- so that's an outfight lie, anyone thinking otherwise is a bigot, no question about that!</comment>

<comment>That's sort of silly.  If I watch BBC, and  there's a ( Semite, Black, Asian) with a British accent, it is bigoted to assume they are British?  WTF.  It's this type of thinking that generates unsolvable, emotional,  non-problems that are deemed problems.</comment>

<comment>Not the point.  The point was Muslims are in the USA and having a party celebrating a muslim victory the fall of the towers.  Everyone one of those people should have been deported.  You missed the CNN clip so there was about 400 folks in the room.</comment>

<comment>He didn't say, "Thousands upon thousands." He said thousands. And it was vastly more than 8 idiots.http://www.truthrevolt.org/new...</comment>

<comment>Liberals parroting lies.  You nailed it!</comment>

<comment>"Cooberate"?  "Ignorance is....bless"??!!  OMG.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for bringing to attention my typos, the corrections have been made.Now, if only your attention to reality were as good as your attention to spelling...</comment>

<comment>It appears I have an eye for detail that you lack.  Obviously.</comment>

<comment>It matters.</comment>

<comment>I've noticed there are many things that "appear" to you that are in conflict with reality. Your powers of observation are akin to the bird that keeps slamming against the picture window, trying to get to that "other" bird it keeps seeing. Good luck.</comment>

<comment>I'm just encouraged that you "noticed" anything.  But a Drake should beware of avian metaphors.  That one was Quackers. "Water Birds Turning Up Dead At Solar Projects In the Desert", KCET ReWire, by Chris Clarke, July 17, 2013.  See also KCET.com.  Be careful out there !</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but you present no challenge to me. You're boring, arrogant and full of yourself. Good bye.</comment>

<comment>Lol, bounce that last one off of some of your brighter neighbors.  The internal tension within it has us all in stitches on my end!  :-)</comment>

<comment>"Cooberated" is not a word. Please cease attempting to phonetically spell smart-people words you've overheard in order to appear smart yourself, because it's just not working out for you.</comment>

<comment>"Corroborated" was the word I meant to say, please forgive the typo, "tolerant" liberal. Meanwhile, you might consider using a different photo to go with your pseudonym. It makes you look like an imbecile.</comment>

<comment>That photo is my avatar, not my pseudonym--you really don't know what words mean, do you? Please keep demonstrating your ignorance and insecurity--much like my avatar, they're at least good for a laugh. </comment>

<comment>Yes, your avatar is your photo but your pseudonym is "cjbussey."And the only thing good for a laugh are your posts.</comment>

<comment>Here's the best part, the one that I've been waiting for:I can change my photo any time I want. I can even change my name. But you, sir, will be a moron forever--and there's nothing that you can do to change that. So enjoy!</comment>

<comment>You'd believe in Santa and the tooth fairy, too!</comment>

<comment>CBS reported the same thing at the time. Look it up, dummy.</comment>

<comment>I suspect your referenced "witnesses" were found by fox news and the likes.  When are you guys going to understand that they feed you BS and keep you in the dark even though you are not mushrooms.  ( Although too much of the koolaid could turn you into a mushroom I suspect.)</comment>

<comment>CBS reported it, look it up, smart-ass.</comment>

<comment>I have looked it up smart ass.  Just not on fox.</comment>

<comment>Then you would have known CBS reported it about 14 years before Fox did. Idiot.</comment>

<comment>Even Blaze, not exactly liberal with Glen Beck said that was false.</comment>

<comment>Show me.</comment>

<comment>Trump isn't the only one who saw them and the news paper who claimed the same thing suddenly years later is writing a retraction ..  funny - sad.</comment>

<comment>I was there right across the river perfect view there we at most 20 people cheering and they all got the hell beat out of them , another Trump lie .</comment>

<comment>yeah, and how do you do that, how do you look at a video and know what ethnicity the people in the video are, do you ask them?  IDIOT!!</comment>

<comment>And anyone who believes Trump the chump and his lies and really pathetic.</comment>

<comment>What in the world does this have to do with Trump. Hillary is a despicable human being who puts her ideology and her thirst for power above honor and integrity. She is diabolically evil and should be in prison.</comment>

<comment>Thank goodness you are not judge and jury.</comment>

<comment>Somebody mentioned liars so I had to bring up the world champion who is the idol and mirror of REpubs.  Perhaps you are out of step with the rest of us.http://www.gallup.com/poll/166...</comment>

<comment>Nasty,  subjugated, and stubborn to the end!</comment>

<comment>They all lie, did you have a son that was killed during this attack?  None of us were there and I suspect that the truth will remain at large because so few politicians on both sides know what the truth is or how to tell it.If you don't think Republicans are above lying about this tragedy you are delusional, as much as you point at Clinton Dems will point to Bush and daddy.</comment>

<comment>Yes they both lie.</comment>

<comment>YOUR AN IDIOT AS THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDIUNG MARCHANT LIBBY!!!</comment>

<comment>^^^WHAT are you even ranting about??!!  LOL, you make NO fucking sense!!!  LOLOL  "Marchant Libbies"??!!  WTF??</comment>

<comment>YOUR JUST A TYPICAL LOW INFORMATION HILLARY VOTER!go ahead little boy, get all the lies out, it's ok!</comment>

<comment>well, your side has spun quite a few beauts- remember "Saddam has WMDs"?  Or how about that snake Wolfowitz crowing "The war will pay for itself"?  Or Darth Cheney's "We will be greeted as liberators"?  Tell that to the 4,500 US soldiers in early graves.</comment>

<comment>Saddam did have conventional wmds, including biological and chemical wmds, and he used them, just not nukes, although he said he did have nukes and he was trying hard to get them.  We did not fight for Iraq's oil, with which Wolfowitz expected to pay for the war, and we were greeted as liberators by Iraqi soldiers in the Gulf War, but we stopped short of liberating Iraq then, and just liberated Kuwait from Iraq.</comment>

<comment>HISTORY, Iraq NEVER had any nukes nor the capability of gaining them. they NEVER had biological weapons but Saddam used chemicals against some of the Kurds. The Iraqis have song considered the US military invaders (against international law and the Geneva Convention) and occupiers. The US got rid of Saddam and replaced him with Maliki, who lived in asylum in Iran, who then mounted a crusade to rid the government and the military of his opposing religious factions and slaughter many who protested. We were NOT the liberators you believe, but the destroyers who bombed their infrastructure to hell and gone, killing well over 160,000 innocent Iraqi men, women, and children, and NEVER rebuilt anything (in spite of Cheney's Halliburton walking away with untold millions and the contractor failing to live up to their no-bid contracts. And you have no idea just what a conventional weapon is.</comment>

<comment>That's your own spin on the subject, not history.</comment>

<comment>The WMDs were decrepit garbage sold to the Iraqis by the USA.  They were found decaying, strewn about in the desert.  There were no WMDs that posed a threat to the US.  Nice try at revisionism.  You are sick in the head if you believe the US was greeted as liberators.  Want to see the pictures of the tens of thousands of Iraqis that we butchered?  The pics of the kids with their arms blown off by American heroes?  Where's that 'common sense' you right wingers are supposed to have in spades?  Honest to god, who makes monsters like you?</comment>

<comment>BETTER BRUSH YOUR TEETH WITH YOUR DADDY OR MOMMAS FINGERS FIRST,,,, YOU LOOK LIKE THE TYPICAL 2 BRAIN CELL "LOW INFORMATION VOTER". AND MAKE SURE YOU TELL YOUR P.O.S. PRESIDENT ABOUT WHY ISIS IS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE IN IRAQ!!!!</comment>

<comment>The president know well; ISIS is an offshoot of the rebel cause that was begun during the Bush Administration and was the loose organization, operating under the flag of Al Qaeda, to rout the American out of THEIR country. History bites.</comment>

<comment>The reason ISIS came into Iraq was because your dear sweet president let them in!!!DO your homework and find out why!!!Because he didn't listen to his Generals on leaving a residual force there!!DUH!!!!ONCE AGAIN DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!</comment>

<comment>of course they were let in - idiot!!I bet you couldn't shoot a squirrel in the head even if it was tied to the barrel!!</comment>

<comment>We all know O. is a coward first class. What's there to argue.His command: Well I'm safe now - - retreat!</comment>

<comment>ug really keep up yes saddam had WMD and he even used them, the press was ONLY talking about not finding any nukes, he had biological and chemical WMD, he used them to wipe out a Kurd city in the north of Iraq. YES THERE WERE WMD  good grief keep up liberals.</comment>

<comment>The United Nations technical inspection team found no WMDs whatsoever....including chemical weapons. History, my friend.</comment>

<comment>Bad intel. pure & simple. but well rid of a fascist that had his sights on the tot. M. East. & where would we be w/ our oil/gas for our suv's so we can get to work & earn  a living, right?Thank's W. for standing up to a tyrant. If Chamberlain had done the same 50 mill. would not have been lost in w.w. 2. A little hist. is so-oo revealing.</comment>

<comment>And thousand and thousand of young Americans died...and even thousand more crippled and maimed for life and will draw VA disability payments for the next 60+ years...courtesy of the budget pinching conservatives.</comment>

<comment>yes, the costs of that needless war will be with us for decades. That's why I get furious when people respond "Bush isn't president anymore" or "Give Bush a rest."</comment>

<comment>Do you have an opinion about Obama's war?</comment>

<comment>you mean the ones he inherited from Bush who FUBARed them both?</comment>

<comment>Bush didn't start that war.  Obama made promises not to go to war.  He was paid off like every other Politician.</comment>

<comment>President bush's results are what we can judge republican ideas from.  He was given a nearly balanced budget so he gave a massive tax cut and exploded the deficit.  He allowed an attack on us soil leaving 3000 people dead, and he did not catch the offender.  The number of private sector jobs DECREASED during his tenure.  The banking system crashed causing a recession.  We don't need a repeat of failed republican ideas.</comment>

<comment>Check the Repub demo, it is uneducated whites, overwhelmingly.</comment>

<comment>bahaha! Repub demo?     All blacks, hispanics, illegals and welfare mooches vote democrat not republican.    Your stats are bogus!!!!!</comment>

<comment>So to prove my point, what college do you hold a degree from?http://themonkeycage.org/2012/...</comment>

<comment>Michigan Tech University, Houghton Michigan</comment>

<comment>Hailey, zat you?  Glass, how did you get in on this?  Glass I would be ashamed to relate to the jack pine savages and welfare kings of the UP the way you do.</comment>

<comment>tsk tsk.  Ad homeinems..the high road of the anti-intellectual</comment>

<comment>If a conservative were to use the phrase "Uneducated blacks," he or she would have every liberal on this thread calling him or her a racist. But I suppose YOU get a pass because you're a liberal.</comment>

<comment>Check the DEM demo, they're indoctrinated into the unicorn farts and soap bubble utopia.</comment>

<comment>And provable data as well as scientific consensus. Take anthroprogenic climate change where 97% of climate scientists concur and failure of conservative econ idiocy like trickle-down which has NEVER worked.</comment>

<comment>NASA is now debunking anthropomorphic climate change. They have stated that ice is increasing in the Antarctic and that temperatures have not risen in 18 years.By the way, that 97% figure is bogus.</comment>

<comment>Odd NASA's own website neglected to mention that.http://climate.nasa.gov/eviden...</comment>

<comment>https://www.therealstrategy.co...</comment>

<comment>liberals hold on to lies FOREVER, it has been DISPROVEN the 97 percent figure is total bogus propaganda. It was calculated from stories in a single liberal magazine...  DUMB. Oh yeah CO2 is falling and the global temperature is falling and many scientists say CO2 FOLLOWS temperature increases from the sun, which 20 years ago ended a very high activity cycle and is now in a very low one.</comment>

<comment>Of course there is climate change.  That's the way the world works.  Reduce carbon foot prints?  Stop producing more kids.  Who produces the most kids is the group that needs to cut back more.  Lets now issue license to the world's citizens for kids.  If you are not approved to have kids, you are sterilized.  If you have 2 kids or more, you are sterilized.  To get a license to have kids you must pass some tests, 1- financial viability to support them, 2- genetic 3- psychological.  failure of any one test, no kids.  Allow people to voluntarily sterilize at age 18.   Now I expect the world's liberals to be first in line for this because it's the best thing for human driven climate change.  What I find odd is I am really surprised liberals are not more hawkish, after all, war kills people thus reducing the number of carbon footprints, which is good for the planet and the climate.</comment>

<comment>MAGNUM STUPID A RACIST TOO.</comment>

<comment>Sarcasm sweety.</comment>

<comment>And who is going to make the decision who is worthy to have kids? You?</comment>

<comment>ope- since this global policy it fall under two sets of powers.  People can voluntarily remain childless.  The government can then decide to reward that behavior.   Like all licensing and regulation, it would be the government's decision of course.   We need license to get married, to own animals, and machinery, and guns, and even land.   But it wouldn't be me making such decisions.  I  don't have enough money to run for office and I don't have a government job.   But my logic is true.  If one beleives humans are causing climate change, then the only way to improve reading on climate change are to reduce the number of humans.  The world can reduce humans several ways:1-war2- do not rend aid, let heath issues run their course3- set a max population limit per country4 - enforce birth control, regardless of "religion" a family of 10 kids isn't good for the planet.5- enforce Birth control of families with 2 kids.6- allow voluntary sterilization.  This is not allowed in the USA before age 35.No not me making a decision.  I am just making a point that carbon foot prints are people.  I wonder why the USA always has to take the full brunt of climate change issues.  Why not the Chinese and Mexico.  Ever been to the border and seen the pollution belching out of Mexico?  Ever been to India and not be able to breathe the air?  China's polution  is practically an internet celebrity.  Climate change is a global problem, yet it is unfair that it always seems to be a US problem.  It is not.   Now the Chinese have relaxed the one child rule, that's just going to create more carbon foot prints.   Why aren't the climate change crowd doing something about that?In short- climate change results in draconian, and anti-liberty polices while promoting the reduction of carbon foot prints.   Not a nice picture, but hey, let's fix climate  change by government policy!   I just showed you how that can go horribly wrong and horribly right at the same time.</comment>

<comment>Or could this be hilarious Hillary, lying cheating g bill or Chelsey who earns over a million a year and does nothing</comment>

<comment>tamra your are 100% correct,, here is something no one here wants to talk about;Think about something she once said to all of the women,,,,"I Want To Be The Champion Of Women".As several Countries in the Middle East( who are notorious  for abusing women) contribute to her and billy boy's  so called,,,,, Clinton Foundation!!!!! Of which you are right,,,, they appointed Chelsey to run the foundation!!!How convenient to set their daughter so she is set for life drawing a million a year!!!!And wonder why the FBI did have about 100 agents looking into,The E-MAIL SCANDAL!!!!AND NOW IT'S OVER 150 FBI AGENTS LOOKING,,WHY???BECAUSE NOW,,, THEY SEE ALLOT OF IMPROPRIETIES,,HER USING HER APPOINTED STATUS AS SECRETARY OF STATE TO ADVANCE THEIR SO CALLED PRECIOUS FOUNDATION!!!! </comment>

<comment>And YOU'RE an idiot for now knowing you native language and murdering it.</comment>

<comment>and your just a plain ole libby idiot!!!</comment>

<comment>The actual maxim is: The proof of the pudding is in the eating.</comment>

<comment>And that sir is  correct as,,, Hillary will be In The Pudding,, because now, there are over 150 FBI agents investigating inconsistencies and improprieties from her visits to the middle east and the money coming into her and sex offender hubby Billy Boy's so called tax free,, Foundation while she was Sec. of State.</comment>

<comment>the proof is in the pudding?chocolate pudding I suppose!!Now let me ask you this question, you dummy, could it had been coffee pudding instead?</comment>

<comment>Well Lamont,,, "You Big Dummy" as Sanford would say,,,,,It could be because it's still morning,, and Morning coffee pudding is always the best. take care.</comment>

<comment>@Marchant   Andrew Stevens asked Hillary many times in prior months to give the Benghazi people MORE SECURITY AND SHE IGNORED EVERY REQUEST.  THERE ARE EMAILS TO SUBSTANTIATE THEM! Guess you have not watched FOX and the mother of Sean Smith."As seen on America's Newsroomby Fox News Insider	"Patricia Smith, the mother of one of the four victims of the Benghazi attack, said this morning on "America's Newsroom" that she still has not heard anything from Hillary Clinton.	After her son, Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith, was killed in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack, Smith said the then-secretary of state assured her that she would give her a full accounting of what happened.	Since then, Smith said she's never heard from Clinton or her office, and accused the State Department of withholding information about her son's death.	"As far as I'm concerned, Hillary is anti-mother. She will not give me an answer to anything. As far as I know, it was the video that caused everything because no one has told me any different," she said.	Over the weekend, a former staffer on the Republican-led special Benghazi committee claimed that he was fired for refusing to join what he called a partisan effort to go after Clinton."</comment>

<comment>waybackwhen, How many "investigations" have we had now...and EVERY ONE of them ruled there was "no wrong-doing" by any one.  You, and all the others who choose to bring Benghazi into every argument don't want to admit the truth and no matter how many investigations you people line up, they will all come to the same conclusion...but, of course, that won't make you stop using Benghazi as a battering ram.  We have now spent more time, effort and taxpayer's dollars on the Benghazi affair than we did investigating 9-11.  Try being an adult about it and admit (at least to yourself) that you're wrong.</comment>

<comment>yeah there was no wrongdoing, BECAUSE SHE WITHHELD THE EVIDENCE, there have been subpoenas for her emails for years and she NEVER gave them to the courts and she DESTROYED thousands of them, see what the FBI says now that they have most of them to actually FINALLY work with.</comment>

<comment>Ok, Michael, enlighten me.  What evidence has Hillary held back?  She has given them every email she had and we haven't heard a peep about them finding anything new.  What evidence do you have that she destroyed any emails at all?  Don't talk rhetoric...talk proven facts.</comment>

<comment>Why are the America tax payers paying for her security. The money she made for trading favors w other countries while she seved as secretary of state should pay for it. I bet you her security guards hate her</comment>

<comment>Because they pay for security for all their leaders and advisors  and do you honestly think she would be the only politician taking a kickback?  Bush got thousand of our troops killed to protect the family oil and should be tried for war crimes so one party is as bad as the other.</comment>

She said it was because of the video."Sean Smith's uncle: "Mrs. Clinton really has a problem embracing the truth."Glen Doherty's sister: "When I think back now to that day and what she knew, it shows me a lot about her character that she would choose in that moment to basically perpetuate what she knew was untrue."</comment>

<comment>http://m.townhall.com/tipsheet...</comment>

<comment>Cite source then, because I also remember the family said they don't want to turn it into political and everyone with a brain know the whole investigation is a BIG FAT JOKE that waste over 50 millions of tax money.</comment>

<comment>Took me eight seconds to look it up. Ever heard of Google, or is that too much like "work" for you lazy source-requesting junkies?https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Ahh yes, from Fox Noise, bravo to pay enough money for a few of them to finally talk. Then what?The family is in dire needs for financial help and with enough lying to old people, anything can happen. Are these families know the truth? The answer is NO, they only believe what Fox Noise tell them and with enough money, that help a lot as well.</comment>

<comment>So, don't ask for sources anymore. Educate yourself, rather than expecting others to do your research for you. That way, you find something to your own liking and bias. Problem solved.I don't watch Fox News. I'm not even Republican. You asked the other person for a cite, and my link was for the sole purpose of teaching you how easy it is to do things yourself... not necessarily for you to accept its validity.</comment>

<comment>Look at the date of your source.I am responding to a guy that said MULTIPLES appearance of the family member, which means it should be during the over 7 times investigation. Perhaps a good reading comprehension class would do wonder for you.This is just a way to advertise for the movie, which FAR from the TRUTH. I can see you can easily be manipulate.Again, perhaps read what I am responding to first before you try to sound smart, take your own advice, LOL.</comment>

<comment>I'm not here to argue with you. I'm merely making the point to  research things yourself, instead of requesting others to do it for you, while you sit on your lazy ∂SS doing nothing. Nobody has a different internet than you do. Free yourself from your bubble. Once you let go of brainwashing, party indoctrination, you can more clearly differentiate facts from lies.</comment>

<comment>You are trying to argue by jumping into something you clearly didn't even prepare to.Again, like I said, I am RESPONDING to something like "MULTIPLES APPEARANCES" during the 7 times of investigation. You didn't read it and try to sound smart by citing a source just "recently" that is clearly an advertise for the movie.Again, reading comprehension class may help you on this.</comment>

<comment>Your pathetic party-biased, closed-minded defensiveness is only going to hurt your life, not mine. Free yourself.</comment>

<comment>REMEMBER HE IS A "LOW INFORMATION VOTER"!! LOL!</comment>

<comment>Yep, Youtube....a reputable source.   I saw it on the internet, so it must be true.....Bonjour....</comment>

<comment>So, don't watch it. Easy.</comment>

<comment>DO YOUR HOMEWORK IDIOT!!!</comment>

<comment>Oh, please...</comment>

<comment>See my replies below if your internet connection is fast enough to keep up.</comment>

<comment>Hah!</comment>

<comment>Fox news #1 news source for a reason.   They gave these family members a voice!  NBC, ABC, CNN and MSNBC ignore news they don't want the us to know.  These families are calling Hillary a LIAR because she LIED!   So you have a problem with Fox news reporting the Truth?  Wow!!!</comment>

<comment>Everything about your post, from its conception, to its reasoning, to its execution, illustrates with crystal clarity what a fool you are.  Shut up now.  Do yourself a favor.  "Giving a voice" to Right Wingers is not the job of a "news" organization, Clod.</comment>

<comment>Most Democrats are not intelligent or educated enough to figure out how to think for themselves, much less search, and must be spoon-fed by their masters.</comment>

<comment>Robert, please inform your 3rd grade teacher that he or she failed to teach you the difference between 'your' and 'you're.'  It's not too late for this teacher to fix this problem.If the average 9 year old writes better than you do, you really should not call anyone else an idiot or "low information voter."</comment>

<comment>you poor poor LIBBY!!!</comment>

<comment>Not everyone,just the people with a brain and they don't vote against their interest.</comment>

<comment>Hey goofy,  have Trey hold a SEVENTH hearing.  Yeah, that should do it. Hillary just adores these FREE televised 11-hour campaign ads.Bernie says he wants to appear before Trey, too...something about equal exposure.ps...breaking news: Trey just named 2015 Democratic Man of the Year. Richly deserved.</comment>

<comment>Funny, I don't remember any family member calling her a liar and that would have been on ALL the major networks.  Seems as if the guy who claims to be the mastermind of BGHAZI says the internet anti-Islamic recording prompted the attack.  ONLY AN IDIOT (A Repub ) WOULD RULE THIS OUT AFTER 5 OR 6 MAJOR DEMONSTRATIONS IN OTHER Islamic COUNTRIES that very day at American embassies. The next day Obama did however call the attack an act of terrorism.  How is it that Hillary has the power to keep witness from House investigations?  Please explain.  Oh and opening up your server and having ALL e-mails released is hiding?  Good Goat seems to be a dumb goat.</comment>

<comment>It was all over the news, (google Hillary is a liar, and pick your source) there was no riot in Benghazi, Obama did not call it terrorism, but an act of terror.Thank God we're not depending on your recollection of anything.</comment>

<comment>Yep. Liberals-- wrong about everything but damned pleased with themselves.</comment>

<comment>Oh, yeah, you keep rubbing 'em out to that little mantra.</comment>

<comment>I know it’s super popular right now to call everything “racism.” This morning I put a bit of milk into my coffee. I made it “less black.” Racism! Who am I to whitewash my coffee? I’m calling the ACLU to get me into a reeducation program. BlackCoffeeMatters.</comment>

<comment>Are you this irrelevant, witless and stupid about EVERY subject you comment on?  Honestly, I know the dimmest have the greatest self regard, but don't let that seduce you into getting it on here, because I promise you you ain't that guy.</comment>
