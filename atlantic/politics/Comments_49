<comment>"The taxes Sanders is calling for are in a different league from any peacetime Democratic candidate in history.  The single-payer health plan alone, according to the estimates of the Sanders campaign, requires raising as much revenue as the federal government collected in 2013 through the individual income and estate taxes"Glad someone is finally pinning some numbers onto Sander's insane fantasy. The GOP are deftly going after Clinton as they are salivating at the chance of going up against a candidate like Sanders. Team Clinton needs to up their game and expose Sanders for the tax-and-spend extremist, anti-capitalist, anti-trade, anti-innovation candidate that he really is.</comment>

<comment>I don't know why people say "tax-and-spend "is a bad thing. I mean, yeah, taxes. But we had 8 years of "cut taxes and spend" from Bush and a bunch of Republican candidates whose budgets don't add up since then. We've already got a massive debt we've got to pay off even if we balance the budget tomorrow. No one likes new taxes, but shouldn't finding revenue for your programs be considered responsible?</comment>

<comment>Indeed.  Tax and spend is a basic function of government. Otherwise why have government?  Of course,  many things can be accomplished by rearranging spending.</comment>

<comment>You're speaking, of course, of the backroom deals already made on Wall Street ages ago.They may not fly this time.</comment>

<comment>Government spending will not, by itself, solve all problems. It will buy votes, however.</comment>

<comment>Government spending can solve the problem of an economy not working at 100% capacity, or with significant unemployment. This is the fundamental Keynesian principle which has been denied by the Republican party for 40 years, to their own demise. It's true, and it has been recognized as a fact since the 1930s, when every industrialized economy on Earth implemented Keynesian spending and never stopped.</comment>

<comment>Most government spending is intended to buy the political loyalty of the recipients, and Keynes provided the New Dealers a convenient justification.</comment>

<comment>I'm not talking about the US alone. In England, home spending was their "new deal", and it was implemented by Chamberlain. In Germany, it was Autobahn and military spending (this was copied by the US in the 1950s), and that was mostly under Hitler. Whichever politician was first with Keynsianism in their respective country won tremendous power, for good or for ill. Every country has Keynsian spending, it is required for an economy to function. If you have too little taxes, the inequality can balloon to catastrophic proportions, and you end up like Argentina.</comment>

<comment>It is not the function of government to use taxes for any social ends. Taxes are solely for the purpose of generating revenue to run the government as prescribed in the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but the constitution was Amended in 1919 to allow a progressive personal income tax for precisely this purpose. The constitution has amendments for a reason.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but you did not read what I wrote. Taxes were put in place to fund the running of the government and I have no problem with that. Taxes were never meant to be used to affect people's behavior and that was my point.You might want to consider a course in reading comprehension.</comment>

<comment>Progressive income taxes are not for affecting people's behavior, they are for redistributing ill-gotten high incomes. That's a major function of government since even before the New Deal.</comment>

<comment>You cannot be serious. Are you saying that all those millions of people were stupid buying Apple iPads and IPhones. Are you saying that this stupidity led to Apple receiving ill gotten gains? Sorry sir, but capitalism is the fairest of all economic systems and accounts for the fact that we live in luxury compared to any other time in the history of man.You should get out a read some history, especially the parts that describe the unconditional failures of governments like the one Bernie is proposing.</comment>

<comment>Of course they were stupid buying iPads, but the stupidity is due to the problem of  corporate monopoly, not of the interface design of the device. You can't even log into an iPad remotely, programming it is a nightmare of closed corporate OS and opaque standards, it doesn't run flash just because Steve Jobs had a funny feeling, and it has an interface that is designed top down by a corporate bureaucracy. That bureaucracy might be making the right choice regarding interface today, but it cannot be counted on to make the right choice in the future.The only resolution to these problems is a true competitive market for tablets, not a monopolized industry under unified ownership. Apple didn't invent much of anything of value since it stopped being a small Apple II company, it has become a corporate dead weight preventing competition.Bernie Sanders' proposals are successful everywhere they are used, and his economic policy is pro small-business and pro competition. You need to learn how innovation happens, and how economies work. They don't work when there is no competition, and a small number of people at the top of a small number of corporations stuff money into their pockets. That's not American, it's Soviet, and this is the cause of failure of every economy that went down that road.</comment>

<comment>"Apple didn't invent much of anything of value since it stopped being a small Apple II company, it has become a corporate dead weight preventing competition."In this case, how did it become a "monopoly" on tablets, and smart phones?</comment>

<comment>By rehiring a CEO who managed like Stalin and knows how to steal the best ideas. That's not a program for stable progress.</comment>

<comment>Ron - "corporations stuff money into their pockets..." EXACTLY. Big corporations are buying back all their stock instead of investing in ideas. Either there are no good ideas anymore or some folks are very greedy and and want to own everything. The Fed pumped trillions into the economy (Quantative Easing) with the hopes of sparking economic activity only to see the oligarchs "stuff money into their pockets". One only has to look at the M2 reported at the St. Louis Fed to see that during the quantative easing the volume of money actually nosedived when it should have been spiking up. Big money saw this as their greatest opportunity in the history of monetary systems to take full control of our economy.</comment>

<comment>"Progressive income taxes are not for affecting people's behavior, they are for redistributing ill-gotten high incomes. "What's the evidence that everyone paying top marginal rates did not deserve their income?</comment>

<comment>The evidence is the laws of economic equilibrium, where the difference in competitive salary is about a factor of 5-10, the same as the difference between a great programmer who programs embedded systems,and a hack.All higher salaries are noncompetitive, and are derived from political power in the boardroom or in collusion with government.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that amendment was about taxing unearned income, not wages.</comment>

<comment>Nope. But that was covered in Grade 5 Civics class. Well, for those who went to a real school.</comment>

<comment>So you're telling me you didn't go to a black high school, huh?*giggle*</comment>

<comment>You must be another one of those home schooled idiots. Those who were educated know that Grade 5 is in elementary school.</comment>

<comment>OK,FYI, Baggers don't know funny. They are also the least educated demographic.</comment>

<comment>rofl. I'm sorry you don't feel yourself to be funny or intelligent---both of which are correct assumptions.And I'm still getting a good laugh at how you didn't get the joke. too high-brow for such a dummy like you.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should have stayed awake in class.  The nation's first tax on wages was passed during the Civil War.   The Constitution didn't prohibit direct taxes, but the requirement that direct taxes be apportioned across the states created a politically impossible situation, and without the Sixteenth taxes on unearned income were essentially impossible, unlike taxes on wages which had both been done and were arguably excise taxes and thus not subject to the apportionment clause- the same arguments used in support of them in 1861.</comment>

<comment>What is your point? The XVIth struck down the "apportion" part of the original Constitution. Ron was correct, but it was ratified in 1913, not 1919.</comment>

<comment>I already said my point:  the main purpose was to be able to tax unearned income.  Federal courts had consistently held that taxing investments were a direct tax subject to apportionment.  That wasn't the case with wages.   Congress didn't need an amendment to tax income as long as it came from wages, and the Sixteenth says squat-all about imposing s progressive tax structure.</comment>

<comment>The purpose of the XVIth Amendment was two fold; to impose income tax when and where Congress wanted to AND to spend that money as Congress sees fit.Taxes were still to be apportioned even if they did tax income.</comment>

<comment>http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-...</comment>

<comment>No, stupid, the Constitution was amended,  to allow for tax based on income.There is absolutely nothing in the amendment about redistributing income.Any source you cite for a "reason" will only be one person who supported the amendment for their own personal reasons. Which only applies to them and their own personal hopes and wishes, not the Constitution's actual meaning.Have a nice day, airhead.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Why isn't it? Please tell us where in the Constitution that the government may not raise and spend money on social programs.</comment>

<comment>Frances Perkins, FDR's Secretary of Labor , was tasked with finding a way to finance Social Security before the program was presented to Congress.. She got her answer at a Washington cocktail party from Chief Justice Harlan Stone , who said "The taxing power, my dear. You can do anything with it."This was, of course, recently confirmed  I Chief Justice John Roberts in the first Obamacare decision. Two conservative justices over 70 years apart; same answer.</comment>

<comment>You argument is silly. The Constitution enumerates what the government cannot do to usurp the freedom of the citizens of the U.S. It does not enumerate the things that it does to the people. It protects people like you from being forced to attend right-wing indoctrination camps when people you do not agree with gain power. It protects everyone from illegal takings and protects our free speech.Tell me where in the Constitution it says that we must bilk taxpayers for a failed anti-poverty program to the tune of trillions of dollars over 50 years and has had no effect on poverty rates? Why are we putting huge debt burdens on the yet-to-be born rather than fixing failing social security and Medicare programs? Why are we forcing young workers to pay a large part of their pay into FICA with no promise they will get their money back and if they do, the returns will be terrible?When money is taken from the private sector and ill spent by government it is money not available for a young person to start a business and for businesses to grow and hire more employees.I am not against government, but I am against wasteful government.</comment>

<comment>So you can't tell us where in the Constitution that the Government may not raise and spend money on social problems. Gotcha. You just pulled it out your butt and went with it without thinking first.Tell me where in the Constitution it says that we must bilk taxpayers for a failed anti-poverty program to the tune of trillions of dollars over 50 years and has had no effect on poverty rates?Yup. You got caught BSing about the Constitutionality to fund social programs so you moved the goal posts to some new BS.Look armpit, it isn't up to me to prove they succeeded. Economists do recognize that LBJ's poverty programs do work. Maybe I should restate that REAL economists recognize that poverty programs do work.

<comment>You may not be familiar with Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, which provides that "The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . ." Or perhaps you know of a definition of "general Welfare" that excludes "social ends"?</comment>

<comment>Yes. It was a time known as the Great Depression in all of those nations and it ended in World War. Most rational folks would rather not relive those days.</comment>

<comment>You relive them whenever you stop doing Keynsianism. We're reliving them right now.</comment>

<comment>Not at all, Ron. We're reliving Keynsianism. Malaise, depression, misery indexes, the whole nine yards.</comment>

<comment>Those are right wing talking points. No real economist takes this seriously. What you call "malaise" is Carter's austerity program, which was designed to end inflation, and it did. Inflation and unemployment can coexist when there is no capital to invest in new business, because it has inflated away. This is why you stop stimulating when inflation starts, as Carter responsibly did. That's what you call "misery index". The association with depression is unfortunate, as the only real depression is due to Bush's Reaganomics.Unforutnately, the Republican party ran on foolish anti-economic fantasy ideas, which were decried by economists on all sides, and now they believe their own voodoo. That's not a responsible party, and they must never be elected to any office ever again, as they don't understand the basic principles of economics.</comment>

<comment>Those are truths, Ron. Carter was misery, FDR was misery, Obama is misery. You and the other creepy progs prefer misery, I get it.</comment>

<comment>Times were tough under Carter, but that had more to do with the OPEC Oil Crises than any internal problem. As for misery? Did you thank Reagan and especially Bush II for ruining the economy?</comment>

<comment>No, it had a lot to do with Carter's failed policies. That's why voters gave him the boot.Times were great under Reagan. Everyone knows that. Bush was a disappointment, to be sure.</comment>

<comment>What failed policies? Oh right, ya, just say "failed policies" and that means it is true. Just like the rest of the BS you've been posting.You give all the indications of being one of those lower intelligence Trump supporters / Limbaugh listeners. No thought required.</comment>

<comment>"Wear a sweater" is one that immediately comes to mind! Almost as good as "Overinflate your tires!"Hahahahaha!But it's easier for you to start in with namecalling and insults, isn't it ? Pretty typical of Democrats and I see it every day. Heck, Red Sanders and the Greedy Old White Hag have built their campaigns on such.</comment>

<comment>So you can't list any "failed policies". Then, after pointing out that you have the indications of being a low intelligent Trump supporter / Limbaugh listener, you start claiming I called you names. Well I didn't, but I do notice you didn't deny it. So what did you do? Instead of listing those failed policies, you start calling Sanders and Clinton names.First, I too would be offended by being compared to a Trump supporter or Limbaugh listener.Anyone with an IQ  above room temperature would be.Second, you demonstrated my point. I bet you don't even understand.</comment>

<comment>Actually, "wear a sweater" is pretty indicative of one of Carter's signature policy areas, Mr. F. If you were smarter, you'd know that.Carter's economic failures are well known. It was a time of misery, and a time of inventing new words to describe such misery.  He was all over the place--increase money supply, decrease it, decrease interest rates, increase them, regulate, deregulate.  A clueless disaster.</comment>

<comment>He was ending the inflation of the overstimulation of Vietnam war production. Nixon stimulated the economy so much, he had to impose price controls to prevent inflation, and instead created gas-lines. Carter's economic policy was successful, he ended inflation in 4 years, and he also deregulated the Airlines for competition, and started the AT&T breakup in 1979. All these things, Reagan took credit for ridiculously.</comment>

<comment>He was all over the place. A dismal failure. Everyone knows that.</comment>

<comment>If by "everyone" you mean all the folks who are about to die soon from old age, you are right.</comment>

<comment>Yes, of course. Youngsters know what life is all about. Older people with experience are idiots.</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the world of the children of the boomers, whose parents snorted and smoked away their memory.</comment>

<comment>Of course. They have it all figured out, just like the boomers had it all figured out while they were doing all that smoking and snorting.As you mature a bit maybe you'll see that not much changes and every generation thinks it's special. Any older person could tell you that, if you'd listen.</comment>

<comment>It's a rare generation whose "specialness" consists of undoing fifty years of progress in economic theory. There was also (outside Italy, the USSR and California) some regress in physics, a ton of regress in philosophy, regress in mathematics. It's amazing how much damage a bit of snorting and smoking can do, although honestly, most of the damage was due to monopoly in TV/radio/newspaper media, the drugs only harmed individuals. On the other hand, there was progress in string theory, and some progress in anarchist thought, and after the internet came along, it's easy to explain the old stuff to new folks. That's what I'm doing here.</comment>

<comment>Italy, the USSR and California are all doing swimmingly, aren't they!No thanks!</comment>

<comment>lol. "explaining" to a leftist airhead is always "I assert this to be true, anything that contradicts me is wrong, no I don't need to provide proof."your lies are pretty sad there, little loser.and hilarious.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>"He was ending the inflation of the overstimulation of Vietnam war production. "When? The cut in money supply happened when Reagan was president."Carter's economic policy was successful, he ended inflation in 4 years"What was inflation in January 1981?</comment>

<comment>Volker did the monetary policy, and he was a Carter appointee, and he ended inflation in the four years from 1978 to 1982. It's just that the austerity cost Carter his job in the interim, so yu're giving Reagan false credit.Reagan's appointee was the moronic Greenspan, who was not a Keynsian, and didn't know what he was doing.</comment>

<comment>Are you against sweaters?</comment>

<comment>I'm against widespread misery. I realize that might be hard for a creepy prog to understand.</comment>

<comment>No, you are against sweaters.</comment>

<comment>Eat Your Peas, Ron. Take a Pill Grandma! Obama commands it!</comment>

<comment>I grew up under Reagan, and it was the worst time of my life. The constant panic induced by fear of accidental nuclear war was sufficient to put him into the "worst president in history" category.</comment>

<comment>Your difficult childhood explains a lot.No, there was no constant panic induced by fear of accidental nuclear war. I think maybe your daddy and your acne was more to blame.</comment>

<comment>No, the Pershing II missile system, with 7 minutes to Moscow was to blame. Reagan mouthing off about "evil empires" was to blame. George Bush mouthing off about surviving limited nuclear war was to blame. The Korean Air shootdown, whatever that was, was to blame. The Soviets believed there would be a nuclear first strike in 1983, and they had glitches that could have led to war. Every 10 year old child was panicking about nuclear war, especially accidental war, but curiously enough, none of the adults (around me at least). The adults were wrong. The kids were right. I stopped listening to old people in 1985.The psychiatric association of the 1980s had a clinical diagnosis for children with complete paralyzing fear of nuclear war. I wasn't one of them, but I still had debilitating nightmares once a month. Nothing you can say can ever make me think of Reagan as anything other than a madman who risked nuclear war just to look strong.Other than Reagan, my childhood was normal.</comment>

<comment>Blame for what? There was no widespread panic. You're delusional.</comment>

<comment>I guess the million anti-nuke protesters in NYC were delusional, and the millions of European protesters trying to get intermediate range ICBMs out of Western Europe. And the folks who made "Threads", "The Sacrifice", "Special Bulletin", "The Day After", "Testament", "War Games", and "Miracle Mile" were all delusional, since nobody cared about the topic of those films.Google "films about nuclear war" and you'll find that they cluster around two periods: 1964 (near the Cuban Missile Crisis) and in 1984 (near the Reagan is so stupid crisis).I can guarantee you ONE person was definitely delusional. That's Yuri Andropov. He was completely positive the US was going to launch a nuclear first strike in 1983, and his network of spies had to calm him down that there was no preparation for this sort of thing. But there was still a provocative simulation of a launch in 1983, and a Soviet satellite glitch that looked like a launch. The cold war was extremely serious in 1983, because the intermediate range missiles made the required response time shorter than 10 minutes, so you had hair-trigger launch sequences.All kids knew it. All the adults were clueless. They had smoked and snorted all their worries away. Can't wait til your generation is gone.</comment>

<comment>They weren't delusional, perhaps, but they weren't panicked, either.</comment>

<comment>Reagan defeated USSR and took economy from Carter's recession into growth.</comment>

<comment>Carter's recession was necessary to remove inflation. In Israel, it was "Peres austerity", and it removed hyperinflation in the early 80s. This is the advance in monetary policy of the 80s, and it came from the left. Reagan did nothing of value.</comment>

<comment>Times were not great under Reagan. Unemployment was over 7%.</comment>

<comment>Sure they were. Unemployment was high at the beginning of his term as he was cleaning up Jimmah the Jooh Hater's mess. By the end, it had tailed off quite a bit.Everyone knows that.</comment>

<comment>Carter is not a Jew-hater, he led to the Egypt peace-treaty, still the best peace treaty ever signed in the Middle East.</comment>

<comment>Sure he is. He's publicly apologized for it, in fact.</comment>

<comment>He can apologize all he wants, he still wasn't guilty. Jesse Jackson wasn't guilty either, even though he called NYC "Hymietown". Racism is not a problem of bad language.</comment>

<comment>Sure it is, Ron.</comment>

<comment>Racism is not a collection of forbidden bad words, it's a power structure that systematically removes people from decision making.</comment>

<comment>You might be interested in this recent letter about moralistic gods http://www.nature.com/articles...</comment>

<comment>Sure it is. The collection of bad words helps make it happen. Just ask Jimmy the Jew Hater.</comment>

<comment>lol. racism is nothing more than noticing a pattern in people based on race.and noticing patterns is a sign of intelligence.but you wouldn't know that, would you, airhead?*giggle*</comment>

<comment>And "idiotism" is nothing more than noticing a pattern in people based on their online comments.</comment>

<comment>According to Forbes magazine and indices President Obama outperformed Reagan on jobs.http://www.forbes.com/sites/ad...</comment>

<comment>Pretty hilarious.We've got the highest non-participation rate since--you guessed it--Jimmy Carter.</comment>

<comment>Do you only care about yourself or do you want to see higher employment in the US?  Go argue with Forbes, that bastion of liberal economics.  BTW, the slide of blue collar jobs started in the 70s and continues  today.  Thank Globablization and shipping jobs overseas. But Corporations always have the best economic interests of America at heart, right?    If we don't fix the HB1 visa situation where corporations bring in foreign workers and pay them 70% of the going rate for highly educated STEM workers in America, you can guarantee that slide will continue.</comment>

<comment>Still, we've got the highest non participation rate since--you guessed it--Jimmy Carter.Of course I am worried about those chronically unemployed folks who have given up and fallen out of the official statistics Obama wants you to keep parroting. That's why I don't parrot those bogus numbers.Why do you?</comment>

<comment>Carter was one of the two or so reasonable postwar presidents, Eisenhower being the other one. Reagan took credit for Carter accomplishments in reducing inflation, deregulating airlines, and breaking up AT&T. Reagan added nothing but nonsense economics, but enjoyed the inflation free economy he inherited, and created a boom-bust cycle which led to a market crash and recession in 1987 and to a deep recession in 1991.Carter's malaise is the austerity Volker imposed to end inflation.There is nothing you can do about it. The reason you associate Carter with misery is that Democrats are only elected when Republicans screw things up so badly that the ruling class can't bear the economic conditions anymore. We are now witnessing the end of that cycle, as the ruling class loses its grip on elections, with Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Carter was a disaster. Everyone knows that.Reagan was great. Everyone knows that, too.</comment>

<comment>Reagan was catastrophic, everyone under age 50 knows that. Carter was a great president, everyone is slowly learning that.What the media repeats is not what is eventually settled on as the truth. You will have to learn that the hard way.</comment>

<comment>Yes, of course. The kids have all the answers. After all, they've taken freshman courses in college.Good thinking, Ron.</comment>

<comment>Don't trust anyone over 50?</comment>

<comment>Sanders is 74, and just missed the cocaine orgy that created Reagan.</comment>

<comment>Everyone knows that? Are you twelve?</comment>

<comment>Not at all, JS. I'm an eyewitness to both.</comment>

<comment>I was also an eyewitness.  Carter was a better ex-President.  And Reaganomics doesn't work, never did, never will.</comment>

<comment>Carter has been the worst ex president in this country's history. Constantly bad mouthing the U.S. overseas, making anti-semitic statements, etc., etc. Almost worse at being an ex president than he was a president.Reaganomics worked great. Everybody knows that.</comment>

<comment>lol. No real economist takes this seriously.I see the True Scotsman is over on the lefies side. Always. NEVER QUESTION THE LEFT WING AGENDA! (/sarcasm)oh , you airheaded rich and powerful really do make me laugh.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Economists make quantitative predictions, and the definition of "real economist" is one that predicts the numbers right. There are relatively conservative Keynesians (like Nixon's advisors) and Marxist Keynesians (like some European economists) but there are no serious non-Keynesian economists.*bang* *bang* (whiff)</comment>

<comment>rofl. again, we see our little airhead lefty just asserting the No True Scotsman fallacy---because he has no facts, beyond his little airheaded assertions, to back it up.It's cute what a failure at debate you are.*chuckles*</comment>

<comment>I don't need to debate you, just use primitive propaganda The only process I need to win is the fact checking session that the reader will do on google. That's already accomplished. That's what makes the internet different from TV.</comment>

<comment>rofl. it's cute how you admit you're just using primitive propaganda, logical fallacies, and demanding everyone else prove your arguments for you.you truly are a low-IQ buffoon.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Two nobel prize winners, Hayek and Friedman, both very serious economists come to mind... Both were anti-Keynesians, and both were proven wrong when stagflation proved Keynesian economics to be wrong.Read a text book on macro economics, and learn about the Philipps curve, the foundation of Keynesian economics...P.S. I wonder if you ever show your nose outside of liberal and hard-left bubble. It seems like you don't know anything about the non-hard left views.</comment>

<comment>Hayek and Friedman are not serious, they are buffoons. They make wrong predictions, regarding the change in employment when you raise minimum wage, regarding the amount of inflation when you do stimulus by monetary expansion, everything. They are just propped up by right wing money.The "philips curve" is a bastardization of Keynesian economics. The proper term for Keynesian economics is "Marxist economics without Marxist statist prescriptions", but that's a mouthful, so I just say "Keynesian" for short. Economics is a bought field, and you aren't allowed to say the name "Marx", so the most important analysis is buried and hidden, and everything is obfuscated, but the result of using Marx's economics but just removing the "state takes over everything" part is Keynesian theory.The Philips curve is not a prediction of Keynesianism, it's something philips made up to describe a true effect by a bogus quantitative claim.The true effect is that when you have the infrastructure to employ everyone, and you introduce a policy perturbation that moves you closer to equilibrium, you employ more people! When everyone is employed, and you try to go further, you produce inflation.To illustrate the effect, imagine you are increasing minimum wage. As minimum wage goes up, purchasing goes up, and people get employed to satisfy demand. When you can't employ any more people to satisfy demand, you have to increase prices instead. At this point all your infrastructure is exhausted--- you are employing as many people as you can. If your infrastructure is enough to employ everyone, unemployment is zero now.The point is that stimulus reduces unemployment until the point it produces inflation. The "philips curve" is a silly attempt to make the intuition quantitative. It is true in a sense.The point of stagflation is that there just wasn't enough infrastructure to employ everyone, even at maximum stimulation in the mid 70s. To produce new infrastructure, you need investment, but the stimulation was producing inflation, which was reducing investment capital by inflating it away.That means that you need to increase bank capital, and start a government jobs program to absorb the remaining unemployed people. But that was politically impossible. So the thing that was done was to reduce inflation, and allow inequality to increase, so as to allow infrastructure investment to go up, until the unemployment could be absorbed. That's what Reagan's "revolution" was about--- you needed more investment, and Reagan could only see investment coming from wealthy capitalists at the top of large corporations, or from new corporations that would get financed by wall st. investment.You see that stagflation didn't prove "Keynsianism was wrong", it simply proved that philips didn't understand Marx. Most Keynsians are hobbled by the inability to speak about the Marxist foundation of their field, I am not hobbled. The events of the 1970s were simple--- there was no more investment capital due to inflation, and stimulus couldn't fix unemployment because there was not enough infrastructure to employ everybody, and not enough investment capital to make the infrastructure.I didn't read a book to explain this, it is obvious to anyone who read Marx and worked out Keynes for himself.Also, it justifies Reagan to a large extent, because you really did need more investment back then. But right now, you need to move back to equilibrium. It is also not clear that the investment model is the right one. With appropriate banking stimulus, you should be able to increase infrastructure to the point where a regular stimulus will bring you to 100% employment before inflation sets in.</comment>

<comment>lol. Note the nonsensical blather from our murderer-supporting buffoon. all he needs are his feelings to tell you that the great soviet and Venezuelan economies were brought down by pigs and liars. Proof by assertion is the lefty way!such a buffoon. So hilarious to laugh at.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>I don't support the USSR or Venezuela, I just use them as examples for reasoning.**FIZZLE *** POP *** POP *** FIZZLE ***</comment>

<comment>rofl. Oh yes, the soviets and the Venezuelans were not True Communists, comrades--bbbbecause they didn't work!What we need is more collectivism! The No True Scotsman fallacy isn't a fallacy, my fellow proles! (/sarcasm)It's blackly humorous how you little buffoons really will support all murder and totalitarianism in support of your cause.*guffaws*</comment>

<comment>I am not a collectivist or a communist, you fool. I'm a leftist libertarian.</comment>

<comment>lmao. now the little airheaded buffoon is literally trying to claim he is a contradiction:  leftist libertairianAre you a black white man, too?*giggle*</comment>

<comment>I would urge you to read about the history of libertarianism. It was originally an offshoot of Anarchism or anarcho-communism, and the most prominent American supporter is Noam Chomsky.The point is uniform policy to reduce the power of both government and big business at the same time, until both are superfluous, because the structures in place are self-sustaining with broad-based ownership of capital and diffuse political power. I wrote a blueprint for how to move forward on this, which you can find by googling my name + nonbureaucratic socialism.My father is North-African, so I guess I am also a black white man.</comment>

<comment>lol! Now the little commie-sympathizer is quoting CHomsky as an authority on libertarianism.so so  low IQ. so buffoonish. so laughable.*guffaws*</comment>

<comment>Chomsky is the only American authority on Libertarianism as it originally developed.</comment>

<comment>lmao. note how the little airhead tries again his "proof by assertion" tactic.Noam Chomsky is libertarianism! Black is white! War is Peace!truly, you have proven your communist credentials, little buffoon.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>"What you call "malaise" is Carter's austerity program, which was designed to end inflation, and it did. "When? In 1982, when Reagan had to deal with his recession?</comment>

<comment>In the first Volker term, 1978-1982, when the austerity was implemented.</comment>

<comment>"You relive them whenever you stop doing Keynsianism."What happened first - Keynsianism or WW2?</comment>

<comment>WW2 is Keynesianism on steroids, and Keynesianism in the US never was implemented properly until WW2, when the top tax rate jumped to 94%, and government spending eliminated unemployment altogether. In England, and even in fascist Italy and Germany, real Keynsianism eliminated unemployment before the war, and those economies recovered.The main point of Keynesianism (you can't read Keynes, you need to read Marx) is to elminate unemployment. The US programs were never sufficient to eliminate unemployment until the war, when they did so and then some.</comment>

<comment>While I agree, telling someone to read Marx is asking to be ignored. They wouldn't even want to understand such a read.BTW, I am the only person I know that read the entire Communist Manifesto. A terribly difficult pamphlet to read, but that could just be the English translation.</comment>

<comment>I read it when I was a child, it's well written but not so difficult if you're used to 19th century sentences. The better book on these matters is Capital I, which I only read as an adult, unfortunately after largely working out the contents for myself through later writings. That's largely a collection of 19th century wage-labor statistics in England showing that without zero unemployment, industrial wages collapse to subsistence, together with implications of this observation. This is the basis for Marx predicting the collapse of capitalism (essentially the great depression) and Keynes proposing a fix by zeroing unemployment.</comment>

<comment>Maybe it is just me then, but I found Capital fairly easy to read.Both are insightful if they didn't butt up against mankind's built in greedy side.</comment>

<comment>It is an easy read, Marx deliberately wrote it avoiding all philosophical jargon, so that a 19th century worker could self-study using it. He also painfully explains all his mathematics from scratch.But based on what you said, you didn't read it. Capital is about Capitalism, it is precisely about greed. There is no anti-greed prescription in there.</comment>

<comment>I read the Communist Manifesto as part of my European History course in ~1973 and Capital: Critique of Political Economy on my own the next year, after a recommendation by another History Professor. I viewed it in the light my professor suggested and had no issue with it. In a way, I enjoyed the alternative view.The required reading of the Communist Manifesto was dissected as truth by the professor and his devout communist grad student assistant. Gawd I hated that class, but I felt it would have offered some insight instead it was pure propaganda.</comment>

<comment>Marxism was full of propaganda in 1973. I just read Marx, I wasn't a Marxist, so I didn't get so much propaganda. It's not exactly an alternative view, the predictions of Marx for the wage structure in unregulated markets are just true, and are accepted by all the mainstream economists who aren't stupid.</comment>

<comment>lmao. Marx was misunderstood, comrades! We must all reinstitute his legacy, USSR style! Do not listen to the capitalistic pigs lying to you, demanding "proof"! Our assertion is proof enough! (/sarcasm)Oh ronnie, you really are bad at all this.hilariously so.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>WW2 resulted in drastic drop in living standards, although official unemployment also went down (the draft, i.e. slavery made it so). And yes, I read Marx. Of course, slavery eliminates unemployment, but there are other, well, negative effects of it."The US programs were never sufficient to eliminate unemployment until the war, when they did so and then some."At the cost of living standards and personal liberty. Agreed?</comment>

<comment>At the cost of nothing. The same policies continued through the 1950s, and into the 1960s, and living standards skyrocketed.When you do Keynsianism right, it increases personal liberty too, as you do not put money into enormous corporations making bombers and carriers, but into small businesses doing construction or programming, or into workers pockets through an EITC. None of these are anti-freedom, they are correcting a mistake in the market.Marx wasn't proposing slavery, that was Lenin. Marx pointed out that a capitalist economy has a problem with wages dropping and demand not sufficient to purchase all the products. His solution was to let business concentrate into monopolies, as they naturally do, then take the monopolies over by the state. That's not a good idea, but the problem he identified is real.Lenin wasn't exactly proposing slavery either, he just proposed to run an entire country as if it were a single corporation. The idea was to build the monopolies from scratch, instead of taking it over. That is exactly what the USSR did.That's a tremendous mistake, as enormous corporations are not efficient compared to small business, but it is effectively what the US chooses to do in most industries also. The USSR was competitive with the US precisely in those industries where the US is dominated by large firms. It was hopelessly behind in those industries where the US was dominated by small business.</comment>

<comment>Hitler used Keynesianism and started WW2.</comment>

<comment>And Atlee used Keynesianism and defeated him.</comment>

<comment>" If you have too little taxes, the inequality can balloon to catastrophic proportions, and you end up like Argentina."Speaking of Argentina - it's the only country that has the dubious distinction of become the first ex-developed country. It achieved this by massive welfare spending during WW2.</comment>

<comment>No it didn't. It achieved this by avoiding Keynesian spending due to US intervention. The US prevented Keynesian policies in South America since the Monroe doctrine until the recent socialist wave there finally shook off US imposition.</comment>

<comment>With Keynesian Economics you end up like Ireland, Portugal, Greece, etc. DEBT + INFLATION = PROSPERITY? <- I think not!I have a plan to become wealthy, let me know what you think: - I'm going to take out loan after loan, and max out as many credit cards as I can... Think it's a good plan?? C'mon, It's fool proof I'll be rich in no time!</comment>

<comment>Nope. Ireland, Portugal, and Greece don't practice Keynesian Economics because they can't. HINT, Mississippi and Alabama don't practice it either.</comment>

<comment>Countries' spending is not like personal spending, because the government controls the amount of money. If there is no political will to raise taxes, issuing more money is an effective flat tax by inflation. It's better to raise taxes.</comment>

<comment>Yup, Keynesians are just the priesthood for enabling tax and spending politicians who then can't stop there but go on to devalue everyone's money, too.</comment>

<comment>That's the whole point of Keynsianism. To diminish inequality, and restore competitive equilibrium.</comment>

<comment>Are countries with more government handouts more or less competitive?</comment>

<comment>Handouts to who, the rich or the poor?</comment>

<comment>Let's try with the handouts to the "poor".As for handouts to the rich, I keep hearing about them, but I haven't seen anyone showing them in the US budget - federal, state and local.</comment>

<comment>If you don't see the gifts of tax breaks and corporate tax loopholes that politicians gift the rich as payback for funding their campaigns as 'handouts' then there's really nothing more to discuss here. They are handouts every bit as much as your idea of 'handouts' to the poor.</comment>

<comment>So, in your mind every dollar not collected from the "rich" and "corporations" is as much a handout as welfare and medicaid? This is stupid.</comment>

<comment>WTF? Yes, you're quite right about that. The question you just posed is stupid because it made no sense.</comment>

<comment>Did you miss the bailout of Wall St. and stimulus that went directly through banks?</comment>

<comment>both</comment>

<comment>It depends on the form of the government "handouts". If they are competitive contracts, then yes, these countries are more competitive. If they are welfare payments, then it cuts into productivity. Sanders is on the right side of government spending.</comment>

<comment>Welfare, foodstamps, subsidized housing, medicaid, medicare, obamacare are not "competitive contracts". And they all make countries less competitive. Of course, EU has more of this, so few EU countries are more competitive than USA.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is proposing infrastructure jobs, subsidized university, and single payer healthcare. So I guess he has your vote. He is not Lyndon Johnson, he actually wants to reduce unemployment.</comment>

<comment>"Sanders is proposing infrastructure jobs..."Let's cut medicaid and welfare and spend money on infrastructure. Agreed? If not, then you are proposing an increase in taxation on working Americans, and using the money to build often useless and too expensive, union-dominated projects."subsidized university,"Why do we need to subsidize universities? If you are getting a good profession, you can get the money form the bank. If you are getting a bad profession, something no one needs in the free market, then no need to subsidize you. Universities are too expensive now, we need to cut their costs, not inflate the price with more handouts."single payer healthcare."Somewhere else you explained your dislike for large corporations. And yet, you want government monopoly on healthcare. That makes no sense."So I guess he has your vote. "I will vote for politicians who want to cut spending, cut taxes and cut regulations. Barney wants to do exactly the opposite."He is not Lyndon Johnson, he actually wants to reduce unemployment."I don't care what he "wants", I care whether what he proposes will make America a more free and more prosperous country. Everything he offers will make this country worse off. Am I crazy to vote for that?</comment>

<comment>YOU DON'T CUT ANYTHING! You have no understanding of economics. If you reduce all government, large corporations will create their own de-facto government, like your cable company creates its own monopoly and charges whatever it wants for your internet, with whatever laws it can legislate to you through the fine print in its contracts. It's the government's job to guarantee a competitive economy where business is nimble and individuals can innovate.An economy cannot tolerate unemployment. If there is unemployment, you need to absorb it into jobs. Always, without fail. If you can't raise taxes, you need to print the money! There is no excuse for unemployment, you need to make sure that every person who needs a job has a job, period. Whether it's a government job or a private sector job.There can be no unemployment in an economy, it destroys wages for everyone, it is the reason that economies can be depressed. There is also no moral excuse to leave a person's labor unused while they are looking for a better job. There is always something useful a person can do, build a bridge, write code, whatever. If the private sector doesn't have use for people, the government must find a use for them, otherwise the wages of everyone will fall due to competition with the unemployed.There is no unemployment in economic equilibrium, it doesn't exist in the model you use to justify capitalism. When you see it, you must get rid of it. Subsidizing college is a full employment prescription, both because students are out of the labor pool, and because they come out with better qualifications to fill openings.Without full employment, there is nothing else that works. The welfare policies of Europe are actually a gimmick to avoid having the government find jobs for people--- it's just easier to write a check, and it's substantially the same in macro impact. But it kills a person to not be productive, it destroys motivation and makes people useless, and drives them to drugs and suicide. Sanders is proposing the proper policy--- jobs for everyone.That's not a handout, it's absolutely required. The rest of his policies require taxing non-competitive income, and instituting single-payer healthcare so that businesses don't have to deal with it anymore, and costs are finally contained for real, as they are everywhere else in the world.It is impossible to argue with a conservative, you don't understand the fundamental problem of capitalist economies. The fundamental problem is unemployment, as Marx identified, which prevents economic equilibrium from ever being attained. Any full employment policy fixes this, although it is always easier for governments to give handouts than to advocate for jobs, because governments find it easier to hand out money than contract for useful work.</comment>

<comment>Sigh. You write so many slogans, but few actual evidence to support your claims. This is typical for a liberal."You have no understanding of economics. "Sigh. Let's take one claim after another..."If you reduce all government, large corporations will create their own de-facto government..."No one argues to eliminate ALL Government. There are certainly very reasonable claims that the government spends too much, regulates too much and taxes too much. Secondly, the government has a monopoly for violence. It does not ask you to contribute - it takes your money at gun point and sends you to jail if you refuse to comply with its demands. No corporation can do that. Thirdly, back in the FDR times, the government checked the optimal size of the corporation and found out that overwhelmingly, it is far below the size of a full monopoly. The corporation becomes inefficient well before it takes over a sector of the economy. This is not an assertion, this is the result of research by the government economists. Lastly, a corporation becomes a real monopoly in 99% of the case because the government gives it special rights, and privileges."like your cable company creates its own monopoly and charges whatever it wants for your internet"Out of myriad of different businesses, you picked the cable company, the business which is heavily regulated. Why not the computer industry? Why not the car industry? Why not the insurance industry? How many real monopolies can you think of - monopolies which are not protected by the government - like the electric generation?"An economy cannot tolerate unemployment. "This phrase is the best representation of liberal ignorance. It's so anti-science, it's amazing. Economy is not a human being, it can tolerate anything. What you are trying to argue (or should have, if you understand economics) is that when there is unemployment, the economy is not working at full capacity. That's the best you can say. But then again, you need to explain that your efforts to get full employment will actually result in the economy running at full capacity. That you haven't spent any time doing..."If there is unemployment, you need to absorb it into jobs."The whole world had unemployment for as long as the mankind existed - and yet you now pronounce that it's impossible to tolerate and we need to fix it. Can we? At what cost? You won't even consider this."There is always something useful a person can do, build a bridge, write code, whatever. "There are a few strong counter-points.... 1. You are the one who is proposing to increase minimum wages. Well, if your labor creates less wealth than what I am supposed to pay you, then why would I hire you? You yourself make millions of people unemployable.2. Welfare, Medicaid, subsidized housing, foodstamps make it easy for people not to work. This is why there are so many in US who are not even looking for jobs - they have no need for this. Why would you work for $5 an hour, if you can do nothing and get paid just as much? And yet, you do not propose to completely eliminate the handouts, right?3. Not everyone can build a bridge or write code. Simple manual labor is not necessarily needed in the same numbers as the willing to do it. In order to build a bridge, you need to have a need for a new bridge and massive investments to design it and get equipment. Moreover, you will spend years in getting government permits to build it."There can be no unemployment in an economy, it destroys wages for everyone, it is the reason that economies can be depressed. "Again, the argument you are making is amazingly stupid. If there is unemployment among people who cannot read and can only flip burgers and dig ditches - does it mean that the wages of a doctor, and engineer or a mechanic will be destroyed? No, not really."There is no excuse for unemployment, you need to make sure that every person who needs a job has a job, period. "See the points above. If the minimum wage is above what the worker can create, then he won't be hired. If his skills, his character, his abilities and interests are not required on the labor market, he won't be hired."Subsidizing college is a full employment prescription..."You need to explain why taxing working americans and giving money to students will create "full employment". Go ahead."Sanders is proposing the proper policy--- jobs for everyone."Liberals had these slogans for a century. No country with liberals at the helm was able to provide full employment and high living standards. You cannot have a vast government employing tens of millions of people to do in most cases nothing useful, and yet maintain a healthy economy. This is why all left-wing experiments fail."instituting single-payer healthcare so that businesses don't have to deal with it anymore"Businesses don't "have" to deal with it - they choose to, because it's part of tax-efficient benefits for workers. The government monopoly on healthcare is obviously counter-productive... How do I know this? You said this: "It's the government's job to guarantee a competitive economy where business is nimble and individuals can innovate." By allowing the government to monopolize health industry, you surely make it uncompetitive, stifle innovation and make medical insurance one huge behemoth - opposite of nimble. By arguing in support of a sclerotic government behemoth you are essentially arguing against yourself. But this contradiction remains unnoticed by you, right?"It is impossible to argue with a conservative, you don't understand the fundamental problem of capitalist economies. "Sigh. You make a lot of claims, but don't even attempt to prove them. So typical for a liberal, who does not understand economics, and whose own contradictions are transparent to him. You argue for small, nimble, innovative businesses in one passage, and then announce your support for a huge government behemoth, which will monopolize the entire health industry."The fundamental problem is unemployment, as Marx identified, which prevents economic equilibrium from ever being attained. "Sigh. Have you even read Karl Marx? Damn. The main issue with the free market economy according to Marx was revealed in his "theory of surplus value". Without looking anywhere - can you quickly tell what it was? According to Marx, the discovery of this theory was his main contribution to the economic theory. Can you explain what it is, and why Marx was wrong?Last but not least..."There is no unemployment in economic equilibrium, it doesn't exist in the model you use to justify capitalism."There are plenty of models which explain the existence of unemployment. Minimum wages, welfare, stickiness in wages - all explain it very well. But let me finish this letter on a bigger message. Let me ask you - do you comprehend what "capitalism" is? What is the essence of "capitalism? Let me answer - capitalism is the right of people for economic freedom, the right to freely exchange goods and services without compulsion. I don't use any "models" to "justify capitalism" - since capitalism is freedom from coercion, it is the foundation of all other freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion. Now, on the other side, your crazy "full employment" schemes, based on massive taking of people fruits of labor at gun point need a lot of justification, and based on your post you have provided none so far, and it does not seem like you even understand it.</comment>

<comment>There are two different definitions of capitalism, I will distinguish them and use different terms for both:1. Existing capitalism--- this is the legal system that allows individuals and organizations to freely trade ownership of various abstract deeds for land and physical property, which grants the owner power over the use of that land and property, with the goal of using this property to create more property by employing wage labor.2. Theoretical capitalism or "competitive frictionless market equilibrium" --- this is the situation described by Adam Smith, Ricardo, and other economists in the 19th century, which is an entirely theoretical mathematically precise model. This model makes the claim that every service has infinitely many suppliers in tight competition, every purchasing decision is rational, and all prices are then rigidly fixed at the intersection of supply and demand.When I talk about capitalism, I am talking about 2, theoretical market equilibrium. This is something one can understand, as it makes a bunch of extremely precise predictions about the structure of payments and prices, the structure of ownership, and the response to marginal changes in prices when an entity like a government makes changes. The result of a market operating according to "capitalism 2" is perfect Pareto efficiency, completely distributed capital ownership is stocks, and nearly equal salaries, which differ only in relation to individual worker productivity. This is why Adam Smith advocated capitalism--- he was thinking about the point of perfect equilibrium.When YOU talk about capitalism, you are talking about 1--- a system of free exchange of deeds of property. The result of this system is not the equilbrium of 2, but the concentration of property deeds in a few hands, through buyouts and consolidation.Since existing capitalism (1) is different from theoretical capitalism (2), that means there are some predictions of market equilibrium theory which are not obeyed. What part of the theory fails most obviously?The answer is that when the deeds concentrate, the owner can raise prices and siphon off profit, due to power. Once that happens, the economy is not operating at pareto efficiency, because the worker is slightly underpaying the employees. Then the employees can't quite buy the full production, which means some employees become unemployed (again, this never happens in 2). The unemployed workers compete with the employed, and drive down wages to the lowest possible value consistent with staying alive. Then the economy really crashes, and even the owner isn't making a profit anymore, because nobody can buy anything.This is the situation described in Marx. It is a failure of existing markets (1) to reach the equilibrium point (2).Of course I read Marx, although not all of it. I read The Manifesto, Capital I, and various online and collected essays. I didn't need to read most of it, as I worked out the mathematical models myself, after taking a course in microeconomics in high school, and working out the math in a few hours (it's easy compared to real math or physics or anything).The main point of Marx is that the existence of abstract ownership of capital separates people into two classes--- those who compete for jobs, and those who own capital and do not work. Those who own capital do not pay the wages equal to the productivity, because of the fact that there is unemployment. This means that they accumulate profit beyond the amount required to replace their capital and pay interest and dividends, and this profit is lost by the workers. This means the workers are making less money than they would in capitalist equilibrium.The problem with your point of view is that you take existing markets described by (1) and treat them theoretically as if they were theoretical markets described by (2). This means you make completely wrong predictions.For example, you claim that a person flipping burgers doesn't produce enough  to justify a $15/hour wage. How would you know? Do you know what the price of a burger should be in competitive equilibrium? How would you know what that price would be? You only know the real price in real markets, where there is a corporation or owner taking profits on the burger store.If you imagine a situation of zero unemployment, where the worker has the option of doing other things, like working in construction, or whatever, but with no chance of becoming destitute, this worker can demand a competitive wage, rather than being forced to take a minimum wage. Under these conditions, hamburger flipping is rather boring, rather tedious, and nobody wants to do it. So in a competitive equilibrium it would probably require a salary relatively high compared to say, being CEO of GM, which is a high prestige position which involves using your brain. Heck, I know a lot of qualified people who would PAY to be CEO of GM for a year or two, rather than take pay.The equilibrium wage of a worker is the wage at zero unemployment, and at this point 2, competitive equilibrium, indeed, the wage they draw is equal to their productivity. But when you look at real markets, point 1, you are not at zero unemployment, and the distortion impacts workers who compete with unemployed most directly hardest. This means that their pay has no relation to their productivity. Their productivity could rise by a factor of 2, and their wages would stay exactly the same, only corporate profits would double, and the concentration of deeds in the hands of a few people would get worse, as they now have even more capital to buy deeds with.The economy of the US today is operating at point 1, and the ideal is to operate at point 2. The way to make markets like 1 look like the equilibrium in 2 is to get rid of unemployment. Then workers can demand as high a wage as is equal to their productivity, and profits plummet to nothing, and people become equal through market mechanisms of competition. That's what Adam Smith was arguing for, and it's also what Karl Marx was arguing for.Marx made no mistakes in his analysis. His remedy however, was not to remove unemployment, but to take over industry by the state. This remedy is disasterous, and must not be used.Despite the disaster, the Soviet Union operated at 0% unemployment from approximately 1934, when the last unemployment office closed during the first five year plan, to 1991, when it collapsed. The labor policy in the Soviet union was actually close to point 2, it was just that the bureaucratic nightmare of regulating an economy from the top down led to the worst possible inefficencies you can imagine.I am not a Soviet style socialist, I believe in distributed ownership. There are ways to encourage the economy described by 1 to turn into the equilibrium described by 2 using gentle nudges, employee ownership, and public stock, and progressive taxation and minimum wage laws. Without these nudges, you will fall away from equilibrium permanently.All Keynsian policy is based on this analysis, which you really can only find in Marx.</comment>

<comment>Facts are that the USSR had a better wage system than other economies, due to the zero unemployment. That's the only good thing about the system, and it explains its stability. Other than that, it was awful.</comment>

<comment>lol. now the little buffoon is saying the soviets---who murdered far more than the venezuelans, and oppressed far more for far longer----were the best of all possible worlds.it's cute how much he still believes that, if he just lies enough, it will all come true.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>There's no 'devaluing everyone's money' dude. You're peddling a myth. BTW, check out the inflation rate. It's effectively at zero.</comment>

<comment>You have not bought groceries in the past five years. and printing 4.5 TRILLION dollars will cause inflation.(quantive easing)</comment>

<comment>Again, check out the rate of inflation. Also check the inflation rate over the last five years. Any questions?</comment>

<comment>Any of the inflation numbers have the same fakery the unemployment numbers from the administration have.</comment>

<comment>Fakery eh? Gotta love the conspiracists who claim the BLS is faking the CPI when all you need to do is check the independent price indexes like MIT's billion prices project or even the now defunct Google Price Index, but active between 2010-2015 could have told you much the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Over 95 million people not even looking for a job and the labor participation rate dropping every month since Jan 2009 and the people applying for first time unemployment greater by 150,000 to 500,000 every month since Jan 2009.  how does the employment rate go down when so many are loosing their jobs???   As for inflation do I believe the CPI or my own lying eyes and wallet???</comment>

<comment>How'd this turn into a pivot into employment numbers? I was talking about the rate of inflation and your insinuation of a grand conspiracy between three autonomous price indexes the CPI, BPP, and GPI to fake their numbers. How would that work? The CPI is obviously broad measure of prices across many categories so a higher than expected spike in some goods and services is not going to be reflected in total rate of inflation if balanced out by lower than expected prices elsewhere. You could just cross check what products you think you're seeing spikes in prices with the appropriate CPI category and see how reflective it is, because you're obviously working from a very limited sample size and built in confirmation bias. You might even find it reflective. But that would require you to be data driven and not conspiracy driven.</comment>

<comment>Inflation only starts when people have enough money to stress production. This is Keynes 101.</comment>

<comment>That's bullshit.  Keynesian economics works and very well. It had nothing whatsoever to do with providing the New Dealers justification for anything other than putting the economy on track for the whole of society and not just a few at the top.</comment>

<comment>According to all the Fox commentators. Must be true.</comment>

<comment>Is this still true?There are a lot of people who choose to support candidates or parties for non-pecuniary reasons.  Wasn't this the entire discussion point in 'What's a matter with Kansas?"</comment>

<comment>Government has created many of the problems in our current economy. Free people, freely contracting among themselves is the essence of a healthy economy. Burdensome regulations, a crony-derived tax code and other government meddling is what is hurting our economy.This is reflected in a decrease in startup companies and retrenchment of many existing companies that are not optimistic about investing for the future.Then there is a federal reserve playing with the money supply.Government is the problem.</comment>

<comment>Yeah ok, continue to think that. But Walmart decimated small business by "free people" contracting to supply them at reduced costs, because they were so big, they could leverage their size to bully them into non-competitive pricing. That didn't come from the government. Chain stores do the same, and are decimating small business. None of that comes from government. The mean wage they pay is a starvation wage that no small-business owner can impose on himself or herself. That's "free people".The problem is not the government, it is concentrations of power that allow large corporations to pay their employees too little and drive small competitors out of business. To get rid of these practices you need pro-competition policy, including breaking up monopolies, instituting pro-competition regulation (or "deregulation", however you like to call it), like in the AT&T breakup and telecom deregulation/regulation or the airline deregulation, both done by Carter/Clinton.The only person who calls for something remotely close to this is Sanders. He is the only one who has a proven record in protecting small business and small farmers from big business predation. You must vote for him, as it is a vote not for big government, but for small business.</comment>

<comment>Sure it came from the government. Who do you think gives tax breaks and zoning breaks and new roads and the like to draw Wal-Mart to communities as "economic stimulus"?</comment>

<comment>I would prefer a president who would force them to pay a living wage, and supported small business until they broke that monstrosity up into smithereens. That's Sanders.</comment>

<comment>I prefer a president who doesn't force citizens to do much of anything, Ron.  But then, I'm an American.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't require force to get citizens to do what is in their best interest. I'm an American, and I don't believe in either government or corporate coercion.</comment>

<comment>"Force" was your word, Ron. Why back off now, after praising the work of Adolf Hitler?</comment>

<comment>All government policy is enforced by courts and coercion. Your smear tactics don't work online, where I can respond, they only work on TV, where I can't. My relatives were killed by Hitler, my grandfather was enslaved. I didn't praise Hitler, I praised Keynesian economics.</comment>

<comment>You said you wanted the president to force folks to pay higher wages, and such. Why back off that now?You praised Hitler. Clear as day.</comment>

<comment>I'm not backing off. I want the president to enforce a $15 minimum wage.</comment>

<comment>I prefer presidents who avoid forcing citizens to do stuff, as I stated before.</comment>

<comment>Define "living wage".</comment>

<comment>Living wage = "the maximum minimum wage you can set before inflation starts". That's also the minimum wage level which minimizes unemployment. It would probably be around $25 an hour considering the productivity gap between workers today and 1979.Sanders calls it $15, which is a political judgement, based on the current minimum wage, and what can be realistically passed.</comment>

<comment>So, there is nothing "living" there. Okay.BTW, inflation is a purely monetary effect. You will see the growth of prices to accommodate higher minimum wage, so the "minimum wage which minimizes unemployment" is zero.</comment>

<comment>What YOU call "inflation" is purely monetary, and meaningless. What EVERYONE ELSE calls inflation is the change in the price of a basket of goods which set the CPI. That's what I mean when I say inflation.The minimum wage which minimizes unemployment is not zero, and this ridiculous prediction you just made is shown to be false every time minimum wage goes up and unemployment simultaneously goes down. It's a counterintuitive effect, due to the stimulus effect of extra spending.The limit at which rising minimum wage produces CPI changes (inflation) is when production is stressed. That happens when everything is working at peak capacity, and that's when everyone is working and unemployment is zero. It is zero, that is, if there is enough infrastructure to employ everyone. If not, you need more investment in new industry, and until that time, you need a jobs program to get unemployment to zero.</comment>

<comment>"What YOU call "inflation" is purely monetary, and meaningless. What EVERYONE ELSE calls inflation is the change in the price of a basket of goods which set the CPI. That's what I mean when I say inflation."I was quoting Milton Friedman, a Nobel prize winner in economics, one of the founders of famous Chicago School of Economics. Please, be careful next time."this ridiculous prediction you just made is shown to be false every time minimum wage goes up and unemployment simultaneously goes down. It's a counterintuitive effect, due to the stimulus effect of extra spending."There are a few fundamental laws of economics that few people debate. One of them is the law of supply and demand. If you make labor more expensive, there will be less of it. Multiple economic works showed that raising minimum wage increases unemployment. There is a debate on how strong this dependence is, but it's settled that unemployment goes up. And no, there is no "extra spending" - since the money did not miraculously appeared in the hands of the people. By raising minimum wage, you made it more difficult and expensive to create wealth, which in turn means less wealth will be created.Just as what you discussed before - you want "full employment", and yet don't comprehend that few businesses would hire a worker, if they are supposed to pay for his labor (with taxes and risks) more than what his labor is worth to them. This is why uneducated folks have a hard time finding jobs - it's uneconomical to hire them at today's government prescribed wages.This is economics 101 btw. Please, take a macro-economics class for undergrads, if you don't mind.</comment>

<comment>You think I don't know whose absurd definition you were quoting? Milton Friedman is an idiot. All his quantitative predictions have failed, and he is a laughingstock in quantitative economics as far as I am concerned. The fact that he has a Nobel prize is an indictment of the economics "Nobel" (which is not really a Nobel). By his definition, we had 300% inflation in 2009, even though prices rose only a few percent. Aristotle style quantitative failures like that is why people don't take your side seriously anymore.The "law of supply and demand" fails spectacularly in the case of minimum wage and unemployment. That's one of the greatest COUNTERINTUITIVE quantitative prediction of Keynesian economics, which no Chicago-school person can make, and which is routinely verified whenever minimum wage goes up.The reason it works, the reason you can increase the price of labor and yet get higher demand for labor, is because the economy is operating at nowhere near economic equilibrium. When you raise minimum wage (slowly), you increase consumption by more than you increase the price of labor, until you reach the point of maximum employment, at which point you just produce inflation.This is counterintuitive, I admit it, but it was predicted by Keynesians, and the counterintuitive prediction was verified in every single one of the many dozens of minimum wage hikes in diverse economies around the world. This is the reason minimum wage was instituted, and the reason Australia has both a higher minimum wage ($15/hour) and a higher median income, and lower real unemployment than the US, despite the lower productivity per worker in Australia.This is the great triumph of Keynesianism, making correct counterintuitive quantitative predictions. That's how we know the theory is sound.This fact is ignored by Milton Friedman, which is why I ignore Milton Friedman, and so should you.</comment>

<comment>rofl. just rofl.</comment>

<comment>lol. Note, comrades, how anyone's definitions that contradict with our little airehead lefty's are "meaningless." Only he must say what words mean!It's cute how Mr. Soros has programmed you so poorly.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Gee wiz, exactly how does a president force Walmart to pay higher wages? If that is your goal, then bills have to be passed in legislatures and in Congress that Sanders would be utterly incapable of accomplishing.</comment>

<comment>The president can mobilize a boycott of Walmart, he can lead Federal recommendations to state commissions to recognize the value in zoning out Walmart until their wage policies are sensible, he can point out the politicians who are on the take from WalMart, and ask the public to get rid of them. He can do a lot by himself. But best of all is to come to Congress with a request for a sensible rise in minimum wage over a few years, and for Congress to pass it. If they resist such a popular measure, the leaders of the opposition need to be voted out.</comment>

<comment>That is the key- controlling Congress and having term limits.  It all starts with citizens being in charge of drawing voting districts, not politicians.</comment>

<comment>"Sure it came from the government.  Who do you think gives tax breaks and zoning breaks and new roads and the like to draw Wal-Mart to communities as "economic stimulus"?"That's an easy one:  They're given by corporatist politicians who sell those measures  to the public as "deregulation" and "low taxes" and "free market economics," which they know plays very well among the political right.And what compels "government" to do that?  Being lobbied, bribed, and having their campaigns bankrolled by mega wealthy special interests who stand to benefit from those policies.Seriously...how many times do people need to watch this happen again and again, republican and democrat alike, to finally get it?  If nothing else, maybe a Sanders presidency would get him enough airtime and SOTU speeches to rephrase this carefully and perhaps draw a couple nice pictures for the electorate to get it through their heads for a while.</comment>

<comment>Yes, government is corrupt. Always has been and always will be. Smaller government is best. That's not Sanders' belief.</comment>

<comment>Government can only be small when corporate power is reduced, otherwise a call for smaller government is a call for larger corporations.</comment>

<comment>Not at all, Ron. Big government grows big corporations. Just like at Obama and the big banks. Or at your buddy Hitler and his defense contractors.</comment>

<comment>Hitler murdered nearly my mother's entire family, nitwit. While it is true that government and big business collude, the source of big business is not government, but consolidation. To avoid consolidation, you need a government that enforces anti-trust law, and breaks up big businesses. That's not Obama, it's Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Big government picks winners and losers, and the winners are always the big boys.</comment>

<comment>That's why you need to elect Sanders to head your government. He wants to break up the big boys, not give them contracts.</comment>

<comment>rofl. Oh yes, Bernie Sanders is the truth to power. A career politician owned by George Soros.It's cute how backwards your wordview is.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>As he grows the government, the big boys will just get bigger. It's inevitable.</comment>

<comment>Your simplistic formula is only true when government and business collude, as in the military industrial complex. It totally misses that he isn't "growing the government" in any way that involves contracts with large business, or coordination with business interests.He is taking over health care, which gets rid of several big players, and makes small players more competitive (due to health care being portable), and he is providing family leave by taxes. He is also breaking up big banks, and enforcing anti-trust law, and instituting progressive taxation. These policies don't involve subsidies to large corporations, and they don't involve corruption or collusion. They are simply nudging the economy toward economic equilibrium.His policies are libertarian, in the leftist European sense. They can be supported by a person who wishes to see the reduction of concentrations of power. This is why he is my ideal candidate--- he understands concentrations of power, and he knows how to usethe existing degree of government power to get rid of private concentrations of power most effectively.He is not just a libertarian on social issues. He is a libertarian on economic issues as well. It's just that the American idea of libertarianism has been corrupted to mean "let big business consolidate arbitrarily, and collude with government without limit", which is not at all what it's supposed to mean, or what it meant originally.</comment>

<comment>Any time one grows a government it includes contracts with big businesses, Ron. The government can't do much without them--build roads or buildings, wage war, etc. etc.In the case of healthcare, the "small players" I know of who had their own practices are all getting swallowed up by hospitals these days.His policies and goals are communist, by USSR standards.  Punish the rich, grow the government, make everyone poor except a few cronies who get even richer and richer.No thanks!</comment>

<comment>You don't understand national health care. It doesn't contract with business, it pays the bills directly. That's 95% of his "grow the government" proposal. His miltary budget would probably redirect money from the traditional big contractors like Haliburton and Lockheed Martin, toward universities and research centers. He is not a big fan of these enormous corporations, that's the whole point of his campaign.The contracts for road building, and bridges, are contracts with relatively small business, unless a big bidder forces their way in by corruption, and they are done by bid. I can assume that Sanders would show preference to worker cooperatives, because he proposes to create more of those. Construction is not at all a big-player game.To help small players in medicine, national health means that they don't have to worry about which insurance company will provide reimbursements, or haggling with a thousand different negotiators from each company. National plans have standardized fees, so they would only haggle on the supplementals. Also, hospitals are much better at gouging medicare and private insurance, as they don't have a personal connection, and love to over-test and over-treat. National health care eats at hospitals more than private practice. I assure you that national care is good to private practice, because the phenomenon you see of private practices disappearing is unique to the US.His policies and goals are libertarian and socialist, and he would have been shot in the USSR, as all the libertarians were executed early. You don't know anything about the USSR, or about the type of Democratic socialist that helps small business. Small business in Europe is protected from predatory behavior, unlike the US. That's part of what government is for.</comment>

<comment>lol. buffoon boy the animal torturing liar is back!note all of his proofs are merely by assertion. that's because the only place he can find his reality validated is in his own wee wittle mind.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>Sure it contracts with business, numbnuts. How do you think billing works? Why do you think many small practices are no longer accepting medicare or medicaid, and others are being bought out by hospitals? Maybe just maybe they don't have the volume that makes the government's 50-cents on the dollar reimbursements possible for them to take on. Only the big boys can do that.Good example.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't have preferential contracts with one business or another, it pays all businesses the same amount. There are very few practices that don't accept medicare, but some don't accept medicaid only because of class consciousness--- they don't want poor people sitting next to their clientelle. The 50 cents on the dollar reimbursement needs to be universal, and I guarantee you that small practitioners thrive in public health systems, as I was treated outside the US.</comment>

<comment>ronny...oh ronny....where are you......oh, there you are. just sniffing Mr. Soros's fingers.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>No, it has contracts that are by nature preferential to the big boys. That's what I've been claiming all along.Lots of practices don't take medicare. Lots don't take medicaid. It's because of the billing, numbnuts.</comment>

<comment>lol. you're losing, little airhead.but please tell us all about how you discovered a new law of physics and how the Soviets and Venezuelans were wildly misunderstood paradises. We're all ears.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>There is no such thing as "big government" vs "small government."  This is just a political slogan designed to oversimplify public policy analysis and to keep conservatives wedded to the knee-jerk reaction that any regulation is a further encroachment on economic freedom (it isn't necessarily, it depends specifically on what is being done on behalf of whom).There is only what government is doing and who benefits.  This requires the electorate to actually pay attention to exactly what each law does and do some actual policy analysis with consideration for historical precedent and an understanding of economics, and not think like useful idiots who automatically chant "REGULATION BAD" whenever their corporate overlords ring a bell.</comment>

<comment>Sure there is. You can't see it because you're a creature of government and think all of existence is government. Sad to see here in America.</comment>

<comment>lol "A creature of government?"Yeah, no.  Never taken welfare in my life nor taken a government job.  I'm just someone who has lived and worked in the real world, gone to school, actually studied US history, political science, and economics and I understand how these things actually work.</comment>

<comment>You don't have to take welfare to be a creature of government, or take a government job. Millions of progs haven't done either, yet they believe every breath they take is taken at the mercy of big government.Sad to see, here in America.</comment>

<comment>lol You have so much to talk about and yet nothing to say.Well, it's been interesting watching you try. </comment>

<comment>Good one, JG.</comment>

<comment>Right and corporations aren't corrupt?  Do you think the company you work for cares about you?  Without government, companies would pollute the environment until it was destroyed because it is more expensive to use pollution control.  When was the last time the majority of middle class Americans got more than a cost of living increase while CEO's pay continues to climb, even while the companies sales decline and they lay off employees.  Or do you call that right sizing?  Gag.</comment>

<comment>Corporations have no power over me unless government gives them that power.  I don't work for one, either.Corporations that overpay their administrations even while in decline in the marketplace are sure to fail. The same cannot be said of government entities.The current VA scandal is a good example.</comment>

<comment>Okay so Pfizer buys Wyeth, 40% of their people lose their jobs.  These are highly educated people that have helped developed life saving drugs and other necessary positions that keep the process flowing.  Meanwhile the CEO of Wyeth gets a $60 million bonus.  Many talented and educated people work for Corporations.  Pfizer isn't failing, it is the largest Pharma Company in the world.  These companies layoff their employees when they reach their 50s because they can hire someone in their 20s or 30s for much less.  And then the 50 somethings can't find a job at the same pay scale while they have kids in college.  Sounds fair to me.</comment>

<comment>Who claimed Pfizer is failing?It's terrible when corporations lay off long time employees to save money. Maybe employees need to take that into account when they accept the jobs, and maybe they need to insure that when they're in their 50s they can provide expertise to the company that a recent college graduate cannot.In any case, it's no business of the government's.</comment>

<comment>Show me what law of economics requires that human labor be a component of the value added process.Good luck with that. Because you can't.  To believe so despite that is to be a willing participant in the Labor Content Fallacy.You'll finally learn this when the robots take over 80% of all human labor jobs by 2025 or so.Oh, and Sander's proposed tax policies would absolutely kill small businesses, btw.  This is a proven fact.</comment>

<comment>The stuff produced by robots will be cheap, and if the ownership is distributed widely in public stock, the corporate profits will be shared.</comment>

<comment>"The problem is not the government, it is concentrations of power that allow large corporations to pay their employees too little and drive small competitors out of business."Are people who work for WalMart more productive and yet are paid less than folks who work for mom and pop stores?</comment>

<comment>They are "more productive", only in the sense that they are paid so little that the corporation can suck out more profit. Mon and pop stores are more efficient in every real measure except centralized profits, because they don't need WalMart's bureaucratic overhead, and they are more responsive.To get rid of WalMart's advantage, you need fair pricing laws, so that WalMart can't get special deals. You need to enforce anti-dumping laws, so that they can't operate at a loss to drive competitors out of business. You need zoning reform at the local level to prevent them getting subsidized land deals, and you need a high minimum wage, to cut into their margin. With these reforms, they would quickly go out of business, as they are terribly inefficient compared to small stores.The WalMart model is the failed Soviet model of nation-state level monopolies. It's amazing to me that the most anti-communist folks immitate the failures of the USSR most closely.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you should move to that libertarian paradise, Somalia, to see what a country with minimal government looks like. You are advocating for a piracy-based economic system, right?</comment>

<comment>I notice you progs always have to put words in your opponents' mouths to argue effectively.Do you ever wonder why that is? I don't.</comment>

<comment>you're just not curious, eh?</comment>

<comment>It's pretty transparent.</comment>

<comment>care to share your Olympian wisdom with the hoi polloi? to date you've been opaque.</comment>

<comment>Progs are stupid and progs are liars. It's really their only avenue.</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a true boot-licker of the billionaires.</comment>

<comment>I don't know any billionaires, bill. But of course demonizing fellow citizens is pretty much par for the course for progs, too.</comment>

<comment>You don't have to personally know a billionaire in order to drink their Kool-Aid.</comment>

<comment>You have to be a creepy prog to not even see when you're demonizing fellow citizens, bill. You'd have made a good Stasi neighborhood agent, I'd guess.</comment>

<comment>"Demonize fellow citizens", you mean like you calling them stupid and liars? Maybe I am supposed to feel pity for you for drinking the Kool-Aid.</comment>

<comment>Know, like doing the knee jerk "evil billionaires" dance for your Overlords. I see I was right about you not even realizing it.Creepy.</comment>

<comment>I see you just can't help yourself, so just sit back and have another big drink of that Kool-Aid.</comment>

<comment>Your ignorance overflows for all to see. Libertarians believe in a lawful society. Somalia is an anarchy, it is no where near a libertarian society.</comment>

<comment>The flaw in libertarian economic thinking is that their tendency toward religious belief in a "free market" and deregulation as an axiomatic good naturally leads to the mega wealthy buying government off and skewing the playing field, until we end up with what we have now- an oligarchy of entrenched political and industrial elite steadily enriching themselves and the complete sidelining of the interests of working and middle class Americans in the meanwhile.</comment>

<comment>Government has created many of the problems in our current economy.True. That is why we do NOT need more Republicans in Congress or the White House. They have a habit of screwing up the economy.Burdensome regulations, a crony-derived tax code and other government meddling is what is hurting our economy.So what regulations would you do away with? The ones prohibiting coal plants from fouling the air that I breathe? The regulations that limit how heavy a truck can be that tears up the roads? Those regulations that insist that what you say is in the bottle is actually in the bottle? How about the regulation that stopped Shkreli selling a 1$ pill for $700 each? C'mon, you can tell us, WHAT BURDENSOME REGULATIONS ???Government meddling? You mean something along the lines of refusing to pay Planned Parenthood for services? Or government deciding how many H1B visa's to issue?Then there is a federal reserve playing with the money supply.They are doing the job they were tasked with; managing our money supply. We have seen that when they don't manage the money supple, in 1928 and again in 2008, the economy collapses.Government is the problem.The problem is those who claim government is the problem and then once elected, proceed to try and prove it.</comment>

<comment>Social security and Medicare are on the verge of collapse. Barney-Frank has been shown to thwart start ups. LBJs great society has thrown trillions of dollars at reducing poverty over the past 50 years and the rate has not changed. We have a corporate tax rate that forces corporation overseas and makes us less competitive in international markets. There is much more, this is a start.How much of the resources of future generations do we throw away before folks wake up and say, hey, let's do some different? Perhaps we should be critical and see what is working and change what is not.</comment>

<comment>What is not working is Republicans ignoring the basic laws of economics.</comment>

<comment>Both parties have been derelict. Both parties share the blame. The fact that social security and Medicare are failing has been reported by the non-partisan OMB.Perhaps you should ask you mother to let you get out more?</comment>

<comment>Both parties have been derelict,it's true, but only the Republicans have turned dereliction of duty into a platform.</comment>

<comment>Social security and Medicare are on the verge of collapse. Nope. Great line but it isn't true.Barney-Frank has been shown to thwart start ups.It has? 90% of start-ups fail within the first two years. Another five % will have failed with in the next three years.I can understand how you think it is OK to lose others people's money, but it really isn't as smart idea overall. Most Baggers have no problem with others paying as long as they don't have to. LBJs great society has thrown trillions of dollars at reducing poverty over the past 50 years and the rate has not changed.The rate hasn't changed? The rate hasn't changed much BECAUSE it still measures those able to afford certain standards. But, after adding the assistance of Federal and State programs, a great number of those rise above the poverty rate. Second, the number of totally destitute people has fallen to marginal numbers. The BS spread by the right wing has been thoroughly refuted by several other studies by real economists.see https://www.washingtonpost.com...http://www.npr.org/2014/01/08/...http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/ar...</comment>

<comment>The number of totally destitute people is not negligible, you just shut your eyes to the homeless. I meet at least 5 every day walking around NYC. The only effective anti-poverty program is to ensure that every person can always get a job, through the government if none are available.</comment>

<comment>How did we get on THIS subject? Keynes vs the Laffer Curve? Is there ANY idea more discredited than the awful "government is the problem" meme?But your comment perhaps suggests to others that the Socialist Sanders and the Democratic Party going back many years have more in common than Sanders suggests.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you would care to provide an example (time or place) where a nation with less government than we currently have has resulted in a better economy than we have.</comment>

<comment>Yet the supposed Keynesian's in the Democrats mostly follow Paul Krugman's lead and have never actually READ KEYNES! Yes Keynes was a huge proponent of using Government Money to prime the pump and help grow the nation out of economic downturn. But there is a caveat that always gets ignored by the supposed Keynesians. Keynes LOATHED deficit spending. Keyne's Prime the Pump principle relied and spending SURPLUS! Keynes thought deficit spending, taking on new debt in order to spend out of economic downturn was the path to suicide. Deficit spending to "grow the economy" is 100% Krugman and has no business with Keynes. And Krugman is by and large a well proven idiot.</comment>

<comment>Keynes doesn't have anything original to say, he is cribbing Marx, and getting details wrong. His proposals are watered down nonsense, and there is no point in reading Keynes, all a Marx reader has to do is say "Ok, lets say we wanted to fix Marx's problem under Capitalism. What do we do?" The answer is to equalize incomes by paying people to drive unemployment to zero. Everyone can see that.Keynes couldn't mention Marx, or else he would have been an academic pariah. So he made up a bunch of stupid nonsense to get the basic idea across without mentioning the income segregation and competition with the unemployed. His proposals are basically more or less sound, to the extent that they agree with what a random person would say would reduce unemployment.Deficit spending to grow the economy is a process of redistribution, as the inflation takes money away from people who get paid too much, and the jobs program distributes it to unemployed, who got paid nothing before. There is no point to reading Keynes, he had nothing original to say beyond getting what Marx said discussed in non-Marxist economic journals, in obfuscatory language.</comment>

<comment>We've tried that, Ron. It failed. Our government is too corrupt for it to work at this time.By the by, the 1930s was known as the Great Depression. It ended in a World War. Most rational folks might conclude that it didn't work then, either.</comment>

<comment>It is still done by every industrialized economy, it is the foundation of economic thought. It is only denied by the Republican party since 1980, which is why they are not competent to govern.</comment>

<comment>No, it's not the foundation of economic thought.It didn't work in the 1930s, it didn't work in the 1970s, and it doesn't work now.</comment>

<comment>As I said, it is denied by Republicans since 1980, which is why they must never be elected to any office in this country.</comment>

<comment>Good one, Ron.Tell me about the glories of Hitler's economy again, please.</comment>

<comment>Hitler had the best capitalist economy in the 1930s, which is why Germany was able to destroy so much of the world in the war. Nobody disputes that, it's not praise of Hitler. It's praise of Keynesianism. I am obviously not a Hitler supporter, but he was just a Keynesian, and Hitler's economic policies, road construction and military spending, were adopted more or less as is, by Eisenhower.It's not because Hitler was such a genius. He was just doing what Chamberlain and Roosevelt was doing, except in a dictatorship, where he didn't need to get all the legislators on board.</comment>

<comment>Sure folks dispute that, Ron. Gearing up for war under the direction of the government isn't a good capitalist economy in any sense.It's praise of Hitler, and you're not the first prog I've seen doing so this week. Creepy people.</comment>

<comment>Hilter enslaved my grandfather, nitwit, and killed most of his family and associates.I agree that gearing up for war is not good. It does employ everyone, but there are much better ways to do that. The US uses Hitler's method, and the better way is to do other things, as the war machine wants to be used. That's the lesson Eisenhower learned.</comment>

<comment>And here you're praising him 75 years later. They must be rolling over in their graves.</comment>

<comment>Hitler's Keynesian policies gave him the power to destroy much of the world and commit horrific crimes. Keynesian policies rescue economies and give people great power, for good or ill. I will never praise Hitler, and I wish the US would not follow his "roads and arms" path to Keynesianism, but it does. This is just a fact.</comment>

<comment>No, Keynesian policies give big government and their crony corporatists all the power, Ron. Just look at Obama and the banks and Wall Street.</comment>

<comment>No, it can't. Because of all the wealth that is destroyed in the process of confiscating that money for said spending has to be subtracted from your '100% capacity'.You Keynesians NEVER look at the other side of the ledger.  Hence why you also think that breaking windows is 'good' for the economy, too.</comment>

<comment>You don't understand how Keynsian spending works. It is taking money away from where it is concentrating, and putting it in the pockets of workers who are being ripped off. I wrote about this here in a debate with a similarly educationally deprived fellow like you: https://disqus.com/home/channe...</comment>

<comment>WW2 ended the Great Depression in the US - although it hardly improved the living standards. Problem is - people who demand more government spending to improve the economy don't comprehend the simple principle of the broken window.... The money to spend has to come from somewhere. There is no Santa Claus.</comment>

<comment>The Great depression only ended after the death of FDR and the policies that were implemented during that time.</comment>

<comment>"government spending can solve the problem of an economy not working at 100% capacity"....SERIOUSLY???  And, the republican party is HARDLY in demise.  They've won the past two mid terms quite handily.  Might want to look into some history about the role of government.  Your "common core" education is showing.</comment>

<comment>My (self) education came in the 80s, and it came from thinking, not from others.</comment>

<comment>Close enough......nuff said.</comment>

<comment>BS hasn't stopped yapping in his campaign that our Government is corrupt and in the pockets of big business. But, his solution to that problem is to triple the size of that corrupt Government. Does it make sense? Clearly not. I'm starting to wonder whether BS is becoming senile.</comment>

<comment>He isn't expanding government except to the extent that it involves reforming health care. He is using government power to reduce the power of big business. That's the other half of libertarianism you guys on that side forget about.</comment>

<comment>Ron, on this we agree. But how do you get STATES to spend money on infrastructure that will make good jobs and enhance the country? I live in Michigan. Bad infrastructure policies are not just bad economics; they make people sick. Flint is the tip of the iceberg here.</comment>

<comment>States don't refuse Federal infrastructure funding as a rule, but to make sure the infrastructure is sound, you absolutely need to vote out all the Republicans in your state. There is no other solution. A second party will emerge after that, as always, probably to the libertarian-anarchist side of the Democrats. I don't understand why that didn't happen in 2004, but it needed to happen, like yesterday. It's not just Flint, I agree.</comment>

<comment>In Michigan, alas, they do. MDEQ is corrupt and likes gimmicks. Ann Arbor, where I live, is no different. I am in court with the City of Ann Arbor (now representing a class of over 3000 residents) whose houses are damaged (some severely) because 15 years ago the City decided to forego infrastructure upgrades. Instead of making the sewers bigger, the City (in effect, as far as storm water is concerned) tried to make the houses smaller. The City's brilliant idea also opened the houses to increases in radon infiltration.They don't attack the problem. They attack me, the pro bono lawyer working in the public interest. Ann Arbor, the iconic progressive town, has politics that make Cook County look clean.We're getting rid of Snyder, count on that. It took lead poisoning on a massive scale to get the pipes fixed.</comment>

<comment>Yeah ask those farmers and their subsidies!And the Pentagon alone is the worlds largest employer</comment>

<comment>Government spending will help with many problems. A great example was Obama's "Cash for Clunkers". That got the moribund auto industry moving which helped to invigorate the rest of the economy.</comment>

<comment>ASSUMING that the spending is reasonable spending, then obviously we need to have money to pay for it.  But nobody thinks it is.  All seem to agree that we have enormous waste, fraud, and abuse.  People campaign on getting rid of it, but nobody wants to.</comment>

<comment>"tax and spend" is NOT the role of government.  Please.  While taxation is necessary, it is SUPPOSED to be done with "representation"....something this nation hasn't seen for centuries.  This government is totally out of control.  Time to get back to the Constitution while we still have a nation left.....if we do, which I doubt we will till this maniac is out of office.</comment>

<comment>And Bernie Sanders would help the situation how?</comment>

<comment>Don't rely on us to type a page to list the ways bernie would help us. READ FACTS NOT OPINIONS. RESEARCH. THINK INDEPENDENTLY.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is proposing $19 trillion in new spending, and no one believes that this is not a low-ball estimate of his pie-in-the-sky proposals.  He would take office with $21 trillion in debt on day one.  He has not proposed how he will pay for his Santa Clause promises to Generation Snowflake.  He is already the worst candidate in history, a lying populist demagogue if there ever was one.</comment>

<comment>It is my experience that the Baggers like stuff, but just hate to pay for it. They are all in favor of lower income taxes but don't want any user fees on anything they touch. For a prominent example, those welfare queens out west that want OUR land for free to graze cattle, strip mine, and clear cut forests.Baggers are the bane of the world.</comment>

<comment>What the hell are you blathering on about now?</comment>

<comment>BAGGERS ARE WELFARE QUEENS !!! Was that better?</comment>

<comment>Thanks for clearing that up.</comment>

<comment>But Berniebaggers are too. They want all the free stuffs that he has been promising them.</comment>

<comment>Wrong on the facts in so many ways. First it would be 19 trillion over 10 years. Secondly most of that comes from  the universal health care coverage. However, at the moment healthcare is not free as the iguana god seems to think. It would cost us 18 trillion over ten years if it stays  the way it is now. The government already pays a big chunk of that in the form of Medicare, Medicaid, the VA system and subsidies to public hospitals and private non=profit hospitals. The rest is paid by private insurance and hospitals when they forego payments from the uninsured.</comment>

<comment>BS would triple the size of the Government that he already qualifies as corrupt. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. This old man is senile.</comment>

<comment>you sound like a fraidy cat</comment>

<comment>By re-publishing his rape fantasy memoirs?</comment>

<comment>off topic. saving that for Sanders' second term.</comment>

<comment>I don't. I can't get ANY specifics from Sanders supporters about "how bernie would help us."</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders has an economic policy which is designed to reduce unemployment, until it is zero. His main policies are an infrastructure jobs program, which gets Federal money directly into formerly unemployed workers' pockets, education subsidies, which reduce the pool of workers and helps retrain workers for openings, a higher minimum wage which reduces unemployment by increasing demand, and public health care, which allows small businesses to compete, and increases worker mobility, as workers no longer have to worry about health benefits.These policies, if done right, can reduce unemployment to zero, and produce tremendous economic growth, as in the late 90s. But you need to understand economics, not listen to Republican propaganda.</comment>

<comment>Government receipts and government spending are both at all-time highs.  This fear of the government not spending enough is like a Sumo wrestler pathologically afraid of starving to death.You need to find revenue for legitimate programs, not illegitimate ones, or to make sure that every GSA-like agency has enough parties each year.</comment>

<comment>Love how you totally skipped Obama, who spent with more borrowed money than the two Bushes and even Clinton, combined.</comment>

<comment>Cutting programs would be more responsible, Harvey. Always claiming the other guy has to pay more is neither responsible nor moral.</comment>

<comment>Because too many people have wised up to the fact that the folks who get the spending are not the folks who get taxed for it, that's why.The Europeans, in contrast, tax the hell out of their middle class to give bennies to the middle class (with more to the poor as an automatic result of that). They do not tax the hell out of the rich, as is commonly misunderstood to be the case.  Because when they tried that, the rich send their capital out of the country or at least didn't invest it into risk-bearing investments at home that are needed to fuel the economy.So, they tax the middle class with high payroll taxes, high income taxes (the rich are not rich because of their income, but because of their assets, hence those taxes don't hurt them much or can easily be avoided), and of course the Big Whopper -- the Value Added Tax.But that won't happen in America as the Dems are only into taxing the 'rich' (reality: upper middle class) to buy votes from the poor and to hell with the middle class.  That's not opinion, but observed fact. Look at the disaster that is ObamaCare and how Obama doesn't really care.  It's why the middle class has fled and continues to flee blue state cities, districts and even entire states.  And you expect that voters will trust them to deliver 'Medicare for Everyone!' as Bernie keeps promising?  Riiight.Bernie might actually want to change that.  But as the article says, the rest of the party certainly is not on board with that and nor do the taxpayer voters trust it to deliver the actual goods that they are being forced to pay for that they otherwise can provide for themselves quite well w/o the government being involved.</comment>

<comment>"No one likes new taxes, but shouldn't finding revenue for your programs be considered responsible?"And who determines if the programs are successful? Most politicians equate success with how much money is spent, not what results their programs produce.You assume that everything politicians produce is a better use of resources than if done in the private sector. As taxes go up, less is available to the private sector, the cost of goods rise, consumers pay more and our competitiveness in international markets decreases.</comment>

<comment>What does it matter except to an accountant with OCD. If you pay $10,000 in income taxes + $6,000 in health insurance premiums and co-pays today but $15,000 in one shot under Sanders plan you are better off.Health insurance premiums ARE a tax.</comment>

<comment>What a ridiculous argument. Taxes and premiums are apples and oranges. Nice try though. </comment>

<comment>Well your using of a phrase of speech has TOTALLY convinced me Miles.   What astounding reasoning.  Well done.</comment>

<comment>It's telling that you used snark rather than a reasoned argument in your reply.My reply wasn't designed to convince you off anything. The purpose was to call out the disingenuous argument by the op.</comment>

<comment>Well by all means, if something is mandatory (health care) by the government that cost money then in essence it is a tax. I don't give a sh** what you call it. However, I will take a 2.2% tax for Healthcare any day rather than the premium and deductible of 5-7% that its mandatory that I pay now. I know its hard for you think that far so I had to break it down for you.</comment>

<comment>You offered nothing to argue with? You just make a statement.</comment>

<comment>The look pretty similar to my bank account...</comment>

<comment>Taxes and premiums are apples and oranges.Nope. But you knew that. Both are required by law. The only difference is that one goes to the government, the other goes to a private company.One takes a few % for running the program while the other takes 15-20% for overhead.Medicare uses less than 2% for administrative costs while private providers for Medicare Advantage uses 11%.http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009...</comment>

<comment>Required by which law? Obamacare?</comment>

<comment>Our government is nowadays operated for the benefit of the Administrative Class, and they will extract as much as needed to feather their own nests at the expense of the tax payers.</comment>

<comment>Money is money</comment>

<comment>wait. i thought taxes were oranges and premiums were apples. now who's being ridiculous!</comment>

<comment>Gosh, I spent $200 at the grocery store Saturday too. Let's call that a "tax" and nationalize food.</comment>

<comment>Health is not a hazard, it shouldn't be a bet.</comment>

<comment>why is food any less of a "right" than medicine? You're more likely to die without food than medicine.</comment>

<comment>You can choose to grow your own, you just don't. You're also not insuring (i.e., betting on) the possibility that you're hungry. If medicine was a thing that could just be bought from the store without question, you might have a point in comparing them.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that we subsidize food in the US, right?  Not just a little, either.</comment>

<comment>The difference is the negotiating power of the buyer in regard to health care and food. The person getting health care is not usually in a position to know what kind of care they should be receiving, and they can be manipulated into spending whatever the doctor wants them to spend, by just inventing tests and diseases. The consumers simply don't have enough information. When they do, as in the case of optional surgery, the market works fine.That's what makes health care different, and it is why the parts of care that are most frightening and most difficult to control, the parts that involve lifesaving measures, are paid for by all modern developed states. The remaining health care is done by supplemental insurance and markets, and that system works fine.</comment>

<comment>Ah, but the government can decide just what kind of food you really need just as well as it could decide what health care you really need.You don't need steak and lobster (think of the inequality!). And to avoid hoarding, everyone should simply be required to appear three times a day at their assigned Federal Feeding Center for their gruel ration. Think of the savings that would come by removing all the profit that goes to greedy restaurant owners, grasping waiters, and Big Grocery Store companies! And we could negotiate the cost of gruel to ensure fat cat farmers make almost no money at all, just like Bernie proposes for doctors.Do it for the children! 15 million children go to bed hungry every night while the 1% eat elaborate French dinners and thousands of filthy capitalist restauranteurs push wasteful, unnecessary plates of food onto consumers who don't know any better.</comment>

<comment>Food consumption does not usually involve coercion or emergency, in cases of famine, when it does, the government gets involved. "Government food" existed in the US in the 1940s and 1950s. Food is not a problem usually, because the consumer knows how to buy it.The main problem with health care is that the consumer usually doesn't know enough to make an informed choice, the doctor both opaquely diagnoses the care required and gets paid for the amount of care dispensed, and the insurance company foots the bill. This allows hospitals to make profits by over-treating and over-prescribing. Government systems set a ceiling and strong policies for care, and then private add-ons complete the care in a market system, so that there is no rationing.</comment>

<comment>Governments have caused more famines than they've relieved. And activists claim 15 million children go hungry in the U.S.Michele Obama has spent the last 7 years operating under the premise that food consumers don't know enough to make the right choices (she's largely right - no pun intended - but consumers don't seem to care).I would rather my doctor determine what is "over-prescribing" and "over-treating" than my senator. Glad to see you would allow a private option.The point, of course, is that you could make the "expense" and consumer-knowledge-deficit argument apply to anything.</comment>

<comment>You could make the argument disingenuously, that's why you need to take it case by case. It is true in the case of medicine, it is not really true in the case of food (although consumers are really stupid about food), and this is why the entire world makes a floor of care which is government provided. I don't agree with the British system, where the floor is also the ceiling, because there is no reason to prevent markets on top of the basic care provided by the government. Markets fix whatever rationing issue you have with the basic care. But it doesn't matter, even the British system is better than the US by a mile.</comment>

<comment>lol. "consumers are really stupid about food"Yes, comrade. We must tell the people what they want! Like the McGovern diet plan, by our should-have-been-glorious leader George McGovern which....makes those proles fat! (/sarcasm)It's cute how you don't actually think before you write, little airhead.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>UK tax rate on a person making $50,000: 40%US 25%UK VAT- 20%US VAT- 0</comment>

<comment>I think you missed the point. For the person who has to pay, it does not matter if it is called a tax or a premium to a private insurance company.But if it is a tax, it depends on income. People with a high income pay more, while people with a low or medium income pay less than if everyone pays the same premiums.Those who say "oh, someone wants to raise taxes, that's terrible" when something is suggested that makes it less expensive for most people and only more expensive for a minority with a high income have, in my view, a rather strange view that has more to do with ideology than with the interests of people.</comment>

<comment>Look at Europe. They've only been able to make this "work" by taxing the crap out of the middle (and even lower) class. It's called VAT, look it up. Even then, it doesn't "work" if there is any significant portion of the population that isn't working its tail off. Google "austerity" and "Scandinavia welfare reform" and be amazed. There is no such thing as a free lunch.</comment>

<comment>Yes, look at Europe! Do you think anyone in Europe would like to give up free or low-fee university education and universal health care just to lower taxes (while paying much more in university fees and health insurance premiums)? Not even conservative European politicians would be as crazy as suggesting something like that because they would have no chance of being elected.</comment>

<comment>Europe can do these things because they weren't disrupting a behemoth to transition to national health and national education. WWII reduced all their previous institutions to rubble -- it wasn't just physical damage to places, the whole concept of what government is and what it does and how it's paid for had to be rebuilt almost from scratch (with the benefit of recent memories of what they liked and didn't about the old system before demolition.)We'd rather not go through that kind of disruption, just on the chance that a new construction might eventually be preferable to what we get from do-able renovations.</comment>

<comment>Do you think Europe can sustain their welfare state when a few more million immigrants from ME will go there? How about they get 20 million - like US got from Mexico?</comment>

<comment>They have a higher percentage of immigrants than the US, due to guest worker programs, and these migrants receive health care without any problem.</comment>

<comment>Europe has a higher proportion of non-European people than USA has for immigrants? Do you have any evidence for this?</comment>

<comment>Not "non European people", it's absurdly racist to care where people's ancestors come from. Europe just has more immigrants. They have a guest worker program, and they have massive immigration for decades, due to a low indigenous birthrate.</comment>

<comment>Sigh. People in EU are mostly people who were born in the EU. They move from one part of EU to another, but it's same union. It's stupid to count people who move from France to Switzerland (or from Switzerland to France) as "immigrants" - and compare them with 30 million or more Mexicans moving to the USA. These are people with same culture, same background and comparable education. Now, it's a very different matter when 1 million arabs are moving into EU - that's true immigration. And EU is in panic."Guest worker programs" are for people from outside EU. The percent of such workers is very small compared to the percentage of hispanic immigrants in the US.</comment>

<comment>lmao. now the little lefty airhead is denying evolution. and inheritability. and of course asserting ludicrous illogic that more people on welfare=better economy.it's cute how dumb you are, little airhead.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>There are some countries within Europe that have as many immigrants as the US does, or even more https://data.oecd.org/chart/4r...And there are fewer jobs in the US than in central and North Europe https://data.oecd.org/chart/4r... . Despite the 5% of unemployment rate you see in the US, which is due to its small labour force.What a welfare state needs is as many people working as possible, so that pensions, health care, etc. can be paid with high economic activity. This means high employment rate and a large labor force. Immigrants are a good thing economically for Europe and welfare states. The big problem for welfare estates is the lack of jobs, which is caused by lack of industry/innovation and by small demand, due to too low salaries.</comment>

<comment>Indiana just raised their VAT while promising to cut income taxes again. By the way, a VAT is a fancy name for a sales tax.</comment>

<comment>the sales tax in Indiana is 7%. The VAT is 20-25% in Europe. VAT is similar to a sales tax in that it's regressive- i.e. hits the poor and middle class - but there are some differences. In short tho. you are right, you'd need to triple the sales tax and increase income taxes. Then you too can get free stuff (rationed, and as long as you don't mind massive debt.)</comment>

<comment>Uummm, then don't visit Europe.It doesn't matter what you name it, money goes from me to someone else to pay for something I'm obligated for. Call it a tax, premium, or user fee, it is all the same.</comment>

<comment>Adreng's argument was the Bernie Sanders claim- that if you turn health care spending into a "tax," then rich people pay it and middle class and poorer people rake in the benefit. Where it actually exists- the experience in Europe with health care - the poor and middle class get shafted with a giant regressive sales tax and higher income taxes. And the system is pretty near bankrupt ("austerity" on top of rationing). There is no free lunch or free health care. The European experience is that the government will take what you're paying in premiums, will still need to triple your sales tax, will still need $3/gallon gas taxes, will still need to take a greater percentage of your income, will still need to all but eliminate your defense department, will still need to recruit from India to find you a doc willing to work at that price, and will still be very concerned about deficit spending.</comment>

<comment>Vat is also similar to sales taxes in that hardly anyone has a good idea of how much they actually pay into it. That lack of transparency is a feature, not a bug.</comment>

<comment>Sanders didn't propose a VAT.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Sanders is proposing the magic solution. In the real world, government run health care is so expensive everyone needs to keep paying more and more to get less and less.</comment>

<comment>Government run health care is 30-50% cheaper than what you have in the US, and produces better outcomes. Sanders isn't proposing a VAT because he does it with a properly progressive mix of payroll and income taxes. It's not magic, his plan is dead on accurate on the numbers (despite what you read), which is a first for campaigns.</comment>

<comment>Except nobody has ever done it without a VAT (and they aren't able to afford it with a VAT) so it is magic.As for "cheaper" - ever heard the expression you get what you pay for? Here are some examples for you to chew on- Honda run small sedans were 30-50% cheaper for the quality than Detroit-made small sedans. How did that work out for Detroit and the UAW?WalMart-run department stores are 30-50% cheaper than most grocery stores, clothing and toy stores. Liberals love WalMart, right? WalMart is cheaper because it pays its people less and gives you lower quality.This experiment has been tried. The reason government-run health care claims to be 30-50% cheaper is for two factors- 1 it will only pay for 30-50% of the health care you're now getting and 2. It will only pay your doctor's office 30-50% of what it's getting now (which is one of the reasons you get less health care). Remember all those people who complained when Obamacare went into effect that they were paying more for policies with less coverage? They were real people. They were also  told it would save money, remember?</comment>

<comment>If no one has done it without a VAT, Sanders will be the first. It's better to do it partly in payroll, to make the program politically immune from repeal. It's good to do the rest in income, to make it progressive.If you want extra health care, pay for supplemental insurance. In France, people get supplemental insurance, they pay 30% less in total, and they get more health care.Health care is expensive in the US because there is no government to hold down costs for MRIs, prescription drugs, x-rays, and so on, and hospitals and medical professionals make a higher pay than is justified by market rate given the number of doctors, through guild practices.Once the government holds down basic care costs, that sets the pay scale for the private system on top. If you feel you aren't getting enough care, buy supplemental insurance. Your rates won't be driven up by homeless people and uninsured going to emergency rooms, and by ridiculous unnecessary tests for children and ignorant people who can't evaluate their care independently.</comment>

<comment>That VAT tax is a convenient way to hide the cost of government from the people who have to pay for it. Even more so that withholding here.</comment>

<comment>Sanders didn't propose a VAT. It's also terribly regressive in addition to hiding costs.</comment>

<comment>lol. your mom's terribly regressive.*giggle*</comment>

<comment>National Health Care isn't just Europe. It's the entire world, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, India, China, Cuba, literally the whole world. There are as many systems as there are countries, and even the worst ones work much better than the US.</comment>

<comment>" For the person who has to pay, it does not matter if it is called a tax or a premium to a private insurance company."Do you think you can make same argument about sex? After all, if you want to have sex, it shouldn't matter who and when and how. Right?</comment>

<comment>Its not mandatory by the government so it is not a tax. However healthcare is...YOU BIG DUMMY. If you want to be sarcastic try sounding smart first otherwise no point in dumb sarcasm.</comment>

<comment>If it is really so easy, let's make Bernie-care voluntary for all Americans except registered Democrats.</comment>

<comment>It matters because I pay $60,000 to $70,000 in income taxes personally, and up to $180,000 through my company.I spend less than $3,000 a year on medical expenses for my family, including direct pays through the medical plan. Most of that is for the dentist, which isn't covered in a medical plan anyway.If the government does it, expect the cost to increase from 15% to 50% for the same level of service.Here is another reason, Where does it say in the Constitution that the federal government can pay for your medical treatment?</comment>

<comment>It matters because I pay $60,000 to $70,000 in income taxes personally,Hhmmm, vivid imagination you have there, Joe.Where does it say in the Constitution that the federal government can pay for your medical treatment?So you haven't read it. Ya, that confirms my first impression.Try Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1 and the XVI Amendment. Been there and done that with Medicare and Social Security.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, dude. I must not have mentioned, I am rich.You might want to look some words up in a dictionary. See, "general" is not the same word as "individual". That means, the federal government has the authority to fund research for cures for diseases, and regulate pollution. It does not give it the authority to treat anyone.Yes, the feds can tax any darn well way they like.</comment>

<comment>So in other words, you want to pull the plug on grandma because... Constitution! Freedom!Did I get that right?</comment>

<comment>She can do as she wishes.I merely want nothing to do with it.</comment>

<comment>Yes, your comments are rich. Very rich. That is why you can't show us anything that forbids the government from paying for medical care. And every faceless commentator here can invent their own life, which too many do.BTW, I guess you never heard of the VA. They provide medical care; some direct and some paid. And yes, they are totally separate from the DOD.</comment>

<comment>The VA is part of the compensation agreement for certain federal employees in the federal government's role as employer.</comment>

<comment>So the government can make an agreement with its employees but can't with its citizens? Seriously dude?So where is that in the Constitution? I keep asking but you can't show us.</comment>

<comment>How did you get the idea that a mandate or nationalization of an industry is an "agreement"?Agreement requires the parties to, you know, agree.</comment>

<comment>So you still can't answer where in the Constitution your BS lays.Nothing in the Constitution gives business any right to exist, let alone to remain unregulated. The Constitution does allow the Congress to regulate commerce. That includes nationalization.BTW, it was YOU that used the word "agreement".Give it a rest. You've been caught lying too many times to continue.</comment>

<comment>We spend half the federal budget on war, endless, unwinnable wars that have gone on for 15 years - as long as we were in Vietnam.  We spend more on the military than all our allies and enemies combined! We sell more guns to the world than any other country.And most pathetic truth of those wars -- beyond the never-ending death and destruction -- is that we actually LOST manufacturing capacity while fighting multiple wars, yet we didn't lose a single factory in the violence of the conflict.Why? Thanks to free trade Democrats and their craven Republican kin, we OUTSOURCED OUR MILITARY MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO THE WORLD. So we didn't even get the economic boost that comes from starting wars.Democrats have been on the wrong path since Jimmy Carter said 'free trade will create world peace.' How's that working out for us?Get out of the Mid East, negotiate a new international arms reduction agreement. Accept the fact that some countries won't be run by the investment industry and INVEST THAT MONEY DOMESTICALLY AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PEOPLE.  Maybe we can rebuild our manufacturing base while we are at it.Or is that too 'anti-capitalist' for you? Hope not, because what the Clinton's are peddling is way too 'Republican-lite' for me.</comment>

<comment>You are wrong.https://media.nationalprioriti...</comment>

<comment>No you are wrong, bucause you only look streight like a bison looking at a colerful door. Now add the taxes not paid for because of offshore banking.I live in germany currently and I have nothing against paying a little more tax when I see where it goes, and our rich in the states live in gated communities, hahaha, what a life. We have a oligarchy its a fact and every philosoph and intelectual online and offline is saying that. Greed!!!!!</comment>

<comment>Let me refine my statement: 53% of all discretionary is on the military. Another 5.6% is spent on veterans. 3.67% is spent on foreign aid, 6% of our annual budget goes to debt repayment, most of it militarily-incurred.That same website also confirms my point that we spend more on 'defense' than the next seven heaviest-spending military budgets combined (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, UK, France, India and Germany).All these points confirmed on same website you used.The point you haven't addressed is that Clinton/Obama/Bush trade policies have destroyed our manufacturing base so badly, that we are the first nation in modern history to lose manufacturing capacity, while fighting war and not lose a single factory to the violence of war.That's how badly neoliberals and neoconservatives have destroyed this country</comment>

<comment>Wait, why are looking only at the "discretionary" portion of the federal budget?</comment>

<comment>Because it helps his argument to ignore all the other spending.</comment>
