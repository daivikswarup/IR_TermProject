<comment>Rubio is the least worst. Admit it. Hillary should be in prison or at least indicted. Bernie is a leftist commie. Trump is Trump. Cruz too conservative to beat an old white Dem like Hillary or Bernie.</comment>

<comment>rubio is a shifty panderer.  just like Cruz, but far less intelligent.</comment>

<comment>Cruz just won Iowa while taking a stand against ethanol subsidies. That is NOT pandering.</comment>

<comment>It is when almost all your funders are Texans.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is against subsidies for oil companies too. That hits Texas.</comment>

<comment>Thank you.  I did it for the children, azt.</comment>

<comment>Well Cruz is a lot of things but panderer is not one of them. In Iowa panderer promise ethanol subsidies. Cruz didn't.Trump did.Sanders? Well Sanders has offered free or subsidized everything.Hillary? She is having a difficult time keeping up with Ssnders' list of freebies. The only thing from preventing from exceeding Sanders' list is an absence of imagination.So who do I like. None of the above. I recuse myself. The political process isn't what's broken, it's the culture that's broken. Politics cannot function properly in a culture where voters act as consumers instead of citizens. </comment>

<comment>Cruz is the biggest and most obvious panderer. If he says his version of Allah Akbar once more, I'm going to wretch. His pandering is the worst kind because it has nothing to do with politic or issues and everything to do with religious tribalism.</comment>

<comment>Okay, I will grant you that. </comment>

<comment>Is it worse to promise freeloaders free stuff or to recognize the religious sensibilities of evangelicals?</comment>

<comment>The whole anti-freebie crowd does not understand that the whole planet belongs to a higher intelligence.  Man has to get that the abundance is for all the creatures, not just man and not just some men.  No matter how hard you have worked. The problem with sharing, now, is just that the planet has double the number of humans that it needs. Man should be working towards understanding what its optimal population is because man's genes have not figured it out like other species have. Intelligence is somehow a two way sword and mankind is going to hell. Sander's has the right analysis of what the 1% have done to the working classes and the poor, but only Trump could take charge of the U.S. military-industrial complex and possibly make America great again.</comment>

<comment>"Sanders? Well Sanders has offered free or subsidized everything."Not all all. He is against our current system of free and subsidized wealth acquisition. People like to think that the takers are the poor and lower middle class. Sorry, just not the case anymore.Sanders is against subsidies (in lost taxes through loop holes) for the multimillionaires and corporations. He wants major handouts to stop.</comment>

<comment>It's not a handout for people to keep more of what they earn.A handout is taking something from Peter, who earned it, and giving it to Paul simply because Paul inhabits the same country as Peter.And - good luck on being the country with the highest corporate tax rate!  It's not like they have choices or anything.</comment>

<comment>Capital gains aren't earned through labor. They are earned through investments. They are also never taxed as income. Money continues to grow untaxed until it is taken from the investment. Then it is only taxed at 18% - far less than income from labor. It is a myth that wealthy people "Earn" their money. Financial planners earn money for them, people who work earn money for them by allowing the tax base to remain intact.The statutory corporate tax rate is relatively high (around 30% or more) however large corporation pay only a fractions of that in reality (12-15%). Some corporations - like pepsico in 2011or so - get money back from the government due to the amount of deductions they are allowed to take. These are deductions for depreciation of capital (machines, computers, etc.). You're average tax payer is not allowed to take deductions for depreciation of his TV or computer.Small businesses (middle class) are hurt by the current tax rates as are people who work for income (not investment gains). You are supporting ideas that are against your interest. You are allowing the government to take your hard earned money at a higher rate than someone who hasn't worked for his income.Should people be able to keep their hard earned money? Of course... (1) assuming that income is actually earned, and (2) assuming that in keeping that money others aren't harmed. People who think otherwise have been conned into supporting ideas that aren't in their economic interest.</comment>

<comment>You lost him when you started making sense.</comment>

<comment> Do you believe that smart and rational people pay attention to incentives?If you jack up capital gains taxes, then the activity will diminish apace.If you jack up corporate rates, corporations will relocate, as they are already doing. </comment>

<comment>They were doing this before there was any talk of tax increases (the trend started in the 80s as tax rates for corporations were declining). In fact there the government offered tax incentives to bring corporate production back to the US. No one took them up on it. Why? because they can continue to exploit international labor *and* the US consumer with the high cost of products to maximize profit. What is the solution... well many countries have far stricter policies on off shore production and stricter taxation laws. It works.Corporations aren't going to leave the US. It is politically stable, its economy is strong. We have a strong consumer base. Those things in and of themselves are critical to corporate success. Beyond that most of the money that is made now is not in production of goods, but in services. The financial markets are where wealth is made... labor in the US is in services. Service industries (like Walmart) won't leave... they already produce goods oversees. They need the US market and they primarily employ people to provide the service of sales.So tax them fairly. Otherwise we have a middle class that can't buy anything... then lets see what walmart does? Maybe more layoffs, salary reduction, fewer people buying goods and services... Not good for Walmart.We've tried lowering taxes and it hasn't helped. Wealth still trickles up into the hands of a few. Lets trying addressing the problems with a strategy that emphasizes the middle class and opportunities for economic mobility. If after that we are still in a mess... then ok call it out. But for the past 40 years we have been working with a trickle up mentality. It simply hasn't panned out.My family for one has lost ground not gained it. My husband and I both have PhDs and struggle to stay in the middle class. The crazy thing is that we make what I once considered decent salaries... when you do the right thing, and are still strapped financially (making choices between saving for college or retirement - or saving at all), then that is a problem. We are in a higher wage bracket... most of the US population is worse off than we are. Neither of us had student loans to speak of... that is hardly the case now for a typical student. You can't start off life with 50K in loans and move into the middle class anytime soon. It is a sad state economically for a class of people who were doing fine a generation ago.</comment>

<comment>Do you realize that companies can relocate to the UK and their tax rate will drop in half? What's worse is that we tax based on geography. So, this also encourages production and talent to move out of this country as well.Walgreens has a 28% effective tax rate, and CVS has a 43% tax rate. Chasing multinational corporation's around the globe and trying to soak them is a fool's errand. </comment>

<comment>Neither Walgreens or CVS have substantial markets globally. They aren't going anywhere. Is there rate too high - perhaps, but there are many other corporations that pay far far less than that. Let them move to the UK - that market is smaller and has far less global reach You might also lose talent as there are many who might not want to leave the US.I am of the idea that if a company doesn't want to support the country that made it - that supported it through infrastructure, economic stability, etc. Let them go. It is not an option for every company to move. It is also not an option for every company to pay import taxes to the US. Let see them lose the US market. Cough it up or leave.</comment>

<comment>re: capital gains...Do you really think a very wealthy person will pull out of investments because of a tax increase? Of they won't. Where are they going to put the $$ under a mattress? They will continue to invest and make millions even if it is slightly less than the millions they have made in the past. Less money is better than no money.</comment>

<comment>They will defer these gains ala Buffet.No one makes you sell an investment. </comment>

<comment>That is their right and privilege. However when they sell, they should be fairly taxed.</comment>

<comment>How?There is no trigger until they sell. </comment>

<comment>you die - estate tax</comment>

<comment>Look what Buffet did. His wealth is going to the Gates Foundation tax free.Or - you buy life insurance whose proceeds are tax free. </comment>

<comment>Trying to use government policy to change behavior rarely works as expected.  We already know that investors aren't rational, and that investors make decisions thinking about many variables (in addition to taxes).  Instead of trying to coerce people with tax policy, just focus on doing what's right, fair, and just.</comment>

<comment>Comparing corporate decisions to short-term stock moves is, in my opinion, a very poor analogy.If you raise corporate taxes even further, you will have even more corporations relocating overseas. The rate in the UK, for example, is 20%.What's madness is that the left wants to both uncap the W2 s/t to the social security tax AND raise the corporate income tax.  It's like they are begging companies to send high wage jobs overseas. </comment>

<comment>it's not like corporations pay the highest tax rateyou don't know anything</comment>

<comment>CVS pays an effective rate of 40%+ for example.They are mostly domestic and have no NOLs.I know plenty. What do you know?  "Corporations" = bad?</comment>

<comment>all I see is what you typed, goober, cut the crap</comment>

<comment>Ah, ok.You can't pull public financials and do 2nd grade math.Nevermind dumbass. </comment>

<comment>you got links or you got lies</comment>

<comment>Free healthcare, free University, free childcare, free....  </comment>

<comment>Close tax loophole and stop wealth fare... not a free free free message to me. It is a message of "if you have done well in our society, it is because we have such a great nation. Now pull your fair share, so others can do well too." I hope you will take the effort to really examine what is happening to the middle class. It is sad and bad for the economy and everyone who is not uberwealthy.It is time people put aside there delusions about the wealthy (that they are smarter, work harder, and are more valuable to society) and start paying attention to what a "free" market does to the middle class. It is shrinking and will gain traction again until the reigns are pulled on massive wealth acquisition. It is obvious and the facts are there to easily be found by anyone with an interested in real research and the truth. There are plenty of nonpartisan highly reputable sources of information - Urban institute, Kaiser foundation, RAND, even government website related to social service spending.If you want to continue to loose ground economically, lose the ability to become upwardly mobile, forgo seeing your kids do better than you have... then go ahead! Support the ideas these people are feeding you. But one day you will realize that "liberal" policies didn't get you there. The GOP is bought and paid for by wealthy interests. People just keep drinking the water. They are thinking trickle down when history has shown us that the natural course of events is trickle up (see Thomas Picketys work)</comment>

<comment>I am not sure what any of what you are saying has to do with what I said. Is Sanders promising free stuff? Yes or no? You can justify it in any number of ways just as you can giving free stuff to corporations. But the bottom line is this: politician get elected by promising to take something from one person and giving it to someone else.I am not going to get into a back and forth with you on whether the wealthy 'deserve' or earn their wealth. But I will say this: all other things equal if you create a system in which hard work and rich taking pays no more than sitting around and the house collecting a welfare check I can promise you this, productivity with collapse.I for one will not awake 5:30 AM every morning putting in a 12 to 14 hour day every day only to earn the same amount as someone who hasn't worked a day in 10 years.And I know plenty of wealthy people and I know plenty of poor and lower middle class people and while there is not a perfect correlation between wealrh and intelligence my experience tells me there is a strong correlation.</comment>

<comment>You don't know what a leftist is - or a commie. I also don't think you know what constitutes a crime. But go ahead... share your thoughts with the public at large.</comment>

<comment>No way, are you joking?  There's no way Rubio would be better for normal people than Sanders.  Hillary's a criminal, sure.  Cruz is a dominionist nutjob.  Like you aptly put it, Trump is Trump.  Rubio is the status quo personified.  He has no principles I can discern; he's completely in the pocket of the oligarchs.Sanders has some crazy ideas, but frankly I doubt any of them could get passed.  He'd be president, not emperor.  At least he's not already bought and sold like Rubio, Cruz, and Clinton, and he's not Trump.  For the first time in a long time, I am likely going to vote if I get the chance to vote for Sanders.  If it's Cruz / Clinton or Rubio / Clinton who cares?  Same difference in the end.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is reminiscent of Reagan. The idea that he is too conservative is BS.</comment>

<comment>Heretofore, Rubio has been the Boy Scout amongst the serious candidates.  This article's description seeks to pain Rubio as either an opportunist or a hypocrite, when in fact, this is very, very mild shifting compared to what a Clinton or a Trump or a Nixon would do.  Rubio seems to me to be getting smarter, not slimier.</comment>

<comment>But...Rubio is an opportunist and hypocrite </comment>

<comment>Ignore the opportunist and hypocrite.Stick with the proven patriots.Trump/Santorum 2016</comment>

<comment>Sooo...he's a politician?</comment>

<comment>Rubio is only telling the voters what they want to hear.</comment>

<comment>As opposed to Trump?  Uh-huh.Cruz is the only candidate who might be said to telling voters things that make them uncomfortable.  But given his flip-flop on immigration, including the legalization of those here illegally, even St. Ted. is a demagogue.</comment>

<comment>I'm often told that my very presence makes people uncomfortable.</comment>

<comment>Just show them your paintings. That will win them over.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is layered with slime. He supported his immigration reform bill and once he found out how unpopular it was with the base he needed to get to the White House he dropped it like a hot potato. Talk about lacking conviction.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is an evangelical catholic. Lacking ethical convictions is a requirement.</comment>

<comment>A fair point.  Marco Rubio is almost assuredly the only politician who has ever changed his stance on something to win favor with the electorate . . . with the exception of Senator Cruz, who did the same thing on the same issue, but now lies about it.</comment>

<comment>you got the "boy" part right</comment>

<comment>Rubio is worse than Cruz or Trump.  The latter two are obvious with their hatred and bigotry, whereas Rubio hides his behind a smile.  Beware the wolf in sheep's clothing.</comment>

<comment>He is a snake.</comment>

<comment>Cruz continues to be the worst.  Rubio has his flaws, but it was Cruz who pushed the country towards an economic crisis for no reason other than to get a few days of press coverage.  It was Cruz who when faced with his own unambiguous statements in support of the immigration bill said "I did not support the immigration bill" with stone cold, unflinching eyes.  The guy is quite literally a sociopath.  Rubio is nothing compared to Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Agreed about Cruz.  Rubio is an aspiring sociopath.</comment>

<comment>"Aspiring" doesn't cut it when you're dealing with pros.  Rubio is child's toy.</comment>

<comment>Ha! not quite there yet?</comment>

<comment>Exactly- an act! Look what Obama said during the campaign- like night and day with his actions.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is the "Most Worst" of this particular toxic choice.Rubio has no values at all and is willing to say and do anything to get ahead.</comment>

<comment>Are you really saying Rubio is worse than Cruz? I find that hard to believe. Cruz literally shut down the US government, costing the US economy tens of billions of dollars, purely to advance his political brand.If you're just comparing Trump and Rubio, I don't see either as being much worse than the other. Mostly because I don't think Trump is any more serious about the things he says than Rubio is about what he says, this week rather than last week. They're both opportunists, rather than ideologues.The thing that's really scary about both Trump and Rubio is that the things they are getting a positive response from the Republican base about, so the things they repeat the next day and the next debate, are so vile. It's the Republican base's nasty soul they're revealing, rather than something particularly foul within themselves, I think. </comment>

<comment>Yeah. Put on your diaper. that is what I am saying.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is odious, but Rubio is reading from a script. He dosen't have a single original thought. Pure message machine.</comment>

<comment>Not sure your specifics around the Republican's vile, nasty soul but can we at least remove accusations of racism ?About 60% of the vote went to a Latino or Black candidate in a electorate that was 95% neither.</comment>

<comment>With Rubio's flip flops on immigration I think anyone who believes he's going to attract a portion of the Hispanic vote just because he's Cuban is incredibly naive.</comment>

<comment>Not my point and I don't really care the about the color of his supporters, it's time to move on.It will become difficult to bash the GOP as angry racists after this while the Dems can only offer old white people.</comment>

<comment>The argument that the Democratic Party only has old white people in it is an disingenuous as they come, especially given the overtly racist tone the election has taken on the GOP side. Can you share any talking points that don't come from Fox News or Tub O'Lard Limbaugh?</comment>

<comment>LOL, Does that 'argument' work anywhere, with anyone?The future of the democratic party is in the hands of grandparents.</comment>

<comment>well, the gop IS angry racists, it's your party, live with it</comment>

<comment>Even though you used capital letters, I think you're wrong.again, in Iowa 60% of the republican vote went to non-white candidates.No one is voting on color of skin but ideas.</comment>

<comment>that's because people in the north are morecivilized than people in the south, home of racists</comment>

<comment>Mexicans and Central Americans are worse than poor whites; they vote against their own interests due to the lack of knowledge of how the worlds or economics work. But, their lack of education might make them loyal to the tribe and vote Hispanic. That is why in the Spanish media there is a concerted effort to make them not vote for Cruz or Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Plus according to your hero Trump they're all rapist and murderers to boot.</comment>

<comment>I have a hero?</comment>

<comment>That is silly... Cruz. Rubio. Trump promise to kick them out.... Hillary promises to not deport</comment>

<comment>Pero los apellidos son faciles de pronunciar, o no?</comment>

<comment>Since you are an illegal - I suggest you learn to communicate in English.  And your "Last-name are easy to pronounce" makes no sense.....</comment>

<comment>Ok, I'll do as you say, gracias. But, they are still easy to pronounce for a Spanish speaker.</comment>

<comment>"With Rubio's flip flops on immigration I think anyone who believes he's going to attract a portion of the Hispanic vote just because he's Cuban is incredibly naive."This makes sense for a rational electorate. Unfortunately, we have many people who pay no attention to what a candidate does or what he said last year, and pay attention to only what's said most recently.</comment>

<comment>She's not "saying" anything.  She's just vomiting out the first thing that crawls through her lizard "mind."</comment>

<comment>It's the Republican base's nasty soul they're revealing, rather than something particularly foul within themselves, I think.Trump actually draws from a much more mixed background of Republicans, Democrats and non-partisans.  What you're seeing is a lot of working-class sentiment.</comment>

<comment>I would argue it is a subset of the working class (hopefully). They are either not paying attention to his message ("minimum wage is too high") or they are not comprehending the fact that his (and all of the GOPs economic policies) are fundamentally contrary to their economic interest.Some must be poorly educated or willfully ignorant. The facts about the issues are out there and easily accessible (government websites, Kaiser Foundation, RAND, Urban institute). People just want to remain ignorant and manipulated.I don't want to believe that good regular people (like my family) are either too dumb or too stubborn to really understand the stakes. But...</comment>

<comment>People are more persuaded by identity than argument; Trump, for all his money, is more culturally working class - a good old boy made good - than bourgeois Sanders.  This works in reverse as well; there are lot of people of dislike Trump for reasons that have more to do with cultural signifiers than his statements or platform.As far as policies go, Trump is actually a pretty big break from the more conventional Republican candidates.  He strongly supports campaign finance reform and higher taxes on the wealthy, for example, he has no interest in social issues or religion, and his stance on immigration is at odds with where the party leadership would like to go.  There's less light between Trump and Sanders than there is between Cruz and Sanders.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you that Trump is actually not really as conservative as he purports to be. I think he is playing to win and is saying many things he doesn't really believe. I also know that he is hardly a loyal republican and from interviews with friends of his that I have seen, he is probably far more moderate than he appears on the campaign trail.I don't believe he is a self made man though. His dad was a real estate mogul who gave him $1 million when he graduated from college and told him to start a business. He gave him his contacts in the business too. The guy has come from amazing advantage economically.To be honest I don't know about Bernie's upbringing. Bernie's problem was that he called himself a socialist. He isn't in the least (at least in terms of what the wold thinks of socialism). He is at best in the scheme of history a moderate democrat or liberal Republican (ala the 1960'70s). His use of the word has created an impression of him and his positions that isn't accurate.Its funny though that you mentioned cultural signifiers. My dad's wife told me she was pro-trump because he spoke what every day people were thinking. She was proud of his courage. Now whether in reality he is courageous, stupid, a panderer, etc... she did see cultural similarities. I think you are right - he is able to tap into that at some kind of psychological level...</comment>

<comment>Trump isn't a self-made man, but his father was, and he comes from and understands the culture - one that values skill and action, not education and credentials.  If you're interested, I stole heavily from this essay and its associated links:http://slatestarcodex.com/2016...</comment>

<comment>I agree with your assessment of Rubio, but somehow I'd take his dishonesty and personal ambition over the qualities that Cruz and Trump exude.  At any rate, this conversation is akin to trying to pick which of your last three turds is most appetizing -- whoa to the person who is actually enthusiastic about any of the choices.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>So conviction and follow through are vices? The American people disagree.</comment>

<comment>>Because I want my politicians to be lying when they talk crazy.I'd feel better about that take on Rubio if when it comes to foreign policy he hadn't been advised all along by the craziest of the crazy of the 'W'-era neocon dead-enders.On immigration, yes, Rubio has shifted to a position that seems out of step with most of his career and who he talks to.   Good chance he'd pivot or not not push it as Prez.   On getting us into more wars and more doomed foreign adventures, he's been quite consistent.   I think we're seeing the real thing.</comment>

<comment>The same could absolutely be said about Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Everyone seems to forget Bill's lurch to the right after getting crushed in the '94 elections.</comment>

<comment>I can't really quibble with this analysis.  To Fox's credit, Megyn Kelly gave him a hard time about the 'closing down mosques' quote.  Nevertheless I'd say it's a defeat of Trumpism, because Trumpism is really about unbridled aggression bordering on fascism.  And I just can't see Rubio embracing that even if he has to say some distasteful things to pick off some voters.</comment>

<comment>Megan Kelly gave him a hard on??</comment>

<comment>Not with that lesbian haircut.</comment>

<comment>Try to keep up. Lesbians now have long hair and straight women are doing the pixie cut.</comment>

<comment>Have you heard Rubio speak on foreign policy?  He is the most hawkish of the bunch, raring for a clash of civilizations.  Or, at least believing that is what the voters want to here.</comment>

<comment>Interesting article. Rubio is an establishment politician who will say anything depending on which way the wind blows. He kind of reminds me of Hillary without the FBI criminal investigation.</comment>

<comment>fcuk you  with your hillary whine. what an arsehole you are.</comment>

<comment>rubio is just as scummy.  uses the party's card to pay for personal expenses.  and he's a lawyer and knows better...?</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton is not under criminal federal investigation. Do not listen to Darryl Issa . These emails probably contain stuff about drones. This was classified after her emails were written. The state department classifies anything about drones( even if you can read it in the newspaper !) of course your opinion of Clinton will not change, but at least when you repeat these particular falsehoods, you will do it knowing that you are talking trash. </comment>

<comment>Do people like Beinart realize that the Constitution does not guarantee open borders forever?  There is nothing wrong with being in favor of less immigration.  You don't belong on the SPLC hate list because you're in favor of lower immigration.</comment>

<comment>if you are in favor of lower immigration, you're most likely a bigot.that's just the nature of the beast these days.</comment>

<comment>"if you are in favor of lower immigration, you're most likely a bigot.' But only if you're in a majority white nation.</comment>

<comment>wtf is "white?"</comment>

<comment>Don' be coy, you know damn well what it means- people of European ethnic heritage who the left considers uniquely evil and blames for all of the world's problems.</comment>

<comment>no i don't</comment>

<comment>It has meant, and will always mean, what the nativists (in whatever country) want it to mean. In the US, a Polish immigrant would be white; in the UK he's a "plumber" there to steal their jobs. People of Jewish ethnicity are usually considered white - but in the deepest darkest corners of Trump support some aren't so sure. </comment>

<comment>It wasn't that long ago that a Polish immigrant in the US wasn't considered "white".  Ditto for Italians and Irish.</comment>

<comment>And Jews.</comment>

<comment>no, i've heard ppl call me a bigot for wanted a homogeneous asia (and everywhere else)so it's important not to fear bigotry, but rather encouraged it where needed</comment>

<comment>No one ever criticizes Asians for their strict immigration policies.</comment>

<comment>I love Taiwan's immigration policy; it'd do wonders here.</comment>

<comment>So True! I keep wondering why this is so. They are not the most compassionate people, but they protect their heritage and make smart deals. </comment>

<comment>Japan is in an economic meltdown that they cannot pull themselves out of - an aging population being supported by a decreasing number of working taxpayers who have become sceptical of their future and are hoarding their savings.  Their last gasp came last week with the reduction of interest rates into negative territory.  Immigration is necessary for every country when large families are no longer the norm.  That is why China dropped its one child policy in a nutshell.</comment>

<comment>white people do actuallyyour busybodies push their ideas all over the world</comment>

<comment>Asia is excellent at 1) stealing technology developed by the west, and 2) convincing its population to work in prison-like factories to replicate said technology.Perfect example: Samsung.We will see if it's sustainable.</comment>

<comment>No, it means you are smart about economics, lesser public assistance, American jobs, stronger labor wage, law & order, Nat'l security and American culture. </comment>

<comment>What's American?  Do I see these "Americans" out there declaring the importance of black and native American culture?  I do not.And what about the very important influence of Latino culture, especially in the West?Also, what about religious diversity, including the right not to be religious?Those are as as American as apple pie.But, white nationalists don't think so.Give us a break.</comment>

<comment>Do you love these cultures- no thanks I say. Their people can appreciate it. </comment>

<comment>Of course I love these cultures!  Native American cultures are beautiful, wise, offer profound insight into the ecology, the interaction of plants, animals, land and people.  Have you studied them at all?  My goodness, many of our states and cities, our great rivers carry Native American names - you think "Mississippi" and "Chicago" are from Europe?And, don't forget, "we" conquered this land by physically beating the hell out of the indigenous people, brutalizing them, driving them off their ancient territory, darn near exterminating some groups and driving others away to be interred in "reservations," a kind of behavior in the 20th century we'd describe as Nazi.Now, the remnants of these beautiful people live, often, in real hardship.  Do you know anything about this?  How can you live here, on this land, and not know this and honor the people whose land you walk upon?It's not to late for you to learn and I hope you do!Black people have contributed profoundly to everything we call "American," from music to cooking to poetry to dance.  You probably love certain music, say rock and roll, or tap dancing, or Broadway musicals, that you THINK are "white," but which either originated in the black South, often from people enslaved for the benefit of "white" people; or heavily influenced them.I grew up out West, where so much is influenced, first by the indigenous people, then by Spain, and much was actually even owned by Mexico.Again, there is a great deal of beauty and history there.  You can't walk in Colorado, you can't say the word, without honoring the fact that it's a Spanish name.Please - learn something about your country.  You can't call yourself "American" until you do.</comment>

<comment>Yes I truly respect Native Americans. I do study them. They are my favorite minority. I was speaking mainly about American Black and American Mexican culture. I enjoy learning about Mexican culture though. There is a difference.Oh and I was a dancer and loved and still love to dance to black music. They do it best. Not bad lyrics black music though.</comment>

<comment>I'm very glad you're studying Native Americans!  That's awesome.  And, Mexican culture, Southwestern culture in general, I'll bet the more you learn the more you like and respect it.Black culture is equally rich though.  Modern rap and hip hop often reflect a misogyny I find disturbing, but I understand the anger.  It's the anger of poor people everywhere, that the establishment is maybe FINALLY going to have to listen to, especially since so many formerly middle class people and working class people are now poor or headed that direction!PS I'm a dancer too!  Used to make my living as a dancer.  So nice to meet you!XOXOXOXO</comment>

<comment>Great! </comment>

<comment>Humans are capable of great good as well as evil. The many hunter-gatherer skulls bashed in warfare that we've found, including the recent find in Kenya, attest to that.</comment>

<comment>Are the Japanese bigots? Not that I agree with their immigration policy, but they allow in very few immigrants and have pretty much outlawed Muslim immigration due to concerns about national security. Again, I don't agree with their policy, but I never hear any criticism of Japan.Interesting note: Japan is actually developing some advanced robot technology to help aged people, as opposed to bringing in younger immigrants to take care of them.</comment>

<comment>Sure sounds like it:"But many conservative politicians, including Abe, are reluctant to ease immigration rules, particularly for unskilled foreign workers, apparently fearing social and economic tensions that could arise from the introduction of different ethnic groups."http://www.japantimes.co.jp/ne..." have pretty much outlawed Muslim immigration due to concerns about national security"http://www.snopes.com/muslims-..."CLAIM: Japan has been able to keep Islam at bay by enforcing strict laws on Muslims.Finding: FALSE"This took me 5 seconds of Google to disprove. Stop lying, because there's no possible way you can truly believe this nonsense with an internet connection.</comment>

<comment>It's more of a de facto thing. Japan hasn't banned Muslim immigration, but they have so few immigrants from the Middle East it's really a de facto ban.In 2010, the number of foreigners in Japan was 2,134,151. There were 209,373 Filipinos, 210,032 Brazilians, mostly of ethnic Japanese descent,[3] 687,156 Chinese and 565,989 Koreans. Of all these foreigners, 7.5% are spouses of Japanese nationals.[4] Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, and Brazilians account for about 69.5% of foreign residents in Japan.Guardian: Abe’s consistent refusal to consider allowing even a modest number of refugees to relocate to Japan has prompted criticism of the country’s strict policy on asylum: last year, it received a record 5,000 applications but accepted just 11 people.</comment>

<comment>"It's more of a de facto thing."No it's more of a "doesn't exist" thing. Japanese immigration forms do not request any information on the religion of the applicant. Next time try researching something instead of trusting what was forwarded to your inbox.</comment>

<comment>De facto: Being such in effect though not formally recognized. The point is, regardless, Japan has very strict immigration laws. As a result, it lacks religious and ethnic diversity.</comment>

<comment>No the point is you're posting lies and now that those lies are exposed, you spin them until they sound like the truth. Just say, "I was mistaken, they do not have a policy specifically limiting Muslim immigrants."</comment>

<comment>I said they essentially have such a policy due to their strict immigration that takes in few people from the Middle East and elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>"takes in few people from the Middle East and elsewhere."And elsewhere being defined as the rest of the world. Japan has a strict immigration policy for ALL immigrants and is in no way religiously based. Not even a little, unspoken bit is it. You're now deliberately and knowingly spreading falsehoods. Shameful.</comment>

<comment>As far as I know, there is no written law prohibiting people who are of a certain religion from immigrating to Japan. In practice, though, it appears so.70% of foreign residents in Japan consist of ethnic Japanese from Brazil, Chinese, Koreans, and Filipinos. Judging by those figures, Japan's immigration policy seems to favor Asians.Regarding religion: According to surveys carried out in 2006[1] and 2008,[2] less than 40% of the population of Japan identifies with an organised religion: around 35% are Buddhists, 3% to 4% are members of Shinto sects and derived religions, and 1% to 2.3% are Christians.Japan is lacking in Christians, but even more so, Muslims, who don't even register on the survey.--Update: Japan's Muslim population consists mainly of Indonesians and other small expatriate communities, which represent less than 0.08% of the total population, while the estimated Japanese Muslims consist of less than 0.008% of the total population.</comment>

<comment>"70% of foreign residents in Japan consist of ethnic Japanese from Brazil, Chinese, Koreans, and Filipinos. Judging by those figures, Japan's immigration policy seems to favor Asians."Good God your knowledge of history is abysmal. There's a reason they have high Brazilian and Korean foreign populations. Most of those "Brazilians" are ethnically Japanese through their parents. In the 90s, Japan needed workers but wanted to maintain their culture and make assimilation easier (their plan backfired massively FYI), and thus, opened their borders to Japanese descendants (through the 4th generation) many of whom lived in Brazil."Japan is lacking in Christians, but even more so, Muslims, who don't even register on the survey."This in no way indicates the Japanese selectively deny Muslims immigrant status.</comment>

<comment>I am agreeing with you: Japan doesn't officially selectively limit immigration based on religion. However, the effect of their immigration policy is that they have essentially limited immigration by people outside of East Asia, which has essentially led to a dearth of Muslims (Christians as well, but particularly Muslims). Japan's immigration policy overall is partially based on security concerns.So, yes, you're correct, my initial summary didn't give the correct picture. So, yes, we agree.</comment>

<comment>"Japan's immigration policy overall is partially based on security concerns."Not really. Most of their policy is built around maintaining cultural homogeneity, which, could be construed as bigoted.</comment>

<comment>Indeed it could. But Japan has security concerns -- heck, two nukes were dropped on them during WWII. That could make anyone a little jumpy.</comment>

<comment>Japan is in the midst of an economic meltdown due for the most part to an aging population.  Read the news.</comment>

<comment>The question is not whether or not Japanese are bigots, but whether or not bigotry is a bad thing</comment>

<comment>So you want open borders.  Correct?  Don't be afraid to admit it.Eliminate the immigration service and just let everyone in with equal rights to current citizens.  What can go wrong?</comment>

<comment>actually, i don't mind some semblance of quotas and certainly there is a place for border enforcement, lest people smuggle goods into the country.  but for the most part, we are going to need more immigration sooner than later.  if people can get here, let them be citizens here.  not easy for everyone to do.</comment>

<comment>So the immigrants out-breed the natives and destroy their democracy.</comment>

<comment>yeah, the native americans are pretty bummed about that.  WASPs were pretty good at concentrating them on reservations.</comment>

<comment>Who cares what this lib thinks? The important sorry of the day is why these white Republicans want to live in Mexico 2.0 via voting for rubio.</comment>

<comment>The eventual Dem nominee would love it if the GOP would nominate Cruz or Trump. Cruz for GOP nom!!</comment>

<comment>There's a difference between what you're saying and what Trump and Rubio are saying, and you know it.</comment>

<comment>Rigged.Cruz, couldn't sell donuts to cops lol.  But somehow he "won."  Ooookkkaay lol</comment>

<comment>Rigged because if Trump is a loser so is America. America is full of losers like Trump.</comment>

<comment>Who got "beat" in Iowa by a gimp like Cruz lol? </comment>

<comment>I am amazed that the nominee for the Democratic Party in 2016 is going to an Iraq War supporter.</comment>

<comment>Jesus, I'm not.  The party itself wasn't against the war, just the most idealistic parts of its base.  The party doesn't care what the base thinks any more than the GOP cares about their base.  The Dems and the GOP work for the same overall interests.</comment>

<comment>Winners tonight are:1.Cruz of course2. Bernie for making this a dead heat3. Rubio for the surge that placed him a very close third to TrumpLosers tonight are:1. Trump because as his campaign manager said yesterday "I’d love to say second place is great but it’s not" and then went on to say that the country needs winners and not losers or as that great race car driver Ricky Booby once said, "If you're not first, you're last."2. Hillary for making a winners speech when the race was still too close to call and for not flat out beating a 70 year old socialist in Iowa3. THE POLLS - all of them were wrong. Maybe now the news will start talking about issues and not these Mickey Mouse polls.</comment>

<comment>Pro vaccination Gates is Rubio's second largest donor the past 5 years....About that Microsoft 'free' voting app when only recently polled 12%¿</comment>

<comment>Hillary must be pooping herself. A tie in Iowa with Crazy Bernie?! This is great. And it took her six coin tosses. I can only imagine what she said to staff behind closed doors. And it was only 3% but is anyone really surprised Cruz won? Bruh, it's Iowa. It's the freakin evangelical homeland.Little Rube did surprise me though, did not see that coming.I'd rather have Trump then the whacked out Cruz or Rubio....or Hillary.Big win for the Bern.Also I just read that if New Hampshire looks like a tie the democratic winner will be determined by a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors and the republican winner will be determined by arm wrestling.</comment>

<comment>"Also I just read that if New Hampshire looks like a tie the democratic winner will be determined by a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors"LMAO . . . . I could not believe the coin tosses . . . . Hillary's speech looked like she was angry as heck. Let's face it. She will be forced out of the race when the FBI comes down on her and their nominee will be Biden."and the republican winner will be determined by arm wrestling"Thinking of all the guys on that stage, the winner of an arm wrestling match would be Rubio who is the athlete among them and stays in good shape. Trump is a flabby 70 year old and not sure about Christie.</comment>

<comment>Beinart is not exactly neutrally objective in this analysis</comment>

<comment>He's not even objectively neutral.</comment>

<comment>So did scumbag Ted actually get the most votes?Let's have a count: how many of you want to punch him in the face?(just 'cause)</comment>

<comment>Look, I recognize The Atlantic leans liberal, and in large part, particularly on social issues that's why I read what you write. But, I do think that you barely giving Rubio an honest take. The quotes used in this article don't really convey what you want them to devoid of the context you choose to place them in. Additionally, no voice is given to the fact that Rubio may be trying to slant his take on the issues to appeal to trump voters specifically to sabotage the insanity of Trump's campaign. Which is an idea that occurs to anyone paying any attention to anything happening politically. Please cover things intelligently. I don't ask for unbiased reporting. But I do ask for editorials that acknowledge other opionions than the one being expressed. And I make this appeal here because I believe The Atlantic to be one of the few publications that might listen.</comment>

<comment>No idea what you said because it was too long and stupid (seriously... you bored me after the first sentence).But... yadda...yaddda...yaddda.yaddda...yadda...yaddda.And I agree</comment>

<comment>"bla....blah..blah....blah..blah "– Sarah Palin</comment>

<comment>hun u make sarah palin sound like a genius</comment>

<comment>Thanks for this.  It bothers me that so many analyses of Rubio from left-leaning publications repeat:  1) he's just as bad as Trump and Cruz, but dressed up in a nicer package, 2) he's a parrot with no ideas or 3) he's a sell-out who's dropped all of his ideas in order to compete with Trump and Cruz.I'm disappointed with Rubio in many respects, and am particularly frustrated with his rhetoric about immigration and Isis (though he hasn't actually disavowed any of his previous immigration positions, just said that they need to be reexamined in light of national security concerns).  But he's pretty much unique in this field for both talking repeatedly about what the GOP can do for the working poor and for pushing for an expanded EITC and child tax credit, which would be huge for the working poor.He's articulated a vision of the country that is different from the other candidates, as a place where people don't need to be a big success in order to afford safe neighborhoods, good schools, home ownership and other components of the middle-class life.  He has some policies aimed at this goal, and I'd love to read some serious analysis of those policies.  I'd also love to read more about the ideological similarities between Paul Ryan and Rubio (I've heard them referred to as reformicons), since that partnership would probably define a Rubio presidency in terms of domestic policy.He's also a fire-breathing foreign policy interventionist and domestic spy supporter, which freaks me out.</comment>

<comment>Your points are well taken.I've never much liked Rubio, however, at one point I respected him for standing up to his party on principle regarding issues like immigration. Sadly, he seems to be walking away from his principled stands, much as McCain did in his campaign years ago.I've always felt that Rubio is an outstanding campaigner and that many people were selling that ability short in this race. He came from literally nothing to defeat a hugely popular governor when he won his Senate seat. He might very well use some of those skills to make a difference going forward in this primary race as well.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you'd read more about his policies if he ever talked about them on the campaign trail? But he's a coward and an opportunist.</comment>

<comment>Almost all of the foreign policy arguments from all the nominees have been off kilter. While the Republicans mostly vie for who will kill ISIS best, Sanders is just out of his depth, and Hillary would probably selling the country to the highest bidder; I've just kind of written off foreign policy as something to look at this go around.I do think Rubio has the most sane immigration vision of any of the candidates. The kernel of truth in Trump's anti-muslim immigration ranting is that yes, we do need to do a little extra scrutiny of these candidates and we can't just expect them to fit in. We can look at Paris and more poignantly Cologne, Germany for why that's true.</comment>

<comment>I didn't watch the debate, but what context could possibly make "shut down mosques, cafes, and websites" look better? That seems like a pretty unambiguous attack on free speech to me. Seems like he wants to go back to the Red Scare, but make it even worse.</comment>

<comment>Except Communists never played rape games on New Years.</comment>

<comment>Communists killed hundreds of millions of people; are you seriously saying they weren't as bad as Islamists?</comment>

<comment>Islamists haven't gotten access to the industrialized level of killing that Western countries have had for the past century. That said this is about people not governments. The Red Scare was about people who were Communists, not governments.</comment>

<comment>Beinart is obsessed with Rubio, and not in a good way.</comment>

<comment>Over half of the bigoted Iowa yokels voted for Hispanics.  It's clear that the Republican field is loaded while the Democrats are down to an Iraq War supporter and an octogenarian socialist.</comment>

<comment>Rubio looks like a Hollywood pool boy, but with a creepy smile.</comment>

<comment>And nice shoes.</comment>

<comment>The boots did garner an astonishing amount of attention.</comment>

<comment>Apparently, rubio's high heels are just enough to allow to see over the carnival barker's hair.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump Is the World's Most Dangerous Man</comment>

<comment>Trump is going down because, IMO, he trashed Everybody, including Fox that gave him a load of free airtime.  Eventually, when one makes enemies with everyone, it come back full circle, as they say, what goes around.......</comment>

<comment>Rubio's "victory speech" is Iowa was a bit contradictory to anyone listening. Praising up America's generous immigration policy ( really special for his Cuban parents) which allowed his huge personal success while firmly slamming that door behind him is the height of hypocrisy. Cruz winning could be good news for Democrats.</comment>

<comment>You don't understand the difference between legal and illegal immigration?We brought in the best of Cuba in the early 1960s, and we weren't yet an entitlement state.</comment>

<comment>Mass immigration and generous benefits are a terrible combination. See Germany's migrant crisis.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, we brought in all the Cubans with the Mafia ties.</comment>

<comment>Better than what Carter brought in.Cuba used to be one of the richest per capita countries in the Western Hemisphere.  You prefer Castro and forced misery except for the 1% of party cronies who simply steal aid?</comment>

<comment>Saying that you don't prefer people with strong mafia ties is not saying that you prefer something else.And speaking of strong criminal ties, wait until the media starts exploring Rubio's Brother-In-Law, who went to jail for being the biggest coke dealer in Miami in the 80's. Rubio is very close to his Brother-In-Law, brings him on-stage at his rallies, did shady things to help his Brother-In-Law get his real estate license. Oh yes that's going to be a treasure trove of fun to explore!</comment>

<comment>Uh huh.Hillary's brother. Favors thru the Foundation.Bill - pedophile island.HRC - 100+ FBI agents on her tail.Bring it!</comment>

<comment>Trump may have lost in Iowa but Trumpism won.It won among the confused, fear-motivated "we want our country back" types that cheer when Sarah Palin speaks a string of incoherent laugh-lines. In Russia, people like this vote for Vladimir Zhirinovsky.http://www.brainyquote.com/quo...Every country has these types, when they reach a critical mass, you get things like Boko Haram and Pat Robertson.</comment>

<comment>and on the Dem side a McGovern, Dukakis, or Sanders....</comment>

<comment>No, Sanders, and a large group of people who will finance his campaign with small donations.He will win over the Goldman Sachs candidates -- Cruz and Bush (who actually theoretically doesn't need to take bribes) as well as Rubio (Rubio means "blonde" in Spanish, that will serve him well among the Mexican-Americans).The Reagan/Clinton deregulatory vampire squid era is about to end.</comment>

<comment>You're a delusional Bernigan! Sanders will never get the nomination, the Dems will push Biden or Warren in if Hillary fails.</comment>

<comment>Warren is almost as good, she'd be a good VP choice.People who have "private" comment streams may be child molesters!</comment>

<comment>No Trump :(I'll just have to settle for Rubios $2500/kid tax credit. There are worse things I suppose.</comment>

<comment>You backed a loser. Because you are a loser like that loser Trump.</comment>

<comment>It's Evangelical Iowa and they came out big for Cruz and his perfectly organized ground game. Reagan, Clinton, and GHW Bush all lost the Iowa primary. Trump having no ground game there is lucky his NY moderate values came in 2nd. That never happens. </comment>

<comment>$10,000 tax credit is losing? Maybe I should have some more kids and lose some more.</comment>

<comment>Tax credits encourage irresponsible childbirths from the poor. It's about our country, not more welfare.</comment>

<comment>No. A basic per child income encourages irresponsibility. You have to pay enough in taxes to claim a child tax credit.</comment>

<comment>I know I do taxes. The child tax credit and Earned Income Tax credit is widely abused bigtime. The income threshold is quite low. And idiot parents have unwanted pregnancies to get a little tax credit. Say no to welfare babies!http://www.politico.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>ummm whatyou think someones actually making money off of a child tax credit?  How does that work exactly.  Having a child is going to cost you more than 1000 dollars in food alone</comment>

<comment>It's widely abused and yes idiot people have children for ALL the welfare given. It's in many forms and this credit and EITC is a part of it. Long -term Welfare recipient parents should be encouraged or forced not to have babies. It's cruel! --look at the DCS for abusive parenting info - lots of poverty.</comment>

<comment>People claim it when they shouldn't' sure.but give me some evidence thats there's any motivation to have kids just to claim a tax credit that's a fraction of what having a child actually costs</comment>

<comment>I'm not arguing with people who can't use common sense. I 100% know with obtaining CPE credits for helping the poor with their taxes. It's big with Hispanics too. It's ALL the child based welfare - there are many forms of it and it adds up...TANF & WIC. We need to put a stop to the long-term poor having multiple children! Look at DCS reports.</comment>

<comment>That's rich coming from someone who supports a party that hates abortion and birth control.</comment>

<comment>I don't. I encourage abortion in irresponsible pregnancies, esp after reading the DCS reports. And birth control? Duh, of course. Why do you assume all non-liberals are all Evangelicals, anti-abortion, anti-SSM.I personally hate abortion, but we have too many idiot people nowadays. </comment>

<comment>Were you a tax credit? Ask.</comment>

<comment>Who cares. I had good parents. No multiple welfare siblings. No child abuse in bad environment. </comment>

<comment>but poor people who claim the credit must be doing it just for the welfaregot it</comment>

<comment>Go away.  I've explained it 3x in great detail and you come back with that. Whether it's intentional or not, we don't encourage welfare parents. It's cruel. I feel the same about animals not being neutered. It's cruel! Do you not have a heart or not informed. Read the DCS reports. </comment>

<comment>You care. Apparently. Were your parents influenced by the hope of a tax break?</comment>

<comment>Rubio won't go far because of his position on amnesty for illegals.</comment>

<comment>Trump's a loser. Go figure.</comment>

<comment>Possible scenario: trump fades, Cruz rises, establishment unites behind Rubio, Rubio get the nomination, nut job voters aren't enthusiastic. GOP loses, but establishment still in power.Alternative: Cruz survives New Hampshire, does well in  south, gets nomination, loses badly, GOP in disarrayAlternative: trump....  Umm no.</comment>

<comment>A Rubio/Kasich ticket would have a very good chance of winning, actually.Republicans would likely have two key swing state of Ohio and Florida.</comment>

<comment>Kasich seems to sane, and too moderate, to agree to be Rubio's running mate.</comment>

<comment>Kasich is moderate by Cruz standards; he is a solidly conservative governor of a non-liberal (but not deep red obviously)  state.  But sane - yes.Why do you think Rubio is insane though?  He's a lightweight who says stuff his sponsors want and teach him to say.  A GWB type.  A GWB with a Cheney as VP and mentor was dangerous; a GWB type with a Kasich as VP and mentor, not so much.</comment>

<comment>This is the same Kasich who got less than 2% of the vote? Or was it less than 1%? And who was endorsed by the NYT? hard to see the GOP base rallying for that</comment>

<comment>Kasich would deliver the key swing state of Ohio and might help in places like PA.    Kasich's poll numbers mean he won't win the nomination but that wouldn't prevent him from picked as VP.</comment>

<comment>There are some subtle differences between being anti-war and parroting the nativist jingoism spewing from the likes of Trump and Rubio.Need any more proof that the electorate are distracted lemmings?</comment>

<comment>Rubio can go far if his plethora of lies and ever-present chameleon nature aren't spotted often and successfully challenged.</comment>

<comment>maybe when running against other republicans but he's a piker on lying compared to Hillary</comment>

<comment>The most telling thing about the strength of Rubio's campaign potential can be seen from the extremely simplistic and angry comments about him from people both on the right and the left.  He has legitimate potential to consolidate and unite much of the Republican party, which would be very dangerous for the Democrats considering how weak Hillary and Bernie are as general election candidates go.</comment>

<comment>Once again Beinart demonstrates that he knows nothing about the character of America.</comment>

<comment>That's a very strange take Peter.A 74 year-old socialist just tied Hillary in IO, and your instinct is write your weekly lame hit piece on Republicans.But, partisan hacks gotta partisan hack.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is flip flopping only to pull Trump people. Wake up!! No more candidates beholden to big donors!Hillary was the loser, maybe/almost losing to a socialist. Nobody should want a 3rd term Obama w/Hillary. She will destroy America---3rd world country style.Close the border, deport illegals, refuse refugees, and bring jobs back. Trump pulls NH, SC!!</comment>

<comment>I am by no means a Hillary supporter.  Truth be told, I can't stand her.  But a Hillary presidency would not "destroy America".  Stop being hyperbolic.</comment>

<comment>No but do you look forward to 4 more years of gridlock?</comment>

<comment>Gridlock has traditionally been a GOP electoral strategy.  As the anti-government party, they stand to benefit from gridlock.  The GOP is not a governing party.  It is an obstructionist party.</comment>

<comment>No its a check and balance party TC . They have kept Obama from F ing up even more than he has.</comment>

<comment>No, it is not.  Go look at filibuster statistics since 2007.  McConnell's use of it has been unprecedented and it has caused damage to the Senate.  In the midst of a financial crisis, McConnell's first priority was to make sure Obama was a one term president.Obama was elected by a majority of people in this country not once, but twice, and therefore has legitimacy.</comment>

<comment>He was elected  POTUS  not KING and hes screwed up so much. Thank goodness for the Constitution and check and balances</comment>

<comment>This is hyperbolic twaddle.By any reasonable measure, the country is in better shape than it was in January 2009.  Would you like to revisit what happened last decade?And by the way, find me the language in the Constitution that allows for filibustering.</comment>

<comment>Yes it would. Quit being naive. Some of us have higher standards. </comment>

<comment>If you had higher standards, you wouldn't be for Trump.  Authoritarian followers have no standards and are easily led.</comment>

<comment>Trump matches all my beliefs. Better than anyone I've voted for. And there are like 10 issues. I'm a moderate conservative that wants no more 'free trade' nonsense, open borders, Corp inversion, tax loopholes, refugees, poor military and gvmt waste. </comment>

<comment>Trump has beliefs now?</comment>

<comment>Only Trump is not a "moderate conservative", Sarah.  And Trump is one of the beneficiaries of the carried interest loophole.  Do you really think a GOP Congress and a President Trump is going to close that and alienate their donor base?  No.But if you're against government waste, then why don't you look at the Pentagon and see what you're getting for your money.</comment>

<comment>They spend the $$ so poorly it's sickening. It's about spending frugally and smarter. Not just aimlessly spending.</comment>

<comment>If Trump shot someone outside his penthouse on 5th avenue, would you still support him? (He thinks you would and is gratified by the thought.)</comment>

<comment>Next up, Donald Trump and the Donald Trump dancers perform the Trump Thump. Tonight's forecast calls for partial Trumpiness with occasional light Trumping. Tomorrow on Good Morning Trumerica Donald Trump trumps his trumpiness with in house reporter Tara Trump Trump TRUMP!!!!  For Christ's sake now you have Trump infecting Rubio with "Trumpism".  Really give it up already, it's sickening.</comment>

<comment>Tear the roof off, we're gonna tear the roof off the mother, suckerTear the roof off the suckerYou've got a real type of thing going down, gettin' downThere's a whole lot of Donald going roundOw, we want the TrumpGive up the TrumpOw, we need the TrumpWe gotta have that Trump</comment>

<comment>Beinart is basically correct.Obama has ceded his presidency to Trump as Carter ceded a presidency to the Ayatollah of Iran.Trump is not going to be president, but neither was the Ayatollah.</comment>

<comment>Rubio's on the rise - good news at last.Sanders' on the rise - also good news. Why? Because if this hard-core commie wins the nomination, his chances against Rubio will be much weaker than Hillary's. I mean, Americans are not that crazy to elect Comrade Bernie.Rubio for POTUS!</comment>

<comment>Oh Lord, Trump Evangelical version and Trump Florida version. Wonderful</comment>

<comment>Chances the GOP will have a very strong contender (Marco) look much better now. Which explains Mr. Beinart's dissatisfaction and anxiety.</comment>

<comment>Trump will likely win NH.  NH is not dominated by Christian fundamentalists the way Iowa is.  Still, a L is a L, and it is hilarious to see the spin.</comment>

<comment>And who are you voting for TC?</comment>

<comment>Probably no one.  I dislike all of them.  Trump is a demagogue, Cruz is a Christian fanatic and an ideologue, Sanders is a socialist, and Clinton has no moral center and is driven by greed.  None of these people resonate with my small c conservative sensibilities.</comment>

<comment>Whom do you consider to be the least bad?</comment>

<comment>That is a difficult question to answer.  But I'll do so honestly: Clinton.It's because of stories like this --http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2...-- that I distrust her.  Her vote in support of the Iraq War and her hand in destabilizing Libya would be, in a saner election season, disqualifying.  With that said, however, she is the least likely to radically upend the status quo.  And it pains me to write that, man.  It really does.</comment>

<comment>I prefer Kasich.  I don't take Rubio's warmongering statements very seriously because they doesn't seem to come from conviction.  If Rubio is the candidate and he has a seasoned, decent VP candidate (vs. a Dick Cheney type) he could be acceptable.Hillary with a Republican congress would be mostly harmless; it would just be gridlock.  Except for the Supreme Court nominations...</comment>

<comment>I respect that line of reasoning.  Kasich is not an ideologue and he's got experience both as governor and in the Congress.  The fact that he did the Medicaid expansion in Ohio even though he was philosophically opposed to it showed both grace and courage.</comment>

<comment>And who was the main person egging the country into the Iraq War - Dick Cheney.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  If Rubio has a Cheney-type as VP to guide him, the country will face disaster.  If he has a Kasich in such a position, it ought to be a decent presidency.  Rubio, like the George W Bush, is kind of an empty vessel.</comment>

<comment>61% - share of the GOP vote to anti-establishment candidates (Cruz, Trump & Dr. Carson)The GOP talk is all about coalescing around the establishment/anti-Trump candidate. What happens if the anti-establishment bloc coalesces around a single candidate?</comment>

<comment>Good point.</comment>

<comment>Spin it however you like. Peter B., Trump lost.</comment>

<comment>Despite the recent terrorist attacks, and the orgy of lewd and violent sexual misconduct, associated with Muslims, that has thrown Europe into turmoil, "progressives" remain frozen in their "welcoming culture" modality.   The American People have rightly had their fill of this simpering exercise in self-congratulation.</comment>

<comment>Lol!</comment>

<comment>I've never read so much nonsense as I read this article!</comment>

<comment>A complete misreading of Rubio's success last night. Rubio tried the Trump rhetoric for the past 6 weeks and it got him nowhere. In just the past few days in Iowa, both on the trail and in his commercials, he changed course, talking about being the candidate who will "unify the Republican Party."That's the message that worked. Rubio is running as the anti-Trump.</comment>

<comment>Hope GOP will come to its senses and nominate Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Screw Rubio and his support of H1-B outsourcing to replace American workers. Although a Trump supporter - I'll vote for Bernie over a traitor like Rubio any day.</comment>

<comment>Ewww spud!!!!!</comment>

<comment>If you support H1-B - you have touched the third rail on the Spud track.</comment>

<comment>You'll vote for Dems anyway, so what's your point?</comment>

<comment>Trump will crush Rubio in NH and SC like the cardboard pint container of milk that he is. Any questions?</comment>

<comment>Your man made a mistake picking a fight with Megyn Kelly and spending more money on hats that on getting actual voters to the polls. </comment>

<comment>Nobody cares about Megyn Kelly. Trump will do fine going forward.</comment>

<comment>I care !!! shes hot AND smart.</comment>

<comment>She would surely feel the wrath of my tongue in a one-on-one, but the joust would not be verbal.</comment>

<comment>But, ducking the debate was stupid.</comment>

<comment>Wrong, dude.  Fox insulted a candidate in an unprecedented way - they needed to be stood up too, and Trump is a leader.</comment>

<comment>how did they insult him?by having one of their top anchors moderate the debate?</comment>

<comment>You didn't read their little press release?</comment>

<comment>We'll see.  If Trump underperforms polls there like he did in Iowa he's in serious trouble.It's too late to build a ground game and he's got diddly.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is a crafty politician. Since immigration reform imploded on him, he's done a good job of tapping into political currents while not flip-flopping. It's how he's managed to be both the angry outsider and party unifier at the same time. Notice his "victory" speech was filled with a lot of glittering patriotism and few policy proposals.</comment>

<comment>It's all words. His true colors were shown with Gang of 8. And uniting the party means -let the lobbyists and big Donors run the country. </comment>

<comment>He simply cannot attract Trump's voters without becoming Trump. And that, my friend, is the Devil coming to collect Faust.</comment>

<comment>If he were of Mexican descent it would be easier to support him. I feel that addressing our self defeating immigration system plays a huge role in getting the voters' ear. He might be unifying conservatives but, on the long run, Rubio's policies have to help this nation. My hesitation, does he believe in what he says or is he just another politician? I think, at the end, it would easier to vote for him than for Trump but we owe Trump pointing out HUGE challenges in this nation."Our immigration system, designed primarily to reunite families, is an outdated relic of the last century. This system worked for much of the twentieth century, when we had no shortage of low-skill, middle-income jobs and the government safety net was still fairly limited. But today we have low to nonexistent growth, a shortage of good jobs and a massive web of needs-based programs." RubioWe need a good immigration system and passing amnesty will bring in A HUGE social problem, more division, more challenges in education, labor, unifying values and norms that ease nation building. BUT he was willing to pass amnesty with our still anachronistic immigration system.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is willing to blur any position he takes so that he can shift to where ever the next peak in the distribution of opinion happens to be. The ur-example of this is his claim that he is a settled Catholic who attends Evangelical church service on Saturday.In a study of the Republican voters, Matthew MacWilliams finds that Trump voters are uniquely identified as those high on the scale for authoritarianism using a standard set of test questions. His data shows that Rubio supporters do not share this attribute. This suggests a very different picture of Rubio support and a different potential coalition in the general election, one much closer to the usual Republican profile than that attracted to Trump.http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappbl...</comment>

<comment>The Democrats dominate the voting block that has a high school  education or less.And – If you don't think Hilary has taken every side of every issue, you are truly  delusional. She takes money from Goldman Sachs, but she is really against Wall Street. She has been both for and against the TPP.She voted for the Iraq war, and now she's against it. </comment>

<comment>Wait a minute, Hillary explained her Wall Street loot during the debates - it was her patriotic response to 9/11.https://www.washingtonpost.com...CLINTON: So I represented New York, and I represented New York on 9/11 when we were attacked. Where were we attacked? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is. I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild. That was good for New York. It was good for the economy, and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country.</comment>

<comment>She is truly a patriot. </comment>

<comment>Are you saying you want money out of politics? I thought your party believes money is speech?</comment>

<comment>It that's all you have, that's very weak. </comment>

<comment>Really? Why not admit that the Republican Party floats on money "donated" in return for legislation and admit that Republicans in Congress and on the Supreme Court have made sure that money will have total access to the political process.Are you in favour of campaign finance reform that would limit donations and expenses to some modest limit-- say 250$?</comment>

<comment>You didn't want WTC rebuilt?</comment>

<comment>You dufus- the Federal government has nothing to do with the rebuilding of the WTC.</comment>

<comment>"Just days after the events of September 11, 2001, President Bush and Congress promised that $20 billion in federal aid would be provided to help New York City recover from the attack." In fact the actual amount of federal aid  was a bit over 11 billionIf you would just try to find out things rather than simply assuming you already have all the answers, and not insult people, you life might be better.http://www.ibo.nyc.ny.us/ibore...</comment>

<comment>You said the WTC, dumbass.</comment>

<comment>"Of the $8.0 billion in Liberty Bonds authorized by the federal government to encourage commercial and residential development, just over $700 million remains available for commercial projects. These bonds, allocated to the Port Authority for Tower 1 and shops at the World Trade Center site, must be used by December 2012."You really can't read at all.Did the federal government have anything to do with rebuilding? Were you wrong?</comment>

<comment>Only a moron like yourself would think that Hillary Clinton's long history of bribes from Wall Street investment banks is somehow excused by the fact that she was a Senator during 9/11.</comment>

<comment>Were you wrong on federal aid to the WTC?</comment>

<comment>Rebuilding the Port Authority, a NYC government office, and helping shops displaced from the WTC collapse is not the same thing as funding the building of the Freedom Towers.</comment>

<comment>"The supertall structure has the same name as the North Tower of the original World Trade Center, which was completely destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre (6.5 ha) World Trade Center site, on the site of the original 6 World Trade Center."" These bonds, allocated to the Port Authority for Tower 1 and shops at the World Trade Center site, must be used by December 2012."</comment>

<comment>You just repeated the same false assumption. Again rebuilding the Port Authority and helping shops displace by the twin towers collapse is not the same thing as government funding going to rebuild a privately owned building.</comment>

<comment>And dont forget  she is for women who are victims of sexual abuse should be heard EXCEPT if its her husband doing it.</comment>

<comment>I am not suggesting that Rubio is wrong to change positions to gain votes, it is what politicians are expected to do in catch all parties with a variety of opinions in their electorate. (Downs, "An Economic Theory of Politics"  noticed this a while ago). I am simply pointing out that his supporters are not the same as Trumps, according to the evidence of the study I cited. They are not particularly authoritarian.Nor is it a negative characteristic to change in light of new evidence.  Rubio believed a compromise on immigration policy could pass Congress and improve on the status quo, but realized that was not possible.  I regard this as expected behaviour in his context.</comment>

<comment>This just proves that Trump's support has less to do with the man and more to do with his actual views. Banning Muslims, deporting Mexicans, etc. This is what the Republican base wants to hear. Trump said it first, but Rubio finally figured out he just needed to say it too.</comment>

<comment>Trump just got 25% of the vote.  A 74-year-old socialist just got 50% of the vote.The Republican base looks at the disaster in Germany with the migrant crisis, and they do not want that to repeat in the United States.The Democratic base thinks that 4 rich people can pay for freebies for the rest of  the population.  </comment>

<comment>I% of taxpayers reported 19% of earnings...top .1% of wealthiest own as much as the bottom 90%. Inequality now is greater than any time since the beginning of the 19th century and it is increasing.</comment>

<comment>The top 5% of earners pay about 70% of the federal income taxes.That is greater than their share of income.The bottom 60% get more net federal benefits than they pay in taxes.And, a person who makes $100K pays 4x more for his Medicare benefit that one making $25K.Innumerate  lefties do not own calculators, and have no idea how progressive the tax code already is. </comment>

<comment>I am aware of that.  My point is that wealth accumulates in the US at an increasing rate (inequality is increasing) even though there are social transfers and a progressive tax system.That is because there are ways to escape taxation that are built into the tax law that are only available to the very rich--they put them there.The bottom line is that there is room to tax at the top and essentially leave the very rich very rich, and the rich rich.TARP paid for the banks that provide their mortgages.</comment>

<comment>This highlights that the people who are most screwed are the upper middle class people whose earnings come from their incomes rather than from investments (physicians, engineers, etc.).  The top 2% to 10%. What about the top 1% or top .1%? Do Democrats have a point when it comes to their clams about this group?</comment>

<comment>Most screwed? Your assumption is that well off people don't get more from government programs than others.  They do. For example, medical facilities and education are subsidized and engineers often work for companies that depend on government contracts.</comment>

<comment>Physicians get paid for work they perform, and most engineers work for private companies.  Unionized public service workers are the ones most living off the government.  The highest tax burden seems to fall on the upper middle class.</comment>

<comment>The work couldn't be done without the government paying for the subsides that make it possible. The private companies in the defense industry take cost plus contracts that are without effective competition and rely on tax breaks to their employers.Unionized government workers provide services.As I said, the tax on the upper middle class is compensated by the greater value of the services that protect and defend their property and generate the demand for their services within companies and markets that are subsidized in numerous ways.</comment>

<comment> "The work couldn't be done without the government paying for the subsides that make it possible A lot of physicians don't take medicare/medicaid patients.  Physicians certainly don't get more from the government than do teachers, many state or federal workers, or people in private companies that get federal contracts.  Yet they get taxed at a much higher rate than all of those people. "The private companies in the defense industry take cost plus contracts that are without effective competition and rely on tax breaks to their employers. Most engineers don't work in the defense industry.</comment>

<comment>It is difficult to see the pathways that government benefits take to reach each person because many of the effects are indirect. Modern medical practice and research could not exist without the framework of laws and subsidies to health care facilities such as hospitals and medical schools, or without agencies such as the fda, cdc and national institutes of health.As for engineers in private companies, they benefit from the corporate tax structures that help maximise profits for their employer.If you are looking for a summary evidence, then note that the upper middle classes of OECD countries live comfortably with higher marginal tax rates.If you are OK with the US having the greatest inequality and lowest social mobility of any advanced country then look for lower taxes as your litmus test for your vote.</comment>

<comment>They have a stupid point.  You can raise rates - but unless all of the civilized countries develop an ironclade wealth tax - the rich can pick how and when to realize both income and capital gains.</comment>

<comment>They are doing that now. It made Romney a billionaire. The acceleration in the growth of wealth of the 1% came as a result of tax cuts and other changes in policy since 1980 --it had nothing to do with change in tax policy in the EU.</comment>

<comment>So, Zuckerburg starts Facebook and is now worth billions.   That has everything to do with the creative ferment from the tech sector and trends in advertising.Jeff Bezos starts Amazon and is worth $50B+.  He took advantage of the changes in shopping patterns because he built the best transaction interface, gets a bunch of product to your door in 1-2 days and has the widest selection of goods.Also, a two billion Chinese and Indians decided to participate in the Industrial revolution and the Internet's ability to zip cognitive work anywhere.You lefties think that it's 1952 and everything begins and ends with government.What is your plan to force Zuckerberg to sell his FB stock or Bezos to sell his AMZN stock and send you a check?</comment>

<comment>and the top 1% pays more cpaital gains taxes.  the top .1% earns their money almost entirely from capital gains as well..Just quoting income taxes is misleading</comment>

<comment>Romney's effective tax rate was 14%.</comment>

<comment>Don't understand your point.Most of the millionaires in the U.S. are self-made.And - even Obama conceded that raising cap gains taxes results in lower tax revenues to the fisc, but he didn't care because fairness.</comment>

<comment>"Trump just got 25% of the vote.  A 74-year-old socialist just got 50% of the vote."I'm not sure what you think you're saying with this. But whatever it is, it probably isn't supported by that quoted bit.</comment>

<comment>No, the Democratic base thinks we could pay for a lot of things if we stopped giving tax breaks to businesses and rich people who don't need them. The Republican is a bunch of angry white guys who think America was at its best in the 1850s when women couldn't vote and black people had no rights.</comment>

<comment>What's your definition of a "tax break?"Anything below a 95% rate?Funny how you think YOU are entitled to other people's money that they earned.And - this:The Republican (sic) is a bunch of angry white guys who think America was at its best in the 1850s when women couldn't vote and black people had no rights.It always gets back to gender and race identity doesn't it?No - Republicans believe in freedom and in rewarding success.  You guys believe in government control, division by skin color/gender and in confiscation.</comment>

<comment>Tell me why capital gains is taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. If you actually believed in rewarding hard work like you claim, then you would be calling for a reduction in income taxes instead of the estate tax or capital gains.And if you're really upset with receiving other people's money, then tell me why your party continues to support subsidies for private industry. In other words, you support corporate welfare.You guys are the ones hung up on race and gender. The only reason you oppose abortion rights is because you want to be able to control women. The stuff about valuing life is just BS. You support capital punishment and war so clearly preserving life isn't important to you. As for race, your party talks about deporting brown people and you constantly ask the black President to prove he was born here.</comment>

<comment>I don't think anyone is voting FOR Rubio reallyHe's just the only one who's seen as a viable alternative to the demagogue nutcase Trump and the utterly repulsive Cruz.the real telling time will be when the field narrows where do those supporters go.  I doubt Trump is getting much more than he has now</comment>

<comment>Bush, Kasich, and Christie will now be under enormous pressure to drop out and throw their support behind Rubio.</comment>

<comment>I have to agree- Although I would marginally prefer Rubio to either Cruz or Trump, I've been startled by some of the rhetoric coming from Rubio in the last few months. He does not sound "moderate" in any sense of the term.</comment>

<comment>When the ground is shifting to looney land, you've gotta shift with it a little bit.</comment>

<comment>Even if Rubio gets the nom, Republicans are still the White Party. Rubio appeals more to the I-can't-be-racist-I-voted-for-the-Cuban White suburbanites than he does to actual minorities. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You should maybe go through homeboy's comment history. You're not telling him anything he doesn't already believe.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. I think it's a good thing Rubio will boost white turnout for Republicans. </comment>

<comment>If there's no Trump, I will vote for the most tax cuttingest candidate when the R primary swings round to my state.</comment>

<comment>Those racists in South Carolina have an Indian governor and a black senator. Time to find a new smear. </comment>

<comment>That's one of yours, dude.</comment>

<comment>Are there any racists in SC? Do any racists vote Republican? Or is that a complete fiction?</comment>

<comment>Republican elites have done a great job recruiting diverse candidates in states where they could literally put a cow on the ballot and win. Their electorate remains the same.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you're the racist...</comment>

<comment>Racialist, race realist, alt right... I've been called it all. I consider myself a 90s Buchanan paleoconservative.</comment>

<comment>The two aren't mutually exclusive, and neither really have to do with the other. So congratulations, you're a paleoconservative, you're still being racist.</comment>

<comment>Coming from a liberal the term means absolutely nothing.</comment>

<comment>lol, assumptions just make you look stupid.</comment>

<comment>Libertarians and liberals consider so much stuff racist that the term loses all meaning.</comment>

<comment>lmao, keep trying there, this might just be fun to see you keep guessing "what I am."</comment>

<comment>It's quite clear you're a troll, but I'm sure you think you're some special kind of snowflake.</comment>

<comment>Oh! That's a good one, never heard that before. I'll admit, seeing your "jimmies" rustled over being called out for being a racist has been quite amusing. But really, you've only been trolling yourself by resting every argument you've made at this point on ignorance based ad hominem.</comment>

<comment>As someone else observed, in Iowa 68% of Republicans voted for a black of Latino.  99% of Democrats voted for a white person over age 65.</comment>

<comment>It's like some bizarro affirmative action. Negative Action?</comment>

<comment>What a load of horse manure. Don't cherry pick your data.How many Dems in Iowa voted for an African American in 2008 and 2012? And how many Republicans?Both parties clearly have an issue with nominating people of color. Dems shroud and candy-coat their biases, while Republicans hide them behind other issues like crime and social safety nets.</comment>

<comment>What a superficial, bizarre, and idiotic analysis...so typical of Mr. Beinhart. Every time I see one of his essays, I'm astonished that he keeps getting published at The Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>Well, Trump did not deliver the first round knock-out blow America hoped for.  I expected the natural born Canadian Ted Cruz to win Iowa.  Iowa retail politics is a great place to engage with grass roots evangelical voters who love a snake charming social conservative like Cruz.  It is axiomatic that these candidates never win the nomination.  You cannot repeat this style of campaign on a national scale and, let's face it, Cruz has NO NO NO chance in blue states.  Marco Rubio is the LEAST qualified candidate ever to run, he barely has a talent for memorizing talking points, and his open border amnesty "Gang of 8" record is something that he cannot hide from.  If Rubio gets second place in New Hampshire, then he might be viable.  This is doubtful.  Rubio is a war-monger, to boot.</comment>

<comment>Deux...serious question.  What are you for?</comment>

<comment>Better question would be what am I against?  I am against phony donor class puppet empty-suits like Rubio.  Cruz is an ideologue.  He hides behind the bible and this is annoying and false.   He has no experience that qualifies him to be president, and he is emotionally unstable.  I am against a corrupt media and elites in general who simply refuse to report the truth about open borders, and who demonize a candidate like Trump for doing so.   I am opposed to dynasties, so Bush and Hillary are my biggest fears.   I am against communism, so there goes Sanders.</comment>

<comment>I reject the idea a slick-talking eye doctor should be our president.  I love commerce and unlike our corrupt and lying and hypocritical Marxist media I think a business executive would be an ideal candidate.  Trump is a business icon, not an eye doctor.</comment>

<comment>So Fiorina?</comment>

<comment>"...I reject the idea a slick-talking eye doctor should be our president...".He's too busy just holding on to Damascus right now.</comment>

<comment>I can't believe nobody else caught this gem.  All the upvotes to you, spud.</comment>

<comment>If you look at what he's against above, I can understand and respect that.  But in my view, a Trump presidency would do more harm than good.</comment>

<comment>He may be a business "icon" whatever that is, but he is not a particularly successful businessperson. If you'd inherited $50 million, you'd probably be rich too.</comment>

<comment>You learn towards paleoconservatism.  I can respect that quite a bit.</comment>

<comment>For the subset of Republicans who are Obama fans, this is a winning argument. Unfortunately, this subset is not especially large.</comment>

<comment>Is Rubio black?   We elected Obama because he was articulate and black.</comment>

<comment>And not because he was articulate and Latino?</comment>

<comment>Huh?  Were Latinos slaves in the USA?  I did not know that.</comment>

<comment>So we elected Obama because he was articulate and formerly a slave?</comment>

<comment>We wanted a black president.</comment>
