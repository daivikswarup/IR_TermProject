<comment>Do they kill 800k like the liberal sacrament of abortion? Sociopathic progs.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I am not interested in your abortion pørn fetish. Contact your local bigot party.</comment>

<comment>800k dead babies should be celebrating. Not cheering it is bigotry!</comment>

<comment>Not interested in your abortion pørn fetish.Why do you hate women so much?</comment>

<comment>He's under the impression that a woman magically becomes a mindless incubator when they become pregnant.</comment>

<comment>not the right question girlwhy are you so afraid of men?</comment>

<comment>Abortion kills 0 people. </comment>

<comment>but a lot of lives</comment>

<comment>Meh, you guys have an odd concept of 'life'.You thought Terri Schiavo was alive, when she'd lost 40% of her brain mass.</comment>

<comment>I don't think there is much odd about the standard scientific definitions of life and death, it's pretty cut and dry.Was Terri Schiavo dead, read the definition and tell me."Death is the permanent termination of all vital functions or life processes in an organism or cell."you may have different beliefs but the science is clear.</comment>

<comment>So, let me get this straight, because someone's tissue was kept animated via machinery (But not the brain, of course, which was degraded beyond repair)... they were alive?Really?That's what you want to hang your hat on? Let me breathe a sigh of relief that people who think the way you do are literally dying off. :)</comment>

<comment>Again, I'm not arguing your beliefs about when life begins and ends or what is a life worth living,  I am just pointing out that what you consider odd is actually the scientific consensus that has been around for a long time.</comment>

<comment>The "dying off" meme is repulsive, Blogvader. It always comes across as a wish disguised as an observation. In terms of argument, the meme is literally gratuitous: If your point of view prevails because your opponent dies, you didn't win the argument.</comment>

<comment>if so they then kill for good reasonTime for more right wing values</comment>

<comment>Show a little class....</comment>

<comment>Resist the immediate temptation to indulge in secular hagiography of power in the immediate aftermath of death.Scalia's prime was in the 1980s (appellate and SCOTUS) and 1990s, sharply waning after 2000.  His stupendous creation (albeit interlocutory and dicta) of a constitutional right to an unclouded election victory in the interlocutory phase of Bush v Gore stunned many of his until-then admirers that his textualism was more foil than substance. I am not sure his influence fully recovered.But you depend on people forgetting this episode.</comment>

<comment>people won't forget the episode but they will remember that the US Supreme Court shut down an out of control Florida supreme court and forced them to follow the law.</comment>

<comment>Speaking as a Republican from the dividend-collecting wing (not to be confused with the Jaysus anti-abortion anti-gay wing, or the neocon wing), I am not even slightly embarrassed to say that the *only* intellectually robust defense of what we did in Florida in 2000 is "Screw you liberal wankers; there's nothing you can do about it; I've got something you can suck on right here."Luckily, this is all the defense we need, because it's air tight. </comment>

<comment>Scalia was never the jurist that conservatives made him out to be. Say what you will about Rehnquist or Thomas if you disagreed with them, but they were careful not just to blow up a rule they didn't like, but replace it with a clear, consistent standard of jurisprudence that you could apply in later cases. Scalia was so eager to beat on liberal strawmen that he'd leave the law completely incomprehensible in his wake. And there were not a few times where he darn near invented the facts he needed to reach his conclusion. As a Supreme Court Justice, I'm not sure there exists a more damning indictment.</comment>

<comment>What in the world? Have you ever read a Thomas opinion?  He generally writes brief little dissenting endnotes that would..blow up an entire area of law without even remotely putting forth something to replace it.</comment>

<comment>How can one not be embarrassed by the GOP presidential nominees, except maybe Rubio and Kasich?</comment>

<comment>When Rubio and Kasich are the "except maybe's" that's terrifying.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>He had some sort of God complex and the  belief that he is messenger of God..  It would be his pro gun right wing followers that made him sound bigger than his intellect in my opinion like "Being There".Lately he sounded that he had even more sever cognition issues but online host of trolls would defend it no matter what nonsense he would utter ..  My guess was that he had mini strokes or Alzheimer kicking in..</comment>

<comment>anti-abortion folks are so sweet</comment>

<comment>Well, if it's true that a man is judged by the quality of his enemies, it appears that I'm in trouble! ;)Thanks for playing.</comment>

<comment>He's all good, did his job, did it well, loved his family, loved his country, loved the law.</comment>

<comment>Totally.Provided you were Catholic (not protestant), and not gay, a woman, a minority, or poor.</comment>

<comment>he was more of a 'Content of you character guy' and what the law says.</comment>

<comment>He decidedly was not.He was a "your beliefs go against my personal religious beliefs, so it's a-okay to let secular law punish you" kind of guy.</comment>

<comment>no, he did his job.Free people are free to pass any law they want as long as it is consistent with the constitution.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure which Scalia you were watching, but his record's there for those of us who can acknowledge the truth, and the truth is we're better off without such a hateful and vile man on the SCOTUS.</comment>

<comment>So, Terry, you won't mind if the local chapter of Satanists wants to do the invocation at your city council meetings?  Or hand out coloring books to kids?  Or set up a holiday display featuring Baphomet?Christians get to do all of these things, so Satanists should too, right?Scalia didn't think so. To him, religious freedom meant Christian supremacy.  This is why the masses are so happy he died today.</comment>

<comment>No, he didn't. His job was to adjust to a society that didn't hate gays, women, and minorities. He failed wholeheartedly. </comment>

<comment>uh, stating that gay people are predators who should stay far away from children is certainly not based on facts. Stating that convict on death row should be executed based on the brutality of the crime and never considering that he may indeed be innocent (he was) was also not based on facts.</comment>

<comment>are you sure that's what he said, a lot of time he's making a different point like when he said...“What? It’s up to me to identify deserving minorities? What about pederasts? What about child abusers?”he was simply saying that the laws like the 14th amendment list out those protected, it is not up to judges to add to the list.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it depended upon the Constitutional interpretation of individual cases. Being poor, a minority, a woman, etc does not give you a trump card over the rule of law. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>He was a bigot..</comment>

<comment>no, he was not</comment>

<comment>Yeah, he was.And he was proud of it, sadly.</comment>

<comment>How was he abigot? FOr thinking blacks didn't need standards lowered for them like liberals who believe them inferior?</comment>

<comment>How was he a bigot?Really?REALLY?I'll make it easy for you, Penguin.</comment>

<comment>you don't understand how people make legal arguments. He looked at the Constitution and found no specific protection of homosexual activity and said, write laws to protect or discourage the activity since people are free</comment>

<comment>That is completely false, on all fronts.Ever head of Lawrence vs Texas?</comment>

<comment>great example of a local law that was not in direct conflict with the constitution, so he thought it should stand.  It did not mean that he agreed with the law, just that laws should reflect the values of the population unless they were in conflict with the Constitution  (that was his job).</comment>

<comment>Er... really?You don't think it violated the 14th Amendment? (Equal Protection Clause)The SCOTUS disagrees with you.</comment>

<comment>do you understand that all  dissents disagree with the SCOTUS majority?It was well argued. not bigoted just Constitutional</comment>

<comment>He was bigoted and that is why he was making those arguments.</comment>

<comment>Yep. He could also find no allowance for women to be president cause the Constitution doesn't allow it.</comment>

<comment>Now THAT was an interesting search !(and link technique also, btw)</comment>

<comment>I notice that you are having plenty of fun with the "people who are willfully ignorant."There will be a lot more of them around places like this now that Scalia croaked.</comment>

<comment>Nice! Maybe technology can help make the world a better place!</comment>

<comment>Here is the example of his  bigoted mind is perceived to be and the size of his ego...""Responding to Pope Francis’s suggestion that the Pope is not capable of judging gays, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia contacted the Vatican today to say that he would be “more than happy” to help the Pontiff do so.“If he’s having trouble judging homosexuals, well, then I’m his man,” Scalia told reporters after making his offer. “I have over a quarter century of professional experience.”Justice Scalia said that he was sympathetic to Pope Francis’s difficulty in judging gays, but added, “Once he spends a few weeks watching the master at work, I’m sure he’ll get the hang of it.”“I wasn’t great at judging homosexuals my first year in the job, either,” he said. “But now I can do it without thinking.”""http://www.newyorker.com/humor...</comment>

<comment>They are politicians and move with the wind .... but Scalia was part of the judiciary and he was a bigotYou right wing hacks supported  him because he was a bigot.  Every time he uttered bigoted rants, you trolls supported him.  He even ranted with bigotry when the Pope was showing kindness..  He believed that he was even bigger than the Pope, the head the religious sect that he was party to.</comment>

<comment>And hated people.</comment>

<comment>Loved his family.  As if that were the exception rather than the rule.Love his country?  Robert E Lee loved his "country", which he understood to be a certain a certain gentrified subset of the Virginia population which definitely did not include black or lower class whites.In so far as the law is concerned, sometimes when people use it to benefit only certain groups, rule of law becomes so circumscribed as to be meaningless for the majority of the population.</comment>

<comment>Actually, as an atheist, I'm glad there isn't a hell.Scalia was an awful man, but his crimes against his fellow Americans were finite.</comment>

<comment>"Scalia was an awful man, but his crimes against his fellow Americans were finite."An awful man, true.I don't know what you mean by "finite" but his crimes will hurt many people, and our country, for many many years.</comment>

<comment>It means that I think the concept of Hell is a stupid one, an eternal, infinite punishment for finite crimes.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the clarification.</comment>

<comment>You are trying too hard to sound smart here and you just come across as dumb (and I say this as someone who leans left and generally disagrees with Scalia at most turns)As a Supreme Court justice, Scalia was actually in a pretty unusual position to commit infinite crimes--if that's what you believe he was doing--against fellow Americans.  In the words of Justice Souter, who was then eulogizing Justice Brennan:"If our next decision is meant to follow the course he set, we will reach out to him, and if we will not accept his direction we will have to grapple with him. But year after year, in subject after subject of the national law, we will either accept the inheritance of his thinking, or we will have to face him squarely and make good on our challenge to him."The point, once again, is that Supreme Court justices are in the business of making decisions that really can and do echo for generations.  There is no doubt Scalia's decisions will--unlike any crimes committed by you or me--have lasting, almost infinite effects for years to come.Good try at trying to sound profound though.</comment>

<comment>But, are the consequences?  I don't think that when the man committed these "crimes", he intended the consequences to be finite.  If, the consequences are, in any way, limited, it will be due to the efforts of others.  Somehow, I just don't see him getting a pass just because the fire he set intending a conflagration was put out by others.Just for the record, I don't think there is a hell, which is unfortunate because that belief is the only thing that seems to keep some of us in check.</comment>

<comment>Really? Please name a couple of them. Feel free to be specific.It will be amusing to see how your regurgitated talking points hold up to scrutiny.</comment>

<comment>Gosh, where to begin.Citizens United.  Despite all the squawking about liberty, some voices deserve to be heard more than others.14th amendment and equal protection.  There are no constitutional protection against discrimination.  Whether one is protected against discrimination is strictly the province of the legislature.  In his view, discrimination is acceptable if a majority of citizens approve it.In sum, Scalia believed, to paraphrase Orwell, all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.</comment>

<comment>Of course everyone's voice isn't "equal". The guy on the corner peddling pamphlets doesn't have the same reach as the New York Time's editorial page. He can join with others to amplify his voice, though, which is what CU was ultimately about.And Scalia was right about the 14th Amendment. It is up to the legislatures to pass the necessary anti-discrimination measures, the EPC only ensures that they are applied fairly.We pass discriminatory laws all the time. We levy higher taxes on higher earners, for instance. Do you think such discrimination is unfair?Finally, you have done a very poor job of defending your original inflammatory statements. As I suspected you would.</comment>

<comment>Stopping people from being rude is not the governments job.</comment>

<comment>Being rude?  Discrimination is simply being "rude"?A simple response from a simple man for whom the world is never simple enough.</comment>

<comment>Yes. Refusing or giving bad service is rude. Why is irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>Discrimination is nasty but short of violence or theft it is society not the governments job to handle. Remember government has been a leading cause of discrimination from Jim Crow to affirmative action.</comment>

<comment>LOL1) "Citizens United. Despite all the squawking about liberty, some voices deserve to be heard more than others."So tell us whose voice is more deserving to be heard ?And also who decides which is more "deserving" than another ?I'll also remind you, that even with all the money he spent, Bloomberg has made NO headway with his gun control agenda.And yet, I'm sure that a great many on the left feel that he is far more "deserving to be heard" than say the NRA and those who support the 2nd Amendment2) "14th amendment and equal protection. "Life is full of discrimination. And people have a right to make such discriminatory decisions as INDIVIDUALS.The problem with such as you, is that you try to dictate to people where, when and how they do not have such a right.Your ignorance of Scalia and what he stood for, is driven by your lack of understanding of WHY he made the LEGAL choices he made.In many cases, those legal choices actually went against his own personal positions.But as a judge and later a Justice, he was NOT being paid to let his personal views to influence his legal positions.Something that judges leaning left can't understand or don't practice.</comment>

<comment>It's not the governments job to play nanny. Short of theft or physical violence behavior should be legal. Culture and decorum is none of the governments business.</comment>

<comment>One less hate monger in a position of too much power. The world is a better place without him. </comment>

<comment>Lib vermin.</comment>

<comment>Crybaby.</comment>

<comment>World-class dumbass.</comment>

<comment>always the reaction of small minds when a great one leaves.  He hated no one, he loved the law.</comment>

<comment>Not sure which Scalia you were watching, but you should read his comments on gay people if you honestly think he hated no one.</comment>

<comment>There's also the troubling indications of exactly where he wanted this country to go if he had the complete wherewithal. Richard Posner sums this up quite nicely:http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12...</comment>

<comment>What this says is that he would leave law making up to lawmakers except when in conflict with the constitution.The horrors of a free republic.</comment>

<comment>Oh indeed, the horrors of a free republic. It's the court's job to prevent a "tyranny of the majority"-style situation, as seen with the Obergefell case. Civil rights and fundamental liberties aren't and shouldn't be up to the states to decide. And besides, you do realize that outside of exactly who can marry, the Obergefell case is virtually indistinguishable from the landmark Loving v. Virginia case, right?</comment>

<comment>Loving was based on the facts that Race was specified in the Law, gays were not. They could have been but were not. this is not hard to understand,</comment>

<comment>No, both of those cases involved the fundamental right to marry and the concept of negative liberties (the concept that there are certain rights the government and society has no business interfering with):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...http://www.slate.com/articles/...Justice Kennedy even name-dropped Loving in his opinion (pgs. 2, 16, 46, 88, 89):http://www.supremecourt.gov/op...</comment>

<comment>There is no fundamental right to marry, that is just made up.</comment>

<comment>Apparently, you've never heard of something called the 9th Amendment.Even if the right to marry isn't specified in the constitution, it still sets up the conditions for it to come to fruition. For instance, nowhere in the constitution will you find the "right to a fair trial" literally, but the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendments set that up quite nicely. You also won't find the "right to privacy" anywhere, but the courts have long recognized and respected that right, based on the 1st, 4th, 9th, and 14th Amendments. And lastly, but most importantly, the right to marry has also been formally codified by the Supreme Court, going back to the late Victorian era, at minimum:http://afer.org/blog/14-suprem...</comment>

<comment>Since my sister has the same 'fundamental' right, there is nothing stopping from marrying her?  What if she's already married? Can a man marry his own daughter? Is 'love' even part of it?You can't just dump something that can Ibe done into the 9th and call it fundamental.I may think that my right to have a pint on Fridays is fundamental but that does not make it so.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me, but now you're straying well beyond the scope of this conversation. You've asked me to pinpoint exactly how the fundamental right to get married came about; I gave you examples from various court rulings and opinions that have formulated and expanded upon that concept. It doesn't matter what you, me, or anyone else thinks about this issue, because I'm simply reporting how things came about in the past and what their justifications are under Constitutional law. If you've got issues with these ideas, then take them up with either the courts, the legislatures, or both.</comment>

<comment>No, I am claiming that the right to marry is not a fundamental right, tomorrow the government could decided not to recognize any marriages, no one's fundamental rights would be violated.You just listed places where the right may have been codified, but that hardly proved anything.  Gay marriage was justified under equal treatment, which certainly would allow siblings to marry.</comment>

<comment>Obergefell didn't bother even mentioning Loving. It was ruled based on "Kennedy and the liberal Justices want who cares about the law."</comment>

<comment>The hell it didn't (pgs. 2, 16, 46, 88, 89):http://www.supremecourt.gov/op...And as for "Kennedy and the liberal Justices want who cares about the law", you do realize that there's a whole bunch of caselaw supporting the fundamental right to marry for couples, right? Obergefell is simply the latest doctrinal extension of that:http://afer.org/blog/14-suprem...</comment>

<comment>Not at a federal level. State and federal powers are distinct.</comment>

<comment>State courts are bound by SCOTUS decisions.</comment>

<comment>Yes but the decision hadn't been made yet. </comment>

<comment>What decision? Obergefell is almost a year old already, and ssm has been legalized in pretty much every state by now, barring a few obstructionist attempts to delay or circumvent that ruling.</comment>

<comment>We're talking about before the ruling.</comment>

<comment>Why is this now relevant?</comment>

<comment>Read the earlier posts. Claiming Scalia went against precedent when the case cited as precedent when the case was ongoing makes no sense.</comment>

<comment>Scalia was pretty consistent with his anti-LGBT opinions, both personal and legal. Of course he was going to go against precedent one way or another.</comment>

<comment>Except there was no precedent.</comment>

<comment>Prove it.</comment>

<comment>On the legal level:Romer v. Evans"Today's opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends to. The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans have employed before. Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will."https://www.law.cornell.edu/su...Lawrence v. Texas“Today’s opinion is the product of a Court, which is the product of a law-profession culture, that has largely signed on to the so-called homosexual agenda, by which I mean the agenda promoted by some homosexual activists directed at eliminating the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct.”“Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children’s schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as ‘discrimination’ which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession’s anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that culture are not obviously ‘mainstream.’https://www.law.cornell.edu/su...U.S. v. Windsor"That is jaw-dropping. It is an assertion of judicial supremacy over the people's Representatives in Congress and the Executive. It envisions a Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empowered to decide all constitutional questions, always and everywhere 'primary' in its role."http://www.motherjones.com/pol...Obergefell v. Hodges“to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.”http://www.supremecourt.gov/op...On the personal level:"I don’t know about my grandchildren. I know about my children. I don’t think they and I differ very much. But I’m not a hater of homosexuals at all."http://nymag.com/news/features..."Let me be clear that I have nothing against homosexuals, or any other group, promoting their agenda through normal democratic means."https://www.law.cornell.edu/su... (to revisit Lawrence v. Texas again)In case of all this wasn't immediately obvious, it's clear that Scalia personally and vehemently disagreed with the concept of gay rights (at minimum), but felt that the issue should have been left up to the states to decide. While that's a somewhat cogent argument, what Scalia failed to understand is that it's the Court's job to defend against the tyranny of majority (despite more than a few legal hiccups in the past); that's the main reason why the SCOTUS even exists in the first place. Worse yet, if you're at all familiar with American history, you'd know that the use of "states' rights" in the context of civil rights is usually a dog-whistle for racist, bigoted, and discriminatory policies. The federal government, on the other hand, has a better record of civil rights enforcement on the whole. That Scalia didn't recognize this in his time on the bench speaks volumes in the end.http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12...</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the CLEAR demonstration that you are conflate his personal views from his role as a Justice on the Supreme Court, whose job is to set aside his personal views  and look at the laws and the Constitution and decide accordingly.His writings and comments CLEARLY prove your conflation.Couldn't have been clearer myself.-------Now go back and think on what I wrote.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me, but quite frankly I don't know how you're coming to these conclusions. I made it very clear above that as a justice, he was a states' rights advocate for LGBT marriage, while personally he opposed it and thought it was sinful. I was even able to parse out what he wrote in his judicial opinions vs. what he wrote and said off-the-record and in media appearances. Based on that, one can easily assume that what he wrote and spoke of on the bench was his legal opinion, and what he said/wrote while not on the bench and in personal settings represented his personal views.How do YOU make this distinction? Are you sure you're not just moving the goalposts here?</comment>

<comment>That is, as the man himself would have said, "applesauce."</comment>

<comment>He hated minorities and gay people, and disrespected justices on the Court who disagreed with him - even Pope Francis.He loved big corporations, the Republican party and his own religion, and disrespected other religions, other political parties and ordinary citizens..Mostly, he loved himself.He also had many conflicts of interests, especially during the 2000 presidential election, that involved his family members including his son and wife.He was a bad person who became a supreme court justice.</comment>

<comment>Grow up, try reading some of his opinions.  Agreeing or disagreeing is different that loving or hating, try to understand the law.</comment>

<comment>"State laws against bigamy, same-sex marriage, adult incest, prostitution, masturbation, adultery, fornication, bestiality, and obscenity are likewise sustainable only in light of Bowers’ validation of laws based on moral choices. Every single one of these laws is called into question by today’s decision; the Court makes no effort to cabin the scope of its decision to exclude them from its holding." - Scalia.That sort of unpolished turd thinking is why every sane American is glad he is dead.</comment>

<comment>he did not think that judges should be making these choice, he thought that people should live under laws that they believed in.</comment>

<comment>Doubt it, it's more likely he espoused primacy for men and majoritiesIf that counts as hate then we all need to learn hate</comment>

<comment>Standing against racism like affirmative action is racist now?</comment>

<comment>"Standing against racism like affirmative action is racist now?"Yes, and you know it.You are just a poor oppressed white person with no rights, aren't you?</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action is nothing but racism in the other directionAnd it doesn't matter which way the racism goes, it's not justifiable either way.</comment>

<comment>Yes. You realize treating people differently based upon their race IS racism right? It's not a one way street. It has nothing to do with "power." There's a reason Dr. King wanted content of character not color of skin.</comment>

<comment>He manipulated the law to the ends of his masters.</comment>

<comment>not even close if you read his opinions.</comment>

<comment>He was an originalist when it suited his agenda and the people who've been seduced by his cult of personality can't see it. Fortunately, the damage he can do from the grave is limited.</comment>

<comment>Well, he certainly didn't have a soft spot at all for us atheists for one thing, in addition to gays:http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/...</comment>

<comment>Who cares if he had a softspot or not, people disagree about this stuff.</comment>

<comment>You miss my point. By equivocating atheists and non-believers with the devil, isn't that in itself indicative of a stronger level of dislike than simple disagreement? I'd argue that it borders on hate, in line with the judgments handed down in the above comments. I was using "softspot" sarcastically, in case it wasn't obvious enough at first glance.</comment>

<comment>he was not equivocating, he was saying that this is how the devil's power grows.  No hate (except for the devil).This is not an uncommon belief and is about love, not hate.</comment>

<comment>Just because something is a belief doesn't make it true. And and associating nonbelievers with the devil (even though he/she/it is a fictitious entity) isn't a nice thing to do at all. Even if it's not a false equivocation at heart (hint: it actually is), it's still a logical fallacy:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And if this is somehow "love", then I guess 2+2=5, right?</comment>

<comment>yea, he was talking about the devil, he was not trying to be nice, is that a requirement now?You believe that the devil is a fictitious entity, that fine. Are you telling me that  it's not fine if I believe that that is exactly what the devil wants you to believe?no fallacy and a common belief.</comment>

<comment>It's fine if you believe that. That's why the 1st Amendment exists. However, this doesn't mean that I can't criticize this belief extensively. I mean, can you prove that the devil even exists?"that is exactly what the devil wants you to believe"How is this not an equivocation, or, at minimum, an association fallacy? Enlighten me. I'll wait.</comment>

<comment>you were trying to equate his beliefs with hate, that's not what it's about.It's not an association fallacy, it is of course un-provable.For proof of God or the devil, you need Thomas Aquinas, I don't think you want to go down the rabbit hole of his reasoning.The irony of proving God exists is, to a non-believer it can never be proven, but to a believer, proof of God can be seen just about everywhere</comment>

<comment>Again, how is this not a false equivocation or association fallacy? I don't think you've answered my question in any great detail beyond general assertions.If you really want to engage in this religious debate, then fine. Aquinas' proofs have long been rebutted empirically by scientists like Hawking and Darwin. Philosophically speaking, if God is the prime mover/designer of this universe, then how did God himself/herself/itself come about. You do realize that if you posit the existence of a first cause, then you get an infinite regress of causes, right? In other words, who designed the designer?The irony of your last sentence is that virtually everything in our universe can be explained using naturalistic causes. Per Occam's Razor, there's no reason to invoke the supernatural or excessive arguments when simplicity will do just fine.</comment>

<comment>Sorry if I gave the impression that I was looking for a religious debate, I was just trying to clarify where Scalia was coming from since I have a similar outlook (Catholic/Jesuit).An eternal God has not been proven but has also not been disproven.  Nothing in Darwin's or Hawking's theories is in conflict with my beliefs, I see it more a explanation of how not who or why.Some people consider the 'Big Bang Theory' proof that God didn't create the universe but was created by a process, that is not at all how I see it.  That the universe is made understandable and not controlled by randomness would not surprise me as I believe in a Creator.That all life and all life's functions on earth evolved through random mutations which provided survival advantages seems like a stretch based on the time available.Complex systems like respiratory, circulatory or endocrine would seem to near endless random mutations to provide a working system that would provide an advantage.  It would seem that life on earth would show much more instability but we'll see.My faith and tradition encourages and in many cases leads the search for understanding our universe, our faith is not challenged by what we find.</comment>

<comment>I attended a Roman Catholic school for grades K-5, and a Jesuit school for College (Boston College...go Eagles!), but the more I got into theology, the more I found myself disbelieving it.The biggest problem is that in the absence of positive evidence for God's existence (e.g. if there were a way to empirically detect or even communicate with such a deity), it's not a sustainable hypothesis from a scientific perspective. Imagine if we had no proof that the fossil record exists, for example. If I were to tell you that such a thing exists without direct and unambiguous confirmation, would you then believe me?It's also important to note that things like evolution and the laws of physics aren't random; there are some chance events involved, but for the most part they follow very consistent rules. Introducing a deity into these equations only serves to complicate things:https://www.newscientist.com/a...http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/O...And lastly, despite all I've said above, it's important to note that scientists like Hawking, Darwin, and Tyson don't outright say that it's impossible that God exists. Rather, it's more along the lines of "the universe's workings are sufficiently explained by the laws of science and there's no need to invoke the supernatural at this time." But for what it's worth though, I'm glad that you don't see a need for outright mutual incompatibility between science and religion.</comment>

<comment>That's the thing with Jesuits, they teach a lot of people to be atheists.The randomness I mentioned is a central part of Darwin, each genetic mutation is random and has no purpose, the environment decides if it is an advantage that is likely to be passed on to future generations, a disadvantage that may kill the possessor or neutral where the trait may get passed on based on other traits.I think that Darwin's theory does a good job in explaining how new species are created and we obviously see that evolution happens, I just think that the theory is weak when we try to apply it to explain all life on earth.In humans, it seems that the latest major evolutionary leap was a mutation that allowed people to digest lactose after early childhood.  This small change was simply a random error compared to previous generations, where the gene that triggers a tolerance switch failed to fire and ended up giving the baby an advantage later in life and an advantage in collecting baby mommas.Now, 10-20,000 years later, that mutation has passed to all of  35% of the world's population, mostly those of European ancestryI can't buy into the idea that all life, and all behaviors of that life developed that way, there isn't enough time.  The number of generations needed to develop a brain or circulatory system from scratch is astronomical and to me much more unlikely than some type of intelligence behind it all.Piece of trivia.Georges Lemaître, the Belgian Jesuit priest and astronomer who first proposed the Big Bang Theory had to ask the Pope not to use this new theory as proof that God made the universe, he thought it would impede the scientific progress if scientist thought they were proving God's existence.</comment>

<comment>The problem is a simple one...People conflate his personal opinion with his legal opinion.But as a judge/Justice, there is a separation.In his 20/20 interview he states that the people who see the Constitution differently from him are not "bad people", they are "people with bad ideas"The left unfortunatly does not comprehend that distinction.So anyone who dares to hold or argue an opinion that they consider bad, are automatically bad people.You can easily see that in the spew of hate, bile and venom shown in these comments.To them that Scalia argue a legal point which goes against their agenda/beliefs, makes Scalia a bad person.And that even though LEGALLY, Scalia was right, and as a judge HAD to argue the case legally, and NOT according to his personal view, which may or may not have agreed with what the law dictated.This can be seen in the 20/20 interviews of a few years ago, that can be found on Youtube.</comment>

<comment>That's sort of my point. It's not that I outright think that Scalia's a bad person, it's just that some of his ideas/legal opinions are questionable, to say the least. Since he was a public figure, there's no doubt that his comments and speeches would've influenced quite a number of people either way.For instance, his comments regarding separation of church and state....https://www.au.org/blogs/wall-......come across as very troubling, both constitutionally and and morally. Constitutionally, he was flat-out wrong. Morally, because they have very real implications for atheists and non-believers, given that we're the most heavily discriminated group in the US. And as a staunch atheist, I usually don't take these comments very lightly, even if my own feelings for him don't arise to the level of "hate." Reasonable minds can and should differ on matters of public policy and whatnot.</comment>

<comment>Maybe it's because he's right and those who believe him wrong are in fact wrong.People have gone to the notion that government is supposed to be religion-free. But the Constitution says NOTHING about that.And the Framers, had NOT problems with bringing religion into play, in speeches, displays or whatever.Not establishing an official Church, is very different from being "religion free" and trying to play a stupid game of let's remove ANY and ALL references to Christianity.</comment>

<comment>Again, it really depends. If we're talking about removing a ten commandments monument in a public courthouse that was erected relatively recently, then that's pretty verbotten (Roy Moore, I'm looking at you here). On the other hand, if it's a pretty old monument, for instance, then it would pass muster since at that point it's more of a cultural artifact than anything (per Sandra Day O'Connor's formulation).http://archive.adl.org/10comm/...And the Constitution's pretty secular as it is. It flat-out states that no government establishment of a RELIGION will be allowed. It goes much further than merely one particular church, denomination, etc. There's also that "no religious test" clause that further augments the wall of separation idea.Even if the founding fathers supported the free exercise of religion and invoked religious iconography and whatnot, most of them were Deists, not theists. In fact, they were VERY clear that government sponsorship of religion was a no-no:http://infidels.org/library/mo...https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9...http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18t...Our politicians are free to invoke god/religion however much they want, but to actually make religious laws into public policy would be pretty unconstitutional.Best summed up by the late (and great) Christopher Hitchens here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>The fallacy that was used to remove the 10 Commandments was the claim that it was "religious"When you look at the 10 Commandments, even though it's claimed to have been hand from God to Moses, they are in fact very good moral and ethical laws, that are the basis of any moral and ethical society.And, Courthouses, legislatures, and other government buildings have a long history of presenting arworks outside and inside of them.To me a sculpture of an open book open with 5 laws listed on each page. is both art, indication of the intent of the building, and definitely NOT an example of what the Constitution forbids.In the same way, the deist/theist argument is nothing but hair-splitting used as a distraction, but in the long run pretty irrelevant.As to making religious laws into public policy"Thou shall not murder"  and "Thou shall not steal" sounds like pretty good policy to me.Should we get rid of all the laws with regards to homicide and theft because the Bible beat us to it ?Don't be silly.And yet that is exactly the nonsense you are pushing.</comment>

<comment>There are some good moral laws to be found in many, many religions, sure. And no one argues for the eradication of religion from a cultural standpoint, sure. And, having worked as a paralegal and hung out with law students (go Blue Devils!) before, I don't disagree with you that artworks adorning government buildings are great too. The problem is, displaying all these religious monuments openly, front-and-center, without any significant historical backdrop and time as I mentioned, sends the wrong message to religious minorities, and it's a flagrant constitutional violation, as the various courts have ruled over the years.Things like "Thou shall not murder" and "thou shall not steal" can also be justified using secular grounds: evolutionary ethics/altruism, for instance. Religion doesn't have a monopoly on human morality.And most importantly, though the Ten Commandments certainly have some merit, you do realize that not only do the first four alone run afoul of the First Amendment, but on the whole, they're a terrible source of morality in this day and age? They might have been great for Bronze-age humans, but the moral zeitgeist has long since moved on. Even the "good" ones still have caveats and hidden costs that need to be taken into account:http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/T...</comment>

<comment>1) We are not responsible for the ignorance of those that follow us.So I don't buy into the argument that ".. displaying all these religious monuments openly, front-and-center, without any significant historical backdrop is a problem"The problem is easily solved with a sign.2) The claim that the first 4 commandments are an infringement on the First Amendment is nonsense1- You shall have no other gods before Me.2- You shall not make idols.3- You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain.4- Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.None apply to anyone who chooses not to believe in God.1- if you have no god, there is not before the other2- for the non-believer that is moot3- that would be respect of your neighbor's beliefs if you don't believe4- for most the "new sabbath" is called "weekend".But frankly a mandatory day of rest with minimal work is not a bad thing.And your wiki.It's slick and dishonestEven when it recognizes that the source is a questionable interpretation, it knowingly uses that incorrect interpretation to make the argumentThat's fraud..</comment>

<comment>It's not my argument at all re: the displays of religious monuments on government property; it's the Supreme Court's. Not only would there have to be a significant passage of time, but it would also have to pass the "Lemon test" (per Lemon v. Kurtzman), which itself is no easy feat:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...On the other hand, failing any one of these two provisions (actually, they're four different prongs if you want to be pedantic about this) is a virtually a guarantee that such monuments would be adjudged unconstitutional:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And it's true that the first four amendments have no bearing for people who don't follow Christianity per se. But that's exactly the point: they have no secular resonances whatsoever:http://atheism.about.com/od/te...When you consider the fact that there are a not-insignificant number of Dominionists and radical Evangelicals who claim that the US is a Christian nation and that the 10 Commandments are the basis for the constitution, then that would imply that Commandments 1-4 should be read into American law, and anyone who isn't a Christian is by default a second-class citizen (this ties back into what I said earlier about "sending the wrong message").And finally, regarding keeping holy the Sabbath, you don't need Yahweh or Moses to tell you that taking a break is a wise thing to do when simple human psychology and common sense would suffice (considering the punishment for failing to uphold the commandments is death, psychology seems like the better venue). Indeed, there are superior justficiations to be found in secular ethics for any one of the "good" commandments. As I said earlier, maybe for it's day, the Sabbath was revolutionary, but the moral zeitgeist has long moved on from the Bronze Age (per Richard Dawkins):https://www.youtube.com/watch?...P.S. If you take Fourth Commandment literally, it would also subtly support and enshrine creationism/intelligent design into law. It's an aside, but still. </comment>

<comment>Liberals are racist haters</comment>

<comment>Yeah. Right. WE'RE the racists and the hate mongers. You should be committed.</comment>

<comment>WellWho is spewing all the hate, bile and venom in these comments ?Regress.. uh.. progressives ?Or everyone else ?The proof is evident.</comment>

<comment>The proof IS evident. But the proof supports US. I may be trolling everything, however A) this is a LIBERAL publication - making YOU the real troll just for being here, and B) if you scour the entire internet, I'd say you conservatives are more represented in the loud, stupid, and profane comments.</comment>

<comment>You should start with simple tasks first.I would suggest you scour your bedpan.Once you've figured how to do that, move on to bigger things, like a saucepan.You're not up to "scouring the entire internet" yetNot by a long shot.</comment>

<comment>Hey libs, if Obama had died in 2008 (you know, 4 years before he supported gay marriage) would you be shouting "ding dong the witch it dead" and saying you wished you could have defecated into his mouth like the wonder tolerance brigade is saying about scalia now?</comment>

<comment>Lol. Totally weak.</comment>

<comment>Ding dong, the witch is dead!Hooray!</comment>

<comment>Another liberal Hater. Shameful feces you are.</comment>

<comment>You with your zillion IDs would show up and say it.   That's the deal.</comment>

<comment>So Obama gets one more. Unless Congress is truly and irreparably broken.</comment>

<comment>he gets one, if he chooses wisely.</comment>

<comment>I dunno, King.Republicans have more important priorities than filling a SCOTUS vacancy, like another 40 symbolic Obamacare repeals.</comment>

<comment>Dear Death Panels:Well done.</comment>

<comment>Oh, thank G-d this horrible right-wingnut monster is finally gone and cannot hurt us any more.</comment>

<comment>dumb comment, come on..</comment>

<comment>OK, Terry, I will come on.  Scalia was a terrible excuse for a Supreme Court Justice -- in fact, he confirmed Citizens United and several other terrible, awful decisions.  I am sorry for anyone who might miss him personally, but in general, his death is a long-awaited blessing for the United States of America</comment>

<comment>This from a liberal who cries racism yet demands there be racial discrimination in hiring and university admissions.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me - where have I cried "racism?"</comment>

<comment>No, you cried 'stupidity' and got called out on it</comment>

<comment>All liberals are racists. </comment>

<comment>Especially those Black Lives Matter people, right?</comment>

<comment>You are seriously too stupid to be angry with.</comment>

<comment>Of course he confirmed Citizen United, it was an open and shut case on 1st amendment freedom of speech, are  you really comfortable with allowing a politician to shut down a movie about herself?Do you think that the death of people you disagree with is a blessing?Politically, I 'hate' a lot of people but can't imagine this reaction to someone dying.</comment>

<comment>Liberals are the most hateful and intolerant people out there.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, really sucks when those mean liberals take away the sticks you use to bash people.</comment>

<comment>Need more hyperbole in your silly posts.</comment>

<comment>You are a shameful HATER. You will have a lifetime of pain for your shameful acts.</comment>

<comment>You can at last come out of your "safe spaces," change your clothes, maybe even grow up.</comment>

<comment>And you are a sad excuse for a human being .</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate America?</comment>

<comment>You are a horrible person. You will have a lot of personal pain, more than you currently have. You are a liberal, left wing HATER, and shame will be your life.</comment>

<comment>A true American hero - Obama will not replace him.</comment>

<comment>Thankfully no one will replace that bigot.</comment>

<comment>Gay marriage will come back to haunt Obama and the liberals.</comment>

<comment>Funny how liberals prancing around howling he was racist are the ones demanding racial discrimination in employment hiring and university admissions.</comment>

<comment>I know, Penguin.Life was just so much better when you could tell all of those black people to go eat somewhere else, then get your cop buddies to sic dogs on them if they refused.Traditional values!</comment>

<comment>What does that have to do with affirmative action? It was DEMOCRATS who created jim crow, not republicans. Mincing turd.</comment>

<comment>Ask yourself why Strom Thurmond switched parties, and you'll understand how wrong your thinking is.Or maybe you won't.Either way, I doubt someone of your low intelligence can properly fill out a ballot anyway.</comment>

<comment>Remember when Obama spoke at the funeral of KKK member Democrat Robert Byrd?</comment>

<comment>What was the difference between Robert Byrd and Strom Thurmond?Robert Byrd renounced racism and segregation when the Democratic Party did in the 60's, and that renunciation gave us the National Civil Rights Act.Strom Thurmond maintained his racist and segregationist stance and switched to the Republican Party, which also retained that stance.It was called the Southern Strategy.</comment>

<comment>Funny how it's still only democrats advocating racial discrimination today.</comment>

<comment>Penguin, it's probably time to go back to hiding under your mom's bed, dude.The grownups are having a discussion out here.</comment>

<comment>INstead of personally attacking me, do you deny democrats advocate racial discrimination in hiring and university admissions?</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry.Did I hurt your feelings, Penguin?</comment>

<comment>Democrats are racists. Period. End of story.</comment>

<comment>You are an idiot. Your parents failed you as it is obvious you cannot assimilate into a civilized society. Why don't you us all a favor and go play on the freeway blogvader. You are a net negative.</comment>

<comment>You wouldn't know the first thing about a civilized society.</comment>

<comment>Was LBJ a Racist in your book?Don't even try to get past that raging racist.</comment>

<comment>He was, but in the end, he moved racial equality forward anyway, so his personal feelings on the matter are inconsequential.</comment>

<comment>he did it for power.  "if we pass this the n****ers will vote for democrats for 100 years".</comment>

<comment>He actually never said that.</comment>

<comment>sorry, 200 years.</comment>

<comment>Omg, I don't have time for your levels of stupid.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure your schedule is packed.</comment>

<comment>Well the Atlantic comments section has become more right wing recently.</comment>

<comment>And in doing so, LBJ drove away voters in 11 southern states, and the electoral college votes in those states, in exchange for the votes of people who did form the majority in a single state.</comment>

<comment>"It was called the Southern Strategy."Carter swept the South in '76, from Texas to the Carolinas.Blacks have been deserting "liberal" northern cities and moving to the supposedly horribly racist South for decades now.So much for this Southern Strategy micturating Leftoids need so badly to believe in.</comment>

<comment>Thurmond switched parties, all of the other racist stayed democratic.  Fulbright, Gore, KKK Grand Dragon Byrd etc.there was no trend, the Democratic party has always been the home of racists.</comment>

<comment>You don't have the first clue about your own history.After the Dems passed the National Civil Rights Act, Thurmond famously said: "I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party left me."Doesn't really sound like someone who wanted to embrace the new steps toward equality that Dems spearheaded.</comment>

<comment>you mean the same democrats that LBJ lead to kill Eisenhower's civil rights bill?</comment>

<comment>Yes, those same Democrats.You know, the ones who did the right thing in the end.</comment>

<comment>and what did the Republicans do?  the civil rights bill was passed with republican support against democratic opposition.LBJ wouldn't only call his driver nigger or boy, no Republican at the time acted this way.</comment>

<comment>"no Republican at the time acted this way."Gee! They do it now, though - just not in front of YOU.</comment>

<comment>no, they don't.  people seem to confuse 'not pandering to' to 'hating'</comment>

<comment>"and what did the Republicans do?  the civil rights bill was passed with republican support against democratic opposition."Nope. It was with northern democratic support that the bill was able to pass.</comment>

<comment>there were 46 northern dems in the Senate the former leader of the KKK Robert Byrd voted against it.Can you pass anything in the Senate with 45 Votes?there were 27 votes against, 20 of them dems.</comment>

<comment>You are a fool. Obviously taught by some idiot Union teacher.</comment>

<comment>At least he WAS taught.</comment>

<comment>Democrats were the slave owners. Learn your history - which president abolished slaverly!</comment>

<comment>"Life was just so much better when you could tell all of those black people to go eat somewhere else, then get your cop buddies to sic dogs on them if they refused."Bull Connor was a five-time delegate  to the Donks' national convention.</comment>

<comment>Ridiculous. Where do you people come from? Your parents obviously failed you.</comment>

<comment>"Intent" and "meaning" are two different things.  Seeking the contemporary meaning of something at the point in time it was written is entirely consistent with disregarding intent in the present.</comment>

<comment>LORETTA LYNCH FOR THE SUPREME COURT NOW!!!</comment>

<comment>Elizabeth Warren</comment>

<comment>elizabeth warren would be a great choice. the advantage in loretta lynch is that the republicans have recently voted to confirm her so it would be more difficult for them to turn around and suddenly say that lynch was somehow "unqualified".</comment>

<comment>Being qualified for one job does not mean qualified for another.Look at Obama, highly qualified as a neighborhood activist. Totally useless for anything else.</comment>

<comment>We need a self professed socialist progressive who's 42 years old to nominate.</comment>

<comment>I am saddened by Justice Scalia's death, even though I would have welcomed his retirement.  I would entreat my fellow liberal Democrats to show more respect and a lot more class than this thread reflects.</comment>

<comment>Hard to show what is absent.</comment>

<comment>This article presents Scalia in terms that are far more reverential than necessary. The author might just as well have said he was an often angry, arbitrary and ultimately on the wrong side of history on issue after issue owing to his stubborn belief in his own infallibility. </comment>

<comment>Scalia was a towering intellect that most of the bug-wits who read 'The Atlantic' are incapable of comprehending.</comment>

<comment>A "towering intellect" who wanted to impose his religious beliefs on others through the court. And republicans worried about Kennedy being beholden to the papacy.</comment>

<comment>"Scalia was a towering intellect that most of the bug-wits who read 'The Atlantic' are incapable of comprehending."Scalia believed that the 14th amendment does not apply to women.'Nuff sed'</comment>

<comment>Prove it.</comment>

<comment>"Justice Antonin Scalia still doesn’t believe it. In an interview in this month’s California Lawyer magazine, he said that the 14th Amendment means only men when it says states can’t deny “any person” equal protection under the law."http://www.bloomberg.com/news/...And if that news source isn't "politically correct" in your eyes, feel free to pick one of the several othershttps://www.google.ca/search?q...</comment>

<comment>You and the author are both confused..You are making a basic mistake in presuming that when Scalia is talking about the law AT THE TIME OF WRITING, it also means that he holds that PERSONAL opinion.In effect you are conflating the jurist and the person.In other words, the problem with your cite, is that you and the author are spinning it according the CURRENT interpretation, while Scalia is simply stating what the law intended at the time of writing.And you then stupidly infer that because he specifies what the law meant then, it somehow, to fit your own bias, it also means that Scalia actually PERSONALLY agrees with that interpretation.BZZZT !WRONG !That's about as stupid as claiming that a chemistry teacher who talks about the Phlogiston theory actually believes the Phlogiston theoryA simplistic and moronic intepretation driven by bigotry.</comment>

<comment>The GOP will ensure that his legacy is one of political obstructionism. They were promising to obstruct any nominee of President Obama before the body was even cold. Just one more example of the GOP politicizing death as they did with the Benghazi victims.</comment>

<comment>It is disgraceful how Republicans use the deaths of people for political point scoring! Benghazi being one as you mentioned, now Scalia is being used for the same reason. They are a party that has no shame. None whatsoever!!</comment>

<comment>In future, spare yourself from embarrassment.You're not smart enough to be witty.</comment>

<comment>Not smart enough to be witty. Come come now Attila you are just jealous because your wit has escaped you. Mine is in full flow every day.</comment>

<comment>I didn't realize that wit was like a canary in a cage.I think you're confused about wit and twit.They're not the same.If you had any wit, then you would have been able to answer the very simple questions I asked you in the past.Instead, like a twit, you just ran away..Maybe you'll have more luck in your next life, and you'll be around when spare neurons were being handed out.</comment>

<comment>You Attila don't like answers that don't gel with yours. As usual you resort to name calling but that's what people like you do it's all they have. Goodbye.</comment>

<comment>And yet, instead of showing me where my answers are wrong, you:- first try with a sad and pathetic little insultAnd when I respond in kind, you:- get into a tizzy, - declare that I am the one having issues with answers I don't like, - make a stupid generalization about "what people like me do all the time"- and then scuttle away like a little cockroach when the lights are turned in a tenement.And ALL the WHILE avoid answering any of the not-so-hard questions that I have asked you in the past..Sounds, more like you have a problem with your beliefs and are unable to look at them without admitting that they are not able to stand up to question, and you are completely incapable of defending them.</comment>

<comment>Ant let's not forgetSandy Hook, coughSan Bernardino, cough.</comment>

<comment>"Obstruction" is called separation of powers and checks and balances.</comment>

<comment>No, obstruction for no other purpose than obstruction has nothing to do with checks and balances.</comment>

<comment>You mean like this ?From 2007http://www.politico.com/story/...- -" New York Sen. Charles E. Schumer, a powerful member of the Democratic leadership, said Friday the Senate should not confirm another U.S. Supreme Court nominee under President Bush “except in extraordinary circumstances.”“We should reverse the presumption of confirmation,” Schumer told the American Constitution Society convention in Washington. “The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice Stevens replaced by another Roberts, or Justice Ginsburg by another Alito.”"The Democrats are NOT in ANY position to whine if the GOP blocks candidates nominated by Obama.They've already set the precedent.</comment>

<comment>But they did NOT block Bush's nominees now did they?</comment>

<comment>Because they never got the chance...Their intent was clear and clearly stated nonetheless.</comment>

<comment>No, ONE politician stated his PERSONAL opinion. The GOP were fighting each other to be the first to disrespect the dead man by jumping on his still warm dead body.</comment>

<comment>Sure, bubGo read what the progressives had to say as soon as the news went outThere's even a thread that goes "Ding Dong the witch is dead" Hell, I think you were even a participant.But liar and hypocrite are synonyms of your nym anyway.</comment>

<comment>That is exactly what checks and balances. Remember "obstruction" is an entirely relative claim. Would you call it "obstruction" if Ginsberg stood against rulings creating a state religion? When Dems blocked things W wanted?</comment>

<comment>They were politicizing this before the body was even cold.Regressives have blocked things even THEY wanted as a way of punishing Obama for his popularity. They obtains a majority and have accomplished NOTHING, which is why a vile reality TV caricature of a pandering GOP politician is leading the GOP clown parade.</comment>

<comment>Every SCOTUS nomination is political. Do you not remember the Roberts or Alito fights? How the term Borking entered the political lexicon?You're only attacking this because it's GOP doing it. You'd love it if Dems under a GOP president did the same thing when Ginsberg passes. </comment>

<comment>But there won't be a GOP POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Really ??Is that what you saw in your crystal ball ?</comment>

<comment>They are doing it to themselves. Did you see the sh_tshow debate?!  LMMFAO!</comment>

<comment>NopeDon't watch the debates for either side.They're nothing but theater.PBS has better entertainment</comment>

<comment>Suuure there won't. Because a walking scandal or unrepentant Red have a chance.</comment>

<comment>Against a vile reality TV caricature of a pandering GOP politician or a dominionist who wants the US to become a theocracy? You bet they do.</comment>

<comment>Trump won't win a thing and Cruz is a fine candidate.</comment>

<comment>CRUZ-boy is despised by virtually everyone who knows him. He is beholden to big banking through his wife, and he is a dominionist who wants to turn the US into a christian theocracy and feels he has been ordained by god to lead the country in that direction. He would never survive a general.</comment>

<comment>Every conservative who even plays lip service to religion gets the "theocracy" canard. It's BS. Being liked is irrelevant. Nobody liked Obama. Didn't stop his election.You're going to attack Cruz about banks when Clinton is running? That's a joke right?</comment>

<comment>GRUZ-boy does far more than pay "lip-service" to religion, That is what TRUMPy does when he waves his bible in the air, claims he is evangelical, and quotes "two corinthians". But it works for him. If they are gullible enough to "believe" they are gullible enough to believe TRUMPy.Clinton's spouse was a regional VP for Goldman Sachs? You don't think St. Cruz' PAC gets just as much bank money as Clinton's?</comment>

<comment>Every GOP candidate gets that canard. It's nonsense.Have you read anything about Clinton? If she had an R after her name you wouldn't defend all that Wall Street money.</comment>

<comment>The hypocrisy of the left is unsurpassed.</comment>

<comment>LOLOnly in the twisted regress.. uh.. progressive fantasy universe, is fighting for the right candidate called "obstruction" when one side does it, but it's called OK for the other side to do it</comment>

<comment>No, when the pint is purely obstruction, when they promise to obstruct ANY nominee before the body is even cold, it is obstruction no matter what side is doing it.</comment>

<comment>YawnClearly any reason for it is meaningless with your Fanatic belief that the ONLY purpose is obstruction.Don't expect much respect with that kind of closed mind</comment>

<comment>The body was not even cold. Classic GOP.</comment>

<comment>LOLAs soon as your bullshit is exposed you try to change the subject..Classic regress.. uh.. progressive...</comment>

<comment>A legacy of hate and bigotry, oh and putting idiot GWB into the WH.</comment>

<comment>Then your only legacy will be one of ignorance and prejudice based on that ignorance.But hey.SIXHIRB does play well with ignorant progressives.</comment>

<comment>And yours will be one of ignorance, watch Fox network much?? Yeah you do.</comment>

<comment>LOLMore ignorant prejudice..But hey, nothing new there.</comment>

<comment>LOL, when you've lost the debate, mention Fox News and pretend you've won.</comment>

<comment>Just pretend you don't watch</comment>

<comment>great point, you're really smart.  If you want to be a liberal, at least be an educated one.</comment>

<comment>I am educated, something you apparently are not. Try reading, you might learn something beyond the crap you are fed over at Fox or AM hate radio.</comment>

<comment>An (allegedly) educated person would be smart enough not to claim something that clearly they have no data to support, such as claiming that people watch Fox News, solely on the basis that believe something other than you.All you are demonstrating is that you're an ignorant bigot. And whatever education, you may have had, taught you nothing of value.</comment>

<comment>You surprise me, you don't seem it.Can you try to argue without the Fox stuff and make a point?</comment>

<comment>The Fox News thing is in the same class as pulling out the bearing of nuclear weapons per the 2nd Amendment.It's a clear admission that they've lost the debate and are running away as fast as they can.</comment>

<comment>So Scalia wasn't a homophobe who said that being gay was the same as murder? Ah okay.</comment>

<comment>Go ahead and quote him..</comment>

<comment>"Of course it is our moral heritage that one should not hate any human being or class of human beings," Scalia wrote, in the classic prebuttal phrasing of someone about to say something ludicrous. "But I had thought that one could consider certain conduct reprehensible—murder, for example, or polygamy, or cruelty to animals—and could exhibit even 'animus' toward such conduct. Surely that is the only sort of 'animus' at issue here: moral disapproval of homosexual conduct[.]"</comment>

<comment>I'm sure that you don't understand this, but this clearly does not prove your point.</comment>

<comment>Only if you think comparing gay sex to murder or bestiality isn't an insult. Read you homophobic, failed abortion.</comment>

<comment>You were trying to prove that Scalia was  homophobe who said that being gay was the same as murder.I just noted that these quotes obviously do not do that if you can follow reason.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be not reading again Terry. A common issue with you.</comment>

<comment>This takes a little thought to understand, sometimes people miss the point, it's not for everyone.</comment>

<comment>"animus" is not phobia, bub..Get a dictionary and learn the meaning of the words you use.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, no, you're making up bullshit to ignore the truth. Why can't you croak old man?</comment>

<comment>LOLYou're just as stupid as your vegeta persona was.No surprise there.And your kind of wish is what led to 200,000,000 people being killed in the 20th Century by regress.. uh.. progressives just like you..</comment>

<comment>Good creationist claim with no data. You believe in evolution yet?</comment>

<comment>LOLStill stupid enough to believe that spouting nonsense will distract from your.. well.. stupidity.</comment>

<comment>Rot in the deepest, darkest pit of Hell you racist, homophobic, Bible thumping misogynist. Hopefully Thomas will join you soon.Take this country back Obama.</comment>

<comment>Don't you just feel that regress..uh.. progressive love ?No wonder progressives accumulated 200,000,000 victims of democide in a single century.The only ones who beat them at that are the muslims responsible for abotu 280,000,000 (and still counting). But it took them 14 and not just 1 century to get there.</comment>

<comment>Progressive =/= Nice.Back those numbers up.</comment>

<comment>https://www.hawaii.edu/powerki...</comment>

<comment>Nice scholarly source.</comment>

<comment>So you're telling us that a respected researcher and professor of the University of Hawaii is NOT a "scholarly source"You haven't changed your persona since you were "vegeta".You're still the intellectual equivalent of a gourd.</comment>

<comment>No Shit Sherlock, you figured out the mystery, jinkies gang!Respected? Hah, I see no citations, just claims, much like you. Goodness, you got rocks in your head, much like your avatar.</comment>

<comment>Too bad little buddy.You want to claim that it's not respected, you go ahead and present credible evidence that the data on the site is not valid.But hey, no surprise that a vegetable like you wouldn't know that.</comment>

<comment>Blacks, Latinos, women and gays, show Scalia the same amount of respect he showed you; None.</comment>

<comment>At least you seem to be a HATER !SIXHIRB Rules</comment>

<comment>I know I am. I'm gleeful.</comment>

<comment>He was a vain and obstructionist judge who applied the law to serve his masters. A disgrace to the robe and the nation.</comment>

<comment>LOLSure..</comment>

<comment>Always find it strange that folks like epps think it remarkable that a Supreme Court jurist should look to the Constitution when rendering decisions.  scalia was hardly a literal purist; like so many extremists, he applied his personal form of theology to arrive at decisions when it suited him.  And scalia will enjoy little legacy, other than negative reviews.  The many poor decisions for which he can be blamed will be overturned in less time than it took him to setback democracy.</comment>

<comment>Negative reviews by such as you is one of the highest form of praise for Scalia's legacy as a Supreme Court Justice.</comment>

<comment>What does it say about our country's current political workings, that people can revel in the death of one of the nine arbiters for the simple reason that they feel he has such an effect on their lives?You think that is what this system always was and always should be?</comment>
