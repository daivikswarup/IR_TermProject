<comment>I love a GOP that tries to distance itself from the noise machine it created and (until recently) from which it benefitted, while also selling zombie economic policies and social values. Does anyone really want to live in a economic dead zone like South Carolina, Kansas and, in the not to distant future, Kentucky? Only if your looking for a reason to not advance economically or you just need to be in a circle jerk of rage boners.Keep flailing, Republican brothers and sisters, as America passes you by.Trump/Fetus Inajar '16!Make America 1850 Again!</comment>

<comment>You're a bit of a noise machine yourself. SC isn't a "dead zone". Companies, and northerners following them, continue to pour in. Nobody's moving to Ohio, NY, PA, NJ, MI, etc.</comment>

<comment>Companies aren't pouring into the South. There are certain cities that companies were moving headquarters due to the South's low tax, right to work policies. In most parts of the South it's desolate and impoverished. I live in South Georgia and there is little to no industry. When people say the South is thriving, they mean Atlanta, Raleigh, Charlotte, Dallas, Memphis, Nashville and Austin.</comment>

<comment>Or in other words, in the high tax areas which invest in public infrastructure and attract highly educated people.Which is why the American voters, in their infinite wisdom, constantly vote for lower taxes and prioritize partisan fighting over investments in public infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>"invest in public infrastructure and attract highly educated people"Not to mention the areas of the country where facts are real, not the invention of the "liberal media" or the "Kenyan in chief".  Amazing how much better things are economically when we deal with objective realities.</comment>

<comment>South Carolina receives $5.38 in federal spending for each $1 they pay in taxes.Nikki is dependent on Obama.https://wallethub.com/edu/stat...</comment>

<comment>That's generally true of the red states -- they take far more in federal handouts than do the blue states.</comment>

<comment>That's generally true of the red states -- they take far more in federal handouts than do the blue states.It's more accurate to say that rural areas receive more from urban ones; western NY is subsidized by NYC, inland California by coastal California, etc.</comment>

<comment>That's true to some extent, but much of federal aid is provided to state governments, and not smaller rural areas.</comment>

<comment>...and within states, you'll find that most state taxes come from their urban areas.All federal to state flows really tell you is about the relative urbanization of the states.In general, I find this kind of partisan sniping ill-founded.  It often consists of Democrats suddenly discovering that wealth is virtue and withholding money from the poor is justified when the wealthy regions lean Democratic and the poor ones Republican.Partisanship is very poor lens through which to view wealth transfers.</comment>

<comment>State v State is not partisan. Your point, which I agree with, is far more partisan. Rural areas are much more conservative than entire states are, and the opposite for urban areas.</comment>

<comment>I don't think this is purely partisan sniping.  The Democrats are the ones who are quite comfortable with transferring wealth, and it is the Republicans who called recipients of government assistance "takers".  I have no problem with poorer, rural, and Southern states receiving the bulk of federal funding -- what I do object to is hypocrisy and ingratitude.</comment>

<comment>This is a good point. The net transfers to  rural regions come from things like military bases, farm subsidies, federal land management expenses, disproportionate enrollment in Medicare and Social Security (due to an older rural population) and disproportionate enrollment in Medicaid (due to a poorer rural population).  With the possible exception of the last item, the Republican party has done very little griping about these and frankly fights to maintain most of them.Republican advocacy of spending cuts is more a signifier of affiliation than it is a policy.  Republicans in power have shown very little interest in cutting much spending, and the Republican base would likely oppose most meaningful cuts.</comment>

<comment>The transfers do accurately reflect the relative  success oof some regions policies.  </comment>

<comment>if anything, NYC is subsidized by WNY and CNY (Upstate). They pay huge sales and property taxes. The representation is downstate. They see very little attention.I lived in WNY for 26 years.http://www.whec.com/article/st...</comment>

<comment>Very few of us here in SC are dependent  on Obama. We depend first on THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY AND HIS SON JESUS CHRIST and monies that we paid out in taxes for many years, some of us for 70 years while the government lived lavishly on this money. At 85 I'm still paying taxes, property taxes, sale taxes, I pay taxes on everything except the "squeak of then wagon wheels."Many  of us worked for a living from age of about 8 when we were put in the fields of our fathers farms and did what was needed. We until we grew too old and feeble worked, payed taxes (we are receiving a little of that money, our money, now that we are old and can work, no longer)</comment>

<comment>So basically you're a mooch, and trying to make excuses... </comment>

<comment>LOL.(but seriously, If you can comment you probably can work. Some on this thread have made 4000$ an hour...)</comment>

<comment>Why, because I do not agree with you??? Is a Mooch someone who has always worked for what they got, that is not the definition that I got, my understanding is the opposite. Are you going to take your retirement when the time comes?   NO, no,not you, I'm sure!!!</comment>

<comment>No.  You live in SC which is a mooch state.  You're all a bunch of parasites. Working at 8 is child labor. It's amazing that you losers use child labor and are still so dependant on handouts. Takes a special kind of stupid to accomplish that </comment>

<comment>Sorry, Myrtle, but you rely on the US government, headed by the POTUS, Barack Obama.  You got no proof that your god or JC ever existed, so you certainly are not dependent upon them.When you pay out LESS in taxes than you receive, you are DEPENDENT on others.  And, at 85, you seem to have learned very little, sad to say.Accept it, you are a mooch.</comment>

<comment>No, I am a Christian a follower of GOD'S only begotten SON, JESUS CHRIST......You will meet them one day and realize that they are real and have control and will reward you for what you have done, good or/and evil!Obama is a taker not a giver, he wants to be dictator ogf the USA, I believe.I think you and I have had differences from way back, I have not changed, I serve the same GOD as I served back then. I do not rely Obama for anything but anti-CHRIST actions.By the way my late husband worked 40 years and paid taxes, died and received not one penny, from the government and I worked many years and paid taxes, that is what I am getting part of from the government.John 3:15 Whosoever believeth on HIM should not perish, but have eternal life.May GOD bless you and you will know HIM before it is time for you to leave the world!!Romans 10:13: For whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD shall be saved.</comment>

<comment>Oh please.  Barack Obama is a Christian too and he far better exemplifies Jesus' ideals than any so-called Christian right winger I have ever met.  The anti-Christ he is not.  Furthermore he looks to me like a man who is overjoyed to be getting out of the White House.  I'd bet you anything, if you offered him Dictator for Life plus a zillion $ he'd laugh his fanny off and run the other direction as fast as possible.  I've never seen a person take the kind of abuse he has, for the past 8 years.  The attacks on him are preposterous.  It's been an ugly spectacle.Enough already.  If you feel the government owes you money that is one thing.  Go see the government.  Better yet join the Democratic Party and work to improve and expand Social Security instead of trying to destroy it, like the Republicans, who really have no use for poor people.But for pete's sake don't keep spreading all this nonsense about Obama being the anti-Christ.  It's absurd.</comment>

<comment>There is no fool in the world that will believes that Obama is a Christian, Christians know better and those that follow Obama know better, too! He said himself, that he is a Muslim.1 John 2:4 He that saith I know HIM and keepeth not HIS commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</comment>

<comment>When did President Obama say he is a Muslim?  Do you have a respectable source?Anyway, please let me remind you that Jews, Christians and Muslims all worship the same god.  Muslims respect Jesus as a prophet.  Islam is based on the books of Christianity and Judaism, full stop.That is why Jews, Christians and Muslims are all called "people of the book."Muslims are not from some alien place.  Their religion most certainly evolved from ours.And, it's time we started caring for one another as Jesus exhorts us to do, and so many other good people.  Hatred and fear can bring nothing but misery.You know, it is easy to quote scripture.  It's a lot harder to live as we're supposed to live, to be righteous people.And bearing false witness is a serious offense.</comment>

<comment>The only fool here is yourself, Myrtle.  I know Obama to be a Christian, not that that matters.  I would much prefer it if all politicians kept their religion to theirselves.  And no, Obama never said that he was a Muslim, not that it matters.Poor delusional Myrtle.  Senility in action is so sad to see.</comment>

<comment>Poor delusional Myrtle.  There is no god.  There is no irrational judgement after death.Your delusions make you incapable of understanding President Obama, that is obvious.Myrtle, you are a financial burden on society, and have provided little to society.  Lining where you do, you certainly have not contributed your fair share of taxes, and now my taxes have to support you, so you could at least be nice and thank me.I am happy for you that the Bible gives you solace.  It is simply a collection of stories, written by men, and constantly contradicts itself.  I have no need to"be saved".  So sorry that you apparently do.</comment>

<comment>So find a field and some 8 year olds.</comment>

<comment>Except you've received way more in return for your taxes than what you paid in, as has every American recently.  The amount of extra that we received without paying for is our national debt.  For example, you received your share of a several trillion dollar invasion of Iraq, without paying a single penny for it.That's not to deny that you are hard working, religiously faithful, loving and generous.  You may well be all of these things.  But to believe that you have received less than what you have paid for in taxes is to delude yourself (as our brains are often wont to do).</comment>

<comment>You’re deluding yourself.  For example, even after adjusting for inflation, you’re taking about three times as much out of Medicare as you ever paid in.</comment>

<comment>As is most of the south </comment>

<comment>When people say the South is thriving, they mean Atlanta, Raleigh, Charlotte, Dallas, Memphis, Nashville and Austin.Well, yeah.  Cities tend to be the economic engines of any and every region, and the rural areas tend towards poverty.  This is true in most places, not just the south - inland California, eastern Oregon, western New York...  there are exceptions, like the oil and gas areas of the Dakotas, but as a rule, rural is poorer everywhere.</comment>

<comment>...and Houston.</comment>

<comment>Have you checked out the rural parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan lately???  Are any companies pouring into north, including cities?</comment>

<comment>Admittedly this is an anecdote, but there are so many biotech companies in this part of Cambridge that they are beginning to spread out into downtown neighborhoods in Boston:http://www.betaboston.com/news...</comment>

<comment>Indeed, neighborhoods and neighboring cities of Boston that were considered "unsafe" or "working-class" ten years ago now have average 1BR rentals of $2000/month or higher.  Somerville, Medford, Fenway, South Boston, Central Square, parts of Quincy, Braintree, Waltham, Watertown, etc.  Hell, they are building luxury developments in East Boston and Chelsea now!  It's driving rents higher as far afield as Providence and southern New Hampshire...</comment>

<comment>Isn't that called gentrification?</comment>

<comment>Pretty much.  Along those lines, Dorchester, usually considered one of Boston's *worst* neighborhoods (regardless of how one defines that term), just logged its first >$1 million house sale.</comment>

<comment>Although minimum wage in MA is now $9/hour and will go up to $11/hour by 2017, so at least wages are kinda keeping up with inflation, if not housing costs.</comment>

<comment>While the view along Memorial Drive comes in a VERY close second, I've long thought that the very best view of Boston is from the water's edge in Eastie.  That is, without doubt, a multimillion dollar view of downtown Boston's waterfront.</comment>

<comment>A good point.  There are some remarkable views from the hills spanning from Dorchester down to Quincy, too.  But the view from Eastie is one of a kind.  So is the airport noise.</comment>

<comment>True that, but do you think those enjoying their multi-hundreds/low-thousands per night stays at the luxury hotels "across the harbor" are not also "enjoying" the noise (however so much reduced) of Logan Airport?Many, many years ago one of my aunts & uncles visited me (not all that many years after I arrived in January, '95), and I took them to "Anthony's Pier 4" (that famous/notorious/no longer existing, restaurant in South Boston).  We were seated at a table that had a very nice view of Boston Harbor (from the strongest perspective of those from "downtown"), and I then knew, immediately, why the folks in Eastie standing on their water's edge were SO much more visibly rewarded than was ANYONE, who instead assumed the best view of Boston was to be found by looking out of "downtown Boston" out at the harbor!  :)</comment>

<comment>I don't quite follow.  Aside from the stuff at the airport, I'm not really aware of any hotels, luxury or otherwise, in East Boston.  There have been places put in the Seaport District (Southie waterfront), along Atlantic Ave downtown and the North End, the Mandarin Oriental in Back Bay, the second Four Seasons going in on the Christian Science campus, but I can't really think of any hotels on the East Boston waterfront.  EDIT: never mind; I just realized you are talking about the new hotels on the waterfront in downtown and Southie that look out at the airport.  Never mind.I miss the hell out of Pier 4.  That place was great.  Inimitable: the giant entrance hall of pictures of the generations of famous people who ate there - presidents, popes, movie stars, musicians, etc.  The seafood held its own, no small feat in an area with such an embarrassment of great seafood options.  Pretty staggering views of downtown.  And a wine list that was like 60 pages long.  And it's going to be replaced by another anonymous, 15 to 20 story glass apartment cube where a 500 square foot studio will run you at least $3k per month.  Blech!  We'll just have to go to one of the freaking 11 (eleven) Legal Sea Foods that are inside the Boston City limits now.  I swear, at some point the only food options left in Boston will be Dunkin Donuts, Legal Sea Foods, and Whole Foods.</comment>

<comment>Devra First (the just now promoted to top/chief editor (whatever her title now is) of the Food Section of the Boston Globe), back when she was the Globe's restaurant critic used to decry the fact that while Boston has truly amazing (world class, to be honest) access to excellent seafood, it had only one or two (sort of) home-grown/local restaurants that truly celebrated local seafood (and no, she did not regard any of the local Legal Seafoods chain outlets as representative of that.)I myself have only once or twice gone to a Legal Seafoods restaurant (one of which was in Baltimore, another city justly famous for its seafood.)  I have found their seafood to be appropriate (& most certainly edible), but by no means special.I am also good friends with one Anthony's server, and also good friends with someone else who years ago had another friend who was an Anthony's server.  From what I gather, that restaurant chain has a horrific reputation among Boston's restaurant worker community.  I believe I am reliably informed that the "Anthony's" managers are not in the least interested in good leadership.  If they find their workers sufficiently lagging in production, their response is the iconic, "The beatings will continue until morale improves!"  :(  </comment>

<comment>Don't get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with Legal Seafoods at all.  Not to mention that the organization has almost always led the way on responsible fishing practices, ensuring quality control throughout the supply chain, making sure fish are not purposefully mislabeled (a common deception), banning all GMO seafood from their stores, and on and on.  And thanks to their size, their leadership in these practices matters.  But 11 places just in Boston?  Some of which are gargantuan at that.  To be honest, some of their locations are one-offs with unique menus, which is another thing I like.  And one or two even have fish markets for your home cooking needs.  But still to be honest, I have to say I've always preferred McCormick and Schmick's.  And any number of one-location local places up and down the New England coast.  And Pier 4, of course!And most of Boston's most celebrated restaurants still do not primarily focus on local seafood.  To paint in broad strokes, it's steakhouses, fusion, and French.</comment>

<comment>The fine dining scene is more complex than that (you admitted you were broad brushing), but you're absolutely right that almost none of them (there is Island Creek Oyster Bar in Kenmore Square area) focus on seafood.  (Todd English used to have a seafood restaurant at Faneuil Hall but it closed along with the collapse of pretty much everything in Boston English used to have.)</comment>

<comment>"I don't quite follow. Aside from the stuff at the airport, I'm not really aware of any hotels, luxury or otherwise, in East Boston. "I apologize for not making myself more clear.Nothing in East Boston now is of the luxury that its views ought to earn (most definitely including the hotels on the grounds of Logan International Airport).  What I meant to assert (which I obviously failed to do) was that, in another universe with the same geography, the view of downtown Boston offered by the East Boston waterfront would have - decades ago - caused that East Boston landscape to be insanely built up into super-expensive high-rise luxury apartment/condo buildings because (possibly aside from the views of Boston afforded by Cambridge residences along Memorial Drive) there are NO better views of downtown Boston than those visible from the East Boston waterfront!</comment>

<comment>No, my sluggish brain processed it after I wrote the comment.  I think East Boston has more or less always been industrial at heart, going right back to when Donald McKay was building his world-beating clipper ships there in the 1850's and 1860's.  But they couldn't build high-rises over there because of its proximity to Logan; the FAA wouldn't allow it.  Over in the Seaport District in Southie, no one can build over about 20 stories or so for the same reason.  Before the recession, a developer wanted to put up a 1,000 tower with a 200 foot spire on it in somewhere in the Financial District or Downtown Crossing.  He would have had to fight the FAA, too.  But the views in East Boston are amazing.  See also: why the Charlestown Navy Yard is now full of expensive condos and townhouses.  I can think of a few middle-class towns 20 miles away from Boston where people have put huge McMansions on top of east-facing hills, because they can still see the city at a distance.</comment>

<comment>You're absolutely correct about the height restrictions, but there are top of the line hotels & condos on the other side of the harbor in downtown Boston, even with the height restrictions.</comment>

<comment>Rumor is General Electric, one of the largest companies on Earth, will announce it is relocating its global headquarters to Boston tomorrow.EDIT:  GE has confirmed it is moving to Boston.  Again, that's General Electric: $285 billion market cap, $150 billion in revenue - moving to Boston.</comment>

<comment>Northern states have learnt how to play the tax incentive game, but sadly it's our collective demerit.Well I guess if you can't beat them might as well join them.</comment>

<comment>Its jet engine plant has long been in Lynn, MA.  (Yes, "Lynn, Lynn, the city of sin, yadda, yadda, yadda, so goes the rest of the ditty."), but that GE has decided it's better off moving its corporate headquarters from Connecticut to Boston?THAT is news indeed!</comment>

<comment>It's had assorted other manufacturing concerns around the Bay State - I think Pittsfield used to more or less be a GE company town once upon a time - but that facility in Lynn is massive.  And Boston beat out NYC for the relocation;-)  Yankees suck!  Yankees suck!</comment>

<comment>:)Having grown up in the Philadelphia area, I can assure that while they have only played against the Yankees a very few times, most often to painful defeat, Philadelphia Phillies fans hate the Yankees at least as passionately as Red Sox fans do.After all, even though Boston is TINY compared to the size of Philadelphia, which of those cities is the more famous?  All the more reason for Philadelphians to despise New Yorkers on a much more visceral basis.;)</comment>

<comment>Yes, Boston has about one-third the population of Philadelphia... but according to wiki, Boston is also roughly one-third the geographic size of Philadelphia, at less than 50 square miles (excluding water within the city limits, like Boston Harbor) to about 150 square miles.  And the Boston Combined Statistical Area has nearly one million more people than the Philly Combined Statistical Area.  Strangely enough, Boston's CSA is the 6th largest in the US.  Just NYC, LA, Chicago, DC-Baltimore, and SF-Silicon Valley are larger.</comment>

<comment>I'd venture to guess "metro Boston" (shorter to type ;) ) wasn't always that much larger than metro Philadelphia, but I'm not surprised it's larger now.Even without traffic it takes a good 30 mins. driving at least 50mph the whole way to travel on I-95 from Philly's southern edge (just beyond the airport) to its northeastern edge with Bucks County.</comment>

<comment>If you genuinely thought the South were doing well, you wouldn’t be derailing an article about a speech by the governor of South Carolina to talk about how the North is a blasted hellhole.  Is that how bad you have to imagine your rivals are to believe you’re better?  Is there some positive record of accomplishment you could be talking about?But, yes, total private employment in the cities of the north have been growing steadily since 2009.  The Small Business Administration tracks Statistics of U.S. Businesses, and almost the only states that didn’t see an increase between 2011 and 2012, the most recent year for which they publish their data, were Arkansas and Missouri.</comment>

<comment>Chief it was a response to someone else's comment...But the facts are conclusive, south and west is where it's at...</comment>

<comment>The Sun Belt is where people are moving to, including some very blue states such as California and some red ones such as Texas.  Income per person is highest in states where a few people are sitting on top of a lot of oil, and after them, in blue states.   Growth in income per person doesn’t really lend itself to a pat story about how one part of the country or one party’s platform is better.</comment>

<comment>California has averaged less than 1% population growth per year since 2000, far lower than many other southern and western states.</comment>

<comment>More than half a million people moved there in 2014, more than any other states but Florida and Texas.  California is the most populous state, so half a million is only 1% of 50 million.  But a lot of people are moving there.</comment>

<comment>I think you need to look for another source for your information.  Your numbers are incorrect.</comment>

<comment>My source is the U.S. Census Bureau.</comment>

<comment>Interesting because when I go to census.gov it shows a growth of 378,000 from 2013 to 2014, while estimating growth of 352,000 in 2015.</comment>

<comment>I wasn’t looking at population growth, but the number of residents who were living in another state a year ago.  Population increase would be lower due to emigration.</comment>

<comment>In any case, measuring migration to California as a percentage of its population is misleading, because California is the most-populated state.</comment>

<comment>I don't have a map handy, but I'm pretty sure those are all in the south.</comment>

<comment>You missed the point, which was that some southern cities are doing OK, whereas the rural areas aren't.</comment>

<comment>which can be said about pretty much everywhere on the planet</comment>

<comment>To be fair, you can say the same thing for most of the big blue states too. Some large metros are okay, while the rest of the state is struggling. NY is great in NYC but upstate is a series of small Detroit type cities and rural areas that are probably just as poor as South Georgia.</comment>

<comment>Not true.  Here is the map of per-capita personal income by county.  Except for northern Michigan, the rural counties of the northeast are far ahead of the south, although the Great Plains states seem to be doing the best.</comment>

<comment>Interesting. I'd be curious to see cost of living factored in to determine the real comparisons (property taxes alone are insane up here).  But regardless, I suppose the point would be better stated that here in the northeast the rural and rust belt areas are not experiencing the same level of prosperity as the major cities.</comment>

<comment>Yes, companies have been, are, and continue to pour into the South. You live in RURAL GA! Get real man.</comment>

<comment>i live in camden county in s georgia and its booming here</comment>

<comment>Northerners? You mean migrants right? But I thought they were bad. Build a wall around SC now!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, NYC is a real economic dead zone.  Mmm hmm.  And I was recently in one of Ohio's larger cities: new office park construction was going on everywhere.</comment>

<comment>Cheap labor costs because they exploit workers.  No unions, no environmental concerns, a little bit of China right here in the United States.</comment>

<comment>That was some great word soup.  Do you work in a soup kitchen? </comment>

<comment>Try reading instead of ranting. Read about the labor movement in this country, or even rad "The Jungle" or "Ragtime" to see what life was like before labor unions. Education is a wonderful thing. </comment>

<comment>I was born in 1936, and saw firsthand the unions commit suicide by their abusive demands which drove industries abroad from Americas shores!</comment>

<comment>Big business will always find the cheapest way to operate. If they can move to China, pay workers next to nothing, and have unsafe working conditions, that is what they will do. It is not the fault of the unions, it is the greed of the CEOs.</comment>

<comment>A person buying an auto or a home will always try to get them as cheap as possible, right?A business is not formed and maintained for the benefit of the employees!</comment>

<comment>You have some truth there, and apparently your job is coming here, too.</comment>

<comment>Retired, and before that I was in management, although I started my career in a union job. There was no animosity between union members and management. Next?</comment>

<comment>Next? The subject is the way it was before you retired and your dystopian fantasy about South Carolina.</comment>

<comment>I don't have a dystopian fantasy about the state, but I do believe that unions protect wages and working conditions.</comment>

<comment>Neither party has an economic plan that even views our situation honestly, so I don't really see a point of difference there.You've got a point on social issues, depending on the candidate.  I can't believe they still haven't turned that corner completely in 2016.</comment>

<comment>Given the economic performance of the two sides that's wrong too.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, history has borne out that the laissez-faire economic policies of the GOP that favor the wealthy and slash regulations simply lead to out of control markets, the destruction of the middle class, and a poisoned landscape.</comment>

<comment>It would be hyperbole to refer to Republican economic policies as laissez-faire.Both parties leagues away from even acknowledging the problem.  They might not be equal, but they're close enough for it to not matter.  Especially if we're talking about Clinton.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry...Are these not the same Republicans who can't take a breath without j*rking off to "market-based solutions"?</comment>

<comment>I don't know.  Are they the same ones that seem to push for corporate welfare at every turn?  That's not very 'free-market', now is it?</comment>

<comment>No, but Republicans are nothing if they're not inconsistent.</comment>

<comment>Care to mention which elements of the Republican Economic plan you agree with?</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure there are any.  I just recognize that it is possible to have too much regulation (or too little), and I recognize that it is immensely possible for taxes to be too high or too low.  I think it's pointless to demagogue either party for a blanket stance.Bring one point to the debate, and we can settle it, or at least come to an understanding of our differences.</comment>

<comment>"I think it's pointless to demagogue either party for a blanket stance."Aren't you demagoguing both parties with a blanket stance? The whole pox on both is fun, but intellectually lazy.</comment>

<comment>I said that I haven't seen anything from either party that remotely addresses our current economic problems.</comment>

<comment>This is precisely what I expected to see. You don't really know much about the parties' differing stances just that they exist and that moderation is vaguely considered better practice.In other words, you're saying neither is better whilst not really knowing either side's stance or history.Republican's believe in "voodoo" economics. Lower taxes with the expressed intent being higher overall economic activity resulting in more tax revenue. This has been in practice for the past 30 years (post-Reagan) and has been completely debunked for the lie that it is/was.Lowering taxes on corporations and higher income/wealthier citizens does not result in increased investment in the United States to generate the higher economic activity making up for the lost direct tax revenue. It just results in significantly larger bank accounts for the wealthy and increased investments overseas where the lack of direct taxes/centralized governments/worker protections and environmental regulations result in cheaper labor/property costs. This results in the wealth inequality that we see today and the inability for the government to pay for it's services.The government accruing debt actually ends up favoring republican dogma however, since they shift the blame from their own bankrupt economic policies onto the poor and social services of the government. i.e. Slash Social Security, continue with the military budget.They're not equals, they shouldn't be treated with equal amounts of disdain and to pretend otherwise is to not know what you're talking about.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for taking the time to explain to me what you don't think I know.  Too bad you're entirely wrong.The Republicans are mostly a disaster.  The Democrats are slightly less so.Neither address or even acknowledge the basic underlying problem in our economy- the fact that we simply have no need for ~20% of our labor supply, and that number will only grow as we move forward.</comment>

<comment>So differences in the economic platforms of the two major parties don't warrant discussion because economics to you boils down to automation. Something you assume neither side knows about I might add.Only furthering my initial estimation so far William.</comment>

<comment>They don't warrant my attention.  Especially when we're going to get one side or the other, regardless.Economics, as they relate to average Americans, mainly boils down to employment.</comment>

<comment>Ah, the game is rigged so who cares? Just Team Blue or Team Red amiright?If this is your attitude I Strongly recommend you stop commenting as if the two parties are similar because you genuinely don't know enough about either to care.</comment>

<comment>How hard is it for you to post something even remotely constructive?It doesn't have to be 'rigged' to understand that only the two teams in the Superbowl have a chance to win it.The two parties are similar enough economically for it to not matter to me.  If you have a hard time accepting others' opinions, perhaps the duty is on you to stop reading them, rather than on me to stop writing them.If, instead, you have any actual point of difference between them that you want to discuss, please feel free.  Otherwise, you're wasting both of ours' time.</comment>

<comment>I stated, in a rather lengthy comment, that my issue with you is you masquerading around as if you care about the different economic policies between the two parties and have decided there's just not enough differences to warrant discussion when in reality you just don't care to learn about either side.You're a fraud in short. But worse than that you're a pompous fraud who seems to believe you have a leg to stand on when you claim "The two parties are similar enough economically for it to not matter to me."</comment>

<comment>So that's a big "No" when it comes to having any specific issue or point of difference you want to discuss?You must really like the sound of your typing.  Please, though- if it makes you feel better, carry on with your personal attacks =)</comment>

<comment>Excuse me, my second comment has three paragraphs of specific economic differences between the parties, you've yet to provide anything at all with which to debate. Your stated knowledge of economics so far is that automation is a job killer and an economic concern.If you're interested in having a debate on your point that the two parties don't have substantively different economic policies by all means defend your claim. So far you've been nothing but an unjustified purveyor of false equivalency.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I didn't know I was supposed to seriously consider a point that started off with 'voodoo' economics.I think anyone can generally agree that the trend line when comparing business growth and investment to tax rates is a curve- the argument being where we are at on the curve, and whether it is the government's job to goose the economy through adjusting tax rates.I think a case can be made for corporate tax breaks specifically for businesses that make a new investment here- it is a common tactic at the local level to entice businesses.  That said, I don't see any value in cutting marginal business or individual tax rates domestically when we're running a deficit.I don't agree much with you in regard to the cause of income inequality being low taxes per se- inequality is generated through a snowball effect that occurs around capital, and our government has not taken the steps  needed to alleviate that effect.  (Which would of course require both higher taxes and different priorities.)Our social services budget (which has nothing to do with Medicare or SS) is a sad joke.  That said, Democrats seem largely willing to continue along doling out just enough to attract those that can't survive without the scraps, without ever really going all-in to end problems like generational poverty.At times, I wonder whether having an expansive military hasn't been a bigger economic boon to the lower class than our paltry social support system.Lastly, for all the attacks you've levied here....  You be taken more seriously if you dropped the 'talking points' BS like 'voodoo economics' and the 'Republicans want to slash Social Security' lies and stupid arguments like 'lower domestic taxes promote overseas expansion'.</comment>

<comment>For the most part you're in line which much of my feelings on economics.You lost me however with your final point, voodoo economics is an appropriate term (levied by a republican no-less, Bush #1) when the doctrine is based on wishful thinking (if not outright lies) that have been proven incorrect. Cutting taxes does not increase government revenue, it doesn't operate on a curve.Republicans do in fact want to cut Social Security, many of the Republicans running for president have suggested it so I'm surprised you seem to think that was just a talking point. And finally, do find a quote of mine where I suggest lower taxes promotes overseas expansion. If I did anything close to suggesting such a thing it would have been from rushing through a large economic platform in one comment. Overseas expansion is done to avoid nominally higher taxes here in the U.S. without the tariffs to protect them. The lower taxes companies are looking for would be overseas which would justify my point.Finally, I'd like acknowledgement that you're discussing your personal views on economics and not defending the claim that the 2 parties have equivalent economic stances.</comment>

<comment>So, you're saying that if we raised taxes to 95%, we would just collect tons more money?  People that could afford to wouldn't just move, or at the least, move much more of their assets into shelters?I've never said they were equivalent...  I've said that, in the scope of the action we need, they are functionally equivalent.  It's like...  If I were drowning, Republicans would pull me down a little.  Democrats would lift me up till my hair was out of the water.</comment>

<comment>So you're saying if I distort your position to an extreme your position might not hold up anymore? Cute attempt but utterly baseless. No, taxing at 95%, something no one proposes, would not result in the government taking in "tons more money". At least in the long term as would seem obvious, in the short term yes, it would take in "tons more money" but with obvious side effects.As for never claiming they were equivalent... you literally turned right around and claimed they were equivalent again. I get your point that you don't see ENOUGH of a difference but even that is a capitulation from your previous position and it too is incorrect.You have an FDR model, which admittedly has been bastardized by the likes of the Clintons and Third Way Democrats, and you have the Reagan model. One was disastrous, the other brought us out of a depression and sustained a middle-class for 35 years. The two aren't equivalent, and shouldn't be treated or discussed as equivalent. i.e. my original point.</comment>

<comment>I think the Presidents talking and moves to increase education have addressed that, haven't they? i.e. he's certainly spent a lot of time talking about the changing markets. I guess you can claim the GOP's fear of immigrants taking all those amazing field work jobs is also along the same lines.</comment>

<comment>Increasing education certainly isn't bad, but it doesn't really address labor oversupply, unless he's planning on paying people to not work while they're in school.  We don't need the people we have now to meet the production we need, and the ratio will only get worse as we move forward.  Short of a Butlerian Jihad, we need a complete change in mindset.Immigrants are (in the sense that they increase the labor force, same as births), and aren't part of the problem.  Sure, having less labor overall would ease some of the problems, and it would eventually drive wages up, but it's still a half-measure.The ratio of (people needed to produce) / (people needed to consume) has been growing more and more out of wack over the last 40+ years.  Unless we create a solution to the people that aren't needed as labor, the problem will get worse and worse as we add people.The old thought was, 'adding people people increases demand', and that is/was true.  The trouble is, adding 100 people only produces enough demand to employ 10 of them.  In real world terms- how many additional people are needed at an Apple Store to sell an extra 1,000 iPads in a year?  Probably none.</comment>

<comment>You're 100% right, but probably spitting into the wind.Most commentators here are either too welded to tribal politics or too obsessed with a few pet issues to really take a long step back and realistically evaluate the two major political parties on the economy.</comment>

<comment>That's even more BS. One first has to figure out what you are talking about.</comment>

<comment>"It would be hyperbole to refer to Republican economic policies as laissez-faire."But the republicans are sure trying for it to happen, and have been doing so for many many decades.Your insistence on both-siderism is shows a deep ignorance of the facts - either by accident, or laziness.Or you are just full of crap.</comment>

<comment>Simply removing some environmental or worker regulations is not the same as supporting laissez-faire.   Republicans are neck-deep in favor-trading and crony capitalism.Feel free to believe whatever you will about me.</comment>

<comment>"Simply removing some environmental or worker regulations is not the same as supporting laissez-faire."If we had laissez-faire to the degree we did in the past, the lack of environmental and  worker regulations would be near the top of their agenda - again.Read your history.Regulations were enacted for damned good reasons. Who benefits from removing them, huh? Who!?</comment>

<comment>It's not so much the degree, as the intent.  Republicans aren't seeking to free the markets, they are seeking to direct profits toward their donors in the markets.In some cases, yes.  In some cases, they were enacted in fits of cronyism in order to drive competitors out of business.Virtually nothing is all one thing.In any case, you seem to have next to zero comprehension of what I'm saying.  I'll be generous and assume it's because you've spent too much time arguing with rabid partisans.Democrats are not pure in their urges to create regulation, and Republicans are not pure in their desire to strip them away.  I simply will not be conned into believing that the letter next to someone's name is the best way to tell what their intentions are.</comment>

<comment>Right, and Republican Texas with its projected 5.2% growth in GDP (even with a struggling energy sector) demonstrates "zombie economic policies".You know, this is exactly what Nikki Haley and President Obama were alluding to last night. Die-hard partisan jackasses such as yourself who see everything in such black and white terms that success and failure is defined by the letters R and D. Toddlers don't think in such limited terms.</comment>

<comment>Man, all those immigrants are really bringing down Texas's economy.Btw, Texas growth is now down to 1.4%. But the State has done a reasonable job with diversification so it won't be as bad as the Dakotas...</comment>

<comment>Where do I state in my comment any opposition to immigration? Don't invent arguments for your opponents.</comment>

<comment>Texas isn’t doing badly; its rate of real per-capita GDP growth over the past twenty years is about the same as California’s, and better than the national average, although not as good as New York’s.  If Texas had especially good public policy, we would expect to see higher growth in income per person, and not just in population, and we would expect to see it over a long period of time, since Texas has been a low-tax state for decades.  But that isn’t what happened.  Texas is a state that’s grown a lot in population, not in income per person.Texas does a lot of things right.  The facts that so many people want to move there, and that the local government allows them to build houses there instead of making homes more expensive to benefit existing homeowners, are real points in its favor.  Blue states, and especially cities such as San Francisco, could learn from that example.</comment>

<comment>It is really ironic to see someone from Ohio say that the South Carolina economy is a 'dead zone.'You do realize, right,  that people from Ohio are moving to South Carolina in massive numbers?  Hell I wish everyone from Ohio thought SC had a bad economy, then maybe y'all would stay in Ohio and stop moving here.</comment>

<comment>That is patently absurd. Ohio's GDP is over 500 billion and would rank somewhere around the 25th largest in the world if it were a separate nation. South Carolina's is 160 billion. They are not even comparable.Ohio's labor force is more than twice as large, has nearly three times the manufacturing jobs and three times the number of workers in white collar fields like finance, education & healthcare, and "professional & business services." Unless we are moving down there to mine, I see no data that would indicate a sector of the South Carolina economy that is in better shape than Ohio's.</comment>

<comment>You either have a low bar for absurdity or a dogmatic adherence to happy stats. Price an acre of land in each state and let us know. Every southern state is flooded with Northern economic refugees, now living in McMansions with an acre of land. I hear them in the voting lines, saying how much better it is here than there. (While I think, "It was even better before you got here and brought your traffic").</comment>

<comment>Well, when the conversation is that droves of Ohioans are moving to South Carolina to work it seems statistics about jobs might be relevant. And given that our rates of employment in nearly every desirable job market are higher than South Carolina's with a lower over all unemployment rate to boot (4.5 to 5.5) it seems like a pretty absurd idea to pretend that South Carolina has a better economy than Ohio.You are right though, our retirees sure do enjoy buying up your land and living out the remainder of their years in the low-tax environment of the south. As do our wealthy who enjoy spending their free time on your coast. I appreciate that you guys like to subsidize our luxuries at the expense of your children's futures like that.</comment>

<comment>Working-age Ohioans, as well as everywhere-elsians, are indeed moving here and claim to love it. If you're right, that's not actually happening. But it is happening, despite statistics apparently existing which say it shouldn't. But again, it is.</comment>

<comment>you don't seem to realize that owners of non-primary residences in south carolina pay substantially more property taxes.   So it's the other way around,  your wealthy are subsidizing our children's futures.</comment>

<comment>That must explain why y'all keep moving here, because the economy is so strong in Ohio that people just can't handle the intensity.</comment>

<comment>So Trump is Bin Ladin?  Nice.</comment>

<comment>You missed the point.  It was a counterexample to show that the logical structure of the above argument is faulty.Dems and Repubs both hate child-rapists.  Does this imply that child-rapists are "doing something right"?  Obviously not.</comment>

<comment>Except the people also disapprove of the job he is doing.http://www.gallup.com/poll/116...</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about Trump.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for clarifying that, I assumed because this was an article about Nikki Haley's response to Obama's State of the Union speech that when you say "him" you meant the President and not some media personality.</comment>

<comment>If anyone but Trump gets the nod, she might have just carved herself out a VP spot.</comment>

<comment>But how is "the base" reacting to her speech? Are they buying any of it, or are they still sold on Trump's Anger Train?</comment>

<comment>Trump has never even approached 50% of 'the base', so I'm not sure why everyone is so eager to tie the two together.</comment>

<comment>The base understands immigrants mean welfare and that means votes for the Democrats.  Only the moneyed interests and maybe a tiny part of the religious group want more immigrants from the places we get most of our immigrants.http://www.usatoday.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>You might want to read the article you linked a little more closely:</comment>

<comment>The last line you quoted summarizes it nicely:"Immigrants who have been in the U.S. more than 20 years use welfare less often, but their rates remain higher than native-born households."They are more likely to use welfare when they come here and 20 years later they are still more likely to use welfare.</comment>

<comment>To be clear, the report itself does not distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants, although a "forthcoming" report will break it down by legal status. From the CIS summary:In other words, the vast majority of these immigrants are here legally and are using programs they have a right to - whether as long-term residents or citizens - so I fail to see the problem.Besides, from a policy perspective, you can't just stop at "immigrants use more welfare, we need to impose restrictions." For example, does the increase in GDP that occurs with allowing immigration offset the costs of welfare usage? Most empirical evidence points to "yes," which is why there's a strong consensus in favor of immigration amongst economists: it's particularly strong for high-skilled immigrants, but even low-skilled ones as well.</comment>

<comment>To be clear I never used any other term than "immigrant".  The legal status of them is irrelevant to this discussion which heretofore had only been about welfare usage.Also, when 51% of them are taking from the economy in terms of welfare I have difficulty believing the remaining 49% earn enough to offset that, especially when you consider each child one of these immigrants has likely costs the taxpayers $10k a year to educate. If we were talking about only doctors and engineers, sure, but most of our immigrants are low skill, low education.</comment>

<comment>Well, luckily you don't have to "believe" at all, as there's a wealth of empirical research on fiscal impacts of immigration. Here's a fantastic survey of the various economic impacts of immigration, with overviews of studies looking at various countries. When it comes to fiscal impact, immigrants tend to have a slightly negative or slightly positive impact on public finances, depending on assumptions, econometric methods, etc. - around 1% of GDP or less, to put it in perspective.In this study, when looking at census records from 1980 to 2000, it was shown that "each immigrant creates 1.2 local jobs for local workers, most of them going to native workers, and 62% of these jobs are in non-traded services. Immigrants appear to raise local non-tradables sector wages and to attract native-born workers from elsewhere in the country."I also find it odd that you look at schooling as a sort of black hole for taxpayer money, as though it were some sort of soup kitchen or something, instead of a way to educate these immigrants and thus increase their human capital, allowing them to contribute more to the economy (both locally and globally). Here's a good study examining the costs of migration restrictions in the global economy.If you want more studies, I'll be happy to dig them up.</comment>

<comment>12 years of public education costs the taxpayers $120,000 on average.  If the result of that is a minimum wage job earner society has lost a lot of money.Earnings: $7.25 * 40 * 52 = $15,080 per yearTaxes: 15.3% payroll tax = 2307.25 per yearFederal tax*:  $478 per yearState tax: variable, but assume it's high and you pay another $478Sales tax:  Assume you spend $10k at 7%= $700So best case you're paying $4000 a year in taxes.  Unfortunately $120,000 at 2% interest and a 40 year loan term is $4350 a year, so society never gets back the initial investment.And it gets even worse because $15,080 a year in income qualifies you for Medicare which means the taxpayers will be providing paying an average of an additional $3,247 a year to you.  Then you have to figure out what other welfare programs they'll get and then remember they'll get Social Security and Medicare benefits when they retire.  Which means they end up costing the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars that never get recovered in taxes.http://kff.org/medicaid/state-...* H&R Block estimate of federal taxes for a single filer and no dependents  and no deductions</comment>

<comment>Around 4% of hourly paid workers earn the federal minimum wage or less (that so few work for minimum wage or less is one of the many reasons economists tend to be skeptical of its efficacy as a tool to fight poverty, particularly when compared to alternatives like an expansion of EITC). In other words, the likelihood is that these folks are going to be making above minimum wage.I don't know why you're focusing on this detailed hypothetical scenario when we have mountains of empirical evidence assessing the various impacts of immigration (fiscal, employment, wages, etc.), which I've already linked, and which rather consistently show immigration as having a very slight fiscal impact: ±1% of GDP.</comment>

<comment>Now exclude the H1B and skilled worker Visa immigrants from those studies and tell me what you end up with when you're only considering the asylum immigrants and the lottery immigrants and the illegal immigrants (mostly from Central America).  Because that is the policy we are discussing, whether bringing in a  bunch of asylum seekers from Syria is a good idea.Even with those skilled workers realize 28.1% of immigrants don't even have a high school education.  Do you really think those sort of folks with a cultural and language barrier on top of no education are really going to be earning more than minimum wage?  26% only have a high school education.http://cis.org/node/3876#attai...</comment>

<comment>Well, good news: empirical evidence shows even better results for asylum seekers and refugees than general immigrants.Here's a study showing that "in 1980 refugee immigrants in this cohort [immigrants who arrived in the US from 1975 to 1980] earned 6 percent less and worked 14 percent fewer hours than economic immigrants. Both had about the same level of English skills. The two immigrant groups had made substantial gains by 1990; however, refugees had made greater gains. In fact, the labor market outcomes of refugee immigrants surpassed those of economic immigrants. In 1990, refugees from the 1975-1980 arrival cohort earned 20 percent more, worked 4 percent more hours, and improved their English skills by 11 percent relative to economic immigrants. The higher rates of human capital accumulation for refugee immigrants contribute to these findings."Here's research into the status of refugees in Uganda, and here's on looking at refugees that have settled in Cleveland. Both show positive results allowing refugees in.Here's a detailed look into the effects of non-European immigration in Denmark, summarized here.Here's a CBO report from 2013 on the effects of lessening immigration restrictions, which found that "Real GDP would be greater by 3.3 percent in 2023 and by 5.4 percent in 2033 if the bill was enacted, according to CBO’s central estimates of the overall economic impact of the legislation... the economic effects of the legislation that are not incorporated in the cost estimate would increase federal budget deficits by about $30 billion over the 2014–2018 period and decrease deficits by about $30 billion from 2019 through 2023, leaving the deficit roughly unchanged for the 2014–2023 period. For the next decade, 2024 through 2033, the economic effects of the legislation that are not incorporated in the cost estimate would reduce federal budget deficits by about $300 billion."</comment>

<comment>I'm going to respond only to your Cleveland study because I think it gets to the heart of the problem, namely that you're counting benefits without examining costs.In 2012 it claims $2,709,084 in State and municipal tax benefits from  4,518 refugees. This sounds real nice, until you realize that 19% of them were under 4, which means taxpayers will bear the cost of educating 858 children at a 2012 cost of $15,000 each. That amounts to $12.87 million or 4.75 times the annual tax benefit. But it gets worse because 28% were between 5 and 19 and assuming an even distribution those 17 and under add another 1096 kids you have to public school, or $16.4 million.  So you got $2.7 million in taxes and spent $29 million just on school fees. Seeing the problem here?But that is just the start of your costs.  It indicated that 2 years after arrival 73.5% of refugees were employed.  That means 26.5%, or 634, rounding down, aren't.  Guess what, that makes them and their children eligible for Medicaid, at an average cost in FY 2011 in Ohio of $4,225 per adult and  $2,110 per child.   So that's another $2.7 million for the adults and assuming a normal distribution of the dependent kids 17 and under another 517 which is $1.1 million.  And how much are the employed ones actually earning, because some of them are going to qualify for Medicaid as well.  Then we add in all the other welfare and social costs your study doesn't mention.In other words, you claim economic benefits, but don't lay out the costs.  And the costs are utterly staggering, in the tens of millions in just one county for just educating children.http://www.cleveland.com/metro...http://kff.org/report-section/...</comment>

<comment>So you choose to zero in on one study and then proceed to do more of your own number crunching. Why do you continually ignore the several peer-reviewed studies I have posted at this point that have factored in such costs - among many others - when examining the fiscal impacts of immigration.Studies repeatedly show that immigration tends to have a fiscal impact of ±1% of GDP when looked at over several years, if not decades. The fiscal impact of immigration tends to be slightly positive or negative; if you're going to argue for immigration restrictions, the fiscal viewpoint is simply not a sound approach, given the large body of empirical evidence that says otherwise.Hell, even George Borjas's research shows minor impacts, and he's probably one of the handful of notable immigration "skeptics," for want of a better term, among mainstream economists.Anyway, I think we're done here; I've provided more than a half-dozen studies from peer-reviewed sources, you're providing Cleveland.com articles and doing your own number crunching, or else relying on a think tank that advocates for immigration restrictions.</comment>

<comment>I notice you don't address any of my specific criticisms of your Cleveland study.  So, lets try again with the Federal one.  Your CBO study contains the same flaw as the Cleveland one in that it doesn't actually specify the program by program costs at all levels of government.  Just like in Cleveland it mentions all the nice things about tax income and increased spending in the economy, but it doesn't tell me how much it cost to get us that.  51% of immigrants are on welfare.  What is that going to cost?The children they have cost on average $10k per year to put through a public school.  12 years of that and a 2% interest rate with a 49 year loan period means society needs to recover $319.12 a month in taxes just to break even on that initial investment.  A minimum wage worker never generates enough tax revenue to do that.  Ever.  Starting work at 21 earning $15080 a year until age 67 you'll be paying less than $200 a month into Social Security and medicare, but will begin drawing $904 a month out when you retire.  And you'll be eligible for all sorts of things like Medicaid along the way.  I don't see these costs reflected.  Sure, some of these kids are going to be professional athletes, or rappers, or businessmen or scientists and earn way more than minimum wage, but many won't.Ultimately here is the very scary thing in that CBO study:"Under the full range of estimates, the bill could lower per capitaGNP in 2033 by as much as 0.2 percent or raise it by as much as 0.6 percent"Increasing our total economic output doesn't help much if everyone's collective share of it decreases, does it?  So potentially our per capita GNP decreases by 0.2% and you're trying to sell me immigration is some wonderful economic boon?  Sorry, but our government sucks at figuring out the long term cost and benefit of any policies.  I don't see enough detail in the CBO report to suggest they figured all the State and municipal costs of these immigrants.</comment>

<comment>Trump is to stopping illegal immigration what Britney Spears is to singing.The yuge applause to Obama's anti-Trump lines shows what would happen if Trump tried to keep out all Muslims: everyone in Congress outside perhaps a few would work to block his plan. They might even censure or impeach him.There were workable plans that would have kept more terrorists out of the U.S., but Trump had to propose an unworkable plan to appeal to his mouthbreather base.</comment>

<comment>The most workable plan is to stop all immigration from every where.  We have 330 million people, and absent you having a lot of money or some highly in demand skill, we don't benefit from taking you in.  Your average immigrant is low skill, low education and over 50% of their households are on welfare.</comment>

<comment>Stopping "all immigration from every where" is not a "workable plan" because no one with any power will support it. So, you can propose it all day long, but it will never happen.People like you hurt yourselves by a) failing to understand the differences between wishes and action plans, and b) promoting wild wishes rather than helping with smart action plans.</comment>

<comment>Then maybe it's time to change who has the power...</comment>

<comment>You go ahead and do that and report back. Then we'll think your wish is a plan.Alternatively, you might want to stop living in a dream world and help my very realistic plans.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, we can't even stop Dylan Roof from passing a background check when buying a gun or stopping the Boston Bombers despite a warming about one of them from Russia, so you'll forgive me if I laugh at your notion this same inept government can succeed in weeding out terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Good job helping Obama. If you wanted to oppose Obama you'd help my plans to get Trump to force Obama to do more stringent checks of all types of immigrants. Instead, you let your emotions get the better of you and you in effect help Obama.</comment>

<comment>Illustrating that the checks don't work is the best way to convince people the only way we can guarantee no incidents is to let none of them in?</comment>

<comment>The only way she might not be the VP nominee is if Sanders somehow wins the Democratic nomination and the Republican nominee is a particularly bad fit for the Midwestern swing states (think: Cruz). In that situation, the Republican nominee might turn to a Midwestern Senator or Governor.Barring that, I think she has a lock.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't be so sure.She's been the target of some fairly crazy rumor mongering.  http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckayc....  Whether any of it's true is unclear, and whether any of it *should* matter is doubly unclear.  But it's out there, and it makes her a potential risk.</comment>

<comment>She’d be a good pick, I agree.</comment>

<comment>After Joni Ernst's miserable performance last year, the bar for Haley was pretty damn low.  A coherent rhetorical framework and a few complete sentences alone would mark a drastic improvement.Objectively, given the nature of the performance the Governor was tapped to give, it's hard to deny that Haley did a very solid job of selling the brand - her own.  Well aware of the ongoing schism in the GOP, she stuck with the grown-ups and, like any crafty politician, went a long way towards selling herself.</comment>

<comment>Wait, you didn't like last year when she said she worked the biscuit line at Hardee's to put herself through college?  You don't think that's relevant to the price of higher education in 2015?</comment>

<comment>Well cut me off a pair of pig's testicles, that's a good point.</comment>

<comment>Among the more recent Republican ideas for the Higher Education Act reauthorization:- a 10 year freeze on Pell Grant increases- the repeal of Perkins Loans (this was narrowly avoided a few months ago)- repeal of federal GradPLUS loans so as to drive everyone in grad school back in the hands of private lenders, who are eager to start bundling private student loans into asset-backed securities again (just like the bundled mortgages that sunk Wall Street in 2008).- And of course virtually every Republican-controlled states has cut its state support of public universities to the bone - I can think of several public flagships where the state appropriations are now less than 10% of the budget - all while whining about academic freedom, tenure, and the like.- EDIT: Oh yeah, and they also want to repeal two of the three income-based repayment plans for federal student loans: the two that are most debtor-friendly (PSLF and PAYE).For the most part, Republican ideas on higher education are toxic.</comment>

<comment>In my state the flagship state university ("Insert State Name” State University) now receives a bit under 5% of its funding from the state legislature, but the legislature uses that 5% to ride a hobbyhorse of restrictions and demands every budget cycle (and uses positions on various committees, oversight groups, etc for patronage). I honestly don’t understand why the University’s leadership doesn’t tell the legislature to go pound sand, hand them back their 4.8%, and get on with running the university (while throwing out all of the various “oversight” and “advisory” groups composed of political hacks).</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that is the case in a lot of states.  Ironically, the federal government has a better claim of *owning* these institutions, as the percentage of revenue coming from federal student loans, R&D grants, etc is far higher than the meager levels of state support mustered.  However, most [insert state name] State Universities aren't run by the governor's reelection campaign manager, an individual with zero prior experience in higher education, if I recall correctly.  In that regard, Florida is leading the nation...</comment>

<comment>Sorry to disappoint you - but she represents nobody except a few upset big-money donors.  The McCain/Romney/Bush Republicans are gone.</comment>

<comment>No, as I noted, she's representing herself.  Don't fool yourself into thinking the establishment GOP is gone - they're merely sitting back, circling wagons, waiting.  They understand the ebbs and flows - it's not like such things are new.  The Republican Party cannot exist for long as a one or two-legged stool - held up only by it's middle-class Evangelicals and under-educated Nationalists.  Elections are too expensive and the country club/chamber of commerce wing holds the cash.A Trump nomination and defeat would mark merely a temporary setback for the party from which it would emerge healthier and better equipped.  Haley's banking on this, otherwise, she's a pol without a party.  Growth can be painful, but that pain's worth enduring - and a hell of a lot better than death.</comment>

<comment>I suppose you are comforted with the notion that things never evolve in politics- but you are wrong.You imagine that just because the big-money guys controlled things for many years, that this has to continue ad infinitum.You just MIGHT be right on the Dem side - Sanders is surging but Hillary can probably stop the bleeding.On the Republican side, you are wrong.  The fact that all of Jeb's supporters can fit comfortably in a bus cannot be fixed by the Koch brothers or anything else.</comment>

<comment>"the big-money guys controlled things for many years"Still do.  Trumps' one of 'em.  Hell, he's got 6 Billion dollars bet on this election.</comment>

<comment>A laughably superficial comment. As if there is no difference between a billionaire real estate guy who takes no corporate money ( who else but somebody like Trump COULD be in that position? ) and a couple who have set the alltime record for hoovering up Wall Street/big corporate bribes ( $80 million in eight years in speaking fees ALONE).</comment>

<comment>Eh? Trump is the corporate money. </comment>

<comment>I fail to see the relevance of the Clinton's to the future of the GOP.  Was that just deflection?  An attempt to remind everyone who Trump gave all that money to himself?</comment>

<comment>You are evidently no familiar with Trump's tax proposal. It is extremely billionaire friendly.Do you think Trump has more in common with other billionaires or with you? (If you don't think that matters you are a chump.)</comment>

<comment>They aren't gone, spud.  They just aren't in control.  I'm betting on a full party split.  The establishment will keep the Republican name, Trump will offer his name to brand the new party.  (For a fee, of course.)</comment>

<comment>Hopefully you didn't use up a whole box of Kleenex and KY jelly thinking about that.</comment>

<comment>I admit, I'd love to have a Republican party that competed for my vote.However, I think it's Trump who panders to the masturbatory vote.</comment>

<comment>True - Sanders has the fellatio bloc ( of SJWs/BLM) locked up.The Clintons are number one for anally raping the public on behalf of Wall Street.I'll stick with Trump and his self-flagellation, thanks.</comment>

<comment>And here you are, a 40 yo virgin.  Guess you're bitter for being left out of all the fun </comment>

<comment>LOL!  That's one of my favorite movies.</comment>

<comment>Yeah it was funny.  Maybe sell your comic book collection would help your situation? </comment>

<comment>Most considered Joni's response to be quite good last year. I can understand, though, why a speaker talking about the American people rather than themselves would throw you.</comment>

<comment>Most what?  Most of her Iowa neighbors who didn't watch the speech?  Ernst was a laughing stock.  She lost a tremendous amount of credibility in both Congress and her own party.  The latter almost immediately regretting the decision to give her a job she was so clearly not up to doing.</comment>

<comment>Read the reviews from last year. Most news organizations praised her.But I can understand your bitterness. It sucks to have women like Joni and Niki getting better press than your parties standard bearer.</comment>

<comment>Haven’t heard of Ernst since her SotU response. Remarkable in the run-up to a heavily contested primary in her state that’s been in the national news for months. I’ve read more about some far right winger running a small group (FAMiLY Leader?) than her. She’s completely disappeared, which doesn’t bode well for her politically.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you.  I also agree with those who observe that all politicians on all ideologies have conned the American public for too long and we need an outsider.  Whether it is Trump or Carson I don't much care, and if they were to select as Vice President someone like Haley, there would be a sense of civility as well as toughness; one does not have to come at the price of the other.  It is the manner in which Trump makes some of his assertions that rubs some people wrong, not what he is advocating...I suspect that he could tone it down, and if he wins the nomination will do so for the general election...even as he wipes the floor with Her Highness, Queen Hillary...assuming that her unindicted co-conspirators, Mr. Obama and Ms. Lynch don't turn on her and allow her to be prosecuted for violating the Espionage Act.</comment>

<comment>Weak troll. Trump would include more superlatives. Revise and try again.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention he's incapable of using 3 syllable words.</comment>

<comment>I'm earnestly curious as to what you feel you're getting out of this act.</comment>

<comment>Great speech by Haley.  I hope the pendulum will swing back to sanity in our public discourse.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, and it went over the repub base like a lead balloon. That crank Coulter is apoplectic. There's no hope for regained sanity in the gop. </comment>

<comment>I'd be happier if the pendulum swung back to sanity in our public policy, but I'll take what I can get. So far, though, the only difference that I can see between the "Establishment" and "Tea Party" Republicans is that the former group advocates for radical right-wing policies using bland and inoffensive language, while the other group prefers to explain the identical set of policies using language as harsh and uncompromising as the policies themselves.As someone who regards it as a blessing in politics when things are presented as they are (which happens so rarely), I'm almost hoping the GOP does not take a rhetorical cue from Ms. Haley, and continues to present the American people with an honest look at who they are and what they really represent in their current incarnation.</comment>

<comment>Only the progressives still imagine in their own dreams that these RINOs represent anybody at all.The RINOs are done- they are toast.  It's almost as if the revolution has already washed over the GOP's base - but hasn't gotten around to TAKING OVER THE TV STATION YET.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is going to win it all. It's going to be fun watching you idiots lose yet again.</comment>

<comment>Rubio at 12 percent in New Hampshire. Very impressive indeed.</comment>

<comment>The sane wing of the party will consolidate after Iowa and NH. Jeb, Kasich, Carly etc will be gone those voters aren't voting for Trump or Cruz.</comment>

<comment>You got it  backwards. Trump has brought in millions of new supporters - who will not vote for ANY of those RINOs.</comment>

<comment>That's fine. Don't let the door hit you in the a** on the way out of the party.</comment>

<comment>Same to you and the three guys left drinking stale light beer and Doritos at the Rubio defeat party.</comment>

<comment>The primary schedule favors the sane wing of the party, sorry.</comment>

<comment>Hillary would crush Rubio. Why vote for Hillary Lite when you can have the real thing?</comment>

<comment>Tell me what you like about Trump the most. Is it his support for single payer health care? The fact that he supported the Clintons for two decades? How about his support for eminent domain?</comment>

<comment>Oh, you got some really exciting material there- that should really energize the Rubio base. Chuckle.</comment>

<comment>I notice you didn't answer the question. Does it make you uncomfortable to acknowledge that Trump is Hillary's stalking horse and is playing you for a fool?</comment>

<comment>Trump is already wealthy. He needs nothing from HRC - that's laughable. You sound desperate.</comment>

<comment>You're the one that fell for a charlatan, not me.</comment>

<comment>Rubio has almost everything, looks, style, backing, orthodox policy.  What he doesn't seem to have is any clue about how to run a presidential campaign or how to find someone who does..  It is crazy how i always think "How is Rubio such a sh!tty candidate?"</comment>

<comment>He's a great candidate. As you will see after the nomination.</comment>

<comment>He reminds me more and more of John Edwards.</comment>

<comment>A flash in the pan that's cheating on his cancer stricken wife? Nah. He's better than that.</comment>

<comment>He SHOULD be a great candidate.  He may BECOME a great candidate.  At this point, he IS NOT a great candidate.   We will both see, right.  That's why we call it a race.</comment>

<comment>He's an automation playing scripted lines in a loop. That's the best the "sane" repubs have to offer?  Really love the Mickey Dolenz boots though. </comment>

<comment>"Hope and Change". lol. Talk about one trick pony...</comment>

<comment>I don't dislike Rubio. I must admit, however, that the thought of yet another first term senator with pretty much NO executive experience going to the White House does give me more than a little pause.</comment>

<comment>AT LAST WE HAVE CONTROL OVER YOUR TV SET!!!-Ren and Stimpyhttp://youtu.be/mCqHp3Sr5yg</comment>

<comment>Damn, that's an old cartoon. I remember R + S as being a very edgy cartoon when it came out.</comment>

<comment>Right? Now it's tame by comparison to Adult Swim, or even our actual kids' shows.</comment>

<comment>“Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today.”Yeah sure. Dems are wholefully under represented in DC and everywhere else. If Congress and statehouses reflected the population, your party wouldn't be able to hold the entire country hostage or prevent women from accessing health care, just to name a couple of your achievements.</comment>

<comment>Women aren't denied health care anywhere in this country. In fact, it is against the law to do so in our emergency rooms.</comment>

<comment>You know, sometimes women's health care issues are pressing. You can try to enroll in insurance, enroll with a primary care doctor, wait for that appointment, get a referral to OB/GYN, wait for that appointment... Meanwhile, months have passed. Or you can go to Planned Parenthood. You are out of luck if you don't have the right insurance and enough cash on hand to afford the office visit fees and meds. Especially if you can't take the usual birth control pills for health reasons. The alternatives are pretty pricey.Meanwhile, a significant number of women aren't going to wait out the process or pay the fees. The end result will be more births to low income people who will rely on Medicaid and WIC, instead of waiting a year or two when they might be in a position to have insurance through work and enough income to buy groceries and diapers without government support. Cutting Planned Parenthood is a classic case of penny wise pound foolish. Don't be surprised if states that have limited Planned Parenthood the most also see a healthy spike in Medicaid spending.</comment>

<comment>That really didn't address my point. No one is denying women's healthcare. They still have access to everything, including abortion services.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Try and keep up. Health clinics are being forced to close across Red States because they serve women.</comment>

<comment>There are no health clinics that are being forced to close because they serve women. That would be illegal.</comment>

<comment>See Texas. </comment>

<comment>There are no clinics in Texas that are being closed because they only serve women. They are closing because they refuse to meet current safety standards for their patients.</comment>

<comment>It's weird...  Somehow, 'safety standards' preventing access is acceptable in womens' health, but not gun ownership.</comment>

<comment>you can't get all kinds of care at an ER geniusgo to the ER and ask for an eye exam see if they deny you service.</comment>

<comment>Those are elective and not life threatening.</comment>

<comment>So's a mammogram or a cancer screening or a pap smear.Guess just wait till you're dying them get medical care</comment>

<comment>You're all over the place with your arguments. Who says you have to wait until you are dying to get care? Adults are free to seek medical care at any time.</comment>

<comment>you're arguing that ERs can fill the function of Women's Health clinics</comment>

<comment>No, I didn't. I said no one can be denied medical care in this country, and used that as evidence. You might want to read the post that I responded to.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, duh idiot! These people are literalists. See "If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor". You can't expect them to understand that insane nuance of "impossibly hard for a woman to get access to healthcare" essentially being the same as denying access to it.Which, incidentally, is the same problem Hillary has with Bernie's "We'll force the states to do it" approach to single payer. States like Texas will find the same sorts of unethical, immoral loopholes and basically say "You've got your single payer, you'll just have to fill out 3 months worth of paper work and subject yourself to a few anal probes to use any of it".</comment>

<comment>Why do men even comment on Womens health issues.</comment>

<comment>As long as they live close enough to an emergency room I guess the problem is solved! Everyone who's going to planned parenthood clinics can just clog up the ER's for free service now!</comment>

<comment>Or they could just comply with local laws and stay open.</comment>

<comment>They started off with majorities in Congress when Obama first took office and steadily lost them as America sought to restrain Obama's agenda.</comment>

<comment>Joke rape supporter says what?</comment>

<comment>Reposted Wikipedia: "Haley was born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa in Bamberg, South Carolina, on January 20, 1972, to an Indian Sikh family. Her parents, Ajit Singh Randhawa and Raj Kaur Randhawa, are immigrants from Amritsar District, Punjab, India, where Ajit had been a professor at Punjab Agricultural University. Haley's parents emigrated to Canada after her father received a scholarship offer from the University of British Columbia. After earning his PhD in 1969, Ajit moved his young family to South Carolina to accept a position as a professor at Voorhees College."</comment>

<comment>Anti-Monitor, as the Duke of Wellington said when somebody said he was Irish (he was born in Ireland).  "Just because one is born in a barn it does not make him a horse."  She is an Indian, period.  She needs to go home, now.</comment>

<comment>So much for "natural born citizens".</comment>

<comment>Errrrrmmmm...ok.  I'm going to generously assume this is faux-racism and just move along.</comment>

<comment>She is home. She's as American as you are. </comment>

<comment>You certainly are, one way or another.</comment>

<comment>It's also way wanting rape to be legal is bad for a campaign. </comment>

<comment>You're delusional. What other personalities do you have?</comment>

<comment>What is the point of these infomercials after the State of the Union?Is it the same idea as giving everyone a medal at the Special Olympics?</comment>

<comment>My 83 year old father does, I'm sure there's a few more people around his age that do</comment>

<comment>We probably got this from the Canadians, who gave the opposition parties their few minutes for a response before we did. The poor Canadians sometimes got the dubious privilege of getting to listen to FOUR of these after a public address by their PM.</comment>

<comment>Its a good dumping ground for the GOP's has-beens and soon to be has-beens</comment>

<comment>So Nikki Halley is running for the GOP nomination in 2020?</comment>

<comment>She should tbh. She'd make a good candidate. She seems moderate on some issues although now she just RINO'd herself.</comment>

<comment>Two women squaring off, will be a historic election.</comment>

<comment>So she turned you off because she acted like a reasonable adult. Got it. </comment>

<comment>If you were a reasonable adult, you'd comprehend and understand my post better  to see that she isn't turning me off as I want her to run.</comment>

<comment>As long as she doesn't fall into the same tar pit as Jindahl.1)I like governors over senators for presidents.  They bring executive office experience.  W is the exception because he was a clown, and the governor's office is nearly ceremonial in TX.2)Governors who manage to pull wins in purple or against the state's main party are even stronger.  It means that they have more crossover appeal.  Reagan, McCain and Clinton all rose in states where their party wasn't strong.  This gives a significant edge in possibly winning that state a second time in the presidential election.</comment>

<comment>Reagan, McCain and Clinton all rose in states where their party wasn't strong.This is not true at all.  California in the 60s and 70s was a Republican State.  Arizona is the state that gave us Barry Goldwater.  And Arkansas was part of the Democratic 'solid south' a lot longer (well into the 90s) than most other southern states.</comment>

<comment>LOL.  I was actually thinking Romney, not McCain, I don't know why I said that.  McCain was actually a moderate before 2000.  Arkansas and California may have skewed D and R at the time, but they were very purple states.  My point remains, the politicians they produced were much more seasoned and nationally viable than a politician who was locked in once they won their primary in their ultra-liberal or ultra-conservative state.</comment>

<comment>She is also running for VP. She would be on the short list for any of the candidates except of course Trump.Frankly if Trump is the nominee he will have a hard time finding someone to run with having personally disparaged everyone except Ann Coulter who is Trump's Eva Braun.Coulter has come out bashing Haley saying she should be deported with all the trumpkins chiming in agreeing. Disgusting.</comment>

<comment>Ann Coulter who is Trump's Eva Braun. Nice. I rarely agree with you. But I will here.</comment>

<comment>Can't take credit for that. IT was someone else's comment, but thought it was perfect.</comment>

<comment>Trump/Coulter: A match made in a place with a name beginning with an "H", but it ain't "Heaven". They deserve each other.</comment>

<comment>LOL . . . . 100% right.</comment>

<comment>Haley was chosen by the usual clueless GOP Establishment idiots who are addicted to playing "Me too!" with the Democrats.  This woman is hated in the South and her speech will have zero effect on the rise of Trump.  As for Jeffinohio, we will be coming by for you after Donald takes office.  We are happy to be sending you to your own little "New America" where you will mine salt until you drop dead, along with the rest of your fellow libtards.</comment>

<comment>Wow, with intellect like this, how can the gop possibly lose?</comment>

<comment>Rino Haley commits suicide, no vice president, no re elction, bye haley, trader...Politicians  got us here, not Trump, I hope he wins and you get kicked out, and become us again...</comment>

<comment>Nikki Haley's message was delivered well with of course the usual Republican talking points. However, she made one fatal mistake in the eyes of some in her party, she dared to call out people for the rhetoric being used. We know exactly who she was referring to the master of divisiveness himself, Donald Trump. No doubt she will be called a RINO now by some. Ann Coulter suggested that Donald Trump should deport Nikki Haley which is of no surprise coming from her she as fits right in with Donald Trump. So we will see how much longer Nikki Haley remains popular with the Republican Party she may have been looking at her last time of being governor as some may want her kicked out of office ASAP.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, today's gop doesn't take too well to reasonable adults. </comment>

<comment>We've got the wrong woman running for president.  And I don't mean Carly.</comment>

<comment>Watch her go the way of Bobby Jindal.Sane and then social conservative.</comment>

<comment>Those inbred racist southerners voted for an Indian to lead their state? Well that's a bit unexpected.Luckily it turned out well (for libs) as she constantly shĩts on their southern heritage.</comment>

<comment>oh bless your heart</comment>

<comment>Progressive Nikki Haley pandered to the open border cabal that runs the USA.</comment>

<comment>There's 12 million hard working immigrants already here paying their way. What do you do about them? Trump's plan to round them up and toss them out is looney tunes.</comment>
