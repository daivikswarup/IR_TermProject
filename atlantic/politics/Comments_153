<comment>To be fair, Sanders' vision is the grander, but Clinton's can actually be implemented.  It is pragmatic and do-able.  Sanders' plan is pie in the sky.</comment>

<comment>I don;t know about pie in the sky vs doable.  Insofar as Clinton represents just incremental change and managerialism, she also presents the incorporated idea that the Republicans will dominate Congress forever and ever. This is pretty sad, but a probable outcome of her election. There would be no energized youth base to vote in off-year elections, there would be no alternative candidates promoted by her DNC.  In fact, more blah endlessly flowing to the end of the horizon.</comment>

<comment>And a crushing defeat in the next presidential election, since Chelsea won't be ready for primetime yet and the Clintonistas will have crushed the only part of the party that might throw up a viable non-dynastic candidate.</comment>

<comment>'[w/Clinton] there would be no energized youth base to vote in off-year election'. That's a joke right? Obama had an energized youth base like Bernie does and off-year election turn out was still nil. Don't blame thier future flakiness on Clinton when there's ample historical precedent that the youth demographic will be flaky in an off year regardless of 'energy'.</comment>

<comment>Not really.  But it would depend on the dynamics of the Democratic outreach, which has been, shall we say, flabby for many a decade?</comment>

<comment>Relying on "youth voters" to build a winning coalition is like building your house on quicksand. Voters under the age of thirty rarely if ever vote, they're low information voters and they have short attention spans. Half of them will have radically different political views in just a few short years, as people's views change as they start working, paying taxes, having kids and try to build a nest egg.The "youth vote" is and always has been and always will be an unreliable mirage. </comment>

<comment>Especially the misguided, poorly educated and disaffected Obama youth that has suffered the last 7 years and so desperate they look to a Socialist. </comment>

<comment>Part of the argument for that is that Obama campaigned as Sanders, and governed as Clinton. Some of that may be just due to a lot of his advisors - look at Emanuel for instance, who even advocated giving up on Healthcare at one point.And by that, I mean that he came in and tried to compromise, even preemptively, to try and win over the Republicans, who responded with massive resistance, refusing to even negotiate except to try and run down the clock. He extended his hand, they punched him in the face.Sanders is promising not to do this, but instead to fight and play hardball, and not to preemptively make concessions. He's a chance to move the conversation back from "Do we do all of what Republicans want, or only part of it" to where there are actually other options being discussed.</comment>

<comment>That was exactly Obama's problem. He campaigned saying things like Sanders' "we can do this" message, then once elected basically said "thanks for getting me elected, I've got it from here."  The movement stopped once he was elected, so there was no energy to continue to the midterm elections.  Hence, the republican takeover of congress.</comment>

<comment>There has been an "Energized" youth vote for the Democratic Party in mid-term elections for quite some time.</comment>

<comment>Wow. That is an excellent turn of phrase. If you wrote it, you have a real talent. If you stole it, you have excellent taste. As do I. Yoink!</comment>

<comment>HEAR! HEAR! Thank you!</comment>

<comment>That assumes that the launch is successful.  Look at Bernie's 27-year record in Congress. There isn't one example where he led and championed a piece of legislation to passage.  Not one.</comment>

<comment>...are you... are you paraphrasing Werner von Braun?</comment>

<comment>Yep. Sanders' campaign has performed perfectly, except for happening in the wrong decade.</comment>

<comment>I just dunno what to make of all that....well done?</comment>

<comment>If pragmatism is your only tool, then don't expect to break any new ground.</comment>

<comment>You're right that Clinton's campaign promises are more realistic.  I think most Sanders supporters would agree with that assessment.So why do they still choose to support Bernie over Hillary?I think it's because they view the presidential election as the opening bid in future negotiations with the Republican-controlled Congress.  If Bernie wins, it would send a much clearer message to Congress about the type of changes that Americans want to see.  If Hillary wins, the compromises and concessions she'd get out of Congress are going to be much less dramatic.</comment>

<comment>That assumes that Bernie has the ability to wrench more concessions from the Republicans than Hillary can.  What in his record in Congress supports this assumption?</comment>

<comment>The fact that republicans don't already have 2 decades of hatred built up against Sanders.</comment>

<comment>I really believe that Hilary is far more likely to succeed with some of her agenda than Bernie is with his.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think if Bernie wins, Republicans in Congress will care at all about the type of changes Americans want to see? Or will they just double down on the wrongheaded beliefs/causes of their donors and backwoods congressional districts?</comment>

<comment>Clinton's vision, to me, is lets keep the status quo.  I like her but thats not to my liking.</comment>

<comment>It isn't clear that Clinton HAS a vision, nor is it clear that she'll have any more success advancing liberal objectives using her plan.</comment>

<comment>A few little peeks and tweeks is surely doable, but it only makes sense if that is all that is necessary to create a sound economy that benefits all citizens and not just the top 5%.  Characterizing Sanders' plan as pie in the sky is to misread the nation's current willingness to support more fundamental change than Clinton is willing to even consider.Clinton's allusion to "pragmatism" sounds like an excuse to not fight the fight for which the voters (Red and Blue) are asking.</comment>

<comment>Clinton's vision of regulation can be implemented?  Maybe you haven't read it.  She wrote about her financial reform plan in the NYT a few months ago.  Some of her proposals indicate that she doesn't even understand the issue and know what's actually going on.</comment>

<comment>You people aren't even trying anymore I see....</comment>

<comment>Agree. Clinton's approach is far likelier to get passed in Congress but is far more vulnerable to being gamed by the financial sector. Bernie's and Warren's would be better in the long run but can not possibly get by today's Congress. The revolution is not going to happen for many years. We have to wait for the angry right wing base to see who their real enemies are.</comment>

<comment>This kind of reflexive repetition of Clinton's changes as do-able vs Sanders' pie in the sky is frankly both ignorant and destructive.  It is ignorant because it is completely misunderstanding the game. To say that is to be a dupe of the .01%.  The actual game being played here is: do the .01% run our political system or do the people?  Right now you are siding with the .01% against your own interests. ( I am assuming you are not part of the .01%)The single reason Clinton's "incremental style" can be claimed to be do-able is that in fact it does nothing. For example,Her proposal on student debt was to reorganize the debt and Ask for quarter point reduction in interest. It sounds like a solution, but it is a solution that effectively preserves the interests of the banks and leaves the actual problem in tact. Sure it's do-able, The big money interests and their bought congress-folks can go along with that because it preserves Big Money power and profits.The so called 'pie in the sky' happens to be things the public overwhelmingly support. And that necessarily and dramatically shifts the status quo. BECAUSE in the status quo the public is irrelevant, something to be manipulated and neutered. Medicare for all has enjoyed nearly 80% popularity. Very few people are actually against expanding and strengthening social security. Yet somehow (read corruption) that is not reflected in congress and the White-house, nor in the supreme court.To argue both that Clinton can get things done and she is progressive in the same sentence is ridiculous. She Can get republican stuff done. But not progressive stuff. Not the stuff that actually matters.Sanders will bring tremendous public pressure on congress. Unlike Obama. I believe he will end up fundamentally reshaping both congress and the democratic party.</comment>

<comment>Yawn. Zzzz.</comment>

<comment>Ahhhh, I see. Clever of you.</comment>

<comment>Not my fault you are longwinded and boring in your rants.</comment>

<comment>I wish that Bernie would explain, specifically, how he will achieve his platform. What is his point by point plan for achieving the breakup of the banks, single payer healthcare, free college for everyone, and expanded elderly benefits? His ideas are wonderful, but Congress is and will be controlled by Republicans.</comment>

<comment>So you'd rather make "progress" in the wrong direction by having someone who will "work with" republicans?</comment>

<comment>How exactly is Sanders going to pass his Utopian agenda without compromising with a GOP dominated Congress and Senate?</comment>

<comment>At least when he compromises, he'll be starting in a decent place. Hillary would start bad, and compromise with worse, and end up terrible.</comment>

<comment>I think Dems vastly underestimate the general aversion to overt socialists such as Sanders. It's a recipe for ending up with a President Cruz.</comment>

<comment>I think the aversion to obvious serial killers withs serious dominionist leanings trumps the aversion to socialists, really. Evangelicals might be okay with them, but the rest of the population really doesn't like that sort of creepy SOB. Cruz is just Santorum, except much creepier. I think it might be the uncanny valley at work.Which would be strange; would mean that technology has gone backwards in the four years between the Romneytron 3000 and the IntelliCruz</comment>

<comment>In all fairness, I think Cruz reminds me more of infamous PharmaBro Martin Shkreli, both in looks, obvious sociopathic attitudes, and a smirk that makes you want to punch them in the face.</comment>

<comment>Maybe YOU do...this Dem certainly doesn't!</comment>

<comment>Ben, what do you mean by wrong-direction progress?  Bernie and Hillary are very similar in their goals. Also, either of them have no choice. They must work with the Republicans. Otherwise, absolutely nothing that they want will get passed. Once the Republicans owned both houses of Congress, they successfully stonewalled Obama who has had a less liberal agenda than Bernie's.  I'd take compromised progress any day over no progress at all.</comment>

<comment>Hillary *claims* to have similar goals.  Her record of what she's actually done in government doesn't support that claim.</comment>

<comment>Between making *any* progress and no progress at all, I would vote for progress.</comment>

<comment>I put progress in quotations because it's not actually progress.</comment>

<comment>It's called Politics of the Possible.</comment>

<comment>In my view America is too big and too rotten to the core for a centrally administered socialist state. Socialism gets ugly when compliance must be forced on the masses. The U.S. has thirty times more people than Sweden and a notorious history of corruption in government... and remember the record 20 trillion dollar deficit?</comment>

<comment>Debt, not deficit. Very important difference.</comment>

<comment>US debt is a red herring, as the reserve currency of the world, it is impossible for the US to go bankrupt.</comment>

<comment>Yep.</comment>

<comment>He's tied in NATIONAL polls now... "longshot" Yeah, just like "journalism".</comment>

<comment>Ben, let's see where the polls are after South Carolina and Nevada, and after the media starts vetting Bernie.  He's a good guy.  But the question will inevitably arise: Is his platform a dream?  And will the majority of the party who are moderate and even conservative Democrats buy what he is selling?</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's a dream. But it's a better negotiating starting point than saying let's just tweak a few things here and there.  Clinton's staring point ensures any progress she wants gets negotiated away almost immediately.</comment>

<comment>Bernie would start at the far left so when he gets pulled to the right by Congress his compromise is further to the left than Hilary's would be. That's one of the arguments I am hearing. I don't know if it is valid or not. I do think Hilary is more electable but agree with Bernie that either of them would be miles better than any of the republicans running.</comment>

<comment>Sander's call for a revolution may have been more persuasive at the height of the global economic melt-down of ten years ago...now however, the US economy is growing again, unemployment is at record low, household formation is steady, vehicle purchases at record, and gasoline is the cheapest in decades. A political platform centered around anti-trade, nationalization, and high taxes isn't just unrealistic, but delusional.</comment>

<comment>And yet somehow nobody actually feels good about the economy, and we're overdue for another meltdown.</comment>

<comment>There is a Democrat in office, so it's natural that there would be a steady drumbeat of negativity.</comment>

<comment>Oh, come on. Do you not remember the years of "jobless recovery" under Bush?</comment>

<comment>Is it delusional to feel that 62 people should not control more wealth then the bottom FIFTY PERCENT of the world's population?I feel the key point in the article was conveyed in one sentence:"As a number of recent studies suggest, even in the absence of literal corruption, good-faith regulators often skew policies to favor financial-sector interests as a result of the complexity of financial markets; regulatory dependence on financial firms themselves for information and data; and the shared social, cultural, and educational backgrounds of many financial regulators and financial-sector leaders."Smaller is better.</comment>

<comment>Government too?</comment>

<comment>Nope, that would be counter-productive.</comment>

<comment>Counter-productive for the bureaucratic/administrative class, you mean?</comment>

<comment>Yes.  With the right amount of regulation you wouldn't need as much bloat as the welfare state demands.  As is, we have to provide programs and assorted other services to the hordes of people who can't make enough money to be self sufficient because wages have been stagnant for 30 years and their jobs keep getting outsourced and the loans on their houses were predatory.</comment>

<comment>The quote you repeated is, IMO, a nice way of saying the FTC is a joke.</comment>

<comment>Ironically enough, Sanders's vision -- the structuralist approach -- is precisely how you can have a less hands-on regulatory state. Free up those compliance dollars, so to speak.</comment>

<comment>Until wages and participation start steadily climbing, a whole lot of people are going to disagree that its all roses. We've got a lot of the wrong kinds of jobs and growth that's still largely dependent on debt driven consumerism.  Structural changes are indeed needed, not that I agree with everything Bernie's pushing.</comment>

<comment>I might believe you if inflation no longer existed, housing prices never went up, and wages hadn't been stagnant for 30 years.So yea, the economy is doing better, but your money still counts for less and less.</comment>

<comment>Clinton's version is the usual version. She gets to look good, to say that she's Doing Something, and regulatory capture instantly sets in, so her buddies on Wall Street aren't actually inconvenienced in the slightest, even in the short time before even the letter of the law is rolled back. Dodd-Frank has been effectively neutered and so did basically no good, for crying out loud, and she wants more of that? It's theatre. Mendacious. Everything she does makes me despise her more. I cannot believe I supported her over Obama eight years ago.>Sanders, by contrast, is skeptical of expert oversightAs well he should be, since in this case the experts are uniformly drawn from the people being overseen. I wonder if Goldman has already picked out the guy who'd handle Hillary's "managerial" approach.> President Barack Obama largely governed in this managerial, expertise-oriented tradition.And look where that got us! We're having the same arguments eight years later, so pretty clearly the managerial approach doesn't do squat, even when tried by someone with far more integrity and ability than HRC. </comment>

<comment>Clinton wouldn't know what a progressive policy was if it paid her a $300k speaking fee. How about we ask how the founder of the Progressive party, Theodore Roosevelt would have answered this question? Oh wait, we know exactly what Theodore "Trust Buster" Roosevelt would have done, and did do, despite massive resistance from established interests, the opposing party, and even his own party.</comment>

<comment>Teddy Roosevelt didn't actually bust up any monopolies. He was all talk and little action. Woodrow Wilson did the hard work Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the guts to follow through on. The triumph of image over substance - thats Teddy's real legacy.</comment>

<comment>Ok it's obvious you are pretty ignorant of history. TR broke up 40 Trusts including Standard Oil and the Railroad Trust just to mention 2. You are not too bright. </comment>

<comment>As fine a man as Bernie is, he is no Teddy Roosevelt. And for that matter, neither is Hillary.</comment>

<comment>I ask this question in all sincerity and not as a hostile commentary:Does there exist, anywhere on this planet, a more disgusting, vile, and reprehensible woman, both inside and out, than Hillary Rodham Clinton?If the War in Iraq made your family safer, Hillary is your candidate.If the USA PATRIOT Act secured your family, then Hillary is your candidate.If your family reaps the benefits of institutionalized racism in our justice system, then Hillary is your candidate.If you want more expensive healthcare, vote Hillary. Mine is currently $475/month (compared to my $25/month car insurance from Insurance Panda, or my $10/month dental insurance, but I digress).  Hillary is in bed with big pharma, she is your candidate.If you want to vote democrat, but still want to bomb Iran, then Hillary is your candidate.If you really benefitted from the Housing crisis or from Monsanto bankrupting small farmers or Big Pharma price gouging the sick, then Hillary Clinton is your candidateBernie Sanders is my candidate!</comment>

<comment>Why don't you pose your question to Bernie Sanders? I'd wager he disagrees with you. In the mean time, here's an article that nicely supplements your perspective: http://www.marketwatch.com/sto...</comment>

<comment>I don't understand this hatred of all things Clinton. She has always supported progressive causes and certainly was not born with a silver spoon (or foot) in her mouth. Why should she have turned down huge speaking fees offered by big banks and corporations? </comment>

<comment>Nice shill for Insurance Panda! You really put some work into that one. I hope they're paying you by the word. :-)</comment>

<comment>How is the determination of the proper size that banks should be not "technocratic"?</comment>

<comment>Ensuring that banks aren't too big to fail is too intuitive, popular, and easy to understand to really qualify as "technocratic".</comment>

<comment>Because it's a much easier metric to determine compliance rather than micromanaging everything within a company to make sure it doesn't violate an enormous amount of rules that would be required to ensure it doesn't pose a structural risk to the economy.</comment>

<comment>This is probably not a fair characterization. Sanders does not distrust experts per se. He instead recognizes the corrupting effects of a revolving door of experts shuffling between industry, and banks in particular, and government. This is not settled. At least, according the "The Big Short" (the book), Goldman, Deutsche, and UBS played an enormous role in the mortgage meltdown. Indeed, AIG would have been outside Glass-Steagal. But banks like Lehman and Bear Stearns would not have been able to hold so many mortgage-related securities off-books if it weren't for the ratings agencies. They failed to accurately assess the risk of those securities, marked them AAA, and into shadow banks they went. Sanders is very clear that he wants to reform the ratings agencies, which definitely would address a major underlying issue causing the meltdown.Overall, a badly researched, baldly pro-Clinton piece.</comment>

<comment>"Sanders does not distrust experts per se. He instead recognizes the corrupting effects of a revolving door of experts shuffling between industry, and banks in particular, and government."Thank you.  I have no idea how this author arrived at the conclusion that Sanders does not trust experts.  Elizabeth Warren is an expert in consumer financial protection.  Is this author asserting that Sanders would not trust her?  Rich Cordray, the current CFPB Director, has never represented large financial institutions and has done a good job at CFPB.  Does the author think Sanders would not trust him?</comment>

<comment>Both Clinton and Sanders seek to control the American people through economic regulation. They essentially want to turn the clock back to 1933.</comment>

<comment>Nice piece - thanks for writing it.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders voted against the 2008 bank bailouts as did the most right wing anf left wing members of congress. It was the responsible middle that voted for the bailout and thus saved our economy (and by extension the entire world) from a depression and the collapse of our economy. For all the talk of Bernie Sanders' having supposedly great instincts because he voted against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, in 2008, Bernie Sanders was gambling with the complete collapse of our economy so he could grandstand with Michelle Bachman.Fantasies about a better world are in fact the agency of evil if they're used as an excuse to do nothing when action is called for or to oppose sensible reforms because you want fantasies to come true. Bernie Sanders candidacy is all fantasy, no reality. </comment>

<comment>I think you misread Sanders's position.  It is true that he didn't want to bail the banks out.  But unlike Bachmann, he wasn't categorically against government intervention.  He wanted intervention that would directly benefit those who were losing their homes and their livelihoods, which is something history has shown the bank bailouts utterly failed to do.</comment>

<comment>And what was the practical difference between Bernie Sanders and Michelle Bachman as out economy faced its greatest threat since 1929? Nothing.Bernie Sanders proved in 2008 we was less responsible than George W Bush. He chose the fantasy of perfect over the desperately necessary. We need better leadership than what Sanders can provide. Ideologue purists make terrible leaders.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he voted to bail out GM and Chrysler to save jobs, as he said. And it was worth the money lost in that transaction. But how were people supposed to by cars when he proposed to let the financial system collapse? Voting for one and not the other didn't make sense except to someone wanting to accept credit for one and dodge blame for the other. TARP turned a profit that paid for the loss on GM and Chrysler.</comment>

<comment>Worst set of candidates since McGovern, Humphrey, and Muskie ran for the DEMS in 1972! The results will be similar.</comment>

<comment>. . . Against Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marko Rubio? A game show host, a dishonest backstabber and Dan Quayle 2.0? How does that trio of jokers equal Richard Nixon circa 1972?</comment>

<comment>Except none of those GOP candidates is a corrupt liar who has an indictment pending nor socialists. </comment>

<comment>An indictment pending?  Facts, please.</comment>

<comment>It can't be ruled out so its in play until she's cleared, but with 100 FBI agents on the case and 2 open investigations, I would say likely pending if that makes you any more comfy? Lol. </comment>

<comment>I must have missed the 2 open investigations and the 100 FBI agents. Source - Limbaugh, Cruz, Rove?</comment>

<comment>Comey and some of the investgators have been leaking .</comment>

<comment>Okay. Your source?  A link?</comment>

<comment>Google  have you ever head of it?</comment>

<comment>Not good enough.  Logically, your story is nonsense.  100 FBI agents - now that's a nice round number. And Comey, the head of the FBI is leaking details of a critically important FBI investigation to the press? The director of the FBI whose boss is a newly appointed no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners female attorney general?  He would risk his job over this?  You have no source or link because there is none. Stop spreading nonsensical nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Yes they have leaked that HRC is,in fact, not the subject of an investigation. GOP seems desperate not to have to run against her.</comment>

<comment>Not sure where you read that one? At Media Matters?</comment>

<comment>What you say cannot possibly be true. The FBI reports to the Attorney General, who reports to the President. You think Obama would authorize an investigation into any of the Clintons? Oh, come on... be serious!</comment>

<comment>There are no FBI agents on any case against Hillary Clinton. The Congress can summon her to as many hearings as they want, but they cannot make the FBI investigate her. Why? Because the FBI reports to the Attorney General, who reports to the President. And the notion that Obama would approve or would not stop an investigation into Hillary Clinton is hilariously ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Dreamer</comment>

<comment>I think the dreamer is you. Tell me how Obama would authorize an investigation into Hillary.</comment>

<comment>If the evidence is overwhelming and the FBI goes awol. </comment>

<comment>Well, the evidence was overwhelming in the 2008 crash, but what did Obama do? He went on television and essentially granted a blanket pardon by saying, without any investigation, that "no laws had been broken."Sorry, but again, the notion that a sitting president would go after his most likely successor who happens to be a member of his own party is just... bonkers.Suppose Obama did authorize an investigation and Hillary were indicted. She would have to abort her run for the presidency, and what then? Either Sanders would win, or a Republican would win. Why would Obama want either of those two outcomes?</comment>

<comment>Perhaps we need a Independent Council. The banks paid billions in fines to the Gov't fyi. The 08' crash can not be simply blamed on banksters like the far left loves to say. The fact is corrupt policies staring in the Clinton years with the repeal of G-S, easy money by the Fed, Gov't policies compelling banks to hand out subprime loans and the forced guarantees by Freddie and fannie were the real factors.</comment>

<comment>The main difference between both candidates is that Hillary is completely bought and paid for by Wall Street and K street and is looking to maintain status quo in reagards to the corruption that plagues our system today. She's never met a lobbyist or a "donation" she didn't like...</comment>

<comment>This author provided very little substance here.  There is a hell of a lot more to financial regulation that whether we should break up the largest banks.  Did the author ever consider analyzing the merits of what Clinton has proposed?  Her plan is a joke and indicates that she and her advisors don't even understand the issue.In addition, I'm not sure why this author and others rely on economists for expertise on financial regulation.  People should be looking to the attorneys and auditors/examiners who for the regulators, are familiar with the laws, and see what financial institutions are actually doing.</comment>

<comment>Interesting to refer to 1997 as the New Deal era.</comment>

<comment>Enough with the longshot stuff! The shot is getting shorter every day. It's a little shot. More like dunker. A bunt. An itty bitty toss.</comment>

<comment>"Clinton, by contrast, seeks to extend and deepen oversight of by strengthening the Dodd-Frank financial-regulatory overhaul passed in 2010."Don't be fool. That's what she says she'll do. But 40 million dollars in Wall Street donations say she won't do a damn thing.</comment>

<comment>Dodd-Frank has had a measurable effect."So Matt O’Brien weighs in with evidence that leverage has in fact declined substantially, and continued to decline even as the economy expanded — probably because of Dodd-Frank. This is certainly right; the same decline shows up in other measures, as in the chart above showing financial sector debt securities as a percentage of GDP."http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.c...</comment>

<comment>It could not have had any effect if the wealthy have continued to get wealthier, which they have.</comment>

<comment>Breaking up big banks doesn't suffice if the fraud as business model is achieved, as it was, by transactions (securitization, CDS's) and financial firms such as credit rating agencies and AIG. And the financial sector of the world economy is interconnected, so US structural reform simply shifts the problem of financial instability to an even more difficult political environment.Talking about structural reform as if it is an alternative to regulation is misleading and obscurantist arm waving. The action is elsewhere.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/...</comment>

<comment>Ah, there it is again... "radically restructure the economy itself." In other words, Bernie is a commie, Bernie is a commie! What a load of crap, and what's even more infuriating, is that neoliberal, Ivory Tower Clintonista toadies like this article's author think we're too stupid to see through the lies.Clinton believes in fine-tuning the economy to prevent crisis? Really? Ending Glass-Steagall was supposed to prevent crisis? Passing NAFTA was supposed to prevent crisis? The only crisis Clinton wants to prevent are those that make the 1% sad.And when has Sanders ever said he was skeptical of government oversight? On the contrary, he wants stronger regulations, regulations with real teeth. Does he want to break up the banks? Sure, but that's not "to radically restructure the economy itself." That's just enforcing existing antitrust laws, laws that have existed since Teddy Roosevelt, the Trust Buster.People, reject the lies.</comment>

<comment>What they are fighting about is whether or not the US Government manifests the interests of the .01% at the expense of everyone else or if policy reflects the interests of the 99%. It is explicitly about who is the sovereign of the US, The people, as the constitution lays out, or the elite.01%, who have usurped nearly the entire political system.The academic historical analysis is interesting but misses the nut of the matter by focusing on mechanics rather than meaning. For instance, to ask what financial "innovations" are better for the economy, rather than 'does the economy work for the public good as it is now constructed', are profoundly different questions.</comment>

<comment>I am not a Sanders fan but he is absolutely correct about one thing.  Too big to fail is too big to exist.  It is also too big to manage.  Bailing out misbehaving mega-banks removes the market corrective of insolvency to bad corporate behavior.  And growth in the size and scope of the banking organizations serves to aggregate the bad behavior.The problem is the insured deposits the the government is on the hook for.  That specific issue is the best argument for some sort of return to separation of traditional banking services from the rest of the financial sector.</comment>
