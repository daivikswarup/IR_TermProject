<comment>You aren't a racist, by any chance, are you?</comment>

<comment>Naw. He just likes to degrade Blacks. And women.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget Muslims.  Strange joke!</comment>

<comment>Asians are awesome though except for the gooks. /s</comment>

<comment>I call it socially enlightened when a white man offers his wife to a few brothers in the name of racial equality.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like Truth Tellers wife is sure going to get worn out by those PERSONAL trainers....LOL.Be proud buddy....and get use to them Hookers....sounds like you can afford them....</comment>

<comment>are you sure you arent a liar?</comment>

<comment>Racist trash says what?</comment>

<comment>wut?</comment>

<comment>Flagged. Crawl back in your hole you white supremacist halfwit.</comment>

<comment>Are you sure she's not hanging out with Reince and Newt and Grover?  Did she ever have sessions with Strom and Orrin?</comment>

<comment>And she got that nice white Christian fella, Josh Duggar, to babysit her daughters. He even volunteered to babysit for free!</comment>

<comment>I haven't listened to the speech and probably won't bother, but is it true that Trump never mentioned MLK in his MLK Day speech? Is that the Trumpiest thing Trump has ever done?</comment>

<comment>Not true. He dedicated his record setting attendance at the mandatory assembly."We're dedicating the record to the late, great Martin Luther King,"It was a nice gesture from a man who most resembles Martin Luther King'sbowel movement.</comment>

<comment>When Trump dedicated his record-breaking crowd size to MLK, I sat and stared at my computer live stream for a few seconds processing what he said, thinking I had heard him wrong. WHAT?!?I didn't hear him wrong.  He repeated the same thing later in his speech.What a strange, poll-driven, crowd-obsessed man.</comment>

<comment>Not to Martin Luther King, Jr.?</comment>

<comment>There is so much wonderful stuff stemming from this speech that one hardly knows where to start.  However, it is hard to get beyond Falwell, Jr's comparison of Trump and Falwell, Sr. to Martin Luther King.  Yeah, the same Jerry Falwell, Sr. who started his career actively campaigning against desegregation generally and Martin Luther King specifically in the 1950s and 1960s.  The scale of the hypocrisy of political evangelical Christianity knows no bounds.  Really, is it a surprise that conmen like Falwell, Jr. and the prosperity gospel hucksters identify with Trump?  Sure, Trump doesn't know a word of the Bible but he sure does seem to know how to fleece the flock.</comment>

<comment>Liars and the morons who love them.</comment>

<comment>It's like when Stan called Cartman out for not really knowing anything about religion while pretending to be religious. Cartman replied that he knew enough about religion to exploit it. That's Trump.</comment>

<comment>The Trump/Cartman parallel is pretty incredible on all levels.  This whole GOP primary is basically the Passion of the Jew episode of South Park come to life.Oh, and Jeb Bush is definitely Butters.</comment>

<comment>My wife and I have a running joke. The people who Trump appeals to can be summarized in one Cartman quote. "I do what I want!"</comment>

<comment>Whateva!! Whateva!!</comment>

<comment>You will respect my authoritay!</comment>

<comment>Noooooo, I like Butters!</comment>

<comment>I like Butters too, but come on.  Look at how Cartman treats Butters and how Trump treats Bush and then tell me Bush isn't Butters.</comment>

<comment>Would that make Ben Carson = Token Black?</comment>

<comment>I don't know.  I get more of a Mr. Mackey feel whenever I hear the good doctor speak.  Or maybe Officer Barbrady. </comment>

<comment>Naah, Carson could never be cool enough to be Token.</comment>

<comment>"Oh, and Jeb Bush is definitely Butters."But only because Lindsey Graham is out of the race...</comment>

<comment>You mean, Mr. Garrison?</comment>

<comment>Just to be clear then, a man cannot change his ways?I had assumed, as a progressive, that when a twit like Falwell was criticised, the INTENTION was for him to recognise his mistake and then change his behaviour.For what I can tell, he has done that. You should be applauding.Unless, of course, you suspect him to be insincere. That not hypocrisy though.</comment>

<comment>The deceased Rev. Falwell (reportedly in the 1970s, I wasn't there) publicly repented for his racist past.I'm not particularly impressed by his later actions in almost any sphere, but the man did repent those sins.</comment>

<comment>"... but the man (The deceased Rev. Falwell) did repent those sins."Repenting his sins did not, and could not, do a single thing to reverse the damage he willfully did throughout his life.Deathbed / "late in life" repentence make me sick. It is just another layer of hypocrisy added to all the previous layers.If there is an afterlife with a judgement day, the Falwells and their ilk are screwed.</comment>

<comment>SEE?!?!?!</comment>

<comment>First, Falwell died in 2007; he reportedly repented of his racist ways in the 1970s. So not quite "deathbed.""Repenting his sins did not, and could not, do a single thing to reverse the damage he willfully did throughout his life."That's an interesting thought, given that the damage he caused was entirely by his words. If one does damage by words, I'd think that recanting those words and preaching the opposite (if that's what he did), would do more than "a single thing to reverse the damage."As for "his ilk," here's an interesting recent story on the teachings of Falwell's son:http://www.newsadvance.com/new...To be clear, I was long disgusted by Jerry Falwell's antics. There's little redeeming about his public persona and actions. The same holds true for his university and his preaching sons. But I just confine my criticism to facts. There are more than enough.</comment>

<comment>But that makes the comparison less apt, since Trump isn't given to that level of self-examination or awareness.</comment>

<comment>SINCE WHEN IS THAT GOOD ENOUGH!?!?!</comment>

<comment>I suppose that's between Falwell, his God, and you.Try not to shout at the Almighty.</comment>

<comment>"Falwell lauded Trump’s generosity and worldly success; he called him “a breath of fresh air.”Actually he is a breath of flatulence.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump is "generous" to whom? This billionaire's donations to charitable organizations are practically non-existent. He's only in it for himself. For instance, in the first debate he bragged about how he left Atlantic City high and dry, but it was OK because he got out with his profit and his cronies were all slapping his on the back he'd done so well. The people of Atlantic City, well, they didn't fare as well. Why didn't anyone write about that? Is that how our president's supposed to act? Getting in and out quick, making money on the backs of the poor?</comment>

<comment>MLK was only an activistI don't know why you'd compare anyone favorably with him</comment>

<comment>And he was equal to someone! I bet you hate him.</comment>

<comment>Four-flushing flock fleecer!</comment>

<comment>The Lord God, Allah,  Yahweh, made 'em all. Take away religion and they would still be  the same. Good people are good and bad people are bad and there isn't total unanimity on what is good and what is bad. There's the rub.</comment>

<comment>And the flock seem to love being fleeced by these same men over and over.</comment>

<comment>"Donald Trump lives a life of loving and helping others, as Jesus taught in the great commandment."Try and read that while drinking something and see if you can avoid snorting your drink out through your nose due to laughter. I dare you.</comment>

<comment>Shows how apparently out of touch and desperate the Establishment have become. Pandering to the ignorant and naive might not be working like it once did. Maybe the Evangelicals with Trump are that much smarter than the Political Elite. </comment>

<comment>Or not</comment>

<comment>(snicker)</comment>

<comment>Maybe the evangelicals with Trump need to get over their intellectual insecurities about the "Political Elite."  The constant stream of complaints about how this elite or that elite are treating them poorly or underestimating them are tiring.  The "elite" doesn't think about you a whole lot.  Maybe you should get over it instead of throwing a tantrum.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should get informed. It's all very true to those who are. </comment>

<comment>I'm constantly confused by the fact that certain people decry "victim culture" and encourage bootstrap-pulling . . . yet whine and complain about how they're oppressed.</comment>

<comment>Huh? Oppression is not my point. It's about wising up finally and realizing both political parties have the same big priorities, protecting the donor class priorities at the expense of it's US citizens. At least the Repubs get that; the Dems seem fine with corruption and lying. As long as their party makes them feel warm and fuzzy.</comment>

<comment>Democrats have no organization like ALEC. Most every Republican politician is a member of the organization.</comment>

<comment>"It's all very true to those who are."The world being flat was very true to those who believed it - but it is round.If every person in the world agreed it was flat -it would still be round.</comment>

<comment>Now we have facts and stats. It's all there.</comment>

<comment>Do you just say stuff without backing up with any specifics?  How's he generous?</comment>

<comment>It was in the video yesterday at Liberty University (above); Falwell jr. gave several examples of Trump's generosity to "regular people". I watched it. Here's one; he paid off a couple's mortgage, after their small gesture of kindness.http://www.washingtonexaminer....http://www.examiner.com/articl...</comment>

<comment>Well, he did get the money changers out of the temple and into a Trump casino.</comment>

<comment>More like he put the Temple into the Casino.</comment>

<comment>Awww, liberty university. You have to love it. For all that the conservatives complain about liberal sentiments in universities, at least those universities don't force students to attend speeches from political demagogues. But, hey, at a conservative christian school, you attend the charlatan's performance or you're punished.Freedom. USA. Rock, Flag, and Eagle.</comment>

<comment>In fairness, students also were required to attend when Bernie Sanders spoke there several months ago. (Great speech, btw -- see if you can find it online.)</comment>

<comment>That is a completely fair and valid point. I do wonder, however, if the number of conservative and progressive speakers are equally proportioned throughout the year. I honestly don't know that answer, but I'll admit that I have suspicions.However, I think the emphasis of my main point should be that you are forcing students to go to a speaker at all. In my view, college is a time where students get to choose which classes they go to and what speakers they will attend. It is a break from high school, where you are told what you are going to learn. By forcing students at the college level to listen to speakers outside of the classes they've opted to take part in, we are removing that essential element of higher learning. And when conservatives complain that we are forcing liberalism down students throats, it is ignoring the fact that young minds are often drawn to liberalism. At this college, by comparison, they must force students to see speakers, whether conservative or liberal.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you that college students should be able to freely intellectualize and experiment, whether in a progressive or traditionalist direction.The exercise of working thru the implications, which are unexpectedly broad and may have unforeseen consequences, is the only real way to deeply understand these positions.</comment>

<comment>Most students at liberty are all ready teabagger </comment>

<comment>Liberty is a private college.  They are free to force their students to go see Gallagher on Ice if they want.</comment>

<comment>Also a very fair and valid point. However, what we are free do to, and what we should do, are not one and the same. I am free to drink a handle of whiskey by myself while attempting to juggle hammers. I probably, however, should not.On a side note, Gallagher on Ice would probably be a far more valid viewing experience than Trump. At least more educational.</comment>

<comment>As I've said many times before,  I honestly hate the argument that x is free to infringe on y's rights if x has authority over y.  We hear people make this argument that employers should be allowed to fire employees if they say something controversial, or whatever.  As you say, just because you can do it doesn't make it ethical.</comment>

<comment>I'm going to guess that a lot of students at Liberty are there specifically because they don't want to make decisions of their own.  They're used to being told what to do and are comfortable with authority.  Why would anyone who is interested in thinking for oneself go to a place like Liberty?</comment>

<comment>Though I suspect Sanders, unlike Trump, didn't think he had a chance at their vote.</comment>

<comment>Ironically, Sanders goes much much further in embodying Christian values of social and economic justice than anyone on the GOP side, as one evangelical leader made clear after hearing Sanders' appearance at Liberty U.</comment>

<comment>" ‘Please, Mr. President, we're winning too much. I can't stand it. Can't we have a loss?’ And I’ll say, ‘No, we're going to keep winning.’”That's some platform he's got there.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump is gonna win America so hard, America won't be able to stand up straight for decades.  He's gonna win us every which way.  He's even gonna win us in ways we didn't know we could be won.</comment>

<comment>We're gonna be YUGE!</comment>

<comment>"It's"</comment>

<comment>And schlong our enemies!!!</comment>

<comment>One would think he should be criticized for treating the Liberty audience as if they are infantile and outright stupid, but that is how he treats everybody.</comment>

<comment>Yep.You know, where he scares me the most is when I try to envision his cabinet, his administrative appointments. And I keep thinking about that shitty TV show, "The Apprentice".</comment>

<comment>Well, just stroke his ego and you've got a juicy cabinet position. No knowledge or experience required.</comment>

<comment>As long as you never, ever disagree, you're golden.</comment>

<comment>Do you think he'll appoint Brett Michaels Secretary of Rock?</comment>

<comment>I'm guessing a department head will be fired at the conclusion of each cabinet meeting - which will, of course, be broadcast live on prime time.</comment>

<comment>"One would think he should be criticized for treating the Liberty audience as if they are infantile and outright stupid,"That is how the (misnamed) Liberty U. treats their students.</comment>

<comment>a much better platform than "people should be equals"tells you something about the left doesnt it</comment>

<comment>He doesn't know anything about nuclear war, but one thing is for sure: If we have one, we sure are going to win it.</comment>

<comment>The quote from an evangelical where he praises Trump's "strength" really captures what the Trump phenomenon is all about. Over the past 10 years, the political left has become openly hostile in a way we haven't seen in America in a long time. The blacklisting of the Mozilla CEO for donating money to the wrong cause, the destruction of the Nobel-Prize winning biochemist who said the wrong things about women, the way the NASA scientist was pilloried for wearing a shirt that offended the feminists...the examples are endless. The actions of America's new Red Guard at our universities alone would take pages and pages to describe.In short, the left is no longer content to go to the polls every few years and then get on with our lives. In today's America, if you do not think the right thoughts and say the right words in the eyes of the left you will lose your job and be publicly shamed.The rise of Trump is a response to all that. And it's only the beginning. Whether he wins or loses, it's clear now that cultural conservatives are mad as hell and aren't going to take it anymore.</comment>

<comment>Grand, the conspiracy theory trolls are out. Literally nothing in your comment is factual, all of it hinges on extreme right narratives and distortions of reality. It makes you look like a delusional fool.Trump's embrace of white supremacist groups and widespread support by neo-Nazis ought to scare decent people. Apparently you think they all have a point.</comment>

<comment>Isn't the claim that Mozilla's ex-CEO was blacklisted factual? What isn't factual about it?Also, which "white supremacist groups" has Trump embraced?The sky here is grayish. What color is it there?</comment>

<comment>Trump's support by white supremacists and neo-Nazis is documented, even just on this site. Not only that, but he's retweeted racist memes from white supremacist groups more than once, and uses their talking points nearly verbatim.No, it's not factual. Being fired by your board is not the same as "blacklisted". You're trying to turn him into a victim, as if he did nothing objectionable.</comment>

<comment>I thought that Republicans are usually in favour of companies and their boards of directors acting as they see fit, without government interference.  Should Mozilla's board have been prevented by the government from firing their CEO?</comment>

<comment>he wasn't actually fired.</comment>

<comment>True -- he actually resigned (although obviously under pressure by his board for the PR nightmare he caused them).</comment>

<comment>exactly, and that is the extent of the whole thing.</comment>

<comment>Knowing him and a few people on it, I can tell you that Eich's board very intentionally never asked him to resign. He decided it was the best thing himself.It was a case of right wing internet shaming and bullying. It does happen. A whole lot of people on the right wing also hate it. Its evil.</comment>

<comment>He was forced to resign. That's the same thing.</comment>

<comment>that's literally not the same thing.</comment>

<comment>No, Tulse, and no one suggested that.Instead, people shouldn't have formed a hate mob.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't a hate mob -- the CEO had become a PR liability to the company (and has been pointed out, the CEO wasn't fired, but resigned).</comment>

<comment>when a bunch of people form an outraged mob, then the target of their outrage IS, in fact, a P.R. problem.However, it's quite coy of the outraged mob to turn around and deny any agency in the matter...</comment>

<comment>the board pressure Eich into resigning, he wasn't actually fired.</comment>

<comment>1. I didn't deny that Trump is supported by some bad hombres. You said he supported them. All the evidence you have is a vague claim that he's RTed "racist memes from white supremacist groups more than once". If so, you should be able to find them.2. Maybe you're right about Eich. After all, he raised a whopping $2.5 million - *million* - for his new venture.</comment>

<comment>http://www.mediaite.com/online...http://mic.com/articles/129126...</comment>

<comment>Wow, there's some facts right there. Trump RTed a tweet with bogus facts. That doesn't indicate support for whoever created the tweet originally. One can't expect Trump to determine the exact provenance of something and then vet that source for being far-left approved. You're relying on Mediaite (!), LGF, and other questionable sites; do you vouch for everything those sites support?</comment>

<comment>Gods you're a dishonest person. So promoting white supremacist talking points and rhetoric does not indicate agreement with those positions?Forget it. Go troll someone else.</comment>

<comment>"Ocaire" (/ocaire/) is, of course, lying. I've posted thousands of posts since 2002, and no one has ever presented a valid example of me telling a falsehood. Unlike partisan backs like "Ocaire", I'm scrupulous about telling the truth.There's nothing inherently "white supremacist" about Trump's bogus talking point. Blacks do commit a widely disproportionate percent of crimes. Trump's bogus talking point might be off by a good bit, but it's not like he's saying most liberals are serial killers.</comment>

<comment>If you retweet bogus facts, it minimally means you don't have the good sense to check those facts or their source first, which means you don't have much respect for empiricism or rationalism, which means that, like George W. Bush, you'd be a disaster as President.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for stopping by, Frank. However, that doesn't have much to do with this wonderful subthread.</comment>

<comment>Blacklisted from what? His employees didn't want to work for him. In Silicon Valley every one of them could leave and get a higher salary.</comment>

<comment>Has Eich in fact done that? Is he making a higher salary elsewhere? He looks to have founded a startup that got $2.5 million (a very small amount as these things go).</comment>

<comment>which distortion of reality?these days, i'm ashamed to be on the left. because face it - people who say the littlest thing out of line can be shamed, lose their jobs... I've seen sites that try to disemploy racists based on social media posts.What was Justine Sacco if not a perfect example? She wasn't even making fun of black people, just herself, but the satire was complex and hatred is simple. Sure, she has a job now, but for the rest of her life that shit will follow her around.When people are accused of racism for everything, those who prosper are those strong enough to accept the moniker and punch right on through. Whose fault is that?</comment>

<comment>"The rise of Trump is a response to all that."The rise of Trump is in line with all that. The same dumb and deranged people who are targeted in the actions you describe follow one worthless charlatan after another. They're always looking for a hero, and they always follow those whose only interest is in feathering their nests (or having their egos stroked in the case of Trump).Here's a discussion of how Eich's firing reveals yet again the sheer incompetence and/or corruption of those who present themselves as opponents of PC: 24ahead.com/n/12028Start being part of the solution.</comment>

<comment>It's unclear whether your historical ignorance or your unthinking anger are the biggest drivers of your nonsense, but as a start I really suggest you go read some recent history. In fact (no opinion, not puffery; documented) the viciousness of American politics today really began with Newt Gingrich in the early '90s telling his party to condemn, degrade, denounce, and demonize the left and everyone who disagreed with him and his extremist views. Go learn some facts.</comment>

<comment>Actually started back in the '80s with Gingrich's GOPAC, but yeah.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, but nobody's is going to buy that tortured attempt at persuasion. "Cultural conservatives" aren't just getting mad, they've been spitting venom for decades. Anger, hate and ignorance is what they do and it is ALL they do. It is all they have to cling to anymore. But as "cultural conservatives" die off (here's a secret, they're old people), people are forgetting about the good old days and looking to the future.</comment>

<comment>Take what? civility? thoughtful conversation? reason? science?.....</comment>

<comment>I like the cut of your jib. Are you dating?</comment>

<comment>Trump is a "cultural conservative?"  Did his three wives, numerous affairs or his "very pro choice" position on abortion convince you of that?</comment>

<comment>Three wives and numerous affairs is the definition of traditional values, isn't it?</comment>

<comment>"Whether he wins or loses, it's clear now that cultural conservatives are mad as hell and aren't going to take it anymore."Hooray!  More votes for Rick Santorum's future losing presidential bids!  Bring it on, "cultural" conservatives!</comment>

<comment>As long as you and your rapidly shrinking 15% cohort confine yourselves to shouting into the wind, ruining your allies' electoral fortunes, and occupying frozen nature preserves, best of luck.  Just please stop with the beating of innocent Sikhs.</comment>

<comment>Wow, I have to send a thank-you note to Falwell (the live one)! I could never, in a thousand years, have thought of Falwell Sr., King, and Trump in the same breath. He has expanded my notion of the limits of language, the most remarkable bit of blatant insanity I've seen in a long, long time. A truly great man who did more than anyone in modern times to remedy America's great sin of slavery, a vicious religious fanatic who never saw a truth he couldn't twist, and The Donald, for whom truth or falsity is simply a completely irrelevant notion. Wow again!</comment>

<comment>My family and I will all be voting for Trump, along with many people I know who voted for Obama last election. WHY????, Simple, he will protect our 2A rights, may secure the border, may do something with ISIS, may control the EPA, and he is:1. NOT a bible thumper 2. He will not mess with woman and their private medical decisions (abortion) 3. He will not mess with gays 4. He will NOT mess with marijuana users 5. He IS a true small government person, unlike the rest of the bible thumping GOP nuts, who want to use the government to IMPOSE their views on the rest of us. My family will make their OWN decisions, and that includes my daughter</comment>

<comment>Why would a pro-choice/pro-marijuana/pro-gay rights person vote Republican?</comment>

<comment>Because it's a troll that has spammed this exact same message at least three times on this site. The "NOT a bible thumper" thing is rather funny given the article being commented on. Apparently they're too lazy to edit their spam.</comment>

<comment>STFU jerk off</comment>

<comment>Hey troll? Your comment history is open. People can look and see you've spammed that comment.</comment>

<comment>so he has.</comment>

<comment>That's hilarious. They've been posting that for weeks.</comment>

<comment>Testy, also.</comment>

<comment>So you admit you lost the argument by resorting to childish insults. Loser!</comment>

<comment>Sarah, you can jerk me off anytime.</comment>

<comment>Spam bot or not, that is actually the best defense of Trump I've seen.  That is a pretty low hurdle to jump, I'm not sure it is factually accurate and I still wont be voting Trump.  I would vote Inanimate Carbon Rod first.</comment>

<comment>ICR 2016!!!!</comment>

<comment>Simple, because at one time the republican party was about keeping the government the fluk out of our private lives and then the thumpers took over. Millions of us want the old republican party back.</comment>

<comment>The old Republican Party was civilized. The people you guys decry as the "establishment" are the last remnant of the old GOP.</comment>

<comment>Because they don't care about these issues. I'm ok with their irresponsible abortions, but will never let the High Priority issues be handled by the Dems. </comment>

<comment>You are a poor representative of the Barrow Gang. Our business is robbing billionaires of the money they've robbed from the little guy, not voting them into office.</comment>

<comment>I have no objections to what Trump stands for because I have no idea what he stands for. He never answers questions without spouting some vulgar insult that has no information in it. He could be the most liberal President ever elected for all you know. I object to Trump because he is a reality show actor. And the only thing that he has done so far is pander to ignorant racists. And that is all he needs to do to get the votes fo you and your friends.</comment>

<comment>Wow! Trump will do some great things without doing any harm to causes we embrace. Too bad those things won't mean a thing when Trump alienates our country from the rest of civilized society, when we live in a country where 11 million people are rounded up and transported to the southern border and when he bombs the hell out of some country who has the nerve to piss him off.</comment>

<comment>You all voted for Obama last time because you felt guilty about the negroes.</comment>

<comment>I love how rabid right-wingers will swear up and down that they voted for Obama. They seem to think that everyone is just as dumb and gullible as they are.</comment>

<comment>That's a deal with the devil. If he's willing to discriminate against one minority (Muslims) he'd discriminate against others if it advantaged him.</comment>

<comment>There was the part where he ranked his favorite books, calling The Art of the Deal“a deep, deep second to the Bible. The Bible is the best. The Bible blows it away.”Trump also greatly enjoys the smell of his own farts, but only as a deep, deep second to the burning of incense.</comment>

<comment>I'm not Evangelical but have loads more respect for what's coming out of Liberty than all the uber liberal universities with their weirdo, misfit students & progressive professors that are always looking for anything to be aggressed about. How miserable and weak.Progressive Dems and Established Repubs are so out of touch with common sense and practical solutions. They are just irrelevent to so many independent thinkers. I liked Rubio, but too bad he was part of the big donor, lobbying side on all of this. People want a Mover & Shaker now to counter the low-energy, corrupt DC machine.Go Trump!!</comment>

<comment>Of course you do. Liberty's long history of racism must suit your views quite well.</comment>

<comment>Really, a billionaire who feels your pain?</comment>

<comment>I have little pain. Why? Because I was never duped into thinking the gvmt was my savior. </comment>

<comment>Breitbart is fun!</comment>

<comment>Huh?</comment>

<comment>It's also making you stupid.</comment>

<comment>Your not even real.</comment>

<comment>not real, that's why Sarah L is so HOT!</comment>

<comment>Cute - I'm a bot. Sad you don't venture out of your bubble. Just had lunch with my best friends and we all are so similar it's comforting. My top county is full of me. </comment>

<comment>Those are some... bizarre sentiments you've just expressed.  I don't know what they're supposed to mean, pretty sure I don't want to.</comment>

<comment>“If I'm president, you're going to see ‘Merry Christmas’ in department stores, believe me.”And Burger King for everyone!How ridiculous that someone this lightweight has lasted this long in this race.But irrational and misdirected anger is a strong aphrodisiac for those on the right, it seems.</comment>

<comment>I'm surprised he didn't go the next step and explain that pagans, Jews, and Muslims will be compelled to wish everyone a Merry Christmas. It's almost as if he doesn't understand that Happy Holidays encompasses the whole nation, but just people who look like you.</comment>

<comment>People who don't look like him don't matter, duh. That's how we make America great again. 1. Get rid of all those people, 2. build a wall, 3. ?, 4. profit!</comment>

<comment>Don't forget winning. Lots of winning.</comment>

<comment>I hope he makes Starbucks use REAL Christmas cups too!   In 2014 the cups had reindeer and snowflakes, right from the Bible!</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I'm going to assume this is sarcasm. I certainly hope it's sarcasm rather than bigotry or senility.</comment>

<comment>Yeah cause he totally can control what department stores choose to put up as their holiday message.I really don't understand how people can be so gullible that they'll believe anything this nut job says to them when he's obviously just pandering to you even more than most politicians already do.</comment>

<comment>He plays to the "me so victim" thing.</comment>

<comment>I have read comments regarding how Sanders would never get his policies by Congress. But for Trump, he would never get his policies by the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Which wouldn't really bother his supporters that much, so long as they get to keep their guns.</comment>

<comment>I understand that evangelical voters are frustrated with the mainstream GOP. Let's face it the GOP has been running a game on them for over 50 years now, but the idea that Donald Trump is "one of them" is hilarious. The guy stands for everything Jesus hated. It just makes me wonder what is going on in these people's minds!?</comment>

<comment>winning at all costs</comment>

<comment>Even to the point of rejecting everything their "personal savior" stood for.</comment>

<comment>Evangelicalism in this context is a political movement to preserve traditional social values (which are characterized as Christian) and traditional social hierarchies, within the political system.The teachings of Jesus? The bible and teachings of Jesus, means whatever they want it to mean for them.Tell them Jesus said it is easier to get a camel through the eye of a needle, than it is for a rich man like Romney or Trump to get into Heaven, they tell you that through God anything is possible.</comment>

<comment>"The teachings of Jesus?"Yes, Ephesians 6:5 is a real doozy.</comment>

<comment>Traditional = white.</comment>

<comment>Most Evangelicals disapprove of same sex marriage. It was that group that quoted scriptures as they fought interracial marriage. They talk about 'homosexual lifestyle' and 'living in sin'.  How is it they are totally accepting of Trump and his adulterous marriages?</comment>

<comment>Great points . It's not about Trump as an individual adulterous man, it's about Trump as someone championing their kind of politically unpopular ideals.I guess you could say that Trump's a mercenary for Evangelical ideals, even though he's not  true believer. Partially because no one else will take on their ideals so fervently. Those ideals aren't so much religious, as they are beliefs in "traditional" beliefs on homosexuality nowadays or interracial marriage 50 years ago.</comment>

<comment>You are peripherally addressing the political reality of the 2 party system in the US."Let's face it the GOP has been running a game on them for over 50 years now," which seems to me to promise them a bulwark against cultural change, which for the most part they see as an erosion of their deeply held values. That is to say, "change" as they see it, offers them nothing, while threatening them deeply.This has a parallel in the way the Democratic party exploits its constituencies by appealing to their paranoia and envy.Both parties are ugly in their methods, and the use of their methods is solely to gain power via election, as is the mechanism in this country.</comment>

<comment>"The guy stands for everything Jesus hated. It just makes me wonder what is going on in these people's minds!?"I think he basically preys on people who pay more attention to what's said than to what people actually do, like the Fox viewers who are convinced the BS they're being fed is truer that what's reported by anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Nothing.  That's what's going on.</comment>

<comment>The Bible is the best? Well, it depends on your taste. I sure wouldn't care for the company of anyone who thinks that e.g. the book of Judges is the best. Either Mr. Trump has very reprehensible tastes, or else he hasn't read anything from the Bible but carefully culled portions.</comment>

<comment>If Evangelicals believe in Trump, it provides me some pretty sinister suspicions of that which Evangelicals believe. Trump is a belligerent bully that doesn't preach compassion and kindness. He preaches derision, anger, & success as morality.</comment>

<comment>Just like the self-proclaimed "Moral Majority" that preceded them,  the "Religious Right" is neither.Neither religious, since they focus on their hate, not their faith.Nor right, since they are incorrect about the teachings of Christ.</comment>

<comment>Common practical solutions does not mean "hate". Wise up. Guilt trips from the Left are a thing of the past. Facts, reasoning, stats over phony pandering are driving good policy now! </comment>

<comment>Sarah5 here is a neo-Nazi troll, and said she is "proud" of that.Don't be fooled by her act. This is all about racism to her, just like it is to many Trump supporters.</comment>

<comment>Johnny, Please learn the difference between Socialism and Communism.   BTW, most of us have no problem with capitalism, per se.

<comment>Trump used the wrong Bible verse. He should've used Numbers 23:22 - "God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn." -King James BibleUnicorn power to make America great again!</comment>

<comment>I would have thought that Trump's favorite verse would have been the in Genesis where God condones three-ways.</comment>

<comment>I prefer "The Glass Castle." A much more moving book than "The Art of The Seal." Why doesn't Donald bother to "lean in," as has been so widely suggested.</comment>

<comment>Biblical lessons from Trump are going to be pretty shallow.</comment>

<comment>"Falwell lauded Trump’s generosity and worldly success; he called him “a breath of fresh air.” He compared Trump to his father and to Martin Luther King Jr., who also “spoke the truth, no matter how unpopular.” Trump, he said, “cannot be bought—he is not a puppet on a string like many other candidates.” Though Falwell’s comments were, he said, not an endorsement, he repeatedly imagined a Trump presidency as a boon to America. “In my opinion,” he said, “Donald Trump lives a life of loving and helping others, as Jesus taught in the great commandment.”"What a load of double-speak nonsensical bullshit from Falwell Jr. I'm pretty sure MLK Jr. was never accused of discriminatory housing practices like Trump. Trump is nothing like Jesus. As a Christian, I just cannot say enough that the opinions of these two men do not represent the Christianity a lot of us believe in.</comment>

<comment>I'm not generally sympathetic to conservative Christians, but being forced to watch people like Trump claim the mantle of your religion sounds pretty awful. Even they don't deserve that.</comment>

<comment>Oh I never said I was a conservative.In fact, I hate what a lot of conservatives stand for while also bragging about their supposed Christian values. Equating Trump with those same values just flies in the face of any reason or honesty whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>My bad, I wasn't meaning you in particular. I've met a few conservative leaning Christians who don't share the "hate the right people" thing, and I feel for them on this. Feeling like your religious identity is being hijacked is not fun.</comment>

<comment>this seems the perfect fruition of the marriage between the Chamber of Commerce and The Moral Majority.  The religious folks have just been getting used by the business types for their votes for 40 years now.  Guess they haven't wised up yet?</comment>

<comment>I agree it's something they built themselves. But for other Christians having your religious identity be hijacked is uncomfortable. I'm deeply aware of the feeling, given pagan religions are generally treated as a joke by mainstream media, and there's a ton of "Celtiboo" stuff out there.</comment>

<comment>Being a Quaker, that is my direct experience.  We are marginalized by most other Christian sects for our views.</comment>

<comment>The bottom line is:- You can be a Trump supporter.- You can be an evangelical.- You can be an evangelical Trump supporter- But if you vote for Trump BECAUSE you are an evangelical...you are disgrace to your religion.Trump is NOT an evangelical.  Trump is NOT religious.  Trump is NOT conservative.  It's your right to vote for him.  But you have to understand these three facts.</comment>

<comment>Good. I like it! He's a Christian and a bold leader with the policies I feel strongly about. </comment>

<comment>Got Milk?</comment>

<comment>Excuse me?  What makes you think he is a Christian? Do you really mean that he 'is not a Muslim'?</comment>

<comment>For one he says it. We still don't know about Obama's--- odd.</comment>

<comment>The pope would probably decline an invitation to speak at this place, but tee it up for the carnival barker and he still flubs his thin script.am not bothered in the least about one's personal choices, but it is striking that this (so called) religious leader did not find it at odds with his faith that the thrice married reality tv star was a regular in Studio 54 during its heyday (his quote from a Playboy interview: "They were great years, but that was pre-AIDS, and you could do things in those days that today you're at risk doing. AIDS has changed a lot.").  As the KY clerk episode highlighted, religious fundamentalists in America have turned the bible on its head.  As long as one hates the 'right people', the rest of the book is for chumps.</comment>

<comment>I find the idea of a president Trump to be a nightmarish scenario, but if it happens, the irony of having the "good Christian folks" spearhead the election of the first atheist in the White House would be a delicious result. As much as he tries to pander to those self righteous fools, he doesn't give a crap about their bible.</comment>

<comment>He most definitely would not be the first. He'd be just another one claiming to believe. </comment>

<comment>Never fault a consummate Christian who can quote TWO Corinthians from memory.Those white people at Liberty University are simply swearing their allegiance to their new White God. Evidently Donald Trump is the second coming of Emperor Ronald Wilson Reagan.Fun fact: the name Ronald Wilson Reagan can be rearranged to spell "Insane Anglo Warlord." You simply can't make this kind of crap up.</comment>

I haven't looked up his positions.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is a socialist and seems to say and do pretty much in a straight line.  He was fired-up the other night against Clinton -- we could feel the Bern!  I agree with him on some issues, disagree on others, and worry about the path taken to some.  There is much to like about Bernie, even for those whom perhaps disagree with him on some issues.  Just cannot feel the same for Hillary.  Alas, is there anyone to vote for come election day, is the big question?  Looks like the 1% has staked the deck again -- wait and see, and vote as you may, I would bet on the richest to succeed in the long run -- some things never change.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, same as it ever was.....</comment>

<comment>Perhaps so, but what I am saying is that He is up front with you. In other words, you know you do NOT like or DO like about him. You must admit, not many politicians are what they say.  I do like some of the concepts, but not all, and with much reservation about how some would be implemented.  Of all the choices, I find none at the time to get excited about.  Well the bullies get ya excited, but I am not sure how great a thing that is.</comment>

<comment>Well, sort've. There's a bit of a gap between the events and the writing.</comment>

<comment>I thought the gospels were fairly contemporary.</comment>

<comment>most of the books looked at at Nicea we already couple hundred years old. But the gospels are only 4 of them.</comment>

<comment>You don't think 40-50 years for the original gospels is fairly contemporary?</comment>

<comment>its a coin flip as to whether the authors of the Gospels could even have been alive during the life of Jesus.</comment>

<comment>Since we don't know who wrote them, and who they talked to before writing, it's problematic. It's not quite like having a clean line of transmission, like say Tacitus's work on Agricola.</comment>

<comment>I think we are stepping on each others toes a little here, historians seeing who can answer first!</comment>

<comment>I don't remember where you specialized, I thought it was more modern wasn't it?</comment>

<comment>modern US by necessity, but ANE was always my first love...</comment>

<comment>Ah okay. I understand. I ignored necessity and studied what I could, and we had a great classicist in my department, though she has the older historians habit of focusing only on the Greco-Roman world.</comment>

<comment>Will Durant I think did more to hurt modern history than help.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I reject the "western civilization" myth entirely. It erases cultural diversity within the supposed "west" and places a mythologized version used by modern states in it's place. It's junk history, and I'm surprised how many people repeat it.I'm also fairly certain he promoted a lot of pseudo-historical myths about ancient Israel and Judah that even then were known to be falling apart. But most modern history textbooks promote the same myths, even though now they're pretty thoroughly debunked outside of "Christian archaeology" and it's smaller Jewish offshoot.</comment>

<comment>Most of the OT was contemporary inventions, probably around 650 BCE or so. There was some older tradition, but it was mostly used to fill out the new tradition being intentionally built. A lot of the "old" parts may only be a few centuries older than the writing.</comment>

<comment>believe  it or not, ancient oral traditions had really neat ways of transmitting the stories with very little loss.  The Iliad, although written down by Homer, also continued as an oral tradition.  A later written version compared to Homer's showed very little difference.</comment>

<comment>I don't see it that way.  It was inspired by his life and teachings.  I think accuracy is sort of beside the point.  It is what those that were inspired agree upon as their basis to continue to follow him.</comment>

<comment>this is correct.  Very VERY little is actually known about Jesus or his life.  Those details aren't really important.  Its the message that lives on.</comment>

<comment>That's the way I see it.  Historical accuracy arguments shouldn't mean a thing to those that actually believe.</comment>

<comment>it can't be put out by an omniscient God and also have mistakes.  Modern Christians have to choose 1 or the other</comment>

<comment>It isn't about morals.  It's about hope.  It is a belief that there is justice in the next world because there never will be in this one.</comment>

<comment>love you Terri.  That is exactly it, that is the exact context for Christianity.</comment>

<comment>Awwwww.</comment>

<comment>The fact that Jesus was a Jew and Jews don't actually believe in an after life makes that a bit murky.</comment>

<comment>My grandfather was a Freewill Baptist minister who founded a church.  I have lived among devote Christians.  It is not murky to me.</comment>

<comment>YMMV</comment>

<comment>Ah, but one thing is said to lead to the other.</comment>

<comment>The belief in promise of  inevitable justice can certainly lead one to living a pious life .</comment>

<comment>I think that's a bit self-defeating. The focus on justice in the next world allows people to be complacent. Justice here is important and we can affect it. The next world is beyond our ken.</comment>

<comment>I disagree.  Dr. King is a perfect example.</comment>

<comment>How many people said "alright it's all fixed" after the Civil Rights movement? How many people now pretend there is no more racism? Quite a few. I think your example proves my point far better than yours. People were motivated for a time, and then claimed premature victory and ignored the problem until it festered.</comment>

<comment>No.  It doesn't.  You're talking about political complacency.  It has nothing to do with religion.</comment>

<comment>I don't think the two can be separated. Christian groups that prioritize justice now do support your point, but I'd argue that their focus sets them apart from the "justice in the next world" concept. I've also personally seen the difference between a religion that places emphasis on justice now, which mine does, and one that doesn't, which some forms of Christianity don't. There's a noticeable difference in how people approach issues, how activist they are, and even the quality of debate. That's purely anecdotal, a small sample size, but I bet the pattern holds when comparing different ideologies among Christian groups.</comment>

<comment>My personal experience is this:  My grandfather was a devote Christian.  He founded the Baptist church in his small rural town.  He organized coal miners, and became their representative.  Eventually, he became mayor of his little town when the mines allowed it to incorporate.  He never stopped working tirelessly for a better life for himself and his neighbors, but he believed he'd find true justice in the next life not this one.  He was right in that this world did not reward his efforts by even a half measure.  I'm not so sure about the part about Jesus ensuring a final justice.  I don't believe but I'd be happy to discover he knew more than me.</comment>

<comment>I honestly think that might be more the exception that proves the rule. There are always individuals like that, who I can respect for their attempts to create justice. But I don't see that broadly, on a systemic scale.</comment>

<comment>Many religious individuals do their part to make the world a better place each and every day.  Religion isn't the problem.  It isn't what creates complacency.  It is politics that are part of organized religion that inhibit its ability to be effective.</comment>

<comment>Many individuals isn't even a plurality. You're focusing on the individual level. I'm focusing on a broader level. Broad social trends often fall apart at the individual level.If the politics are part of the religion, I don't know how you can separate it from the religion. Religions are defined largely by their adherents, so if many of X religion hold a particular point and promote it, it becomes intertwined with religious identity. That's not a fixed thing, and can change, but it's hardly disconnected from religion.</comment>

<comment>You specifically were citing belief in justice in the afterlife as discouraging attempts to create justice in the here and now. That's what I'm disputing.  I don't believe that is the reason that religions fail to act coherently on social justice issues. Politics are the reason.  I believe individual actions indicate that belief, in and of itself, does not encourage complacency.</comment>

<comment>I'm not a believer and I understand that religion can provide an ideal which motivates some of its believers to do good. More generally though whether the ideals of provided are those which have that effect is quite variable in practice, both between individuals and between religions (and ideologies).Religion provided your grandfather with confidence that his sense of justice was more than a feeling but was a reflection of truth about right and wrong.  That's how I see it.In his case the effect was admirable, but you can see how it might be otherwise in the case of someone with another sense of justice and another religious ideal.</comment>

<comment>He was something.  He was a Christian man that walked the walk rather than just preaching.  Not that he didn't do his fair share of that.  :-)</comment>

<comment>It might be a problem if one believes that the bible is passing on something from god, but that someone took really bad notes.</comment>

<comment>I'm too practical to believe it is divine.  I still believe it is inspired.</comment>

<comment>Inspired by ....what or whose breath?I know romantic poets  say they are inspired. So is that what you mean?</comment>

<comment>It is inspired by life of Jesus Christ and his teachings, and the stories told by his apostles and disciples.</comment>

<comment>I see.</comment>

<comment>As contemporary as a WW2 veteran writing his memoir of the war 50 years later.  Which is to say, no.</comment>

<comment>I'm unwilling to argue this since I'm unconvinced that it matters in the context of our understanding of Christianity.</comment>

<comment>Whose understanding?  If you mean Christians, I agree.  For historians, however, it's another matter.</comment>

<comment>Christians.</comment>

<comment>50 years or so for the first one, if I remember correctly. That's contemporary in the loose sense. Of course there are a lot of later additions and details they disagree on. Since we don't have the Q source in any surviving manuscripts it's mostly guess work about what is original and what was added later.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I believe they spoke this of the British, if memory serves.</comment>

<comment>Aesop's fables would be a good read as well.</comment>

<comment>I know a bit about those.  My mother used them when I was little to teach me to read.</comment>

<comment>I recommend the Audacht Morainn and the Tecosca Cormaic.</comment>

<comment>my Grandmom used to read me ancient Irish stories like 40 years ago,  I barely remember them but thought they were always so neat.</comment>

<comment>Those are both wisdom-texts rather than stories, though they're told in a narrative metric that was pretty clearly used for oral transmission. Pretty formulaic structure. Audacht means "testament" and tecosca means "instructions" (though there's a pop translation that gives it as counsels).Old Irish literature is nice because they had genre titles. Aided is "death", tochmarc is "wooing", tain is "cattle raid", and fled is "feast. There's at least a dozen of them I think.</comment>

<comment>that's really really cool stuff and why I love history.</comment>

<comment>Most of them are public domain these days, since many of the translations were done in the early 1900s. Off the top of my head the Tecosca Cormaic and the Triads of Ireland are public domain in translations by Kuno Meyer, both on archive.org I think. Anything by Meyer is public domain by now, and his translations are still quite good.</comment>

<comment>Got it, thanks</comment>

<comment>And Ra or the sun god of Egypt...  Lots of history before Christ. The New Testament is certainly a kinder and gentler version of the Bible, one may say.  Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>You too.</comment>

<comment>Are you promoting that theory that links Ra to the Bible? Or did you mean read the Egyptian myths in general?</comment>

<comment>or possibly referring to Akhenaten, the precursor for monotheism?</comment>

<comment>There's a pseudo-historical theory claiming much of the New Testament mythos of Jesus was copied from Egypt. I think it was Ra, though it might have been Horus. Either way, it's complete bunk, and relies on bad pop sources instead of Egyptology. It's popular on some atheist websites and forums.Oddly enough, it's completely disconnected from Akhenaten.</comment>

<comment>the re-birth stories are all over the ANE.  Its hard to tell where Christians cribbed theirs from.</comment>

<comment>True, but the problem with that theory is they created new myths not attested in Egyptian sources to make it match with Christian ones.</comment>

<comment>Christians borrowed from all over, including Sumerian stuff. So some of their stories smack of Arianism, other of Horus and Seth, others of Gilgamesh and Ninurtu.  Equal opportunity plagarizers in my opinion.</comment>

<comment>And many who claim to take the Bible literally have borrowed from the philosophy of Lewis Carroll's White Queen in Through the Looking Glass, who boasted of her ability to believe six impossible things before breakfast.</comment>

<comment>The whole rich man getting into heaven less likely than the camel through an eye of the needle thing seems to stake out some pretty clear territory on the matter for Jesus.</comment>

<comment>He was also pretty clear that slaves must obey their masters.</comment>

<comment>Good god. What if Karl Rove was right about us members of the reality based community?</comment>

<comment>What did he say? I'm always interested in Turd Blossom's perspective as it is completely alien to me.</comment>

<comment>This is my favourite quote from the bush years, because I feel like it illustrates the root cause of every misstep of that administration."The aide said that guys like me were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." ... "That's not the way the world really works anymore," he continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors…and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."</comment>

<comment>Wow, that's one hell of a call back. Pretty accurate to Trump's ideals, which scarily enough seem to match the Bush ideology.You may have cracked some underlying ideological continuity in the modern American right-wing.</comment>

<comment>You really want to understand the modern conservative movement, go read a book called 'before the storm: Barry Goldwater and the unmaking of the American Consensus' by Rick Pearlstien.

<comment>Not in my personal experience.

<comment>Your source is not a study, it's a Christian magazine.</comment>

<comment>Done by Twitter. You are a good specimen for the unhappy atheist. Seek therapy- seriously. </comment>

<comment>he's not an atheist.</comment>

<comment>What is he? </comment>

<comment>Celtic Pagan</comment>

<comment>Gaelic polytheist, to be specific.</comment>

<comment>correction/clarifier appreciated!</comment>

<comment>Good grief, I had no idea that Paganism was so technical these days.  An old friend of mine was like you, but he just called himself a druid.</comment>

<comment>Druidism is a neo-pagan faith with heavy new age influences. Gaelic Polytheists are a reconstructionist community that rejects New Age influence entirely. There's a pretty big theological gulf between modern Druid groups and modern polytheist groups. Beyond that, I'd never call myself a druid, because I don't have the learning that title requires. No one does.I reject using Celtic or Gaelic custom as a "costume" over new age beliefs. I believe you need to understand and embrace the culture rather than just use the words and imagery. </comment>

<comment>Spirituality with or without religion is a beautiful thing. Music, reading, giving time to the less fortunate - simple things. </comment>

<comment>Agreed</comment>

<comment>What you call spirituality is a set of emotions that all people have, including atheists.  A common misconception among the religious is the idea that their faith gives them access to "spiritual" feelings that non-religious people don't have.  Not true, everyone has access to those feelings, atheists just interpret them differently.</comment>

<comment>Ok maybe it's part of what make atheists less spiritual and more "heady". In your DNA perhaps. Are there many female atheists? Science types. The combination is a good balance. Compare the Pentecostals (talking in tongues) to the Atheists (tech types) - quite polar opposite. </comment>

<comment>Your personal experience doesn't matter much, since I'm pretty sure that you don't know many atheists very well.  Also, your "study" (I thought you said there were multiple ones?) involves counting word use on Twitter and then suggesting that this somehow is useful data for psychoanalyzing random strangers.  Scientific, that is not.Given that you support Trump, you may want to re-check your heading on that path to doing the right thing.  Trump stands for everything that Jesus preached against: hate, greed, violence, etc.  You may want to give the Gospels another read if you're fuzzy on that.</comment>

<comment>Hate is hands down coming from the progressives and extreme religions. Who wants more of that in our country. Wow!</comment>

<comment>Sarah there is not worth trying to reason with. She screams about "leftists" and "progressives" while accusing anyone that isn't a racist of being "anti-white".</comment>

<comment>Yes, he's a real Christian. He read all about it in 2 Corinthians.</comment>

<comment>Ha Doubt he reads the bible, but it's not a requirement from me. I just prefer an upbringing in a Christian environment. I'm not a bible thumper type at all, but grew up Presbyterian/Christian school, a great foundation. </comment>

<comment>Suppose the environment was not what you think it was or it was a proper one but didn't have the desired effect?Trump was sent to a military boarding school because his parents couldn't handle him.</comment>

<comment>Prob ADHD. He graduated top of his class in academics and athletics. I can link you on what his peers said about him. It was good. </comment>

<comment>Does this sound like Trump is a Christian or does it sound like he is mocking believers?"When I drink my little wine -- which is about the only wine I drink -- and have my little cracker, I guess that is a form of asking for forgiveness, and I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed," he said.

<comment>Not a good Trump moment.</comment>

<comment>Character shows in such moments if we allow ourselves to recognize it.</comment>

<comment>He's a pretty complex person, many facets to his personality. You should read about the things he has done for others. He's a private person, but he has a heart. </comment>

<comment>Whose name does an athiest call out at the point of orgasm?</comment>

<comment>I would not know. Doubt they get to that point easily. Over-analyzing the mechanics and less about the intimacy, which takes soulfulness. lol</comment>

<comment>You wonder how stupid these "evangelicals" are. http://watchingthewheelsdad.ne...</comment>

<comment>So, when is Trump going to speak at a major US mosque?</comment>

<comment>The day after gays picket them for their attitudes towards them.Thats ''when''.................</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter what Trump does or says.  Nothing seems to matter.  Trump must have sold his soul to the devil to be the Republican nominee and he is protected by the dark lord.  Hopefully, the deal didn't include the presidency.  Satan couldn't be that rash.</comment>

<comment>True.  I am hoping for the best but prepared for the worst.  Well, not really.  How do you prepare for Trump?</comment>

<comment>buy stock in Remington, because if there is one thing that is going to make liberals into gun lovers is a Trump presidency.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  The choices are really, really bad this time.  Far worse than usual and that's saying a lot.</comment>

<comment>At least Trump puts himself third - slightly behind God and Jesus - on his "fabulous" scale. That proves his humility, devotion, and sheer brilliance.</comment>

<comment>It was inspiring to see Trump struggle with who got top billing.</comment>

<comment>And he can hold his breath longer than Caruso.</comment>
