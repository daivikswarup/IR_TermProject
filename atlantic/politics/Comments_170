<comment>Unemployment is down to pre-2008 (normal) levels. Real income for the middle class is up about 9% over the last 10 years. About 20 million more Americans have health care due to the ACA. The TARP has been completely paid back, meaning the total cost to American taxpayer was zero. Finally, America is doing something about global warming. Thanks Obama!Not seeing the cliff, sorry.</comment>

<comment>Every Obama policy has been anti business, anti growth. He has been aided by record deficit spending, quantitative easing by the fed and record low interest rates. Even with that growth has been tepid at best. The ACA has succeeding in raising healthcare costs for everyone except those who now get it as a gift from the tax payers. Global warming is a big 'so what'.</comment>

<comment>Hope over experience.“The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie--deliberate, contrived and dishonest--but the myth--persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.

<comment>The politics of hope?  My politics of hope is that this time around I don't make the same mistake I made when I voted for Obama TWICE.</comment>

<comment>Twice? Ouch. I could not let myself vote for someone who's name was changed from Barry Soetoro to Barack Hussein Obama. A weird vibe. </comment>

<comment>You think I knew all that when I voted for him?  Hell no.  I was a lib back then.  I assumed libs would never opt to present the nation someone that deceptive and chameleonic.  Is that a word, chameleonic?  lol</comment>

<comment>Ha oh well.  He put on a big show during his campaign. I was not into politics much so I was a low-info then going strictly by his name. My mom had read his book and filled me in on his background. She said he was bad news. </comment>

<comment>Voting on the basis of a person's name. You're right..... That's pretty "low info."Hope you're better educated for the next election.</comment>

<comment>Not if its a Muslim name running for president. 'Shariah'  is a governing law. I'm very informed now though.</comment>

<comment>Evidently not. He was named after his father. Which a perfectly respectable thing to do. If you are basing a name on who they are, you are pretty shallow.And Obama has not, at any time, tried to implement Sharia Law in this country. In fact, the only people who have tried to implement anything even close to Sharia Law are the GOP/TP by trying to put their religious beliefs into law.All Sharia Law is religious beliefs made into law. It doesn't matter what those beliefs are.</comment>

<comment>It was more than a name if you read further. </comment>

<comment>Then she hadn't actually read either of his books, just believed what the rwnj pundits had to say.</comment>

<comment>Ha she knows a whole lot more than you. And all she said would happen came to be true. Too bad for you low-infos. </comment>

<comment>So, you didn't actually pay any attention to all of the information on his background when he was running? His name was NEVER legally Barry Soetoro. However, like so many other step-children of the same era, he unofficially used his step-father's last name while his mother was married to him. But it was never legally changed.</comment>

<comment>NONE of it.  I was blinded by liberalism.  The result of that is that now I'm so far to the right it's almost crazy.</comment>

<comment>Grow a pair of what? It's my opinion. What's it to you. I can have a vibe if I want. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I hate that too. Wallsteet corruption, so many jobs moving overseas, large PAC donors running our country, huge tax loopholes for the wealthy, and too much EIC being fraudulent and encouraging more welfare babies. </comment>

<comment>It wasn't changed.</comment>

<comment>It is characteristic of an establishment Goldman-Sachs funded politician like Obama ( or Bush ) to toss around the tired, cliched verbiage about "partisan rancor" and donkeys and elephants who just can't get along.Oh really. I think the problem is that they get along too damned well.Problem is - the recent success of Sanders and Trump points to people waking up to the real truth - that the problem is Wall Street-financed politicians of both parties who get together behind closed doors and sell out average people.</comment>

<comment>lol Actually, it is Cruz who is a Goldman-Sachs funded politician, not Obama.</comment>

<comment>Go educate yourself.</comment>

<comment>Why wasn't Rahm Emmanuel there to be support his old buddy?</comment>

<comment>President Obama has called Republicans teabaggers, hostage-takers and compared them to terrorists. You don't get to lecture about civility in politics after that. Sorry, but no.</comment>

<comment>Not if you imply that I, personally, am not paying my fair share, and later trying to tell me that:"If you've got a business – you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen."and all that implies.I realize that this is out of context, and perhaps he did not mean it the way it sounds, but, by God, it sure came out that way, and in fact, his supporters, not noted for either originality or skepticism when applied to one of their own, certainly jumped on the bandwagon.If Reagan had perhaps given a speech that identified recipients of social services had said:"If you've got a child--you didn't feed it, nourish it. Somebody else made that happen."The recipients would have rightly felt singled out and belittled.</comment>

<comment>No,  it "didn't come out that way"  at all.   But Fox News twisted it,  every Republican claimed they were too stupid to understand the comment,  and finally,  we had to take them and the Mittster at their word and re-elect President Obama.In the end,  YOU'RE the ones that made poor Ann Romney bawl on that stage.</comment>

<comment>Beg to disagree--it *did* come out that way--I heard it, and silly me, I had just voted for him.</comment>

<comment>4 years before, I guess?</comment>

<comment>Yep. First time thru I was shocked by Palin, and also by McCain's acquiescence to her selection, raising the old doubts about the quality of his judgment.But I read a pretty neat sigfile that said:"I voted for Obama in 2008 to prove that I am not a racist."I voted against Obama in 2012 to prove that I am not a masochist."</comment>

<comment>IOW, if you believed that you're an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Guilty as charged.</comment>

<comment>I recall TheWinnerOfTheNobelPeacePrize advocating bringing a gun to a knife fight, maintaining the lie about the VideoThatCausedTheBenghaziAttack, dismissing and denigrating all who dare disagree, and happily playing the race card at every opportunity. What did his pastor Reverend Wright proclaim about the behavior of chickens?</comment>

<comment>He has been a pretty good president. Started out with a terrible mess and brought it under control,jobs have been created, the United States at last has universally mandated health insurance, there have been no scandals( except the ones the republicans have tried to stir up) . He has made many positive changes in the area of wages, advanced social justice, tried to keep us out of terrible wars, improved our image around the world, and cut the deficit. Proud to have voted for him and proud to have him as the president. Sorry you guys don't feel the same way. Sure hope you're not planning to vote for trump.</comment>

<comment>1. WE DEMAND at the minimum, Tump supporting students and Tump supporting faculty to be reflected by the national percentage of Tump supporters in the country2. WE DEMAND that St. John's University’s President, Conrado Gempesaw, writes a handwritten apology to Trump supporters standing in solidarity with the victim and that he hold a press conference in the St. John's Student Center reading the letter. In the letter and at the press conference, Conrado Gempesaw must acknowledge his black on white violence, recognize that systems of oppression exist, and provide a verbal commitment to fulfilling the demands of Trump supporters worldwide. We want St. John's University to admits their gross negligence, allowing a violent offender to leave university grounds without charge, thus consenting to physical violence towards Trump supporters, and lastly refusing to replace the coffee that was sacrificed in the protection of innocent Trump supporters.3. WE DEMAND that Cliff Durand be expelled from St. John's University effective immediately4. WE DEMAND the university create and enforce a comprehensive political awareness and inclusion curriculum throughout all campus departments and units, mandatory for all students, faculty, staff and administration. This curriculum must be vetted, maintained, and overseen by a board comprised of students, staff and faculty who identify as supporters of Trump.5. WE DEMAND that by the academic year 2017-18, the St. John's University increases the percentage of Trump supporting faculty and staff members campus-wide by 10 percent.6. WE DEMAND that St. John's University composes a strategic 10-year plan on May, 1 2016 that will increase retention rates for Trump supporting students, sustain diversity curriculum and training, and promote a more safe and inclusive campus.7. WE DEMAND that St. John's University increases funding and resources for the St. John's University Counseling Center for the purpose of hiring additional mental health professionals, particularly those of who support Trump, boosting mental health outreach and programming across campus, increasing campus-wide awareness and visibility of the counseling center, and reducing lengthy wait times for prospective clients.8.

<comment>What a basket case this guy is.</comment>

<comment>President Obama came in with hope. Hope that those who he had to work alongside would work with him for the good of the country. Well, that never happened. Republicans made it perfectly clear from day one that they had no intention of working with him and have been true to their word no matter the cost to the country. So when people say they are disappointed with President Obama they should try working with obstructionist idiots who cared more about political games that doing what was right for the good of the country. I am proud of President Obama and what he has achieved even without the help of those useless pieces of crap in Congress. If they were in any other line of work shirking their duties as they have done they would have all been fired. Congress is an embarrassment to the country. Get paid good money with benefits for doing absolutely nothing of consequence and that in itself is a disgrace.</comment>

<comment>I'm proud of my obstructing Congressman. I'll be sending him back unless someone more right wing primaries him.</comment>

<comment>You think obstructing is a good thing even when that obstruction may hurt the country just because the obstructionists can't the stand the president? That's totally un-patriotic!</comment>

<comment>Maybe he thinks that obstructing Obama's policy goals aren't exactly destructive ;)</comment>

<comment>Then he is an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Nice one!</comment>

<comment>Maybe because they realized that this Shitbag's ideas were wrong to begin with?</comment>

<comment>He could not even work alongside Olympia Snow and Susan Collins. He never really tried to reach across the divide.</comment>

<comment>Work alongside! They made it clear they didn't want him to succeed from day one. So work alongside any Republican was a lost cause to start with.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you know much about the politics of Olympia Snow and Susan Collins. If President Obama could not reach out them then he did not try very hard.</comment>

<comment>You seem to forget, Obama came into office with huge Democratic majorities in Congress. The GOP had no power to obstruct him, until after the 2010 midterms.</comment>

<comment>Wow! A whole two years to get done all he wanted to do.  He is a man not a miracle worker! Once GOP got in  it has been no way no how on anything the Prez has proposed. So you can keep spinning that two year majority all you want it doesn't wash in the grand scheme of things.</comment>

<comment>Nor is it true. His 60 vote Senate majority lasted roughly 6 weeks between Sen. Franken being seated in July and Sen. Kennedy dying in August.</comment>

<comment>I hear this all the time. People forget that his majority consisted of 58 Democratic and 2 Independent Senators, and this only lasted for roughly two months. Sen. Franken wasn't sworn in until the summer and Sen. Kennedy died 6 weeks later. In a Congress where filibustering has become the norm, he's votes short of passing any real legislation.This is why the ACA was passed through reconciliation and generated so much outrage for being undemocratic. Reconciliation votes can't be filibustered.</comment>

<comment>Actually, he only had a super majority for about 5 months. And the GOP/TP DID obstruct him and every other US citizen.When the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy were set to expire (remember that?) the GOP/TP refused to allow an extension to unemployment unless those tax cuts were made permanent. This was when we were still  struggling to get out of the mess that Bush left us.But the GOP/TP didn't care enough about the US to actually do well by it.</comment>

<comment>Obama is responsible for the Trump/Sanders mess. He showed no regard for Conservative thought or the Constitution, and his well-intended, Liberal agenda hurt the people he claimed it would help, as all well-intended, Liberal policies do.Now we can't even have a discussion because actual Socialist ideas and actual Trumpist ideas are being taken seriously, and subsequently worshiped by the dumb and unqualified.Obama's legacy will be mob rule and potentially even political violence. We'll need a coup d'etat if Trump or Sanders gets in.</comment>

<comment>Give us all an example of President Obama's unconstitutional behavior.Also,  note that "... no regard for Conservative thought..." comes from reasonable,  educated people watching Republicans deny the long-since proven science of global warming as they collectively fawn over contributions from Koch Industries.What Conservative thought?   Your Congressman doesn't have a brain in his head to do anything but hold his hand out for donations. But it's okay,  Bernie Sanders is going to straighten things out next year.   You just nominate one of those clowns and the electorate will do the rest. </comment>

<comment>No declaration of war in Libya, Obamacare, Fast & Furious, using the IRS to target Conservative groups, ignoring immigration laws, attacks on the Second Amendment, and more executive orders/memorandum than any president in 70 years.My point is that Obama doesn't care about the Constitution. He doesn't believe in Liberty. Our country was founded to limit the powers of government (the source of which is the consent of the governed) and to maximize the powers of the individual (the source of which is our "Creator"). He thinks it's his job to run our lives for us, but he's wrong. His job is to kill and punish people who harm Americans, and to leave us alone!"Educated" is not the right word. Liberals are schooled. They are taught what to think, and are given safe spaces to hide from the truth in. Liberals have completely hijacked the humanities because they aren't good enough to get real jobs. They can't produce anything people want to buy and are of no value to any employers. They are too lazy to achieve mastery in any academic disciplines, so they embrace post-modernism (participation trophy culture). They write some BS dissertations and eventually get tenure. Then they sit on their asses and tell kids about the world without ever having experienced it for themselves.And thank God for the Kochs. True patriots fighting for our Liberty every day. They are some of the kindest and most philanthropic people in America, and they employ 100,000 people at an average salary of $65k. They've donated $1.5 billion to various charities, museums, and arts centers. What have you ever done?Your God has never even had a job. He's a career politician. Every penny he owns was taken from taxpayers. He's a drain on society and should be flipping burgers like the lost generation of Communists he's cultivating. Post-millennials are going to outearn this generation by a staggering amount. I can't wait to see it.Your God won't straiten anything out. Rich people are smarter than him, and they will hide their money overseas. The poor will become poorer with fewer job opportunities, zero savings, terrible education, and no sense of responsibility. And the rich will leave the country. Thank God (the real one, not yours) he has no chance of being elected.</comment>

<comment>What an idiot!   The ACA is passed by the House and Senate,  signed into law and passes three Supreme Court challenges!The Snorkeler gags on the bile he swims through for hours on Fox News and comes up gagging as though something is stuck in his throat.It's the Constitution!  He wouldn't recognize it if it bit him on the rear end! </comment>

<comment>Yes, ACA was passed before anyone actually read the bill.</comment>

<comment>First, that is an inaccurate statement.  Lots of Congressmen read the bill.  Second, there's nothing in the Constitution about reading material.  A bill passed both Houses of Congress and was signed into law.  It's 100% constitutional.  The process was pristine.You just don't like the outcome.  Well, hang on.  Single Payer is coming with Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>There is a whole list of Supreme Court decision against Obama's executive reach. The latest was just the other day, when the Supremes put a stay on the EPAs attempt to take over state regulation of the coal industry with new regulations designed to bankrupt the coal industry.</comment>

<comment>If they were doing anything but carrying water for the carbon crooks, you'd be wailing "judges are involved in legislating!"That isn't a "decision".  It's a stay.  And the carbon industry is begging any Republican they can find, saying, "Oh, we gave you all of this money and we're supposed to be able to ruin the planet as we get as rich as possible, that's what you promised us!"And, sure enough, every Republican nodded, agreeing that they had all been paid off to say Global Warming isn't real.</comment>

<comment>We have an activist Supreme Court that thinks it can interpret the Constitution as a living document. Is it any wonder that the Justices who pride themselves on reading the Constitution objectively, as it was intended to be read, opposed Obamacare?Take your hollow ad hominem attacks elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>"... the Justices who pride themselves on reading the Constitution objectively... "You mean the partisan hacks that voted to turn dark money loose to elect more Republicans with nary a whiff of the Founding Fathers thought anywhere in evidence?They aren't objective,  they're objectionable! </comment>

<comment>The Founding Fathers didn't intend to tell us what to do. They told the government what not to do. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the government can regulate campaign finance. There is, however, a First Amendment. And that First Amendment guarantees our Right to participate in politics.You don't get to change the rules because you dislike the outcome. Thank God for Citizens United.</comment>

<comment>"You don't get to change the rules because you dislike the outcome."Evidently, if you're a Republican on the Roberts Court, that's EXACTLY what you do.  After all, Citizens United CHANGED the rules of outside political finance.</comment>

<comment>No, Citizens United restored our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution. Any laws that seek to tell people how much money they are allowed to donate to political campaigns are changing the rules. The Supreme Court was absolutely right. Sanders and Trump are unconstitutional and wrong.</comment>

<comment>Citizens United restored NOTHING.  It CREATED a new donor class, without transparency, nothing but dark oligarch money funneled into less Democracy and more Plutocracy.You are utterly delusional.</comment>

<comment>You don't get to tell people how much they can donate to political campaigns. It's not up for a vote. We have Freedom of Speech, and we can participate in the political process. You don't get to rig the game in your favor.We are not a Democracy. We are a Constitutional Republic. We vote on who will represent us and defend our God-given Rights. We don't mob up like buffalo and push around the minority opinion.</comment>

<comment>They can. What facts lead you to think that they can't?</comment>

<comment>Common sense.Though the Liberal Seminaries, currently known as American universities, allow students to subjectively interpret what they read, every thinking person on the planet realizes that you are supposed to try to understand what the author means, not what it could mean out of context.Can you imagine if a small claims court judge decided to interpret laws his way instead of the way they were intended to be interpreted?</comment>

<comment>Why bring in the Koch bros? They mean nothing to most conservatives.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, if a 'meal ticket' means nothing to a college kid, and campaign contributions are sniffed at by your Republican friends, yeah, they mean nothing to Conservatives.</comment>

<comment>Just as Soro's means nothing to most people on the left.</comment>

<comment>Obama is a two bit hypocrite. All he did was rip Bush and the republicans apart blaming them for everything. His only accomplishments was to make this economy still suck and let his Muslim friends ISIS get away with murder more and more.</comment>

<comment>In related news, Bernie Madoff wants people to stop being greedy and OJ Simpson held a joint press conference with Bill Clinton to tell everyone to stop abusing women.</comment>

<comment>You are responsible for dividing Americans and stirring unrest and resentment, Mr. Obama.</comment>

<comment>No, he is not. The fact that over half the country elected him as President despite the bigots who fought with extremely dirty tactics are the ones who are responsible for dividing Americans and stirring unrest and resentment.</comment>

<comment>Obama is nostalgic for the 'Good Ol' Days' when the Democrats not only controlled the Illinois legislature, but the governorship as well. His memories might have been different had the Republican controlled one or both houses of the legislature.</comment>

<comment>President Obama exacerbated the partisan divide rather than reduced it. Here was a politician who could not even reach out and work with Olympia Snow and Susan Collins! That shows he never really tried.</comment>

<comment>After hearing this crap for eight years, I have come to a very simple conclusion: Obama is delusional. He has this self-conception of himself as being the only adult in the room, the only reasonable man, that is just miles from the way he is perceived by everybody else, both his followers and his opponents.Obama is very, very partisan. So partisan that he is unable to engage with his opponents on the basis of ideas. Instead of contending with opposing ideas, he knocks down straw man versions of them. He cannot describe conservative ideas in any fashion that conservatives would acknowledge as their own. It's always "I want to solve this grave problem with some new government program, vs my opponents who want to do nothing" -- because his opponents don't want a new government program; they think it's a job for the private sector. But he can't imagine ever wanting to accomplish anything outside of the government. For Obama, the very purpose of rule is to increase government reach and power.Then he wonders why his opponents don't abandon their ideas and flock to him. He wonders why partisanship increases and civility declines.I'd tell Obama to look in the mirror, but I know all he sees there is an object of adoration.</comment>

<comment>I have a hunch that as this fractious group of Republican legislators ripens, you'll come to miss the logic of Obama's message, even if not the messenger.</comment>

<comment>Obama never made an effort to work with Republicans and even with Congress in general.  From day one, his approach has been, "I'm right and you're wrong".Not only is Obama an ideological partisan but a narcissist who always thinks he's the smartest guy in the room and people who fail to agree with him deserve no consideration or respect.   This is why he can't understand why not everyone shares his point of view.  This is made worse by the fact that he's not a particularly smart or informed person. </comment>

<comment>your comment is totally false; president obama's problem is that he spent *too* much time trying to "bring people together". when he was first elected, he had super majorities in both houses in congress; when he was pushing obamacare, he had no need to bother with republicans. instead, he spent too much time trying to offer olive branches to republicans thinking that he would "bring everyone together".what happened instead, is that the republicans took these offers as a sign of weakness. it became so ridiculous that republicans even withdrew support for legislation that the had previously sponsored once the president expressed support.</comment>

<comment>i think that the biggest flaw in president obama's outlook on "compromise" is that he seems to believe in compromise is a way to avoid conflict; but the problem is that sometimes you have to have the conflict to get to the point where compromise is possible. wars typically end in some form of compromise - otherwise wars would be fought until one side was completely annihilated, and that generally happens. so the sides fight until they come to a realization that the costs of continued fighting are such that a compromise looks like the better way to go.when president obama came into office, it seemed that his approach was to look for "compromise" from day one. the problem was that the republicans weren't interested in compromise; they were interested in making the president look like a fool - and in the early years of president obama's administration, the republicans did unfortunately succeed in making the president look like a fool. this, coming from a person who considers himself to be a supporter of president obama.where bernie sanders has it right, in my view, is that you do have to have the conflict in order to change the system enough such that some form of compromise is possible. this is why the hillary clinton "democratic moderate" approach, won't work any better than it did when bill clinton was president.feel the bern...</comment>

<comment>The system is rigged. Any criticism of President Obama's actions and you will be branded a racist. The system is rigged.</comment>

<comment>9 years later, the President has still not figured out that politics is how Washington works, and to be successful, you need to be a good politician. He can market himself to the masses, but is utterly clueless when it comes to cutting deals and building alliances with other Washingtonians. Being the President is not enough to impress Senators and Representatives that have lived and worked in Washington for most of their adult lives.  Leadership requires respect, and respect must be earned. It is not a perk of holding the office.</comment>

<comment>I think the most damning testament to his "skills" as a politician is his relationship to the Democrats of Congress: He can't work with them either</comment>

<comment>Obama has two major accomplishments.One is the Iran deal -- he avoided a new war and the possibility, one among many -- that humanity would nuke itself out of existence.The second was raising hopes that neither he nor the "free market" racket could fulfill.Now comes the hard part, the struggle over the real basics, not the old Republocrat con game.</comment>

<comment>Obama's method has been, start in the middle and negotiate to the RIGHT. Republicans started WAY out on the right and stayed there. Not an effective way to govern if you are a progressive.</comment>
