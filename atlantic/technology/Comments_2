<comment>"...Itâ€™s possible for machines to beat their opponents with pure brute force, crunching through every possible set of moves...".No, it is not practically possible to do this with current computing hardware and software.The number of distinct 40-move chess games is far greater than the number of electrons in the observable universe.</comment>

<comment>Analytically, it's interesting for the advancement of AI. But who plays 5 card poker in the first place? Too many combinations to match up against a computer with. The only poker people have played the last 20-30 years has been Texas Hold'em.</comment>

<comment>IIRC the actual work is done using TH as the game of choice. Don't let the stock photo for the article throw you off. UofA.  Polaris vs Phil Laak. Very disturbing!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>It was limit, heads up Texas Hold 'Em, a form of TH almost no one plays.  Most heads up games are no limit.  In fact, most TH is no limit, and that makes a huge difference in risk.  With limit poker, the computer can take more calculated risks without the punishment of losing everything.  Over the long-haul, the computer can probably make better decisions (or equal decisions) compared to the human.  But no limit is a very different game.</comment>

<comment>So, assuming this isn't being done already, how long will it be before a computer takes the human customer role in on-line gambling sites such as are now legal in New Jersey and other states?</comment>
