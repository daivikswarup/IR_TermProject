<comment>“dumb fucks,” which is what Zuckerberg called the people who signed up for Facebook when it was new, according to online chat transcripts that emerged as part of a lawsuit several years ago."Nothing's changed.</comment>

<comment>Awww. That's kinda harsh and ungenerous, huh?  :^)</comment>

<comment>Perhaps it's harsh, but it's absolutely true. It's the same Zuck only much much richer and much more powerful.</comment>

<comment>Zuckberg was an immature 19 year. news at 11</comment>

<comment>He was only telling the truth,even at that tender age! Out of the mouths of babes ... .</comment>

<comment>I bet you're one of those guys that denies ever pooping in a diaper, because, ya know, that's what babies do and you're above such notions. Yes?</comment>

<comment>The proper technical term for "dumb fucks" is "Zuckerberg morons".</comment>

<comment>Yep, Facebook's is a malignant scrounge on humanity.  It's not good for mental health or human freedom more generally.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand why people are surprised India is stopping U.S. internet companies from moving in. China and Russia already have their own domestic social network alternatives to Facebook because they justifiably didn't want western influences to sneak in and "disrupt" things. Western companies for too long thought they could get their way in India because they were allowed to set up call centers there. Surprise, surprise, the rest of the world isn't as interested in this free trade, open borders idea coming out of Washington and Silicon Valley.</comment>

<comment>Many American companies operate just fine in India, investments are increasing all the time. This has nothing to do with free trade.</comment>

<comment>American companies operate fine in India with Indian workers. In the U.S., Indian companies operate fine with Indian workers. "Free" trade is only benefiting wealthy Americans and Indians.</comment>

<comment>American companies operate cheaper with Indian labor under H1B visas, laying off US citizens and driving down wages and living standards in the USA.But hey, because: shareholder valueToo bad you have to sell that IRA off when you lose your job though...iWin!</comment>

<comment>Er... B-1 visas are given to visitors seeking entry for business purposes. If you meant H-1B visas, then you're totally wrong as well. Employers have to report to the USCIS that they are paying their H-1B workers the same wages as their local counterparts.</comment>

<comment>We know what he means, tacboy. Quit be disingenuous.</comment>

<comment>As you wish: I'll bet you don't even know what 'disingenuous' means.</comment>

<comment>Sure, and companies will reassure anyone who asks they're perfectly willing to hire native workers if they're willing to work for as little as the H-1B staff who can like it or leave the country.It's a pretty rich line to keep on parroting when most of the actual work at the DOL itself is done by H1B contractors. I guess try as they might there's just not a free file clerk or database admin to be found between here and India/Russia</comment>

<comment>Employers don't have to pay some of the taxes they pay for hiring citizens/residents, so even if they were to pay same wage, the visa'ed staff are still cheaper (also subservient/captive).  And no local is paid $50K for engineering.  It's easy enough to feed USCIS a bogus job title to get around going rates.And the J1/OPT, ultra cheap.  No taxes (FICA, unemployment insurance, etc.) and in some cases, not even income tax.</comment>

<comment>And what taxes would that be? It's easy to make things up without giving examples.</comment>

<comment>For a J1/OPT (student/student training) visa'd employee, no FICA, no unemployment insurance and in some cases, no income tax.  For an H-1B, or E "temporary" immigrant visa, no unemployment insurance.  I don't know if they have to pay workman's compensation insurance for any of them.  For an L visa, they pay them the wage rate of their country, which would be the lowest of the low, compared to US rates.</comment>

<comment>So simply put, employers DO NOT pay any additional taxes to their hired citizens compared to their H-1B workers.And I hope you realize that H-1B workers are way more screwed than citizens when they become unemployed.</comment>

<comment>Employers pay less taxes to employ H-1Bs and no taxes to employ OPT.  How is this simple statement beyond your comprehension?I am WAY more concerned with the unemployed STEM than H-1B.  H-1Bs aren't "screwed".  Employers are obligated by law to pay their airfare back to their country after their "temporary" job is over.  Citizens, royally screwed, 6 months of unemployment and their career is over as their degree is STEM is useless with a market flooded with cheap J1/OPT and H-1B.  Citizen student STEM, blown out of the water before any chance at a career in STEM.  1/3 of US citizen STEM students get STEM jobs, only 8% still in STEM after 5 years.</comment>

<comment>Unemployment insurance/benefit is not a tax --- comprende? It's not even paid for by the employer but by the state. Which by the way, the H-1B doesn't get even although it's included in his income tax just like everyone else. You're right about the airfare but that doesn't extend to his family or personal items.So any argument about the poor unemployed STEM doesn't get my sympathy since there's no such thing as a 'cheaper' H-1B employee.</comment>

<comment>Okay, so the employer saves a lot of money not having to pay tax, fees, etc.  CHEAPER.</comment>

<comment>Haha. Can you even read past one sentence? Now, you're starting to make the case that employers prefer smarter --- not cheaper --- workers.</comment>

<comment>Just because you're antagonistic doesn't mean you're correct.  And Disney wouldn't have existing staff train their H-1B replacements if they were "smarter".</comment>

<comment>H1B, excuse meemployers lie:http://www.theatlantic.com/bus...http://www.computerworld.com/a...http://www.snopes.com/2015/06/...</comment>

<comment>Nothing to do with shareholders.  It's CEOs who pocket what they can and offshore/tax shelter the excess, scapegoat the shareholders who never see the profits.</comment>

<comment>India is democratic, unlike China. Protection from foreign "social disruption" is ordinarily the calling card of dictatorships and oligarchies rather than democracies.  This isn't to say that India wasn't justified here, but companies reasonably expect India to be a tad different than China.[I'm intentionally leaving Russia out, because they're nothing like India.  And they're basically a mafia state.]</comment>

<comment>Pakistan was supplied with nukes because India was a socialist country.</comment>

<comment>But that simplified Cold War view no longer holds. Today it is clear that India's economy is growing much more quickly than Pakistan's and we no longer fear that India is becoming some sort of Soviet client. In fact, the US signed a nuclear deal with India several years ago.US businesses have been very involved in India for some time. I don't see that changing. But that doesn't mean India needs to accept every new program from Facebook, either. It doesn't sound like Facebook's "generous" Free Basis program was being offered to poor people in Appalachia or migrant worker camps in the California farm country. The idea that it is aimed at poor people in India, but not the US, makes it appear less altruistic and more opportunistic.</comment>

<comment>The world according to US oligarchy's interest is not what the population of these countries has the right to uphold whether it is socialism or their own software industry.  US businesses  do not have the the privilege  to hack other countries for their interest by hacking the net and pushing it into other regions.      Poor people of Appalachia will decide to maje free moon shine or  get a facebook access! to sell moonshine.. but that is their choice.  Their choice does not transfer to India.</comment>

<comment>Indians love Facebook, YouTube, Twiiter and Google. Indians are rooting for Amazon as much as they root for Flipkart. Facebook is still allowed to offer free Internet to Indians.All India has done is: stopped its telcos from offering differential pricing, ie, zero rating. Free Basics is just one case. The whole debate and movement started as protest against Airtel Zero, which is an Indian company. People en-masse downvoted Flipkart (an Indian company)'s app. Indians have lauded Google *a western company)'s free wi-fi and Project Loon.You, sir, don't know what you are talking about.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, in all the verbiose rhetoric of the article, they missed the meat of the point, It's about differential pricing, not whether facebook can offer a service.</comment>

<comment>The opposition was to Free Basics not American internet companies</comment>

<comment>China also likes the idea of having a domestic Chinese company fill that space in the market ecosystem. It means the money the service earns stays in China and it makes it easier for the government to regulate (censor) content on the platform.In addition, it furthers the government's narrative that Chia is becoming a power in technology, developing its own products rather than just manufacturing iPhones. Authorities have even gone so far as to argue that the infamous Great Firewall is good for the country, because it allows Chinese networks to to develop, rather than letting foreign companies "colonize" Chinese markets.</comment>

<comment>Colonialism is inherently coercive, while Facebook is a voluntary free service.  India is a sovereign country that will legislate as it sees fit.  Andreessen made a dumb, uninformed comment.  There's simply no story here.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm ... one of the most famous names in Silicon Valley blatantly and flippantly advocated Colonialism (and by association Racism, Occupation, War, Famine, Death, etc) and it should be construed simply as 'dumb' and 'uninformed' !!  What rarefied world do you live in ??</comment>

<comment>Americans don't know what the word "colonialism" means to Indians.</comment>

<comment>"Americans don't know what the word 'colonialism' means to Indians"If this is true, I don't see how it makes what he said any less awful. In some ways it's worse.And it certainly doesn't mean he's any less likely to actually colonialize the Indian Internet.</comment>

<comment>Errr. I guess he forgot The Boston Tea Party, Battle of Concord, etc...  Of course that was a long long time ago, much more recent for India so the wounds still sting and bleed.</comment>

<comment>We can't expect an American to fully understand a historical Indian grievance against England.If we did, then for consistency, we should also expect every person in the world to understand every country's grievances against every other country, which is obviously unrealistic.  Do you fully understand Finland's resentment against Sweden over the historical injustices of the Hanseatic League?  You may know all about it.  But if you don't, I can't blame you.All we can realistically expect is that Andreessen not moralize about things he doesn't understand.</comment>

<comment>The comment may be bad but that doesn't mean it deserves an article written about it.</comment>

<comment>Bland food?</comment>

<comment>Don't talk nonsense. Mr Andreeson never advocated colonialism. He decried anti-colonialism.Do you see the difference?</comment>

<comment>Are you retarded ??  Go look up what he said before you spew idiocy.</comment>

<comment>Now, now cupcake, no need for the insults. Perhaps you need to retire to a safe place for a wee while.Now, as an African, I can definitely see the delicious opportunity that political correctness allows The Global South™ to get a good kicking in on a rich white fellow.However, a calmer reading will show that Mr A only seems to be expressing a) his frustration that India was not taking up his company's offer, and b) suggesting that their refusal was informed by an overreaction to India's colonial past.At no time did Mr A suggest that colonisation was a good thing, or that India should in way become a vassal state of the USA.My point, and I stand by it, is that 'anti anti-colonisation' is being erroneously read as "pro-colonisation", when of course the latter does not follow from the former.The very fact that Mr A and MR Z had to clarify for the SJWs that no one was "pro-colonisation" is witness to what Mr A was really being accused of.And yes, too much ant-colonisation is destructive - the entire Juche philosophy of North Korea is a 60 year exhibit.</comment>

<comment>Its either black or white.  You are either pro-colonialism or anti-colonialism.  As an 'African' if you are ambivalent about colonialism i can only imagine you are a white south-african or from zimbabwe or some other colonized country !  What does "too much ant-colonisation is destructive" even mean ?!!!  Are you suggesting a small dose of racism and oppression and resource-extraction is 'good' for the colonized people ?!!  What a sick mind !!</comment>

<comment>"Its either black or white.  You are either pro-colonialism or anti-colonialism."Don't be silly sweetheart: this is not the student union - you don't get to play and make the rules up as you go along.How did you get to me being ambivalent about colonisation?All I pointed out is that clearly people like yourself have unilaterally decided that people who have critique that an excessive anti-colonial backlash could be counter productive, are deemed to be in favour of Raj 2.0.Which neither Mr A, nor myself are.As for the tasteless comments about what 'kind' of African I might or might not be, that is precisely the kind of "well he is a ___, so he MUST think like ___" that I thought we were all past. [Either way, you still don't know what 'kind' I am :) ]Note too, that should we happen upon a white Zimbabwean, they could just as easily dismiss native Indians positions using your morality: "oh, he's an Indian, of course he would think like that".But of course they could, could they? Because, in your world view, its not about ideas, but rather about which factions are legitimate and can express opinions, even outrageous discriminatory ones, and which factions must just listen.I am starting to suspect that this is actually the issue at hand: Mr A is a member of a 'guilty' faction - his actual offence was to have an opinion that was not just a grovelling apology.You might also observe from this dialogue, how to debate without insults.</comment>

<comment>--" its not about ideas, but rather about which factions are legitimate"So you favor the 'idea' of colonialism that basically killed millions of people around the world to fatten the coffers of Empire.  how many takers are there for this 'nuanced' position besides a bunch of racist europeans ?!!!--"that an excessive anti-colonial backlash could be counter productive"Anti-colonial backlash can NEVER be excessive.</comment>

<comment>"So you favor the 'idea' of colonialism"No - I have made it quite clear I do not favour colonisation in any form. Is this clear enough? What language would you prefer my declaration in?However,  - and you seem to battle with this, I don't equate a critique of anti-colinisation as being immediately a battle-cry for colonisation either."Anti-colonial backlash can NEVER be excessive."Sigh, I even gave you the canonical example of Juche in North Korea which only benefits a very small wicked elite.</comment>

<comment>In this second response, I am going to address your burning thirst to learn 'what does "too much ant-colonisation is destructive" even mean'.However, may I first request that you observe strict English grammar - there is no need for all the exclamation marks. Really, we know you care about the little people. One ! is plenty.Onwards then.If, like you do, one takes a binary black or white position on this issue, then of course you have excluded "too much" and "too little" from the solution space. So naturally you cannot understand it, because in an attempt to be ever more righteous, you have excluded its very existence.However if you were to take a more nuanced position and re-cast this issue as a spectrum then suddenly a whole new class of ideas appear: one can me mildly anti-colonisation, strongly anti-colonisation, vehemently anti-colonisation, etc.One can also choose one's anti-colonisation position based on the situation: less anti in say Ireland-UK and vehemently so (like me) in say Congo-Belgium. Unless of course you think they are the same?Further it allows a bizarre self-destructive ideology like Juche's "we need no ones help, we do everything ourselves, every outside influence is evil" to not only be identified as such but called for what it is: the Kim dynasty's cynical manipulation of anti-colonial sentiment for their own selfish benefit.Of course, many of the chattering classes, seldom consider Japanese-Korean colonisation: its purely a Europe versus ___ thing. Unless, you know, you ask a Korean :)I know it feels more righteous to take absolute black and white positions and that any kind of nuance feels like giving 'the enemy' legitimacy, but it is a incomplete understanding.A further benefit of a nuanced spectrum understanding is that it allows people like, say myself, to discuss colonisation and its anti-colonisation successor without being labelled, as you did: "a sick mind".So, to come back to the particular situation of Mr A. I suspect, that HE (not me) might be saying that anti-colonial sentiment amongst the politicians is being worn as a righteousness badge and is being used to taint a modern-day WTO sanction international trade proposal.Now, I hold a different position [you never asked] that is closer to the abuse of telco bandwidth [look for my upvotes]. I even hold opinions that are very skeptical of foreign investment as they always involve foreign dividend payments.But no amount of insults is going to make me believe that Mr A's opinions are the same as "19th century European colonisation was great, let's do it again".Again, I managed to do all of this without insulting you. You should try it.</comment>

<comment>Dude ... all this rambling BS makes zero sense to the original article and what i was saying.  Are you for real ?  You sound like a supercilious schmuck apologist for colonialism ?!!  Hiding behind your supposed english grammar superiority does not make you right ... it makes you sound like a dick.--"Of course, many of the chattering classes"Classist english schmuck !--"Really, we know you care about the little people. "And pricks like you dont ... its clear as daylight by now.--" less anti in say Ireland-UK and vehemently so (like me) in say Congo-Belgium."So the Belgians were bigger aszholes than the Brits.  Is that your point ?  What about the 100 million dead Indians in 200 years of british 'rule' in India ?--" that any kind of nuance feels like giving 'the enemy' legitimacy, but it is a incomplete understanding."So what is the 'complete' understanding ?  Do you want us to believe that colonialism was good for us Indians ?!!  You do realize :"By 1700, India was again the world's largest economy, accounting for 24.4% of global GDP, more than that of the whole of Europe combined, and almost ten times the size of Britain's economy, whose growth had already began benefiting from 'trade' with India, China and Africa. By the time of independence, a socially, economically and industrially devastated India's share of global GDP had plummeted to a mere 4.2%."</comment>

<comment>Yip, colonisation is bad for the locals. You seem to infer I think otherwise.But we were never discussing The Evils Of Colonisation, we were discussing whether Mr A's own opinion (not mine) about politicians deliberate or emotional response to their country's experience of colonisation is causing them to make less that optimum decisions in a new context. Unless FaceBook is the heir to the East India Company?You are of the opinion that this makes Mr A a Bad Person who dismisses the death of millions, etc,etc. whilst I urge caution before condeming the poor fellow for being pro- whatver he was merely anti the anti of.But you really have had a nice little venting, haven't you? Lot's of insults my way, a great re-visiting of the horrors.And cupcake, where I live, makes India's experience of colonisation look like a Sunday picnic. Its not a contest and its certainly not a licence to the moral high ground.World history, all of it, is not so traumatising that it cannot be discussed.</comment>

<comment>--"Mr A's own opinion (not mine) about politicians deliberate or emotional response to their country's experience of colonisation is causing them to make less that optimum decisions in a new context. "Bull.  This is not what 'Mr.A' was projecting ... !</comment>

<comment>"Bull.  This is not what 'Mr.A' was projecting ... !"Fair enough - it your binary world that a fair conclusion. In my more nuanced framework, its not necessarily so, I am prepared to give the man the benefit of the doubt - especially since he clarified himself later.I think we have gone as far as we can here.</comment>

<comment>My kids are on social media all the time. They don't use Facebook - nor do any of their many friends.  That fact would make me not want to buy FB stock.</comment>

<comment>Same here. Though I am one of the few people my own age who doesn't seem to be on it.</comment>

<comment>I don't get the FB business model either.  I am on the internet pretty regularly and I cannot think of a single internet ad that has gotten me to spend any money.  I realize I am an N of 1, but do companies actually make sales by buying internet ads or do they just think that they have to have a presence on the internet because it is the wave of the future?</comment>

<comment>Uhhh...kind of hard for me to be influenced - what with the ad-blocker and all.</comment>

<comment>It's more complicated than that. The benefits can't be assessed simply by "I saw an ad and so I bought the product". A lot of companies value Facebook advertising simply for brand recognition and reputation. It's a similar model as TV commercials but way farther reaching.I can't say that I've ever clicked on a Facebook ad and purchased right there just because I saw it on my page, but I've definitely been exposed to way more companies and products than I would have if I wasn't using Facebook and thus have more information when making purchases.</comment>

<comment>I understand that part, but has there been an actual measurable benefit or are these companies literally going on blind faith?</comment>

<comment>Far more valuable than the ads are the data they collect on your online habits. Your contacts, the sites you visit, when you're online and for how long. That info is HUGELY valuable to advertisers. People pay a lot of money for it.And yes, you don't buy a product because you saw an Internet ad, but can you think of a time you bought a product because you saw a print ad or tv commercial? Probably not. Yet those forms of advertising aren't even questioned. </comment>

<comment>FB is rapidly moving away from the blue F, what we think of as Facebook because you're correct that only old people use it any more. It's buying up other social networking platforms (it bought WhatsApp, it tried to buy snapchat) and it's establishing rudimentary networking in the people-rich developing world. </comment>

<comment>Only a completely bonkers pseudo-socialist government would stop a company from giving its (very impoverished) people a service for free.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. Because mainline access to mass private information by corporations and foreign intelligence services -- and of course the ability to manipulate billions of people -- is a wonderful idea.If something is "free," gosh I wonder how it spawns instant multi-billionaires. People used to have to work for that kind of money. For decades! Can you imagine?</comment>

<comment>You are seriously arguing that no internet at all is better than limited Facebook only internet?</comment>

<comment>Who said any such thing?What is it with strawmen? The strawmen that don't even make sense . . . You might consider an edit.BTW, feel free to have the last word. This stuff is a major time waster.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you read the article.  Please see stats above about how many people using this service already had internet access.</comment>

<comment>You don't seem to have fully read the article or fully understood its content. Of course corporations are well known for their pure altruism.</comment>

<comment>That so called limited internet is a red herring to get millions of young users hooked to platform.... If you can't Google search and visit any site - then free is of no use.  Plus this free thing per the report is to get them converted to full paid user.  What if I gave you free electricity but controlled on when you can use it -that's no use. Will you subscribe to such a service ?</comment>

<comment>Did you even read the article? Researched showed the target audience were people already connected (mostly college students). The idea they were "connecting the unconnected" was just marketing.</comment>

<comment>If those are the only options, then definitely.</comment>

<comment>We are arguing that is a false choice. </comment>

<comment>Facebook is NOT giving FreeBasics for free. You, sir, have fallen for Facebook's  PR. (Not your fault. For ex, many people even believed that Zuckerberg was actually donating his wealth to charity, when it was just financial restructuring of his for-profit investments).The telco partners, (Reliance in this case), bear the bandwidth costs of InternetDotOrg. So, Indian telcos, Indian consumers and the Indian public funds FreeBasics. If that is the case, why make Facebook the gatekeeper at all? Why not offer the full Internet.Try to read the actual regulation issued by TRAI.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for clarification on whos actually paying for the bandwidth.  I was wondering that </comment>

<comment>and neither do the Telcos like Reliance give away FreeBasics for "free". Rather it is bundled as part of a REGULAR monthly plan and if you dont subscribe to the monthly plan then no free basics for you.this is like getting a complementary cookie in a regular McDonalds meal and then going all mushy on how much this benefits all the poor starving kids that had nothing to eat</comment>

<comment>An excellent example of how certain people truly can buy the PR they want.It's expensive, too, so it should work.</comment>

<comment>You didn't read the article did you, Sertorius? You also haven't read much history either, have you?</comment>

<comment>The truly poor people in India do not have computers or mobile phones to access Facebook. They are truly begging and scavenging trash to get enough food to survive another day. Free internet doesn't mean much to people in such circumstances. They need to get a stable supply of food and shelter before internet access becomes a concern to them.</comment>

<comment>Imagine you're a poor parent. A rich eccentric offers to pay for your kids to go to college. It sounds great, but then you do some digging. The billionaire will choose the college. Or the major. Or will prevent your child from working at particular companies once she graduates. Or will demand your child buy their books food and utilities from a company run by him, at exorbitant rates. Or will demand your children's organs. Would you still take the deal? Maybe. If you were very desperate or very shortsighted.But you would be crazy to give up that much control over your life just to make things easier for awhile. You'd probably decide it's better to sacrifice in the short term. </comment>

<comment>Why dont you read Nilesh Trivedis post above.</comment>

<comment>Consider that if Facebook had offered Free Basics in the net neutral manner it's critics demanded, all of them would have adopted it without a second thought handing Facebook the colonial monopoly they so fear and getting it to foot the bill. That's financially unsustainable.Oh and about those scary Internet monopolies: AOL? MySpace? Anyone? Buehler?</comment>

<comment>Facebook does not foot the bill for Free Basics. Not in India, not in any other country.</comment>

<comment>What is the Telco angle for giving service away if they are not getting payment from Facebook?</comment>

<comment>The article actually talks about it. Did you look at the Reliance ad for FreeBasics given in the article? That demonstrates what the real gameplan is.It is basically a scheme to poach customers from other telcos. This is the reason why FreeBasics is only available with only one telco, not one of the dominant ones, in most countries. It is also not meant for the poor, despite all the PR. Because poor people cannot become paying customers. 80% of FreeBasics users are those who were already PAYING for Internet. Out of the remaining 20%, 40% went on to become PAID Internet users. So 12% is the upper bound of FreeBasics users who are poor."Free Internet for the poor" is clever but disingenuous marketing. So is, "Some Internet is better than No Internet", because those are not the only two choices. Here are some alternatives which are available to the poor in India:(1) Aircel offers free data for first 3 months at low speeds(2) Airtel offers cashbacks for off-peak data usage(3) Gigato allows apps to sponsor data costs in a manner which is compatible with network neutrality(4) Google has been installing free wi-fi at many places. They will also be launching Project Loon, which too respects Net Neutrality and doesn't give preference to Google devices,browser or websites.(5) Mozilla has been running a scheme where free data is given along with some advertising.(6) Facebook is still allowed to offer free Internet in India as long as they don't discriminate among websites that the poor want to access(7) And finally, the most duh option, out there: Telcos can offer free data with limits and recover costs by charging more to the heavy data users, like a normal capitalistic market.Differential pricing like Airtel Zero or FreeBasics are worst available options for expanding access in India. Facebook wants us to believe that if not for them, India will be leaving a billion users out of Internet, which is not true at all. India brought 100 million users online in 2015 alone. Without compromising net neutrality.</comment>

<comment>So, it looks like it is just the co-marketing opportunity that Facebook is offering.  Rather than paying Reliance directly to subsidize the service, they are using the power of their brand and possibly paying for the commercials to help Reliance gain customers who will then upgrade to paying service.  It is a loss leader, pretty much like Aircel offering 3 months of low speed for free, except they are offering a fraction of the Internet as the crippled version.  Personally, I don't have a problem with that.</comment>

<comment>They pay the carrier.</comment>

<comment>I operate on a preference of freedom.Facebook should be free to offer its service to the market.Individuals should be free to choose whether or not to use the service.Competitors should be free to set up their own competing service.As long as all three planks are intact, the market can determine whether the product offered is worthwhile or not.</comment>

<comment>Except that digital advertisers like FB do things like track everyone across the web, regardless if you have an account with them. There is no choice or freedom in the matter. Your number two is not intact. FB uses the money it makes off of doing things like this to try to push its colonialism on the world as the article points out.</comment>

<comment>Only if you let it. Use an open source browser like Mozilla Firefox and add-ons like Disconnect or Ghostery and FB won't track a thing. You absolutely have a choice in the matter.</comment>

<comment>And for the 99% who don't know how tracking works?</comment>

<comment>Ha ha ha.Since when do they count?//sarcasm(Alerts are necessary, in a world were Andreessen talks like he does, and means it.) </comment>

<comment>One question -- how do you think FB made its money? By your logic, plus ordinary, uncontroversial Thomas Smith economics, FB should be a modest enterprise. So, what is it that's happening, and how?Don't tell me it's just IPOs, etc. Then it's either mass delusion or a financial scam. It is neither.</comment>

<comment>FB benefits from a networking effect - the more people that sign up the more connections other people have to the site, and membership snowballs.FB's primary revenue generator is selling advertising. It made quite a bit of money from its cut of things like Farmville, but that type of game has been in decline for a few years now.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  No kidding.And when has advertising ever made this kind of money, this fast?  Of course I mean in real dollars, and as a proportion of GDP.Tell me how an advertising platform that provides all of these "valuable free services" suddenly has assets greater than the net worth of billions of people all put together, not to mention lots of countries.When we have this figured out, we may have some idea of what it is not utterly irrational to think about limiting what it can do in various countries.Various search engines and social media have already broken EU privacy laws, which are hardly unreasonably restrictive, and EU certainly does intend to look out for the best interests of the citizens its countries, for as least as long as we don't all have one-man one-vote on the boards of limited liability corporations!</comment>

<comment>I hear the argument but the consumer has always beaten the system by his pragmatic savyness. FB will inspire and spawn other businesses in my opinion.</comment>

<comment>This works in free markets. Telecom is NOT a free market. It is a licensed oligopoly.</comment>

<comment>o word it's good to know that your sheer pragmatic savvyness pulled all the lead out of your gas, the salmonella out of your food, and the radiation out of your morning coffee.</comment>

<comment>So let me ask - how would a small tech startup ( like Netflix in 2004 or so) that needs easy access to ALl users who pay the SAME price to get on the net even survive? What if ATT charged you more for a small company but  gave internet for free to amazon prime - is that a good thing for our economy allowing a internet provider to choose winners and losers? That's why we need net neutrality.</comment>

<comment>Great. Except that there is no free market in telecom. It's a licensed industry, Airtel-Vodafone-Idea is a cartel and there are ZERO choices if a consumers wants a telco which supports net neutrality.India has already experimented with unregulated free market in mobile VAS. That disaster is why many people want fair playing ground.Read this as an example of what happened in mobile VAS: http://rashmiranjanpadhy.com/2...</comment>

<comment>If you are so big on freedom, even in telecom which is a licensed industry, do you also oppose Net Neutrality rules in your country?The whole point is that competitors are not free to set up their own competing telcos without following rules mandated by the government. Make spectrum a private property and then do as you please.</comment>

<comment>"rules mandated by the government." Exactly, but continue the story- Rules in large part, designed to protect their elitist buddies, patrons, benefactors, and often times, politicians will get kickbacks as well, to ensure those rules stay in place.</comment>

<comment>Depends where you live. Probably more of a problem in two-party republics with odd electoral college systems. In multi-party systems where coalitions are the norm and there is a history of slightly more social responsibility, plus the occasional referendum, less so.</comment>

<comment>I am from India and I am really torn about this. On some level, I understand the premise of the argument that India is making. It is when I go beyond the surface in thinking on the subject that I see how wrong it is. 'Anti-colonialism' is definitely the wrong word on the subject and is turning the debate elsewhere.India has had strong protectionist laws that have hurt it on a global level. It was only when these were made free in the 90's that India experienced a tremendous boom in economic growth. True, some of that growth is- too fast, unwanted, and messy but the benefits far outweigh those criticisms. I would go even further to make an argument to India based on its history before colonialism. The reason India was such a big presence on the global market (it necessiated finding a trade route when the turks captured constantinople) was not just that it was a source of things but because the kings/people/philosophy was extremely open- economic, social, religious, moral, and you name it. I am not saying things were perfect but there was always room for a new comer and corrections.It is in light of this and our very interlinked world that I think this was a very wrong decision.</comment>

<comment>I'm glad to hear that.  As much as politicians and voters rail about the losers of globalization, a more interlinked world does have vast benefits for all, be it the ability to eat cherries from Chile in the middle of winter, here in Montana, or share discourse with someone from India on a message board.</comment>

<comment>Agree wholeheartedly! What a fun world, if you choose to look at it that way!</comment>

<comment>The debate and the regulation are not about keeping Facebook/FreeBasics out of India. I understand if you got that impression if you only read coverage on international media.The debate was about: whether telcos should be allowed to charge different prices for different websites. The movement started as a protest against Airtel (an Indian company), Flipkart (an Indian company). On the other hand, Mozilla (a western company), Google have made proposals that encourage fair-play and they have been lauded. Even with the new regulations, Facebook and Reliance are still ALLOWED to offer free Internet to Indians.You're looking for anti-colonialism where there isn't any.</comment>

<comment>Saying that being able to get cherries from Chile in Montana is a "vast benefit for all" is incredibly shortsighted and in the big picture, quite simply wrong. It shows how very shallow is your understanding of globalization and it's impacts.</comment>

<comment>What about people who don't need cherries from Chile in the winter and don't want other cultures intruding into their lives? Do they have the freedom to choose this lifestyle?</comment>

<comment>Exactly, and just think about why those "protectionist laws" are in place. (Not just in India, many other countries as well)  Usually, to make sure the 1% wealthy elites who run the country, keep the cash flowing in their direction.So ok, is Facebook evil? Colonialist? Planning on literally taking over India with boots on the ground, to create a "Second Raj?" Yes to all of that. But don't forget in many countries like India, with huge class differences and legions of poor masses, there is also an evil elite, .00001% type billionaires, stealing from the country, stealing from the people, stealing and controlling all the wealth of the country, etc...</comment>

<comment>If your argument were true, what has NAFTA done to make wealth distribution more fair?</comment>

<comment>I'm an economist specializing in cross border trade and int'l tax matters. While you're right about tying this issue to India's protectionist laws, you're mistaken to believe that India was "made free" of these laws in the 1990's.  India is still quite a protectionist country, but it uses different mechanisms to impede foreign companies from selling products and services within certain industries.  Sure, India is open to foreign trade when it means foreign companies setting up pharma or IT manufacturing or call centers in the country, but not when it comes to allowing foreign goods/services to be sold freely there.I'm not saying that India should or shouldn't have wide-open free trade.  There are some decently strong arguments for any country to protect certain industries for specific reasons, but India's reasons are less about protecting the net quantity of jobs (freer trade would definitely create more jobs in India) and more about protecting the interests of an entrenched elite.  The reality is that this elite very often claim that they're taking a position in the name of anti-colonialism when in reality it is about protecting their own asse(t)s.</comment>

<comment>--"The reality is that this elite very often claim that they're taking a position in the name of anti-colonialism when in reality it is about protecting their own asse(t)s."So the 1 million Indians who wrote to TRAI denouncing this deal were the elites protecting their own interests ??!!!</comment>

<comment>India's protectionism does not hurt India in the long run. Don't be fooled by westerners into their total free market nonsense until your own economy is well developed</comment>

<comment>Recently, The Atlantic is becoming more frustrating.   I guess it was too much to expect them to hold out against the clickbait headlines and the creep towards tabloidism.There's no reason to pick on Wikipedia, unless one wants to go on a spurious rant about the hegemony of English (as software development is almost done totally in English, and a wiki requires some software development), the left-to-right order of writing and reading, and that any wiki-like entity will want to hyperlink to the rest of the internet which will all be dominated by mostly American culture.Perhaps it's the fad in some circles to write an anti-Facebook article, a sort of right-of-passage into some clique.   I don't like Facebook, but it's not the source of what is bad in the world.</comment>

<comment>The Wikipedia comment was a cheap shot.  There aren't many aeronautical engineers in Africa - you'll find more in Southern California than on the entire continent of Africa.  Yes, 14% of the population lives in Africa, but you don't find 14% of the world's college graduates in Africa.  The disparity grows even larger for advanced degrees, particularly for those outside of medicine.</comment>

<comment>Plus, the article complains about Westerners White Man Burden-ing in and trying to solve all of the world's problems but then complains that Westerners aren't writing enough about Africa.</comment>

<comment>Especially since the aeronautical engineers in Africa that I personally know happily contribute to the .org Wikipedia in English.I know, I live there.This hand-wringing typically boils down to SJWs bleating about ethnomusicology and folk stories. Hardly worth recording.</comment>

<comment>I also found it a bit odd to attack wikipedia. No mention of Google either.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Someone needs to write an article about how click-baiting with stupid headlines is the new imperialism.More seriously, we continue to try and squeeze modern problems and realities into constructs that were created to explain a very different set of dynamics.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, if someone is unable or unwilling to produce a Wikipedia article from, say, Aleppo, Syria, or Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, how is that the fault of Wikipedia?</comment>

<comment>yep yep yep, those are your options, have twice as much to say about Emperor Palpatine as Hammurabi and half again as much content about the Flying Spaghetti Monster as Ashura or shut down entirely, because if mean people are gonna criticise you for taking an encyclopedia ostensibly about everything, for everyone and making it actually about anime what is even the point</comment>

<comment>If the argument that Facebook is being colonialist is supported by someone that, with a straight face, likens Super Mario Bros. to representing colonialism, then I know how seriously to take the argument.</comment>

<comment>Only Zuckerberg can make me nostalgic for more stories about Martin Shkreli.</comment>

<comment>Do you guys have a FB account?</comment>

<comment>Right, because if you use something, you can't criticize it. </comment>

<comment>No - did you really need to ask, given my last post?</comment>

<comment>Nunca!</comment>

<comment>Nope, so I guess I'm not a "dumb phuck" either, at least according to FB's Dear Leader.</comment>

<comment>Let's be honest about what's actually going on here. If you know anything about how things are in India and how corrupt their officials are (btw, this is based on what a bunch of my Indian coworkers who grew up in India told me).FB/Zuckerberg didn't bribe and pay off the right government officials or didn't pay them enough.</comment>

<comment>The regulation is to prohibit Indian telcos from offering differential pricing (aka, zero rating). Facebook is NOT the center of this debate. It started with Airtel Zero, who got a severe backlash from the people, and the government ended up making clear, non-discretionary rules.Facebook is still allowed to offer free Internet in India, as long as they preserve network neutrality. So is Google (who will be launching Project Loon soon). Facebook has been installing cheap wi-fi in villages which is perfectly fine under these rules and will continue.</comment>

<comment>This article is a joke I hope.</comment>

<comment>I often get that feeling here. Definitely with everything Ta-nehisi Coates writes (but they always disable comments for him so no one can criticize him).</comment>

<comment>Nope.</comment>

<comment>Wiki made me the genius I am today. Knock it off !</comment>

<comment>So Facebook must be paying the phone internet provider for the data used under this plan? </comment>

<comment>No, they don't. Read item #8 here by Facebook themselves: https://www.internet.org/press...Be careful. Facebook makes a lot of fallacious, straw man and misleading arguments on that page. They have been debunked by the activists. But on the financial arrangement part, I thought it was better to refer to the authoritative source. Would like to keep this campaign as honest and sincere as we have so far. :-)</comment>

<comment>Thanks.  I saw your post elsewhere here on this. It was very informative.  I suspected that they weren't paying for all that bandwidth </comment>

<comment>Bahri misunderstands something basic about colonialism.  It isn't practiced by cynics who disguise their profit motive.  It's practiced by idealists who truly believe that they are making things better. Generally, profits aren't hidden because they are proof that colonialism is working.  But this story isn't really about colonialism except in the bogus way in which everything is colonialism now (and is only appropriation seen from a different angle).</comment>

<comment>So expanding western liberalism has its opponents on the left as well as on the right, now. So what?</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a true colonialist!</comment>

<comment>What is the alternative to western liberalism? Chinese or Russian authoritarianism? Middle Eastern theocracy? Isolationism? Strident nationalism?</comment>

<comment>What Facebook did wrong here was attempt to make this sound philanthropic. This is why "capitalism for social good" is a farce. Creating a great business that starts by luring people in with free services, thus motivating them to sign up for the whole enchilada is a time-tested strategy that is used every day, in every industry. Nothing unethical or "colonialist" about it. Facebook should do away with the self-righteous dishonesty and call a spade a spade: they are trying to expand their business by giving people something they want. Good for them.On the other hand, "colonialism" is just another made up pejorative trotted out by the pushers of victimhood and grievance to defend their politically correct agendas. It's evidently not colonialist when Indian companies open sweat shops that undercut wages in the west or when they flood the world with cheap goods that poison the environment.Everyone is just trying to do what they gotta do.</comment>

<comment>Colonialism is just another made up pejorative? You actually just said that?</comment>

<comment>Well, calling out Zuckerberg for being a greedy, under-handed, Colonialist, is cool and all. Certainly true.  But while we are throwing stones, let's also admit the elites, corporations of the elites, and the politicians of countries like Brazil, India, Philippines, are robbing the people blind. Of course there are "protectionist rules!" How else to ensure the rich keep getting richer?</comment>

<comment>lol who told you third world sweatshops weren't colonialist</comment>

<comment>I speak for all of us when I say that reparations are a stupid idea and that only racist morons would support such a racist scam.Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Haw haw and a hee hee haw haw! Suckerberg. He rich anyway, but shoot man, he just want it all. Hey Suckerberg: you rich now by being a punk and the whole world hates you, but don't blame Unkle Jack for that!</comment>

<comment>Colonizing is the Midas touch.  Your welcome to all who the West has enriched beyond belief.</comment>

<comment>Accusing Facebok of Imperialism is so dumb that it would take a "Professor" to believe that.Yes, Ms Deepika Bahri, what you say makes no sense. The Raj was an Imperial enterprise that could enforce it's decisions with gunboats.Modern day companies don't even have a fraction of this kind of power.The fact that a company CO is forced to apologize should tell you that.I bet that Deepika Bahri, has more power at her University than Facebook has in India.Come to think of it Deepika Bahri  practices Imperialism herself. An Indian who lords it over an American institution.The Atlantic plays Quizzling to Ms. Bahri's Imperial ambitions.</comment>

<comment>Modern global corporations do indeed have more power than during colonialism. They benefit from not being burdened with the overhead of actually having to govern or employ a standing army!</comment>

<comment>I'm trying but failing to think of a single military event in the British takeover of India - that small portion it actually ran directly as opposed to the majority which was run by indigenous rulers in treaty relations with the British - that relied upon naval power such as "gunboats".  Yes, in China where you had big navigable rivers and no other form of force projection but India was much more about armies allying with one local ruler against the next one, defeating that one, absorbing the locals into your army and giving them modern arms and tactics and repeat until you find you are running the sub continent (that and subordinate who despite being explicitly ordered not to take over territory go ahead and do so anyway).</comment>

<comment>YOU'RE LATE to this outrage meme.C'mon your whole job is to regurgitate this nonsense immediately.So, get on it!</comment>

<comment>This article is trying to link in concepts all over the place but Zuckerberg's real motive in India is fairly obvious and his entire new philanthropist persona is a joke.</comment>

<comment>Yea, there was quite a bit of debunking of him 'donating' all his money to a foundation...basically a giant tax avoidance scheme.</comment>

<comment>Censorship is the new oppression of colonialism and that makes Facebook and Twitter two very repressive empires.</comment>

<comment>Facebook and Google could have stuck with the principle of supporting democratic free exchange of information. Instead, they are starting to align themselves with corrupt or autocratic governments. Eventually, I expect them to find themselves defending against charges of being complicit in genocide or war crimes.</comment>

<comment>Internet is like Trojan horse by itself where those that have produced it in western world try to use to control the populations at home and abroad and be the masters. Obviously the competition to their empire are also also working hard to use it to hack the apposing turf as well but don't  have as many services that are used internationally.Internet services that require login basically can be easily controlled by the western companies which seek to apply western standards and dogma on their users elsewhere and they would like make these services to get integrated in other countries and then use it hack the conversations and idea that other cultures may have.For example a copy of Twitter was installed in Cuba and it was used western intelligence sources to hack political conversation in Cuba.Imagine an NSA that directly linked with services used in other countries targeting the populations that do not support their agenda.The evidence shows that non western countries would be better off to at least create their own internet services if they desire to not have it hacked from the other side of the world.</comment>

<comment>Oh, so that's why twitter doesn't make any money, too busy overthrowing governments. :D</comment>

<comment>Unless they charge for the service or do advertising, they have nothing else to capitalize on.    They will eventually  find a way to extract cash from it...   They all want part of your paycheck..</comment>

<comment>One example of free data that Facebook is providing is the Philippines.  People there who cannot afford anything else use it extensively.  Towns that don't even have full time doctors do have access to some basic internet service.  For people this poor it means a lot.</comment>

<comment>I think Zuckerberg is more punchable than Shkreli.</comment>

<comment>At least Shkreli doesn't pretend to be a good guy </comment>

<comment>In this case,  the most overtly offensive character is his executive Marc Andreessen..  he was the creator of netscape browser.  He is worth 600 million dollars and so he believes he belongs to the rank of white supremacist oligarchy to rule the world as his privilege or you may call white privilege.</comment>

<comment>When a man is hit with an arrow and it is lodged in his body, extracting the arrow can be much more painful and complicated than being hit by it. So it hurts when it hits and it hurts even more when it is taken out. Same with colonialism. But what are you going to do if you are hit by an arrow? Leave it in your body?</comment>

<comment>British raj was very brutal.    In response to Bangal famine in India under the British rule..Churchill said"""If food is so scarce, why hasn’t Gandhi died yet?"Winston Churchill's response to an urgent request to release food stocks for India.[37]""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...About 3 million people died of starvationBritish role in famine""British imperialism had long justified itself with the pretense that it was conducted for the benefit of the governed. Churchill's conduct in the summer and fall of 1943 gave the lie to this myth. "I hate Indians," he told the Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery. "They are a beastly people with a beastly religion." The famine was their own fault, he declared at a war-cabinet meeting, for "breeding like rabbits.""""As Mukerjee's accounts demonstrate, some of India's grain was also exported to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to meet needs there, even though the island wasn't experiencing the same hardship; Australian wheat sailed past Indian cities (where the bodies of those who had died of starvation littered the streets) to depots in the Mediterranean and the Balkans; and offers of American and Canadian food aid were turned down. India was not permitted to use its own sterling reserves, or indeed its own ships, to import food. ""http://content.time.com/time/m...</comment>

<comment>There are no heroes in this world, only myths. Churchill was and is considered a demi-god by Westerners, but as you say, there is a flip-side.</comment>

<comment>The British Demi God was an outright racist thug.</comment>

<comment>No argument from me there. Look at French "heroes" also during WWII. They were "heroes" fighting for France while at the very same time they were keeping their colonies in misery and they massacred 45000 Algerian civilians in one day on May 8th 1945, and 1,5 millions in seven years from 1954 to 1962.</comment>

<comment>Yup, so called democracy and bill of rights at home, colonialism and slavery abroad.   France's colonial crimes in Vietnam were massive.</comment>

<comment>Here is another immense myth: Abraham Lincoln. He is considered an immensely wise and just man nowadays and in his time. When Frederick Douglas went to see him he received him in a dignified enough manner, listened politely to what he had to say and just as politely turned down his requests. After Douglass left, Lincoln said to his cabinet members who were present : "We gave these blacks a little bit of freedom and now they are going to start thinking they are as good as us ! "</comment>

<comment>I don't believe that is an accurate quote. What is your reference..   The southern folks hack a lot of stuff to taint him...   It is unlikely for him  to have been a white supremacist and anti-slavery..There is tons of quotes by Lincoln about equality that are well documented and he went to war for it:"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half-slave and half-free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved - I do not expect the house to fall - but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other." Lincoln's 'House-Divided' Speech in Springfield, Illinois, June 16, 1858."Whenever I hear any one arguing for slavery I feel a strong impulse to see it tried on him personally." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume VIII, "Speech to One Hundred Fortieth Indiana Regiment" (March 17, 1865), p. 361."What I do say is, that no man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent. I say this is the leading principle - the sheet anchor of American republicanism." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume II, "Speech at Peoria, Illinois" (October 16, 1854), p. 266."We think slavery a great moral wrong, and while we do not claim the right to touch it where it exists, we wish to treat it as a wrong in the territories, where our votes will reach it." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume IV, "Speech at New Haven, Connecticut" (March 6, 1860), p. 16."In 1841 you and I had together a tedious low-water trip, on a Steam Boat from Louisville to St. Louis. You may remember, as I well do, that from Louisville to the mouth of the Ohio there were, on board, ten or a dozen slaves, shackled together with irons. That sight was a continual torment to me; and I see something like it every time I touch the Ohio, or any other slave-border." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume II, "Letter to Joshua F. Speed" (August 24, 1855), p. 320."I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume VII, "Letter to Albert G. Hodges" (April 4, 1864), p. 281."I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so." Lincoln's First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861."In the first place, I insist that our fathers did not make this nation half slave and half free, or part slave and part free. I insist that they found the institution of slavery existing here. They did not make it so, but they left it so because they knew of no way to get rid of it at that time." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, "Lincoln-Douglas Debate at Quincy" (October 13, 1858), p. 276."I think slavery is wrong, morally, and politically.

Basler, Volume III, "Speech at Cincinnati, Ohio" (September 17, 1859), p. 440."In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free - honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just - a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless." Lincoln's Second Annual Message to Congress, December 1, 1862."I do not wish to be misunderstood upon this subject of slavery in this country. I suppose it may long exist, and perhaps the best way for it to come to an end peaceably is for it to exist for a length of time. But I say that the spread and strengthening and perpetuation of it is an entirely different proposition. There we should in every way resist it as a wrong, treating it as a wrong, with the fixed idea that it must and will come to an end." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, "Speech at Chicago, Illinois" (March 1, 1859), p. 370."Now, I confess myself as belonging to that class in the country who contemplate slavery as a moral, social and political evil, having due regard for its actual existence amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations which have been thrown about it; but, nevertheless, desire a policy that looks to the prevention of it as a wrong, and looks hopefully to the time when as a wrong it may come to an end." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, "Lincoln-Douglas Debate at Galesburg" (October 7, 1858), p. 226."I think that one of the causes of these repeated failures is that our best and greatest men have greatly underestimated the size of this question (slavery). They have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores---plasters too small to cover the wound. That is one reason that all settlements have proved so temporary---so evanescent." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P.

Stephens" (December 22, 1860), p. 160."I did say, at Chicago, in my speech there, that I do wish to see the spread of slavery arrested and to see it placed where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume II, "Speech at Springfield, Illinois" (July 17, 1858), p. 514."Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature - opposition to it, is his love of justice. These principles are an eternal antagonism; and when brought into collision so fiercely, as slavery extension brings them, shocks, and throes, and convulsions must ceaselessly follow." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume II, "Speech at Peoria, Illinois" (October 16, 1854), p. 271."As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume II, (August 1, 1858?), p. 532."My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause."

Basler, Volume IV, "Letter to Alexander H. Stephens" (December 22, 1860), p. 160."I believe the declara[tion] that 'all men are created equal' is the great fundamental principle upon which our free institutions rest; that negro slavery is violative of that principle; but that, by our frame of government, that principle has not been made one of legal obligation; that by our frame of government, the States which have slavery are to retain it, or surrender it at their own pleasure; and that all others---individuals, free-states and national government---are constitutionally bound to leave them alone about it. I believe our government was thus framed because of the necessity springing from the actual presence of slavery, when it was framed. That such necessity does not exist in the teritories[sic], where slavery is not present." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, "Letter to James N. Brown" (October 18, 1858), p. 327."I hold it to be a paramount duty of us in the free states, due to the Union of the states, and perhaps to liberty itself (paradox though it may seem) to let the slavery of the other states alone; while, on the other hand, I hold it to be equally clear, that we should never knowingly lend ourselves directly or indirectly, to prevent that slavery from dying a natural death---to find new places for it to live in, when it can no longer exist in the old." The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P.

<comment>He was definitely against slavery, I did not say the contrary, but that does not mean that he considered blacks his equals. I do agree with you about blacks making up all kinds of stuff to further their cause, but in that they are no different from anyone else either.  Just look up Lincoln's racist views and you will see many instances (debates, speeches) in which he said blacks should not be enslaved but they should not have the same rights as whites and that there is a superior race and an inferior race, and no need of course to specify which is which. </comment>

<comment>Southern white folks make a lot of these up.  It is tradition among white supremacists is to taint those that paved  the road against slavery and civil rights.Nevertheless Lincoln would have been product of his  own era for sure  but he changed the era for more equality  unlike Churchill who was batting against it.  I think for Lincoln, the immediate goal was the  abolition so he was not trying to sell anything more or he would not get elected.You could  can see  that from Lincoln Douglas debates  Douglas is blaming Lincoln for seeking equality while Lincoln is trying to sell abolition.   Anyways that is how I see it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>My own view is that there is not one single hero in history who is not heavily tainted in some respect or other. I simply do not believe in heroes or all-good politicians or world leaders. Not even Mandela whom I highly admire, but some of them were real monsters whereas others were just more or less flawed. Lincoln is a much better man than the average among them, but as you said, he was a product of his time and he could not escape certain racist views that were taken for granted by everyone around him his whole life.</comment>

<comment>Seeking absolute  purity in people  to accept their vision is  flawed   but having integrity is material.  There are people who can not be bought out.   I don't ask for more.</comment>

<comment>Of course, we need to include into the narrative that original French occupation of Algeria was in response to Barbery slave traders taking French and (even Welsh) peasants into slavery.No angels anywhere.</comment>

<comment>True, the Turks sold 600 000 Europeans as slaves and ransomed many times more from 1530 to 1830, and they were no angels, far from that, but the real reasons why the French invaded Algiers and then the rest of Algeria were 100% economic. For one thing, French wine production was hit very hard by a disease that attacked the vines, and Algeria had ideal grounds for growing grapes. The French had been licking their chops for decades about that but they were not yet capable of defeating the Turks of Algiers till 1830. They had actually tried many times. But wine was not the only reason. Capitalist productivity  had reached a point where it needed to expand outside of Europe or else face severe problems with workers' struggles for better conditions, and also lack of markets within Europe to sell the rapidly growing industrial production.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the new info - I was not aware of that.However let's not go down the One Real Reason™ rabbit hole.I propose: a complicated situation with multiple factions actors and even opportunists: some humanitarian, some commercial.</comment>

<comment>I believe that the reasons behind all world events all wars are economic. It may not always look like it on the surface, but when you dig a little deeper, you always find it to be so. For example, why did WWII happen? Because Hitler was a crazy man? Certainly not. It was all because of the Great Depression. The Depression had triggered a series of events and situations, too long to present here in a few lines, that ultimately resulted in WWII. If Hitler had tried to do what he did at another time or in another place, he would have been laughed at and put in a straightjacket. But when the Germans were starving and had no prospects for a better life any time soon, Hitler’s words sounded like hypnotizing music from irresistible Sirens. And Hitler was not the causeof WWII, only the spark that ignited it. Under different conditions, that buffoon could not have convinced one dozen lobotomized cretins to follow him.</comment>

<comment>Of course the apologist for racist colonizers everywhere has to chime in with another apology for colonization !!!!!</comment>

<comment>You are just all class, aren't you?</comment>

<comment>Yeah ... total lower class thug ... isnt that what 'class' translates to in your bigoted world lol !!</comment>

<comment>Trying but failing to think of anything else in 1943 that might have pre-occupied the British at the time.  Any ideas?  It is a fact that British administrators in India were expected to prevent famine and if it occurred to organise famine relief.  The Bengal famine had much to do with the fact that the Japanese were about to invade (which would have made it clear what "very brutal" actually looked like) so transport links were diverted to meet military requirements rather than move food around.  "True" famines where there's an absolute shortage of food are pretty rare, "distributional" famines where there's enough food but a lack of infrastructure to move it or money for the poor to buy it are a bit more common sadly.</comment>

<comment>You are trying to wash it obviously.  Churchill was complicit in causing the famine in India although millions of Indian soldier fought during WWII for the Brits.    Churchill had even vetoed against sending grain to India.  His attitude and disregard for human life other than white population is well documented.Churchill was following the path of  those before him that ran East India company and multiple famines that they induced in India because of their greed.   These are also well documented even by the British themselves.This is what the East India corporations was  about, looting, greed and famine... They did not give a damn.."" Yet, like more recent mega-corporations, the EIC proved at once hugely powerful and oddly vulnerable to economic uncertainty. Only seven years after the granting of the Diwani, when the company’s share price had doubled overnight after it acquired the wealth of the treasury of Bengal, the East India bubble burst after plunder and famine in Bengal led to massive shortfalls in expected land revenues. The EIC was left with debts of £1.5m and a bill of £1m unpaid tax owed to the Crown. When knowledge of this became public, 30 banks collapsed like dominoes across Europe, bringing trade to a standstill.""http://www.theguardian.com/wor...</comment>

<comment>So Churchill actually wanted the famine even though, as you correctly point out, there were millions of Indians fighting for the allies (the largest volunteer army in human history)?  It's pretty clear you regard him as evil but was he really that stupid?  It seems unlikely and a far more persuasive argument is that in choosing between famine relief and stopping the Japanese invading India he went for the latter.  I suspect he would have been quite as prepared to opt for starving the white population of the UK if he saw it as necessary for military transport to take priority.</comment>

<comment>His goal was saving England and not India so the Indian troops were essential for his goal were fed on their jobs   but famine in India was ignored and he did not give a damn.  That is what white supremacy is about just like feeding the slaves.     He is on the record with his veto  against shipping grain and derogatory comments about Indians and ignoring people who asked  him to help.</comment>

<comment>--" It's pretty clear you regard him as evil but was he really that stupid?"It was apathy and a complete disregard for Indian lives since Churchill like all his imperialist peers and countrymen were racist pigs who didnt value the lives of Indians in the least bit.</comment>

<comment>--""True" famines where there's an absolute shortage of food are pretty rare, "There were hardly any famines in India before the Brits.  It was far and few between.  The Brits were responsible for at least 8 major 'True' famines and were complicit in its occurrences.  Why are you trying to whitewash this ?!!!</comment>

<comment>How do you know there were "hardly any famines in India before the Brits"?  If so this would make it unique in world history.  The British were sufficiently aware of famine and saw it as part of the their mission in India to prevent or at least alleviate the worst impacts of famines that they developed the "famine codes" which were the world's first way of measuring them and continued in use by the Indian Government until the 1970s.  Prior to their development in the 1880s we don't really have direct way of knowing exactly what did or did not occur vis a vis famine although we know from the records of Indian Civil Service administrators that if famines did occur they were expected to do something about it - which may or may not have been sufficient.  Population stats in India are a bit rubbery prior to the first census but demographers estimate about 100 million in the 1600s when the British were the most minor of bit players compared to the Portugese and the 1881 census recorded 255 million so British rule saw an at least doubling of the population which is not exactly consistent with your picture of constant famine.  I don't doubt that British rule caused some famines by for instance agricultural reform leading to landless peasants (although productivity also massively increased through irrigation works that still underpin food production in India) but your idea that it was an inevitable and deliberate result of British rule is not sustained by the historical record.</comment>

<comment>There has not been any 'famines' recorded in Indian history before the brtish. Indian population used to move across the country whenever there are drought conditions. One of the draconian moves of the east India company was to impose the salt tax and creating a big hedge across the middle of the country thus blocking the mobility of the people during these conditions."Of the great famines that came in India due to the British rule, in the Second Great Famine during 1876-78, around six and a half crore people starved to death. This was around one fourth of the then Indian population. Of that around 30 lakh people died in the then united Bengal. This was the greated famine in world history."https://thesabarmati.wordpress...</comment>

<comment>--"The British were sufficiently aware of famine and saw it as part of the their mission in India to prevent or at least alleviate the worst impacts of famines"This kind of revisionism is rampant in all of 'Western' history !http://yourstory.com/2014/08/b...https://jambudveep.wordpress.c...I could go on but do your own research ... but arguing with revisionists is a useless endeavor ...</comment>

<comment>Bengal famine is not the biggest gift of British to India. 100-150 years before, they killed more than 8 million people in the name of salt tax and creating the biggest hedge inside India. Read Roy Moxham's book:http://www.amazon.com/Great-He...</comment>

All the while, the big World Wide Web, full of a variety of ideas (contrary to our beliefs or otherwise), is out there...</comment>

<comment>Pull up your pants and own up to what you said, don't change it, own it. Take responsibility for your actions. Hiding your original thoughts with validation (to me at least) makes you look two faced.</comment>

<comment>Facebook and Colonialism are one and the same. However; Facebook is just one of many Colonialists - just like the Windows operation system, it will always try to control access to the Internet and our lives. Unfortunately for us, that's what companies will always try to do. Satellite TV, Internet providers, cable, telephone service providers, etc., have exactly the same goal: dominate and control access for there sake of money. Control what the people see, do, etc. That's Colonialism. For the sake of power and money.</comment>

<comment>But, we have accepted this system because, if someone can point out something those in control are squelching access to, they can start their own business and provide that access.Your post is also overly cynical. Colonialism also had religious and moral motivation. Watch the caste system at work, wives burning on their husband's funeral pyres, and your stories will cause lots of financial and moral support for it.</comment>

<comment>I agree with the other motivations mentioned, but business like Facebook strive to achieve to large extent what colonialism tried: control for economic gain.As for starting your own business, that's almost impossible. many companies have tried to compete with Facebook and failed. See anything in sight to unseat Windows?</comment>

<comment>There's a Simpson's episode to support your view ... when Bill Gates shows up and crushes Homers start up. :))Don't you think, though, that people aren't sheep, and just want to be on the same software as others ... to make sharing easy, to avoid having to learn multiple interfaces, to be able to teach each other how to use the same service ... big companies give people manageable products. No?</comment>

<comment>True, but companies like Microsoft make it very difficult for people to switch. They make content work only on their software/hardware and shun open source technology.</comment>

<comment>But isn't it for our own good, to an extent? People say they want options, but then the small company they choose fails and they're stuck with a product and no support. ??</comment>

<comment>True again, but that is/was colonialisms claim. Without the drive of colonial powers we wouldn't have a developed South Africa or United States and many others. What would India and Pakistan have looked like if it was't for the British?</comment>

<comment>Wow !  Such stupendous stupidity deserves a special medal all on its own.  Here is a snippet you might consider before accepting that well-deserved award:"By 1700, India was again the world's largest economy, accounting for 24.4% of global GDP, more than that of the whole of Europe combined, and almost ten times the size of Britain's economy, whose growth had already began benefiting from 'trade' with India, China and Africa. By the time of independence, a socially, economically and industrially devastated India's share of global GDP had plummeted to a mere 4.2%."</comment>

<comment>Thank goodness the Indian Govt (TRAI or whichever organization was responsible to make this sensible decision) stopped Facebook. Indian Media is already the most corrupt media of the world (there is a term known as Presstitutes) and this Facebook and Reliance deal would have made desis slaves to digital media (dumb fucks is early facebook terminology). Some good sense prevailed.Barriers to entry is not that great when it comes to replicate the Business model of Facebook. 5 Yrs from now, Facebook could face significant revenue pressure (online ads etc).</comment>

<comment>Indian Media is already the most corrupt mediaWhat do you mean by "corrupt"? If you mean that people with the right contacts can get things they don't like banned, that is presumably what just happened when FreeBasics was banned.And you're celebrating that.</comment>

<comment>Just watched the movie 'Water' ... was hilarious. The movie managed to criticize colonialism while at the same time focusing on the problematic practice of child marriage and the sequestering of child widows ... per the Manu Samhita. I guess the writers imagined India would have evolved away from that practice even without colonialism. : /</comment>

<comment>The reform movements - all of them were started by Indians themselves and were accepted by the people of the country. Colonialism had no role to play except may be codifying the laws. Besides, we had the Indus valley civilization 5000 years old which had Harappa and Mohenjadaro - cities with extensive urban planning. So, we also have the ability to reform ourselves of any of the social evils that crept in. This, coming from the US which 'debated' to give voting rights for women untill the last century  - just stop it. We are not the white man's burden..</comment>

<comment>For the avoidance then of all doubt, are you advocating that no country or organisation should have got involved in say Rwanda?Because, in your ideology, the Rwandans were doing a great job "reforming themselves from any social evils that crept in". If the Africa connotation it too close for comfort, substitute Rwanda for Bosnia.So, is it:1. only Indians have the innate (if dormant) ability to self regulate.2. this is a deep universal principle, no more intervention anywhere, ever3. you just don't like/envy the US/people who lok like them - and this is a cheap opportunity to have a go?It is difficult to say which from your confused thinking.</comment>

<comment>Getting involved through an universal organization like UN is one thing (discounting the failures and hypocrisies of UN here). Colonizing and exploiting them is completely another. And to say some of the social evils in those countries were solved due to the colonizers is disingenuous and plain lie.Like the british used to say that because of them railways came to India when the truth is that they laid railways to transport the raw materials out of the country and were laid with 3-4 times the cost that it took to lay them in Britain. A whole lot of British investors became extremely rich just by investing in Indian railways. Add to this the projects like Buckingham canal which created a waterway eventhough there is a sea route already available, you know the truth.It is:"2. this is a deep universal principle, no more intervention anywhere, ever"except through agencies like UN with transparent agenda and without creating dictatorships that suit the west.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, but not that you have forever removed the "rich countries should do more to help option"So, for example, no unilateral assistance to West Africa on Ebola.</comment>

<comment>Its not colonialism--its basic monopolistic capitalism(i.e not really capitalism), the type practiced by Amazon, Uber, and Facebook and others.It isn't so much about free enterprise then it is about eliminating competitive choices by nook or crook so you only have one provider.Its the true tendency of capitalism, which is why you always need government to intervene to create a true market.</comment>

<comment>The author does not know or want to see that IBM can structure unstructured data, create personal profiles on that.Therefore, IBM can completely annihilate Facebook and other social services from both directions:1. Being structured advertisements can search for people themselves, based on their profiles of structured unstructured data, with absolutely unprecedented precision. Thus,  IBM and other database companies can at once cease, cut off the only source of money flow to Facebook and all other social services.2. The presence of personal profiles (of structured unstructured data) allows IBM and other database companies to help people instantly find solemates interested in the same.Facebook and  and other social services are gone together with Internet.Indeed, the only difference between Google (and all other search on Internet engines) SQL technology and IBM, Oracle or SAP SQL is in the statistics (on data patterns) Google gets from Internet - so called 'popularity'. (Google accumulates data on what is used on Internet in connection with certain queries, and correlates that data with personal profiles' data patterns: Google does this spying, violating our privacy.)IBM, Oracle, SAP did not have any statistics on data until recently: it was assigned only manually (please study how, for instance, Oracle and IBM assigned 'weights' on data patterns not long ago).However, the situation changed: Oracle introduced Oracle ATG, began to calculate statistics on data patterns automatically, internally to data and said: 'Term weights represent an extremely powerful feature, and care should be taken when using them... terms in an index are automatically weighted based on their distribution in the indexed content.'"By treating data in its natural state rather than breaking it into formal structures, IBM Graph will enable users to uncover previously hidden patterns in large data sets," Derek Schoettle, general manager for IBM Analytics Platform Services, said.IBM: "Watson can understand unstructured data, which is 80 percent of data today: all of the information that is produced primarily by humans for other humans to consume," according to an explanatory video about IBM's Watson tech.SAP HANA: 'Text Analysis is the process of analyzing unstructured text, extracting relevant information and then transforming that information into structured information that can be leveraged in different ways...The indexer will make an entry in the index for each term or word found in a document, and possibly note its relative position within the document.'Finita la commedia - Zuckerberg and others are fired.</comment>

<comment>The British East India Company and the British Raj were not, as the article suggests, the same thing. The Company quite literally ruled India for a hundred years prior to the establishment of the Raj, despite being an explicitly extractive multinational. That's probably relevant context to this story.</comment>

<comment>Imperialism and colonialism involved taking over other countries by force and ruling over their people. Until Facebook starts raising armies and imposing and enforcing its own laws on people in India, you cannot seriously compare what it's doing to colonialism.</comment>

But it's not colonialist for Indian public to invade US job market via US IT's colonialist elite undemocratic access to manipulating the US visa policy.  So, does that mean Wipro and Tata are US colonialists because they execute it on US soil or does that mean it doesn't count because they're originating in India, a country determined to not take advantage of the population?This is so confusing.

<comment>Chinas share of global GDP fell during the industrial revolution as well. And Irans. And Thailands. And the Ottoman Empires.If it comes to that, Indias share of global GDP has fallen since independence too, as other countries have grown faster.If I concluded that indenpendence was a terrible thing for a country, my logic would be quite as strong as yours.Or to look at it from another angle: if independence as such is a good thing, it must be a good thing for every state in India. Clearly they should all declare independence!(You can make arguments about democracy if you like, but not by comparing India before and after 1700, because the Moghul Empire was no more democratic than its successor. You cannot have democracy until you have a mass media.)</comment>

<comment>The point is that for 1700+ years, India has had a fair share of the global GDP. Industrial revolution needed the colonies to sell the goods and this resulted in colonialism wherein the native economies and institutions were destroyed and restrictions put on the trade and commerce.For eg., there were more than 8 million people died due to the salt tax imposed by the british and the hedge they created to prevent salt transport. This is just one example."If it comes to that, Indias share of global GDP has fallen since independence too, as other countries have grown faster."When they left a country with illiteracy, one of the poorest economies along with the horrors of partition, of course the GDP will fall. What else do one expect ?"if independence as such is a good thing, it must be a good thing for every state in India. Clearly they should all declare independence!"Independence from the colonial power is different from asking independence from a democratic country.</comment>

<comment>When they left a country with illiteracy, one of the poorest economies along with the horrors of partition, of course the GDP will fall.It didn't fall. It merely failed to rise quickly. From which I conclude that independence did not, in itself, increase GDP.Which is to be expected, since independence did not cause a sudden increase in GDP per head in the United States, Spanish America, Brazil or post-colonial Africa either. Why should India be any different?People may argue in favour of independence on the grounds that it will make a country more democratic, they just should not be too sure it will make the country richer as well.</comment>

<comment>You miss the main point ... we are anti-colonialism because of its extremely oppressive policies and the rape, pillage and plunder that the colonizing forces (fckn brits) undertook in our country.  The rise and fall of GDP wasnt the biggest concern.  You wouldnt know it unless you had your nuts squished by jackbooted thugs.  As far as we were concerned Hitler and Churchill were same/same !</comment>

<comment>Im guessing you have that perfect formula for growth tucked away in a familiar orifice that you will eventually share with all colonized countries.  Your simplistic logic is worth less than a bucket of warm spit.</comment>

<comment>I have no such formula. But it looks like the people who assumed that decolonisation was "the perfect growth formula" were wrong.</comment>

<comment>No kidding.  Does it feel good to display your ignorance on a public forum or is it you just being you or whatever !!</comment>

<comment>Can someone explain the problem with Free Basics to me like I'm 5? I mean that. Because I don't see it.It seems to me like the main problem people have with Free Basics is that they feel there's an unfair exchange going on, that free access to Facebook isn't worth the data mining Facebook is able to do on all those users. But I disagree. If a company is offering a service then it stands to reason that they should be able to monetize that somehow. And Facebook is a powerful tool for communication and business in many people's hands. I know a lot of people in a lot of countries who are virtually unreachable without Facebook, and wouldn't earn half the money that they do without it. What's unfair about that? And if these users are already online anyway, how does that conflict with the open web?Reliance has found an angle to 'poach users from other Telcos'. What is wrong with that? Isn't that what business is all about? Finding ways to attract people to your service and away from your competitors? Does Free Basics violate Indian law? If it does, that should be the end of the issue, cut and dry. Although I still don't see how it's any different from any other deal designed to attract more users to sign up with your telco company.</comment>

<comment>"Facebook pays a lot of money for this "unfair advantage" "Facebook does not pay any money. It's the Indian Telcos who will bear the costs.. which is in turn funded by the tax payer as the spectrum is 'leased' to them.. Facebook doesnt spend a single Paisa here..</comment>

<comment>The first hit is always free.</comment>

<comment>so... no actual replies then.</comment>

<comment>I gave an actual response, abbreviated though it might be. Is it that you don't understand the reference? Or is there a specific question I could answer?</comment>

<comment>Since you are 5 yrs old ... i suggest you wait for another 20 yrs before you attempt to analyze this.</comment>

<comment>oh ok. sorry, thought this was a place for an actual constructive discussion. guess not</comment>

<comment>So... dumb article with terrible overbroad analogies aside, what did Indians gain from not allowing Free Basics in their country vs having it there?</comment>

<comment>We stopped an internet behemoth from becoming a monopoly of the web. Otherwise millions of people will thank getting to internet means using facebook and that's it. There are already proof that even in the US, only 90 domains are accessed on the web which clearly shows that the WWW is rather shrinking and not expanding.</comment>

<comment>In Brazil its already implemented free Whatsapp only connection. No data is counted using Whatsapp.</comment>

<comment>Colonial rule, East India Company, etc.A bit too much drama folks!.  Comparing Facebook to the East India Company is comparing oranges to fish!  This is the Internet people.  I fully agree it's breaking net neutrality!   Being hooked to Facebook Free it's not the same way being hooked to the East India Company. This was just another click-bait!</comment>

<comment>I am not a fan of social media, and despise the VC's who fund it, but it is amusing to read academics--whose universities charge outrageous tuition without competition, transparency or regulation--criticize Facebook for claiming to be free when it--HORRORS!--makes a profit in other ways,It is silly to call offering a free service which people have no obligation to use an evil on par with colonialism--in social media, that would be attacked as clickbait or trolling.</comment>

<comment>My sentiments exactly!  Academics like the one quoted in this article smugly blame all the world's ills on white expansionist capitalism all the while making lucrative careers for themselves within the very system they criticize. </comment>

<comment>So funny that this article is surounded by targeted adds. Is a great time to live in</comment>

<comment>Marc Andreessen is obviously a psychopath drunk on power to make such a horrendously moronic comment.However, when Deepika Bahri stated "justify the logic of partial dissemination as better than nothing" is a feature of Free Basics and colonialism, what on earth did she mean?  How does that relate to colonialism?A free if limited access to the internet is obviously better than no access.  If India didn't want Facebook to profit from this free service then the obvious solution wasn't to ban the entire service, that is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, cutting off your nose to spite your face, and other idioms for idiocy.Allow FreeBasics, but institute a nation wide filter on it to stop access to Facebook or Facebook owned websites.</comment>
