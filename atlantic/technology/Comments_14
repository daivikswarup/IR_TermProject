<comment>I loathe Facebook and I loathe Apple, but what I loathe most is I've been forced to defend them recently by the idiotic states of India and the US.  It's a universal truth that lawyers are smart talking morons who pretend to know it all.  Any free internet access, for anyone anywhere, is a positive step in the right direction.  It's a 'no brainer'.  Please America and India don't get so stupid that one day I have to defend Amazon or Microsoft.  I'm just not up to that.   If you hate technology, as most of you seem to, then just stop using it.  Go back to your TVs and your angry letters to print newspapers, leave the rest of us to evolve.</comment>

<comment>You are a self-important idiot. People in developing countries may be poor, but they desire and deserve the same access to the internet as anyone else on the planet. What Facebook is pushing is a second class internet, and worse, one severely constrained though a monopolized portal.</comment>

<comment>I'll admit your first point, but dispute your second.  What Facebook was proposing was free access to sites such as the BBC.  We don't have that in the UK or the US today, and our nations would be better places for it.</comment>

<comment>Do you even know BBC was kicked out of India in the 1970s for its anti-India and pro-Pakistan reporting? In 2008, when Mmmbai was under attack from Pak based terrorists, your precious BBC called them "gunmen". (BTW Those playful gunmen left 164 dead and 300 more injured.) Using BBC to justify free basics in India, is like telling a U.S. liberal, they will get "Free" access to Fox news</comment>

<comment>The BBC is far from unbiased.  You have to be approved by MI5 to work there, half their reporters are spies and another quarter are kiddy-diddlers.  It's not the beacon of the free world that it pretends to be, I know that.  It's still better than no internet access at all.</comment>

<comment>You know Fox News, while obviously awful, at least it does tell you when the latest gun massacre is happening.  It's better than nothing, if you know to tune out the talking heads.  Free Basics, or whatever Facebook called it, was better than that.  It included useful sources, maybe not the BBC, but local sources for free.  You have to go to a library to get the BBC for free in Britain.  And free limited internet access is a stepping stone to paid for unlimited access.    Mark ZuckerFatberg, I applaud you in this case.  You are a terrible fraud and self-pleasurer in every instance until now, but you've finally done some good - and this is all you get criticised for.  It's an injustice!</comment>

<comment>what are you talking about? god forbid people want a bit of integrity with their internet. just because something's 'free' (which is a joke itself) doesn't mean it's wonderful and should be used.</comment>

<comment>There's a saying in India, a drowning man will clutch at a snake.  Akin to our "A drwoning man will clutch at a straw" but more pointed.  Any free internet access is to be welcomed. Even it was just free access to the awful Facebook, that is still better than no internet access.  The fact that Zuckerfatberg also included free access to other sites such as the BBC, that has to be applauded.  How many US or UK citizens have free access to the BBC?  None, unless you count the small number of public library users.  Facebook also added several other sites that maybe of use/ certainly are of use to people in that coverage  "Here Is  a free pint of milk for your child""I'm  a vegan, I don't want your murderous milk""Okay, here is a free bottle of clean water""Stop pushing your poison down our necks. That water has a corporate label on it"</comment>

<comment>In India atleast, the BBC has always pushed a very definite (negative) agenda. So its inclusion in the FB package only showed that external players would continue to try and hijack the Indian polity to their benefit.  It is less than 70 years since the British were kicked out-so pardon us ignorant brownies for not rolling over and allowing a new version of the Raj to put down roots</comment>

<comment>You've got to stop mistaking Americans for Brits.  For all Mark Zuckerbergs faults, and there are many faults, nobody is accusing him of being an agent of the British empire.</comment>

<comment>As an aside, I think it's just awful that a state sock-puppet would hijack the name of a JD Salinger character.  It's just sick.  Do you even know the error in the title of your characters novel and where it came from?</comment>

<comment>well if you're going to insult me by calling me a sock puppet and imply i'm illiterate, i can only return the favor and insist that you suck my left one, bikini kill style.facebook is 'free' in that your data is sold to advertisers and you're tracked. free internet in early 2000s was free because giant ad displaying banners were scripted into software, but sure, tell me again how awesome free stuff is.</comment>

<comment>You'd have to explain to me what 'bikini kill style' means.  FREE STUFF is just awesome, especially when it is informative.  Please, please chose another username .  I love "Holden Caulfied.   There is nothing stopping you inventing a unique name for your far-right onslaught  Call yourself Hitler, nobody here would complain.    But 'Holden Caulfied'?  I think not  You are a Nazi.  You are a narcissis.t You are a fraud.</comment>

<comment>you're telling me to change my username and the far right nazi? is it because i'm mexican and a woman? holden is for white men only?you're on the internet: look up bikini kill yourself you lazy cow!now please stop responding to me.</comment>

<comment>"you suck my left one"So you are not a Mexican woman, as you just claimed?  No wondr yu've locked down your comment history.  A JD Salinger character you are not.</comment>

<comment>How about we start with the people in this country, you know, the USA, who barely make rent...the myriad homeless right here.</comment>

<comment>In the UK basic internet access is often offered for free but with a £17 per month line rental.  What is that £17 for and who does it go to and why doesn't it half every 18 months in line with Moore's Law?  I just stopped paying for my old ISP, the line is still there, I could connect through it if I wanted to.  It's a rip-off.  A state sanctioned way to keep the hoi-polloi away from the internet unless hey pay off a middle-man.</comment>

<comment>Hey Adrienne LaFrance, nice article. I agree with your idea. "The full man does not understand the wants of the hungry" .I would like to tell you that this idea is not new as it was proposed by Net Neutrality activists as an alternative when facebook proposed free and restricted internet in India. facebook somehow could not digest the fact that poor people are also human beings and also have equal right to choose what services they want to use and did not want someone to make decisions for them.Such a scenario of giving a choice would not really allow them to channel and monetize the data of the poor. Without adding new users facebook would face a saturation problem that twitter is facing right now and I believe that they are bent on solving it using 'restricted free data for the poor' strategy.</comment>
