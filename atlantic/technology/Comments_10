<comment>I recently read a book on my kindle after not using the thing in quite awhile. It seems a new(er) feature is they tell you how much longer it's going to take you to finish the book based on your pace. For my next book, I picked up a regular paperback and started in on that. I have to say I kind of miss seeing the little countdown! Since I have a monthly goal of books per month, it was kind of cool to have that reminder, "I better find 3 hours of reading time in the next week to get this book done!"</comment>

<comment>I've experienced this with Goodreads as well..if I'm able to quantify how much reading I've done throughout the year, I have more internal pressure to actually finish books.</comment>

<comment>How many people are inspired to exercise because they want to compete in, say, a running race or a triathlon?  This sort of fitness goal is quantifiable and measurable.  So is training for it.  And a lot of people enjoy doing this.I practice with a master's swim team and compete in various sorts of swimming events.  The sport is all about quantification: yardage, intervals, stroke counts, times, etc.  And this is one of the reasons why I like it.  I like to set specific, quantifiable goals (compete in an event of a certain length, drop my times by a certain amount, etc.) because they inspire me to hit the water.   There's no ambiguity: I either make the goal, or don't.But I also enjoy the practice of swimming: the shock of diving into a cold pool or lake, the feel of water on body, the sensation of pulling and gliding with each stroke, the thrill of navigating a medium that humans don't naturally belong in, and the well-being I experience afterwards.  Achieving a swimming goal is satisfying in itself, but it's also satisfying because it inspires me to do an activity that I enjoy for its own sake.</comment>

<comment>The fact is some very healthy physical activity is positively unenjoyable.  I grew up when high school kids had a mandatory hour of PE every day, and one of the great gifts of coaches like "Run 'Em" Dunham was the technique for bamboozling the brain by miscounting exercise.  We did out calisthenics to the count "1-2-3-ONE, 1-2-3-TWO" etc. which left my stupid brain with the impression I had done only ten pushups or situps or whatever when in fact my body had done forty.  This self-delusional approach to exercise has served me well into later life.</comment>

<comment>" In the same pattern as the colorers, those wearing the pedometers walked more than their peers without pedometers but enjoyed it less"Could it simply be a combination of two things (1) The more you do of something, the less you enjoy it and (2) Being watched makes you do more of something considered "good"</comment>

<comment>I read a couple of books on how to improve writing speed. Both used a method referred to a "sprints" (sitting down for a defined period of time to concentrate solely on writing and eliminating all distractions), and both pointed out that tracking your progress either by app or spreadsheet actually improved motivation.I found that advice to be correct. The more I measured my progress, the more motivated I was to write more and to write faster.My experience seems to be in contrast to this article.</comment>

<comment>You don't "measure" fitness activities to quantify your enjoyment of them. You measure things to set a bar for maintaining and improving them. That effort is called "work." Work is not fun. The word for that is "play." The reason people lose interest in their Fitbit is the same reason they generally stop using a century-old fitness device that almost everybody already owns: the bathroom scale - the device becomes a harpy reminding them of their lack of effort, motivation or result in "working" at their fitness.</comment>

<comment>I think that a critical piece of research that is missing from the conclusions of this article is the enjoyment in people that choose to buy Q-self technology to supplement an existing goal. The studies here, while valid, are set in a paradigm where people are being given quantification feedback for activities they did not have any intrinsic motivation to quantify. A harder, but more accurate study, would be to look at the how much people enjoy exercise/task quantification based on a pre-existing goal and/or an active choice to add the quantification in there lives. In my opinion, this paradigm more closely reflects the real world, where people buy Fitbits, etc., presumably with a purpose for quantifying their activity, instead of have someone come into their life and quantify their steps against their will.</comment>
