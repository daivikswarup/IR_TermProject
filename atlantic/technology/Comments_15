<comment>This, this this! Bandwidth is privilege. Always has been, always will be since the days of T1 lines.Webmasters used to be considerate of this and make "lite" versions of sites for folks on dial-up and some forms of DSL. We need to look at how our fixation on rich media environments marginalizes people.I don't have a data plan on my smartphone but I do share Wifi with my neighbors in the apartment next door, which reduces bandwidth but brings down costs for all of us. </comment>

<comment>No, the only constraints should be on Wall Street Profits not customer desires and requirements.</comment>

<comment>What makes you think i am talking about government regulation.it's more cultural than anything.i'm not a fan of constraints on wall street profits, lol </comment>

<comment>I want to make Goldman Sachs so small I could drown it in a bathtub.</comment>

<comment>haha</comment>

<comment>Then turn broadband into a utility and meter it. Problem solved.</comment>

<comment>No metering, flat rate, unlimited use pricing only.</comment>

<comment>I'm fine with metering..so long as I can see the meter. The real issue is when you have a plan and out side that plan the pricing is ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>The place to put the meter is on the sending side, because you can't really control what is sent to you.  Anyone can send whatever they want to your IP address, which is more or less what happens when you visit a www site.  However,  www sites do generally pay by capacity, so they watch their transmission rates carefully and make sure they don't run up a bigger bandwidth bill than their business can cover.   All we need to do is put a regulatory cap on residential access fees, say $20/ month.  Then let ISP's charge whatever they want for inbound data volume.  To some extent they do this already, and all the accounting is in place to push costs back through various aggregators into the bandwidth bill of the content originator.  Of course, Netflix would cry bloody murder, but no logical reason they should not be paying the bandwidth bill and recovering it from their customer, just like the parcel shipping business.Essentially, you have almost choice in who you get your access from, but near infinite choice in what sites you visit.  So, the dollars should flow through the pathway where you have choice.</comment>

<comment>This is a good clear explanation and thought. Thanks</comment>

<comment>IT is a luxury for those whom do not telecommute.</comment>

<comment>Interesting.</comment>

<comment>One of the luxuries of being 75 year old is that you get to witness the passage of lots of time, ha ha.  For me broadband has always been a part of my life.  First dialup at 64 KB, then DSL at 6 MB and now Cable at 50 MB.  But costs are becoming troublesome. Dial Up in the beginning was about $10/month.  Then DSL through local phone company came along at about $29/month.  Now Cable at costs $48/month.  While the speed has increased so has the cost but that leads me to this question.So is faster better?  Well it all depends doesn't it.  For someone 75 who uses the net for reading the news, a few emails and some youTube videos most likely it's not worth $48/mo.  Oh and don't forget that Netflix subscription for the grandkids.I certainly wished there were more choices.  I would be very happy with 10 MB's for what I use the net for but no such plan exists.  I understand gaming and for those individuals faster is always better.  But for me this lack of choice is where I believe broadband companies marketing plans are missing their target.  Does it really make sense to watch your customers leave the system just because you feel everyone should pay a minimum of $48/mo for a 50 MB system even if they never use that much bandwidth?  That to me doesn't make good business sense.I am seriously considering dumping broadband altogether - I can live without it. Now if my cable provider Suddenlink gave me the option to purchase a 25 MB connection for lets say $25/mo I might consider staying with them.  Or how about 10 MB for $10/month.  It is any wonder people are dropping off the net?Have a great day everyone.</comment>

<comment>To sum, old man yells at cloud</comment>

<comment>I would have summarized the posting this way.  Choice is a good thing. It's good for business and good consumers.And yes the cloud is an excellent place to store stuff.  I use both Windows OneDrive and Google Drive.  Great place to store photo's.</comment>

<comment>Choice, including choice of providers.  Many areas have only one broadband choice. And the broadband providers know that.</comment>

<comment>Most of the cost of providing the connection is fixed.  So, they'd probably have to charge $40 for the 10 MB connection that you want.</comment>

<comment>Well that would certainly be a good start Cody.  That would be an $8 reduction and would certainly be a good addition to the all or nothing that we have today :-)</comment>

<comment>But, there are also hugely profitable businesses who depend on using that connection to feed advertisements to consumers.  E.g., Google + Facebook are worth more than Comcast + ATT + Verizon combined.  They could and would pay plenty more to use that connection, and a business like Netflix can simply pass the cost through to subscribers the way any other shipping business works  This is where natural market forces were moving, as content provider bandwidth costs have fallen by a factor of 1000 over the path 15 years, while fanning that content out to homes remains expensive.  This is why the content industry invented the "Net Neutrality" bogey man.  Unfortunately, the public swallowed it hook line and sinker.</comment>

<comment>Very relieved to see a post this full of "$X/month" text not be Insurance Panda spam.</comment>

<comment>Refreshing huh :-)</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't mind having your problems. It costs me $62/month for 12M, and 10GB cap, because satellite is my only option other than 26K dialup. I'd love to have $48 and 50M, except for the fact that I'd have to live where there are enough people to support it.  On the other hand, I guess I'm happy enough with the problems I have.</comment>

<comment>and reduce their profit margins why the hell would they do that?  It makes no cost difference to them to give you 10, 25, 50 or 100 Mbp/s.  So offering a slower speed for less money literally makes them less money.</comment>

<comment>It's the old story of costs isn't it.  It is true that the cost to service each customer is probably about the same give or take a little.  It is also probably true that if you as a business lose too many of your customers then there will be fewer and fewer individuals to share that cost.  Is it not better to have 100 customers paying $30/month than 50 customers paying $48/mo.  The extra $600/mo can be used to pay for system improvements or dispersed as profit sharing to employees or as dividends paid to stockholders.  There are many examples of companies which have priced themselves out of a market.   Our cable TV and satellite providers are facing this same problem as we speak.</comment>

<comment>Because they have a trapped audience.  They have no incentive to ever lower prices (other than the very rare instances of a competitor invading their market) and the customers will always come back once they get reamed by the even more expensive mobile carriers.  This study isn't showing a preference for mobile internet it's showing people cutting cable to save money and making due with their phones.  Which is fine for many people and up front appears to be cheaper until they hit overage charges or wander into crappy coverage areas.Cable companies are monopolies and think and act like them.  It's all about squeezing blood from the stone, not finding new stones.</comment>

<comment>This highlights the FCC's misguided focus on protecting the advertising/content industry with so called "net neutrality" regulation.  Every citizen should have  connectivity to engage with interactive site, which have become essential to access many government, educational and commercial services.  But, that only takes a 100 kbps or so for a site like this.  Making that available and affordable is where the FCC should focus its regulatory attention, not on protecting the Netflix business model, which essentially depends on all broadband subscribers being required to dump money into a slush fund to support the content industry.  How high speed network operators and entertainment content providers divvy up consumer entertainment spending should be left to the market to sort out.</comment>

<comment>Very well said.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  "Net neutrality" sounds like a great idea, but the practical effect is that everyone is subsidizing Netflix, which accounts for 35% of traffic.</comment>

<comment>Having heard just about all the arguments for and against, I have to conclude that net neutrality is a good idea, but the big problem is the pricing structure. After a basic rate which covers the connection and a limited amount of data, the price should be based on what you use. (not how fast you use it)</comment>

<comment>How?  Netflix pays for its internet connection and I pay for mine, nobody is getting a free connection.  Unless you are saying you are in favor of being double billed for the same product.</comment>

<comment>When you pay for "a connection to the Internet" you are not really paying to reach a router or central data repository somewhere in the middle of the network, you are paying to reach another end point that can provide the content you want.  Likewise, when Netflix pays for its connection, they are not paying to drop off data at a router somewhere, but to reach their customers.  It is an end-to-end service.  It has always been double billed.  There have never been any fixed rules about how that bill gets divided for any given end-to-end path.  Instead, it has been negotiated on a case-by-case basis each place networks interconnect.Netflix gets subsidized when 2 people pay the same price for a broadband connection, but one uses it to watch a lot of Netflix and the other uses it very little.</comment>

<comment>Actually you are only paying for a connection to the exchange point.  The networks then peer to peer either for zero cost (very common) or for a transit fee depending on how many hops the request is making.  The other side of the equation pays the same to reach the exchange point on their end of things.  It's split down the middle.  Everyone is responsible for their own side of the exchange, not the entire path.</comment>

<comment>That is sort of how it worked 20 years ago.  Both ends paid for a connection to a backbone provider, who then took responsibility for delivery to a final destination.  But, even then, what anyone was actually paying for was an end-to-end connection.  A backbone provider couldn't sell 1 Mbps of inbound capacity to an ISP serving content providers, unless they had 1 Mbps of outbound capacity to actually deliver it to customers.  Because content providers flush with investment capital were willing to pay for inbound capacity more readily than consumer ISPs were willing to pay for more outbound capacity, backbone providers started offering consumer ISP's cheaper or even free connections so they could sell more inbound capacity.  Entirely new content distribution networks were built to bypass the backbones and deliver data directly to consumer ISP's, often paying them to accept the traffic because they could still make money from the sender side.  Fortunately, we did not have network neutrality regulations then, or capacity growth would have ground to a halt, waiting for consumer ISP's to pay up for "their half" of the connection.  If natural market forces are allowed to work, we can expect this trend to continue, with content providers paying for more and more of the last mile.  This will be great for consumers, since a lot of content provider spending comes from investors and advertisers and is never recovered from consumers.  Even the profitable companies like Google do not generally pay a dividend, which means all of their profits go to more freebies for consumers.  It is really foolish for consumers to insist the last mile must be funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, out of their own pockets.   The investor class controls at least 80% of the wealth in this country; let's not turn our noses up at their money.</comment>

<comment>They do its called 'The Connect America Fund'.</comment>

<comment>Of course broadband access has dropped, since the standard for broadband has been redefined upwards to 25Mb/s.</comment>

<comment>I was not aware of this change.  I am sure you are probably right but without some clarification it would seem to eliminate DSL which tops out in my community at 12 Mb/s   Do you have a website, document or reference you could provide?  Thank you</comment>

<comment>Well, the FCC raised the minimum for "broadband" labeling to 25 at the same time the whole Common Carrier thing happened.</comment>

<comment>I don't have a link handy, but you could try the fcc.gov website or try searching Google for 'broadband definition' This happened just after FCC redefined internet service as Common Carrier, to be regulated the same as telephone service.</comment>

<comment>Ah o.k. thank you very much.</comment>

<comment>DSL is not broadband, and only the phone companies marketing departments ever really believed it was. Sorry, Tom, but you've been mislead if you thought DSL was "high speed internet".DSL is perfectly fine for predominantly text-based  Internet services, though.  So you can read and send e-mail, upload and download a few still photos, maybe even watch Vines and other short video clips.  If that's your usage pattern, DSL may well be plenty for you.</comment>

<comment>Hi Ann Marie:You are so right.  Those things you listed are basically what I used the DSL service for.  I did watch some Netflix streams and uTube stuff from time to time but it did buffer every once in awhile. My cable service is 50 Megs which of course beats the heck out of DSL.  Have a great day.</comment>

<comment>I guess that's what they call regulatory capture.  Crazy for the FCC to be pushing these kinds of speeds when broadband is totally unavailable or unaffordable for so many Americans.  In fact, the Open Internet order of 2015 specifically spells out no rate regulation and no universal access requirements.  https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_pub...Basically, it's fine to stick it to the consumer, as long as you don't mess with the content business.  Everybody on the Internet rejoices their Network Neutrality victory, while Netflix, Google, etc laugh all the way to the bank.</comment>

<comment>What the FCC needs to do now that the ISPs are common carriers is to start implementing rate regulation like the electric and water utilities have to abide by.  ISPs are inherent essential monopolies just the the electric companies are, yet are able to charge whatever they like to consumers irregardless of what it costs them to offer the product.  The internet is essential to modern society, and access to it should be regulated as such.</comment>

<comment>Internet, yes, that is essential.  20 Mbps no, that is a luxury, for most people just another way to watch TV.  They should aim for universal access at ~1 Mbps, possibly subsidized by higher speed service, the way LD phone calls used to subsidize local.</comment>

<comment>"Crazy for the FCC to be pushing these kinds of speeds when broadband is totally unavailable or unaffordable for so many Americans."The current definition of broadband is 25 Mbps.  The previous definition was 4 Mbps.  Broadband is unavailable or unaffordable purely because of the ISPs.  The government has given the ISPs tens of billions of dollars as subsidies to build out their networks for more universal access, and then the ISPs take the money and never do as they promised. The government never enforces the agreements or even attempts to verify any work was done.The higher speeds are necessary for many things beyond watching TV. Ever try to update your computer's OS at 1 Mbps? That's necessary for computer security.  Ever try to backup your files over the internet at 1 Mbps? That's a nice peace of mind if you're computer is ever destroyed in a flood or house fire.  I keep all of my financial information on my computer so having a backup is critical.1 Mbps hasn't been acceptable for a 1st world country since at least 2005.</comment>

<comment>The FCC has the power to do something about affordability and availability.  Instead they focus on "net neutrality" which has exactly the opposite effect, putting upward pressure on monthly subscription rates and discouraging expansion to new customers.  Mostly it is great for the advertising/content business who loves to see you paying to receive their ads.  If broadband is such a profitable cash cow, I wonder why Verizon is selling off their wireline business to Frontier in my neighborhood (California)?Sure, having more than 1 Mbps is handy for many things, but hard to say what the public interest is that demands government intervention.  Most of what was revolutionary about the Internet and important to society happened before 2005.  Big thing since then is mainly a new way to watch TV.</comment>

<comment>Just because Verizon is selling off their wireline business doesn't mean it isn't profitable. It's just to be profitable doing it requires following rules set by the government, and they can rip off their wireless customers even more without those pesky rules.</comment>

<comment>As someone with a pre-paid smartphone with a hard data cap, I've never found it to be a problem.  There's plenty of data for posting to Facebook, asking Uncle Google questions, or getting information from Wikipedia.Data caps are an issue for watching Youtube videos.  The homeless people in my community go to the library when they want to watch Youtube on their laptops.</comment>

<comment>People, who know how to buy a longer, happier and more active lives, buy high speed internet.  Knowledge, not money is at the root of the choice.</comment>

<comment>Of course it's a luxury, broadband isn't a 'right'. In my part of the country, the expansion has slowed dramatically. Five years ago the buzz was all about broadband over power lines, and high speed for all, Fiber lines coming to our neighborhood soon. Well, not really. I've been stuck at the same speed for that same five years! (18MB) The pace of innovation has slowed, I don't know why, but it has.</comment>

<comment>It might be because it just doesn't make sense to have a higher speed. Think about it- how often does your internet connection's speed significantly impact your life in a negative way (denial of features instead of downloading something slightly slower)? There is a big difference between now and ten years ago in regards to actual tangible impacts having a relatively slow internet connection could have on your life.Ten years ago having a 56k or 256k connection could cause problems when a significant portion of the population had 3 or 5 or 10 Mbit connections-websites designed for high-speed users just would not work on slower connections. These days having a 'slow' connection of 18 Mbps compared to someone with 1Gbit doesn't really cause any negative impact, because websites, video games, and even video streaming do not and probably will never take full advantage of enormous bandwidth fiber provides (I am assuming no one has dialup, or a small enough percentage that no one should be basing decisions off of it).So in the end, be happy with what you have! 18 Mbit is pretty damn good (I get around 1-3 on a good day).</comment>

<comment>The problem is that slower speeds in US are making it difficult for mass adoption of new things like super HD video calls (think Netflix-quality video calls between two or more people in different locations), or the move towards more complex web-based apps and OS that rely on internet speeds being as fast as data ports in your computer.If "everybody on 10Mbps or more" was a standard, you'd not see plain sites for most of it, as they could go really heavy on their software and complexity bandwidth usage without fear of locking out no one but a tiny percentage of slow-internet users. Just think, for comparison, how Word or Excel 2016 is so much better and more resource-intensive than their versions of 1995, even though they generic goals and applications are the same. </comment>

<comment>The phenomena is not hard to explain. Very few people understand reality of bandwidth limitations and the constant drumming of advertisements push citizens into bad economic decisions that adversely affect personal choice. Broadband can be very cheap but since economic theory dictates that capitalism must prevail consumer data delivery systems are numerous and dependent on a few monopolies that rely on technology developed by taxpayers and protected by government from pricing constraints.</comment>

<comment>I don't get it. I can understand dropping a land line if you have a cell phone, and I can understand dropping cable TV now that there's Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. But dropping broadband? I couldn't do it. I find my smarphone's internet access very useful, especially for directions, but I still need my desktop with a real keyboard.</comment>

<comment>Probably the drop is a combination of people sharing wifi from their neighbors and people who have DSL or cable connections that are slower than 25 mbps, so they are not counted as having broadband anymore.</comment>

<comment>This is interesting: http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-...It explains why Chattanooga, TN has some of the fastest Internet speeds in the world (>1 gigabit).It also briefly touches on why the rest of the U.S. ranks behind Uruguay and Romania in that regard.Basically, we're getting screwed.</comment>

<comment>I think your figures are skewed. Just as an example change in "All adults - Smartphone only " jumping from 8% to 13 % is an increase of almost 90% if you consider 2013 as base. This holds true for ALL the results.</comment>
