<comment>Read from above...:"How IRENE works: It's basically a digital-imaging device. So, say you have a vinyl record you want to preserve. IRENE scans the topography of the disc, and sends the images it produces to a computer. Separate software on the computer then converts those images into sound."</comment>

<comment>Fine, but what does it do??</comment>

<comment>Above paraphrased:It is a method of preserving the recorded sounds that are currently on a medium of questionable longevity--and may even be already beyond retrieval by traditional means (e.g. you could use this method to preserve the sound on broken records or cylinders by scanning the pieces and reconstructing them virtually.)</comment>

<comment>very interesting article. Ben Franklin would love this stuff.</comment>

<comment>The key of "C" when gauged on the "megalithic scale" and multiplied by a standard constant is actually the wavelength of a very nice blue. Our current scales aren't totally accurate when gauged by natural earth frequencies, but then again, it's what we're used to now.</comment>
