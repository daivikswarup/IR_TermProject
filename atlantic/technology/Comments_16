<comment>Um, cause liars?  LOL.</comment>

<comment>I like cheese and junk.</comment>

<comment>They should have hired Hillary's IT guy. But hey who ever thought China of all places has an interest in hacking OPM, SSA, NSA, PSU and so forth. A dollar for every Republican prez candidate whose password is a: birthdate b: wedding anniversary c: kitten d: dog. Or in the case of Cruz it's 7:18-29; Trump it's Chapter11; Rubio: deregbank$. Those recipes of Hillary are classified Top Secret or in Rush's words For Your Eyes Only which I think he borrowed while on meth from a Bond movie.</comment>

<comment>Did he really say that?  Not "for official use only"?</comment>

<comment>Maybe Ms. Clinton's server choices were better informed than were first thought.</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>"The hackers bested the “Get Transcript” application by assuming others’ identities and tricking it into divulging tax history. They used details about real taxpayers that they compiled separately—likely bought off of other criminals who had previously stolen massive amounts of sensitive information from other places—to convince the system that they were authorized users logging in to download an official document."Wait, then is this actually hacking? Isn't it identity theft?</comment>

<comment>It's both.</comment>

<comment>How surprising, another government agency failing miserably with one of this most basic responsibilities.</comment>

<comment>How'd the gov't fail here.  With enough details, a 3rd party is you.</comment>

<comment>Privacy.  It is required at every private institution. Why can these inept imbeciles at a minimum live up to the same standards as the private sector?</comment>

<comment>Every one of these hacks is worse than you think, if for some reason you believe the initial reports from whoever got hacked.  Doesn't matter if it's Sony, Target, the IRS or the Federal Office of Personnel Management, they lie the first 5 times they report numbers.Just assume that the reality is at least 10x as bad as whatever the initially reported numbers suggest and you'll be less shocked later on.</comment>

<comment>IRS Hack? Lois Lerner is back?</comment>

<comment>F the IRS.  We should abolish it.  We can tax land instead.  Don't want to pay too much in tax?  Just reduce your footprint, or get a new survey.Even renters would pay their fair share.</comment>

<comment>If you never heard of the Magna Carta, or of the Greek City-States, or if Adam Smith doesn't ring a bell nor even Karl Marx, you definitely should read Rousseau's Social Contract.A volunteer tax system that actually works in the face of so much selfish greed is something to preserve- after all we care for one another, and we live in a society that shares.If we walk a few paces down your free-loader path we will find more greed and more scarcity and more fear and more selfishness.Why not learn the philosophical basis and the beauty of a system that was here long before you and hopefully will be here long after?</comment>

<comment>You are an idiot and clearly don't k ow the English language. "Beauty of a system" you are a freak. Yes, taxes are necessary but this institution is a fraud and should be blown up. Everyone fired and start over. And for you go back to North Korea.</comment>

<comment>The government ought to catch up with private credit card issuers who have long used PINS and other secondary ID's to verify.   Except for a small minority of Social Security cards, there is no associated PIN or an equivalent to the 3 or 4 digit card verification printed on credit cards.  Moreover, users of Social Security number cannot double check valid use with an associated phone number or email account.  Questions about your life history also are not used such as the name of your first pet.  In short, if the bad guys simply have your social security number linked to your name, you are in for a ton of trouble.  Secondary verification and more should protect the use of your Social Security number.  Indeed, you should be unharmed if you published your name and Social Security number on a public Internet site.  A Social Security number should be useless unless used with secondary verification that is multiple and which can be quickly changed if stolen.Now, given the government has to deal with a few hundred million Social Security numbers, they have a ton of work to do.  However, it would be money and time well spent, especially since national security issues are involved.  Just think of the havoc a foreign country or group like ISIS could cause if instead of fishing for dollars they tried to sabotage the IRS, Medicare, and all the other activities where Social Security numbers are critical.</comment>

<comment>Despite all the "talk" from DC, the gov remains a pretty poor custodian of our information. The OMB, the IRS . . We're not even close to matching our adversaries efforts.</comment>

<comment>You have no idea how far Federal govt computer systems are behind the times. Congress will not give them sufficient funding to update them so they just continue to fall further & further behind - in security & everything else.</comment>

<comment>If a citizen's data is stolen from the IRS, can that citizen charge the IRS penalties, fines, and fees?</comment>

<comment>One stinking year of identity theft protection?  Why?  Do your name and SSN expire after a year?  What and utterly and offensively inadequate a response!!</comment>

<comment>I have one year of identity theft protection from the OPM. I'm sure another federal agency will get hacked before my protection runs out.</comment>

<comment>Identity theft protection is bullshit anyway.</comment>

<comment>114,000 individuals had their IRS information hacked.  No, wait, the number is 334,000; no, wait, it's 724,000.  OPM exposed the records of 4,000,000 individuals, revised to 18,000,000, revised to 22,000,000, including the security clearance information of government employees.  OPM had been warned by the Inspector General every year for years that data was not secure, and OPM did nothing.  Hillary had a private server, exposing top secret information to hackers.  It's obvious that the government is incompetent and negligent.Now a federal judge has ordered that Apple must provide the FBI "with a signed iPhone Software file, recovery bundle, or other Software Image File ("SIF") that can be loaded onto the SUBJECT DEVICE." If Apple is forced to comply, how long will it be before the SIF falls into a hacker's hands?</comment>

<comment>So, as an over 32 year 9 yrs. retired IRS employee I'm wondering how they can hold you accountable for some of your tax information if your information has been stolen and/or compromised?  What's to say your information wasn't edited & used for their personal gain? They could potentially file a 1040X (Amended Return) on your previously filed return with bogus information & get more money back & you wouldn't even know about it. This could really screw things up.</comment>

<comment>I have a friend who received a tax bill for $140,000, along with the usual thousands of dollars in fines and penalties. This guy has never made anywhere near that kind of money. He was told it appears his SS# was being used by someone else. He has had to hire lawyers to straighten out the mess. He is still arguing with the IRS to disprove that he earned $140K. And on and on it goes.</comment>

<comment>And we're FORCED to give this monstrosity of an agency our most intimate details! (Social Security number--says right on the card "not to be used for ID purposes".) Age, full financial records, etc. This is ID theft on a GRAND scale.Here's an idea: the American people AT SOME POINT get so mad about this that they DEMAND a Constitutional Convention, one of whose planks is "We The People Hereby Replace All Federal Income Taxes with a Flat Rate Consumption Tax." Economists of every persuasion say this would raise savings and reduce spending--good for our economy. It could be coupled with a flat monthly cash grant to every adult citizen to wipe out poverty. Crazy? Maybe. But endorsed by economists from far right to far left.</comment>

<comment>How many federal employees have been fired as a result of this negligent incompetence?... Anyone? Bueller?</comment>

<comment>Whoever is in charge of the IT budget and oversight should definitely be canned.</comment>

<comment>None. Incompetence at an unprecedented level. Liberals would never fire any IRS idiots because they are unemployable in the private sector.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you don't actually know any liberals.Quite a few disdain the IRS once they or someone they know has run afoul of this all-powerful organization. No liberal likes a bureaucracy that can take your money or property WITHOUT TRIAL or hearing.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. I stand corrected then. The IRS has demonstrated plenty of abuses, especially in the past 7 years and liberal left led by this president has given them a complete pass, even been complicit in their illegal behaviors. So understand where I come from because actions speak louder than words.</comment>

<comment>Would it be too much to ask to get a real explanation of where these numbers are coming from? As an IT professional the explanation doesn't make sense for a typical security breach.Typically the target is the database and if the security for the database is compromised the hackers get ALL of the records. In that case you would simply check the number of records in the database and you have your number of victims.</comment>

<comment>Liberals love the IRS. This hateful institution is incapable of executing on its mission. We need a real leader to dismantle this inept organization and start over from scratch.</comment>
