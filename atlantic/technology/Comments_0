<comment>The smartphone is a crutch by which some people would merely fall down and flail on the ground if they didn't have it turned on and in their face.</comment>

<comment>Naw, but when I'm lost in L.A. and need help, that Smart Phone â˜Ž is pretty useful.....</comment>

<comment>All technology is a crutch. Are you implying that the removal of the smartphone would be more dramatic than the removal of industrial farming?</comment>

<comment>In other news, it was also reported that the young, educated, & affluent also regularly purchased and used a whole bunch of other expensive gadgets... many more than the old, uneducated, and poor. This came as a complete surprise to those who were convinced that the crowds at the Apple Store were all retired folks shopping for fruit.</comment>

<comment>Breaking news: people with money to buy computers spend more time using computers!</comment>

<comment>I often forget how lucky I was to be raised in a household that adopted the internet and personal computers early. I remember my father paging through a huge DOS command book to get games working when I was like 4. And reading AOL chat rooms when I was 7 (why my parents thought AOL chat rooms were something 7 years olds should try is beyond me) was an experience. Being able to troubleshoot, build, and maintain, a computer from an early age is an invaluable skill I have learned as I have gotten older. Hopefully lower cost to manufacture computers and more user friendly interfaces help more young people become computer literate at a young age.</comment>

<comment>The young ask Uncle Google, whose great wisdom dispels lies and ignorance.We sought the knowledge of when the chupacabra mythos began, to settle our differences.  Thought it seems to predate modernity, it in fact dates from the ancient time know as 1995, when OJ was found innocent, and when a popular show known at the X-Files inspired the legend-makers.</comment>

<comment>More breaking news: Research shows that people who are in a hurry tend to move faster than people who aren't.</comment>

<comment>My opinion is the only people who really, really need a cell/smart phone are organ transplant surgeons and people who are on the short list to receive a kidney/liver/heart, etc. and both need to be notified so they can get to the hospital in a big hurry. I don't know what the exact percentage is, but I'm guessing that the vast majority of mobile calls do not have to be made. People say "Well, I paid $400 bucks for the phone and it's costing me $100 bucks a month to operate it, sooooo...might as well use it." Which is why there are so many calls like "Hey, what are you doing?" or "I'm gonna be at that party in about four or five minutes. Are you there yet?" Look, when I'm standing at the butcher counter contemplating whether to have the filet or the porterhouse for dinner tonight I do NOT want to have to listen to you blathering into a phone about your latest big deal or how totally awesome you were during your meeting that day. Take it outside. Oh, I suppose some people need a phone to let their besties know that they're going shopping or to take pictures of their lunch or of themselves. Just don't do it anywhere around me.</comment>

<comment>I'm so sorry you had to listen to other people talk.  You may want to look into getting an internet connection or smartphone of your own.  That way you can order your porterhouse online and not have to come in contact with all the chatterboxes in our society.</comment>

<comment>Well, obviously I have a web connection. I didn't post the comment via carrier pigeon. As for the chatterboxes, perhaps they could just observe some common manners and not invade other people's space with their one-sided inane conversations. It's not the phones per se, but the boorish behavior of a segment of users that's objectionable. Actually I have a phone we keep in the car glove-box in case of a breakdown. The rest of the time I really don't  feel compelled to call a buddy and ask him what he's doing. Or to let people know what I had for lunch.</comment>

<comment>So if it were two people just standing there talking you'd be OK with it?  I mean that's been going on since the beginning of time.  The only difference here is you're only hearing one half the conversation.</comment>

<comment>Bill, let it go. Just. Let. It. Go.</comment>

<comment>Do they now ?  These underpaid and undereducated folks under 30 in my office never look up from their devices they can't afford.  I am sure the sickness is spreading.  Yep.</comment>

<comment>In other news, the sky is blue.</comment>

<comment>Hey, I'm on-line now!</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't dwell so much on the smartphone aspect of this.  I mean smartphones are convenient but the PC is a far better device for accessing the internet.  I think the big thing to note here is what the various groups are doing for entertainment.  The internet appears to be offering the young, affluent, and educated something that cable TV, newspapers, or whatever is not.  And conversely those other mediums appeal more to the old, poor, and less educated for some reason.  Maybe it would be worth exploring why that is.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I mistakenly read this article assuming these were the questions it would answer....so, I was certainly disappointed.  I was just thinking earlier today about network tv shows and tv news shows. I realize that in the last 4 years my own viewing has declined like by about 60% at least...maybe more. I am now almost fully using internet for my news (no more CNN and I never really watched network nightly news)....I have one network show I watch (The Good Wife. Mad Men has ended...that was my other one). Other than that it's movies (DVD, cable channels, and Amazon Prime.) I wonder if I am an outlier or whether I am part of a larger group that has nixed tv for the most part. </comment>

<comment>I don't own a smartphone, and I don't use social media. But I do spend more time online than anyone else I know. I started back before the web existed, meeting and courting my now-spouse on bbs's. The habit of spending time online remained.There's internet use and then there's productive and varied internet use.When I went to a local community college for a course, I discovered that the smartphone owners did, indeed, spend a considerable amount of time on Facebook, much to their educational detriment, as none of them had much of a clue how to use a PC, much less actually troubleshoot problems with it. And their online research skills were basically non-existent.Of course, a similar group of actual university students might be somewhat more adept at navigating online. But there's no reason to believe that spending multiple hours a day on Facebook will teach you very much about "the internet" or about computers. On the other hand, you will know a lot about smartphones and Facebook. I'm not sure how valuable that knowledge really is.</comment>
