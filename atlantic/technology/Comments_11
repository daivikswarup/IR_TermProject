<comment>IMHO, better to use an artificial cork and know that your $35 bottle of wine isn't tainted.</comment>

<comment>Not if the artificial cork doesn't allow the wine to age in the bottle.  If it does then I'm fine with it.</comment>

<comment>Actually xToddrick, natural cork plays no part in (desirable) wine maturation in the bottle. Corks do not "breathe" - they leak - wine out and air in. Over the longer term this results in the same wine varying between bottles. As our late "Mr Wine", Len Evans, was fond of saying - "There are no great wines, only great bottles"!</comment>

<comment>This article is incomplete: What is the cost comparison between cork and other closures? How do cork forests - cork oak - compare to other forests in the carbon uptake? Given that today most wines, almost all but the higher priced collector wines, are ready to drink when released, i.e. don't require aging, is there any quality reason to prefer cork over other closures?I drink wine regularly with meals. I had a career as a young man in hospitality with a lot of exposure to wine including being the  beverage manager at a high end resort. Today, with a budget that runs from $10 to $30 per bottle, I find no taste difference between wines with cork closures and screw caps. I've been out of hospitality for about 20 years now and I'd like to hear from other oenophiles on this topic.</comment>

<comment>I worked high end caterings and have tasted 1000+ dollar bottles.It all tastes the same.  Most of the people who pretend otherwise, are again, pretending.</comment>

<comment>that movie somme on netflix is pretty good.</comment>

<comment>You're lucky.  I find great differences wine and prefer many from France, with the exception of Bordeaux, Italy, Spain, and the Williamette Valley in Oregon. </comment>

<comment>My favorite is actually the carmenere, from chile.</comment>

<comment>Am I right in saying that all of my fellow readers are thinking Eff off...!</comment>

<comment>The shipping of bark thousands of miles is unlikely to make cork actually more eco friendly.</comment>

<comment>Cork is extremely lightweight.</comment>

<comment>Incorrect, cork has a low density which is not the same thing. When compared to the quantities of aluminum  needed to create a wine screw top, cork is probably an order of magnitude heavier. And since the aluminum raw material can be shipped in a much much smaller container from point of extraction to a foreign destination for final processing, the difference is even more extreme.And that is not even accounting for the 5-7% wastage of grapes, glass and corks attributed to spoilage due to cork issues.</comment>

<comment>ummm i'm pretty sure i could lift the weight of all the cork in the world with only my pinky.</comment>

<comment>Volume matters.A container of aluminum vs cork cost the same to ship.One can be used to make 100X the number of tops as the other.</comment>

<comment>still.</comment>

<comment>Ok, but shipping occurs after the raw materials are made into closures at which point the volume might as well be equivalent.I'd love to see an actual carbon footprint and cost analysis of cork harvest vs aluminum and petroleum extraction; cork manufacture vs. screwtop manufacture; and shipping comparison, but I'm not seeing it here.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure about that.</comment>

<comment>Funny, because that's why plastic bags are more energy-efficient OVERALL, including shipping, than paper bags!Do the math!</comment>

<comment>...which is why you prefer locally grown steel, plastic, and aluminum closures?</comment>

<comment>Eco-friendly like the bauxite mining in Australia from where aluminum comes from? Are you kidding me?</comment>

<comment>Here's my three question test for wine I'm about to drink:How cheap is it?What is the ABV?Does it have a screw top?A perfect score is Free, 13% and yes.</comment>

<comment>Not a single mention of the always classy wine in a box?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, why wait to guzzle the wine ? - get sick just looking at the container.</comment>

<comment>I LOVE boxed wine. Perfect pour, elegant presentation, and economical to boot. Also, you can just leave it in the fridge for weeks!</comment>

<comment>Lol, I like to give millennials a hard time about all kinds of stuff but in this case ?  Nah.</comment>

<comment>Seeing a screw-cap on my wine bottle after peeling the paper is like suddenly seeing a mega-plus-size model in my Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate convenience?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, exactly.</comment>

<comment>Tradition aside, there is a tangible, palpable involvement in extracting a cork from a bottle, a particular manual and aural sensation unique to cork.  Easily dismissed, of course by anyone immune to nostalgia; with not a moment a spare for the more subtle distinctions of everyday existence...that, which for some, can be the difference between living life or simply enduring it.</comment>

<comment>I absolutely love how Millennials are blamed for just about everything. The only argument they made to support the absurd headline was this:Millennial wine drinkers, a generation that has less of an allegiance to traditional cork closures. A 2012 report by the Wine Market Council, a nonprofit association of grape growers, wine producers, importers, and other affiliated businesses, revealed that 65 percent of older Millennials (over the age of 25) drink wine daily or several times a week; half of younger Millennials (21-25) fell into the same category. The report also revealed that roughly two-thirds of Millennials “frequently or occasionally” purchase unfamiliar brands of wine, and 60 percent admitted to being swayed by “fun and contemporary-looking” labels. The type of bottle closure, by contrast, isn’t an important factor in purchasing decisions—and when it is, the lack of need for a corkscrew may well be an enticement.Yet in the last sentence they say that the type of closure is not an important factor.Furthermore, how did Millennials contribute to the tainted wine? How did Millennials move Australia and New Zealand so far away from Europe and how did Millennials increase the transportation costs to the point where it is more economical for vintners in those countries to use alternative closures?The Atlantic needs to change this idiotic, misleading and factually incorrect headline that is supported by one paragraph and even that contradicts the headline.</comment>

<comment>I'm convinced screw tops are perfectly good, better than cork (which can vary in quality by origin - too many skanky corks in some "peripheral" country wines) for purposes of protecting the wine.  But over $20 or so, with a good dinner and good company, there is a ceremonial, romantic element to opening a good bottle that's lost with either screwtops or plasticized plugs.   Uncorking is  kind of foreplay that's part of the mood.  But a cork is not going to make a wham bam bottle of hootch into anything better.</comment>

<comment>I don't care what stops my wine from leaking.That is all.One thing to note - The plastic "cork" does not get dried out, break and fall into wine.</comment>

<comment>The article is framed as if moving to plastic seals for wine bottles is a BAD thing.  It isn't.  But those seals are only part-way to the real goal.  Boxed wine is the future -- get used to it.I'm a daily wine drinker, and use recyclable box-wine containers.  The wine is cheaper, consistently good, and I've never had a tainted box.  I can't say the same about traditionally corked wine and I can remember many disappointing evenings expecting a nice glass of wine, and getting a corked glass of something that ended up thrown away.In addition, there's the energy saved not transporting all that heavy glass and far less loss from breakage.  I've had a couple of leaky boxes over the years, but it's rare and usually obvious before purchase.</comment>

<comment>Does boxed wine improve with age?  I have had some amazing wines that have matured over many years in my conditioned cellar.</comment>

<comment>I don't think so.  Nor do I need it to. My days of buying pricey high-end wine, having hundreds of bottles in the cellar, and waiting for that perfect time to open them are over. I drink what I buy right away, and there's always more at the store.</comment>

<comment>You seem content with that which is what matters but I can't imagine changing to that approach.</comment>

<comment>There was a figure quoted a few years ago that in Australia the average cellaring time from point of purchase is 8 hours!</comment>

<comment>I suspect just a little PR input from the cork industry...Let's cut to the chase. Australia & New Zealand lead the change to stelvin screw caps  because they were sick of the 5 - 10% contamination of their wines. I was a member of a professional tasting panel in the '90s and I saw it (or rather, smelt it). Further, the most insidious problem with TCA (cork taint) is when it exists in mild form. At this level it "dumbs" the wine without obvious spoilage. So the consumer buys a new wine, thinks "this has no flavour" and never buys it again! The other issue was the randomness - quality control AFTER bottling was useless because the problem was randomly distributed. One major Australian company had to dump a complete vintage of their largest selling white wine.Given that the major export markets, USA and China still show a distinct preference for wines under cork, we would LOVE to resume using the closure - but not until we can be guaranteed that TCA has been eliminated.</comment>

<comment>Oh, it's so easy, is it, to remove a screwcap? Here's a whole piece on the subject: http://sedimentblog.blogspot.c...</comment>

<comment>Jeez, was this article sponsored by a cork company or something?Also, "65 percent of older Millennials (over the age of 25) drink wine daily or several times a week" is a crazy statistic! That's so much wine and so many people!</comment>

<comment>From a winemaker with 34 years of vintages -1. Wine does not need oxygen leaking through the closure to age after it's been bottled!2. The reductive potential is a winemaking issue that should be handled before bottling. Good winemakers don't need to use faulty closures to mitigate their poor quality control.3. Currently the best closure is a screw cap with tin liner. PERIOD4. DIAM manufactured cork closures are purified with super critical CO2 and are 100% taint free and do not break down or leak oxygen. Oxidation being a much bigger problem with "natural cork" than TCA. This should be the only acceptable cork closure for any fine wine.5. Only the cheapest of wines should one ever consider using a "natural cork"6. At least 80% of all wine produced should be packaged in "Bag in Box" as it has no long term aging potential, will be consumed within a year, and is more environmentally friendly with smaller carbon footprint.</comment>

<comment>The focus has moved on from TCA some time ago. It's more about cork's unreliability as an oxygen barrier; get air in to your wine and you've vinegar. No such worries with alternative closures. And if you really think cork has had its day: visit France!</comment>

<comment>I only partially agree with you Damien. Sure, the move to Stelvin has taught wine makers that (a) their wines still develop and (b) the development is uniform across the bottling - but TCA was and remains the major concern.As the UK critic, Robert Joseph, said to me recently, "a cork is packaging" and it made me think. These days we spend a lot more money on heavy glass bottles and fancy embossed labels. Why destroy the visual impact and "theatre" by having a screw cap?</comment>

<comment>It's not good "theatre" when the actors forget their lines (oxidation), or there's a power cut (TCA).All important is what's in the bottle, and making sure it's in as good a condition as possible. Just as lightbulbs replaced candles, innovation has trumped aesthetics in wine.</comment>
