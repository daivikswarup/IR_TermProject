<comment>I think he is criticizing Apple just to get attention. No way he can be in favor of privacy and be in favor of letting the government into your phone.</comment>

<comment>I think he is criticizing Apple because he is reasonable and well informed.  The government can examine the contents of your home with a proper warrant.  Up until 2014, the government could examine the contents of your iPhone with a proper warrant.  I am not aware of any case where liberties were abused by this latter ability.</comment>

<comment>Well put, Tim!</comment>

<comment>That's nonsense, and you should be ashamed for trolling an article about you.  My government can raid my home, but they can't make me decrypt files I have encrypted myself.They can imprison me or beat me up, or abuse my family, all of which has happened to me, but they can't make me incriminate myself.You sir, are not a 'true Scot'.  You probably take sugar on your porridge, and let English lords free reign over your daughters arse.  Shame on ye.</comment>

<comment>I am not 'trolling', kind sir. I am interested in responses to the article, just as I encourage discussion when I teach classes. Academics should not go dark once their views are published by influential third parties.We will have to agree to differ on the Apple-FBI standoff.Actually, you're right. I am a 'sassenach', born in Nottingham in England, but the great and welcoming Scottish nation has tolerated me for 30 years. Nice one about porridge; no comment on your last pot shot.</comment>

<comment>We may have tolerated you, but that doesn't make you a Scottish philosopher, if indeed you are a philosopher at all - there's no evidence of that either in the article.You obviously don't understand the Apple issue.  You claim that privacy must be subject to the whims of the state, any state.  That is a fascist viewpoint, for the simple reason there are fascist states.  There is no justice without privacy.  You know nothing about technology, yet you haver on here as if you are some sort of expert.  How very English of you.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for tolerating me. I did not call myself a Scottish philosopher: that was how the article introduced me. I just use the small intelligence I have to try to develop my field of information policy and advance the common good.I think I do understand the issue. You are  crudely running together fascism, which I detest, and the legitimate work of a police investigation into a mass murder of innocents.I agree with you that justice requires privacy, but not all manifestations of privacy claims should be tolerated.</comment>

<comment>Have you ever developed any technology?  I'm guessing no, and perhaps you should add that to the list of incorrect implications this article gives."You are crudely running together fascism, which I detest, and the legitimate work of a police investigation into a mass murder of innocents."I think crude is pejorative, I think I was illustrating the stark mistake you've made.  The Gestapo did legitimate police investigations according to German law at the time.  The Stasi did legitimate police investigations according to East German law at the time. Just because something is legitimate doesn't mean it is moral.Take Russia or China or North Korea today, or some state you find repugnant.  Would you want them to be able to unlock a dissidents iPhone?  Because that is what you are proposing.  Once the genie is out of the bottle then there is no putting it back.  You cannot subvert security just the once.  In fact, despite the dishonest and brazen lies of James Comey that this one case didn't set a precedent, we know now there are another 15 iPhones lined up to be cracked.  Crypotography is an essential tool in individual privacy, and privacy is an essential aspect of liberty.  You are clearly out of your depth and simply spouting pish.</comment>

<comment>You have focused the issue helpfully: should the North Korean authorities be able to unlock a dissident's iPhone?I will go away and think long and hard about that. But my first shot: yes. Repugnant though the authorities might be in places like that, they should have the ability to unlock data in devices in pursuit of a legal investigation.There are indefeasible limits on what the state can do in pursuit of information. It cannot torture (or 'enhanced interrogate'), not ever. That for me is the real line in the sand, one violated by all accounts in North Korea, among other places.</comment>

<comment>That is the argument and I think you are arguing the wrong side of the case just now.  North Korean security services should not be able to open any North Korean smartphone.The limits on this are indeed torture, as explained in this XKCD cartoon.  The only defence against torture is to have security even you yourself can't get into.  For an individual that means keeping a cryptographic passphrase too long and complicated to remember on a easily and quickly destructible CD or micro SD card.Apple are now taking a similar approach and are reported to be developing a phone even Apple couldn't break into even if/when they are ordered to.Apple Is Said to Be Trying to Make It Harder to Hack iPhonesIf you want a more down to earth example of privacy versus state, I'd argue that I should be allowed to keep control of my own NHS health records.  Mainly because I know how to protect them and the NHS obviously doesn't.</comment>

<comment>That has to have been one of the most entertaining back and forth arguments in a comments section that I've read. Innes Mizner, have you ever considered developing a "character persona" and using it to espouse your views on Youtube? Could be a lot of fun and get a lot of attention.I myself occasionally play the Mad Hatter. :)</comment>

<comment>Here's a compromise.  Once you stop all governments from torturing, including places like North Korea, for  a lengthy period, say fifty years, then, and only then, will I happily submit my right to privacy.  But as long as they keep their phasers set to kill then I'm keeping my shields up.</comment>

<comment>I am impressed with your latest reasoning. However, I faced your test case. Now face mine. A North Korean serial killer's iPhone is found by the police. A child's life will probably be saved if the Phone's contents can be quickly recovered. Whose side are you on: the child's mother's or Apple's?</comment>

<comment>Define 'probably'.  Is that the North Korean Torturer in Chief's evaluation, or your evaluation, or mine?  You are publicly siding with proven torturers here against invented villains.  That has got to give anyone pause for thought.  Surely, Shirley.</comment>

<comment>I should add, we had this debate in the UK soon after the French Revolution.  Please don't make me dig out this quote because it would take me some time and effort, but an English earl said (roughly from memory), "I would rather have a few dozen slit throats in the east end of London than the reign of terror being visited on every French household today".  Words to that affect, back when the only meaning of terrorism was state terrorism.  I kind of agree with that.  I'm not siding with North Korean child murderers, I just note that North Korean policemen are all complicit in child-murder themselves.</comment>

<comment>I think you are not playing fair. You brought in a hypothetical scenario, but you won't allow me to.It is perfectly possible to imagine a situation here or anywhere where the recovery of an iPhone's contents could help to track down a child torturer and save innocent lives.That is why I am saying, and I will have to thank you for the stimulating discussion and conclude my own posts now, that the state must have the ability, in pursuit of justice and in extremis, to decrypt.</comment>

<comment>I think I'm playing fair.  I did allow you to imagine a 'ticking time bomb' scenario, I merely pointed out it was incredibly implausible compared to the daily reality that North Korean policemen are child murderers.The simple fact is the state, as of today, cannot decrypt what I encrypted.  They will not decrypt them in the House, they will not decrypt them with my mouse, they will not decrypt them in a box, they will not decrypt them with  Firefox, they will not decrypt them here or there. They will not decrypt them anywhere.This isn't an argument about encryption.  The US security services lost that argument back in the '90s.  This is an argument about whether you want to exile Silicon Valley or not.</comment>

<comment>Thank you sir.It's nice to see an article's contributor adding onto the discourse afterward. Also, not everyone agrees that justice should supersede liberty, as the other commenter demonstrated.I would rather help a horrible human being save a life than know I preserved a principle.</comment>

<comment>Working backwards from a heart-wrenching scenario that happens to be resolved by "unlocking" an iphone is a pathetic argument and hardly philisophical! The connected nature of these devices provides many additional hints and clues to authorities who we would hope are motivated and clever enough to want to save the child's life. But you are now asking for not only unlockable devices to make police work easier, but devices that can be "quickly recovered". What world do you think you are living in?</comment>

<comment>In fact we have seen totalitarian states fall mainly through the mass flow of public information, rather than secret scheming.</comment>

<comment>Not well put Tim! If the Govt. is to be permitted access it will have nothing to do with technical feasibility. What you are implying is that the state has effective power to prohibit end-to-end encryption, i.e., to have it breakable by a third party. This of course is impossible except under extremely authoritarian rule making. In which case the technology will simply migrate.</comment>

<comment>Well, to be fair the FBI is free to look at all the data on any phone (with a warrant). They just can't understand it in its present form, and that's really not Apple's problem just like how shredded documents detailing evidence of a crime are not the document shredder manufacturer's problem.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but if Apple refuses to assist, the FBI can get a warrant to examine the Apple source code.  This would allow them to acquire the code-signing key which enables the installation of new system software.  They could then hire their own engineers to write the necessary code.  Then, they will have a general purpose tool to apply to any phone of that software generation.</comment>

<comment>Best of luck to them on that endeavor, then.</comment>

<comment>A very interesting take on silicon valley, but plain old fashioned graft is the simplest explanation for the problem.  Sure, there's a techno-utopian veneer to all of it, but the Silicon Valley oligarchs aren't that different from the Wall Street oligarchs. I also think he fails to grasp the libertarianism of these guys.  They don't hold liberty above all as the highest good. It's profit, and power they worship. They're anarcho-capitalists. That mythical creature the Real Libertarian, doesn't actually exist. Except maybe Friedersdorf, but he's just some guy that writes a column for the Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>Friedersdorf might prove his "real libertarian" credentials if he'd finally drop that somebody-shushed-me-in-college-once grudge.</comment>

<comment>"Anarcho-capitalists." I like it!</comment>

<comment>Interesting note: 75% of all engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign born.</comment>

<comment>They don't count for diversity.</comment>

<comment>The hypocrisy of Silicon Valley's anti-government ideology is pretty obvious, but it's important to point it out whenever there's an opportunity. Silicon Valley isn't just sustained by government contracts, it was built on government investment. Yet there are a lot of these techno-utopians that think there's is no need for government. I recently saw a documentary where one of them was saying that they could do a better job at predicting Flu outbreaks than the CDC through twitter mining, implying that all these government are unnecessary.  The problem is, the CDC collects data for a different purpose. For Silicon Valley data is just a commodity to sell for a profit.</comment>

<comment>"it was built on government investment"Well so were the Bundys and Ben Carson.Walking through the door and then slamming it shut behind you is nothing new for the so called anarcho-capitalists.</comment>

<comment>"The ultimate value is not liberty: It is justice. Liberty has to fit within the context of social justice. And where it violates justice, I’m afraid justice trumps liberty."I read the above and I checked out. He has a different value system so he dismisses an entire worldview out of hand.  Not that I agree with Silicon Value - I very much value my privacy but I value it for my liberty - not to further social justice.</comment>

<comment>What about individual justice? We have vested in our government the responsibility of justice, or this would still be the Wild West. Justice is sometimes in tension with liberty. Ask any denizen of a prison cell.</comment>

<comment>Libertarians aren't anarchists, so there is no reason why libertarianism and justice should be seen as either-or. The freedom libertarians talk about is freedom from coercion or force — and so if someone steals your stuff or mugs you, cops and courts are needed. Then due process is needed to protect the accused's right to freedom from force or coercion, lest the cops-and-courts system become vigilantism at a distance.Just my two cents, offered in the spirit of discussion. When folks like Duff dismiss libertarianism, I sometimes get the impression they're dismissing their own caricature of it, no matter how many books on the matter they claim to have read.</comment>

<comment>Freedom can be used to hide coercion and force. Like someone says to me nobody is forced to watch hollywood movies they are right in a way but at the same time there is money and power deciding what is produced and what is available to people they are free not to watch doesn't mean they are free to watch what they could be watching. People have freedom to get rick quick doesn't mean they are free to plant turnips. Free trade is not fair trade nor is the freedom to be rich the freedom from money. If you don't like it run for the hills doesn't mean libertarians don't want freedom to one day frack those hills. </comment>

<comment>Libertarianism isn't a wish-fullfilment machine. I may wish to make a living selling assembled jigsaw puzzles glued to cardboard backings, but if no one wants to buy them and I can't therefore pay my bills, it can't really be said my freedom to follow my bliss was curtailed. I was free to try, and free to fail. You may wish to buy any number of things that no one else has figured out how to produce successfully, but that doesn't your freedom was curtailed. I just means you're disappointed, and no political philosophy can protect you from that.</comment>

<comment>Your not offering freedom from bills so how can we say that the wish to make a living selling jigsaw puzzles was really following my bliss?https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Well,  no one can offer freedom from bills. That's a utopian fantasy. If we got rid of money tomorrow, we'd all still need a way to eat. Humans used to live without money. Apparently it sucked. Everyone had to grow their food and pray for rain. If weren't a farmer, you had to be able to do something for the farmer in exchange for food, so maybe you become a blacksmith, and so on. The promise of libertarianism isn't utopia, it's that people free from force are better positioned to solve those problems. It's not all that weird or mysterious. "Don't kill anybody, don't steal their stuff, don't lie, do keep your word." That's the core and there isn't a society on earth that doesn't have some idea that those are good things.</comment>

<comment>The world has become too complex and inter-dependent for unbounded individual liberty.  Explosive, biological, chemical and radiological weapons can wreak massive destruction.  Power, water, information, transportation, and financial systems are vulnerable to disruption.  A few conspirators on Wall Street can make secret decisions that cost 100000's of jobs.If we can't trust our government with the tools to mitigate these risks, then we need to fix our government, not fantasize that we have only ourselves to rely on for safety... unless you are willing to go totally off the grid.</comment>

<comment>Liberty is not an end to itself. It's simply necessary for self governance. Its greatest advocates sometimes lose sight of that. From that foundation, we can argue at what scale we want government. Anarchy takes too much energy, and does not guard the rights and freedom of the less strong and capable. Autocracy is obviously no longer self governance. There's a balance in there somewhere.</comment>

<comment>Govenment is mind control it is what the word means so unless nobody is influenced by anybody else there is government or even self governance is still government. The images are in the words you can find some fascinating ones like recognize early 15c., "resume possession of land," or work it, work it. http://www.theguardian.com/com...</comment>

<comment>I'd like to thank ProudAAPLStockholder and other commenters for taking the trouble to post. Can I clarify a couple of points.First, there is a slight but misleading transcription error, probably a result of my indistinct articulation. it was European privacy ombudsmen and women, i.e. data protection commissioners from many nations, that jointly agreed the Madrid declaration, not 'the European privacy ombudsman': there is no overarching privacy czar in Europe, nor would I like to see such.Second, I respect Proud AAPL's and others' strong belief in privacy. However, I think you will bring privacy into disrepute by fetishising murderers' iPhones. This is absolutely the wrong site on which to fight. Justice, in this case criminal justice, has to be the winner here. I don't think freedom of conscience or any other inalienable right is being compromised by unlocking the secrets inside a tech device.</comment>

<comment>I think that there is a fundamental divide between your beliefs and those of many commenters here. It is not helped by your insistence that this is about one mass-murderer's phone.The biggest problem is not with the government as a whole planning to misuse the tool they want Apple to build (although they'd love to have precedent so they can use it in drugs and other non-terrorism cases), but the fact that governments and companies are made up of many people. It doesn't matter how good the intentions of the groups, each group is entrusting a number of people with an incredible tool. President Obama's family uses iPhones. Many government agencies use iPhones. A large number of companies use iPhones. Even if no one involved in the creation or use of this tool decides to use it illegally, they will likely be approached by others who will pay them handsomely for such a tool.Assuming that everyone involved can resist temptation, there's still the person who loses a thumb drive of documents they took home to keep working in comfort, the hacker who gets into a computer holding the program (or enough of it to recreate it), or the judge who uses this precedent to allow overreaching searches.The problem is not confined to one case or one phone. The problem is creating a tool to get into many phones, and pretending that tool cannot and will not be misused.Besides all that, McAfee has offered a better solution. He says his team can crack that phone without a backdoor being created by Apple, and he has offered that service for free. They aren't taking him up on that. The feds want the tool. They want the precedent. They want to be able to use this to pursue searches far beyond this one. If that doesn't seem at least a little worrisome, you and I have very different conceptions of privacy.</comment>

<comment>McAfee is a self-promoting charlatan, best ignored.  The thing is though, it was the Feds who deliberately set this password when the phone was in their custody.  They know there is nothing on it, they are using this case as a Trojan Horse.  I really don't have a horse in this race.  My personal data is properly encrypted and I don't use smartphones.  If Apple are forced to comply then Silicon Valley shuts down and the work relocates to Switzerland or anywhere beyond the reach of the FBI.  It would go down as one of the most monumentally self-destructive acts in human history, giving up your tech advantage for no gain.</comment>

<comment>It's sad that you have to explain this to people, who still won't get it. The government licences the airwave spectrum, Apple and the like are the tail on the dog. The notion that an iPhone( or any other tech device ) entitles you to special privileges is ludicris on it's face.</comment>

<comment>I think Drew's comments are helpful and will think about them, particularly about whether an intermediary between Apple and the authorities is viable. This would need to be a smooth-running setup so that the FBI and other government agencies can get quick access to any device, with a warrant, of course.</comment>

<comment>The implied smear that people who criticise your attack on privacy are Apple shareholders is truly pathetic.  I've never owned or wanted to use an Apple device, let alone own their stock.I was reading this article, Should Professors Be Fired for Damaging a College's Reputation? and my gut instinct is of course they shouldn't, but then reading your fake, moronic and embarrassing comments here makes me think twice. Away back to Nottingham, Guy de Gisborne.</comment>

<comment>Calm down Innes he wasn't addressing you.  There was ProudAAPLStockholder in the comments. Apparently there are people who define themselves by the content of their stock portfolio.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough.  He was labelled a Scottish philosopher and that did 'grind my gears'.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Duff Do you often wade into the morass of the comment section to argue your point?  You must be a man of the people. I kind of respect that. You're like a later day Don Quixote</comment>

<comment>Why not wade in? There's nothing more annoying than debating someone's opinions with that someone maintaining a stony silence.More importantly, as a professor I think I should try to give something back to society. I also enjoy discussion, even robust discussion.The only problem is time: yesterday I did not get enough work done. So today I have to catch up preparing lectures, etc.Thank you very much for taking the trouble to comment. If I don't reply for a while, please excuse me.</comment>

<comment>I think the bigger issue is that fact that the pursuit of all things "tech" is leading to a huge mis-allocation of capital. Look at how much capital gets gets allocated to video games and other forms of entertainment, for example, all while we have huge numbers of homeless people and crumbling infrastructure nationwide.How much of the capital being spent on tech gadgets/software is actually leading to an improvement in the quality of people's lives?</comment>

<comment>Good point, but would you stop the space programme because of poverty and misery down here on Earth. I wouldn't.</comment>

<comment>Nah, you'd shove yer grannie aff the bus for the price of her bus fare.</comment>

<comment>Is that capital really "misallocated" if people buy and enjoy the games, and enjoy making them and earn a living doing so? These are all private decisions, freely made. It's not like there's some central government that could've ended homelessness but chose instead to spend the money handing out Xboxes. Quite possibly you have some recreational interest I could point to and say, hey, you should've given that money to the homeless ... except that's not for me to say.</comment>

<comment>"huge numbers of homeless people" - there is no evidence that 'allocating capital' to these people improves their situation one bit.  In fact, many argue that this is the cause of endemic poverty throughout Africa.  Sometimes the best way to help someone is to stop trying to 'help' them.  Another example: Project LEAD in Seattle gives money, housing, education and other services to drug addicts (instead of arresting them).  Yet there is no evidence that giving these people stuff makes them any better.  In fact, they usually eventually drop out of the program due to 'relapse'.  Well I'm not saying they should be criminalized (so it's an improvement in that sense) but again, 'allocating capital' to drug addicts has never, ever, ever been shown to be at all effective, and in fact I claim that our current suicide epidemic is a direct result of 'treatment'. I think the problem is not so much inequality per se, but the unconscious envy it engenders.</comment>

<comment>Well said. This stuff is enabling not helping.</comment>

<comment>It is hard to say with homlessness I think it is probably more a case of removing the right to a home in the first place as in land rights. So you have a situation where a building represents the con of pursuing a mortgage paying hundreds of thousands to someone for doing some paperwork. It is then you put someone for free in a apartment it still represents the same thing to them it is much more fundamental if people had option for land in the first place that is going to change things and certainly capital could do that. Once someone is abused it is a lot of healing and being stuck in an unhealthy urban environment is not the answer.</comment>

<comment>People are homeless due to things like drug abuse not "allocation of capital."</comment>

<comment>A pile of pish.  And you cannot pile pish unless you freeze it.  We had Silicon Glen, back in the '80s when it received government subsidies.  Then it moved to Ireland, and then to the far east.  I know, because I jumped from sinking company to sinking company much like Frogger.  Our Universities hot-houses - mare pish that evaporates as steam in the first cold breeze.We still have that wee jobby.  It employs next to noone, does nothing that any other 'Angry Birds' set-up couldn't and will do better, it's a set-up set-up to be bought over by some gullible schmuck.</comment>

<comment>"Edinburgh Napier University" is not to be confused with Edinburgh University.  It's a community college where kids go to learn how to become hairdressers, but with a trumped up name to get more foreign fee-paying students in.It's a university in the same way Perth is a city.  In Australia Perth is a city, in Scotland it's a town with pretensions.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I must say something to that. Edinburgh Napier University is indeed not to be confused with Edinburgh University. They are totally separate.ENU (if I may) is not a community college (what in the UK we call Further Education college). It is a properly-constituted modern university. It has a business school, an engineering school, a school of nursing, a school of computing, etc.At the last national assessment of research quality, our media, cultural and information research was ranked in the top quarter of British universities, ahead of many much older universities. Much other good research work is done at ENU, as well as excellent and accessible teaching.ENU owns and my own campus is based around Merchiston Castle, where the great Scot John Napier invented logarithms in the seventeenth century. He also devised one of the first calculating devices, so he is a father of computing. Thus, while Edinburgh Napier University is a relatively recent invention, it has impressive roots and is performing well.</comment>

<comment>Crivens!  Napier himself went to St Andrews for his education.  Napier College - call it what you want but that's what all the locals call it - didn't even run any decent technical courses.  All the tech Bluechips sent their employees elsewhere for an education - Ferranti for example sent their Edinburgh Students to Jewel and Esk Valley College or Falkirk College or West Lothian College,  Why would they not send their employees to Napier when it is much closer?  Because it was a joke college.  Being named Napier is as sad as a chicken claiming his ancestor was T Rex.  Heriot Watt University in Edinburgh produced some brilliant engineers, still does really good research.  Edinburgh University produces some fine philosophers.  Napier College, nothing so far.</comment>

<comment>The heart of the problem is that more people are falling into economic holes where they cannot afford access to data. Remember the days when you could walk up to a lunch counter pick up a newspaper and read the news while you ate lunch. Now news outlets, large and small, insist that to read the news the customer must have a several hundred dollar subscription while digital access is controlled more efficiently than in days when you could pick-up a newspaper laying on a lunch counter and read it. Many small libraries cannot pay the subscription fees to put the daily rag on a rack for citizens to read. Access to data less is becoming less affordable. Not many ordinary citizens can afford ten or fifteen dollars a hit to buy many of the special Apps that give special access to various types of data. Money is becoming a brick wall to data access which defeats the purpose of the ideal of expansion of knowledge for the creation of a better humanity.</comment>

<comment>"Money is becoming a brick wall to data access which defeats the purpose of the ideal of expansion of knowledge for the creation of a better humanity."Quite literally a 'pay-wall' these days.  The irony is providing access to sharing information is becoming cheaper every year thanks to Moores Law.  There are some real American heroes like Jimmy Wales or Aaron Swartz, but too many people trying to monetise what would better serve humanity if made universally available.</comment>

<comment>I liked the professor's comment that "That’s what the whole socialist movement was about: A way to humanize the factory system, tame industrialization, and make sure it was steered in the direction of human welfare.Now, have we had anything like that in our own era? We haven’t. So there’s an open field."May I suggest for his consideration my new book, A Celebration Society? It offers a new, model societal design that's rooted in sustainable abundance and based on science and technology. The design can be collaboratively simulated, tested, and refined in cyberspace prior to becoming an experiment in the real world.My own knowledge is wide but generally shallow. Fortunately, an increasing number of people with real expertise are prepared to help refine this design and make it real.</comment>

<comment>"My own knowledge is wide but generally shallow."  So is everyone's!  That's a great phrase, shame about the beard.  Do you not have someone who loves you enough to warn you against posting that avatar?"Jonathan Kolber, author of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations: a 21st Century Translation and Commentary."Wouldn't it be nice if everyone who name-checked Adam Smith first was made to read him?  That isn't a dig at you at all, more a snipe at the Adam Smith Institute.  I'm sure they all own first edition copies of the Wealth of Nations, but I can see no evidence from their output that they've ever read it.  Shave off your awful excuse for a beard, or grow it all out, lose the tie and get someone to tousle your hair, then I'll buy your book.  Until then, summarise your argument or be mocked.</comment>

<comment>What an unusual person you are! Please tell me what's wrong with the beard etc. (Too corporate? I don't look that way now. Gives a little privacy. LOL.)I'm afraid it doesn't grow any fuller than that. Much longer, and it looks like Fu Manchu!How interesting to learn what you said about the Institute. They haven't shown any interest in my Smith book.  (Ironically, the one academic I approached for an endorsement, Dr. Gavin Kennedy, was formerly a Director of the Institute...and he thinks well of it!)I'd love to have a thoughtful person who actually read Smith in the original take a crack at my new book. The best critics make the arguments stronger, in my experience. They also are the ones who catch my mistakes!PS--who are you REALLY behind the robot. I know robots aren't that advanced (YET. <g>). Feel free to write me directly at Jonathan@ACelebrationSociety.com, if you wish.</comment>

<comment>I'll maybe write to you, you seem like a good egg, but first you have to update your avatar to loose that awful beard.  It's too something.   I wouldn't say it was a corporate beard per se, although that does fit.   Just too 'shaped' or 'precise' for my taste.  Go for the Fu Manchu look rather than that.  As an economist it is bound to earn you some respect.   I'll ask my local library to buy a copy of your book so I can critique it.  My local library is the National Library here and they are probably sick of me asking for books so if they don't buy it I may email you.  Adam Smith was a top guy, just much misappropriated.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'd rather not be mocked <g>, so here's a summary of the argument which I just posted on Quora (Answering by invitation a question I've been waiting for! Talk about synchronicity...)https://www.quora.com/What-is-...</comment>

<comment>Back in the early '90s I was working for a company that read handwriting.  That built machines that could read human handwriting.  It was interesting work on a difficult problem, or so I thought.I met a useless headbanger in a cinema queue, and she asked me what I was up to.  I enthusiastically explained I was working with intelligent character recognition.She looked me up and down with undisguised contempt, and summarised, "So you are just making the world turn a little faster?"I had to say yes, I was making the world turn a little faster.  I told her it'd be easier if dead weight like her went into orbit.  I added that not only was I making the world spin a little faster, I was also making many idiots like her redundant and irrelevant at an increasing rate.  Not that she'd ever been employed herself.She didn't warm to me.  God knows why, and I did not care.  That's  a lie of course, I utterly enjoyed her contempt.  Her bitterness was sweet.</comment>

<comment>I missed what the point of this was.  Work life balance in the Valley sucks? True. Not everyone is an idealist? True. There's economic inequality? True.  But none of this is news. Just because a philosopher shows up and notices them doesn't make his observation interesting.</comment>

<comment>"I have read [Robert] Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia, and Murray Rothbard’s Ethics of Liberty, and Milton Friedman’s Capitalism and Freedom—I’ve  read it all, and it’s a flawed philosophy. The ultimate value is not liberty: It is justice. Liberty has to fit within the context of social justice. And where it violates justice, I’m afraid justice trumps liberty...":-)</comment>

<comment>I would submit that justice belongs within a pantheon of ultimate societal values. When people lack essentials such as safety, food and water, they will often (not always) sacrifice justice in desperation.When we consider the increasing likelihood that many of us will soon be unemployed and unemployable due to accelerating automation and its handmaiden, technological unemployment, then it behooves us to find a new way to provide for our fellow peoples' needs of both income AND meaning. If this is not to be accomplished via coercive redistribution (I am being descriptive here; not judgmental pro or con), then we need to step outside the box of past systems.In my view, no existing system of societal organization can meet all of the human needs, from lowest to highest on Maslow's hierarchy, because all are rooted in scarcity. We need to start exploring and testing designs based on sustainable abundance.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for all your comments, Jonathan.</comment>
