<comment>Actually, the new Dream Home looks fairly cramped and uncomfortable.  Not enough room to have even two or three friends over.And that three-walled design is going to be hell in the winter.</comment>

<comment>We were holding a benefit for some local artists at our neighborhood bar in San Francisco--this was in the early, mid-'80s, if memory serves. To pull people into the bar I borrowed my daughter's Barbie, stripped her, tied her up and put her in a rusty old birdcage that somebody had found in a debris box. We chained the birdcage to the parking meter outside the bar.The benefit was a big success--lots of folks dropped by to drink, meet some artists, drink, listen to some good live music, and maybe enjoy a chilled adult beverage. Apparently Slave Barbie in all her glory can be an effective marketing device.After the event subsided I cleaned Barbie up and returned her to my kid. These days my granddaughter is approaching Barbie's target demographic. Unfortunately I suspect that my daughter has more progressive toys in mind for my grandchild. Too bad; as an old creep with too much time on my hands my Barbie dreams keep festering. Those Reagan Administration days of miracle and wonder have evolved. We need Barbie more than ever now.</comment>
