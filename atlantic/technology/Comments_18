<comment>I am now using a DVD player to play compact discs. It lacked progressive scan, so it was obsolete even in the latter part of the DVD era.Now how do I save the sound of 30-year-old recorded CDs?</comment>

<comment>Rip them and encode them as lossless (if you have vast amounts of storage space) or high bitrate (256kbit is good) MP3's.</comment>

<comment>Don't use MP3s, you'll lose information which you can never recover.And hard drives are so cheap these days - you can get around 2,500 CDs encoded as FLAC onto a 1TB drive.</comment>

<comment>Can you really distinguish differences at these way over-sampled bit rates?  Is Nyquist a liar?</comment>

<comment>Copy the raw AIFF files from the CD to a hard drive. Some PCs will automatically rename the files using CDDB - Macs do this, don't know about Windows 8. This is the highest possible quality copy of the data.You can then rip to Lossless or MP3 for playing if you want, as the AIFF files are a bit big for a portable device.</comment>

<comment>I was thinking of trying disc images. </comment>

<comment>IMHO, disc images are probably the best choice. They would let you create an identical CD at a much later date, and likely work with future technologies, too. Unfortunately, disc images are beyond the scope of the average user without some modest research or training and software. I have a root folder named Images just for this purpose.</comment>

<comment>Easy CD-Da extractor...</comment>

<comment>And the disappearance of CD players is just as significant as the failure of CDs. "Quite often, [preservation] is being cast as a separation of physical and digital, whereas in fact the whole concept is the same. Even digital is still played on a physical medium." http://goo.gl/3GY9Lm</comment>

<comment>Which is another reason why people like me multiply convert and also keep all the original media, including LP's, 45's, and 78's.  Have to respect the source materials.  (BTW, that includes paper media as well.)</comment>

<comment>The source material is the master at the record company.  Your 45s are an imperfect copy.</comment>

<comment>That assumes that the source material still exists: I can tell you from my research that often they do not.  This covers not only 78 matrices, but also the LP (and presumably 45) matrices, and even tapes of same (tape didn't become a common medium for preservation until after WW2 and many tapes have degraded such that it is a challenge to get anything from them.)  The same pertains to videotapes of early TV shows, or even later TV shows, to say nothing of film.Over the years, for example, I have kept recordings of audio and visual materials and I find that in some cases my copies are superior to what is being sold commercially.  It shouldn't be that way, but it is; you over-estimate the willingness of recording companies (of any kind) to maintain their archives, especially after bankruptcy, mergers, etc.I can think of two examples right off the bat.  Recent Beatles reissues have attempted to recreate the sound as the recordings were experienced in the early '60's in the US.  And yet, some of those versions, done quickly for commercial reasons, have never been reissued in the original format because that original format no longer exists.  In another case, a record company active in the 1960's lost all of its recordings (which had been made on film) and thus there are no masters remaining: the best you can do is look for pristine vinyl and dub them yourself (the original metal stampers were long since melted down.) There are many other examples.</comment>

<comment>Easiest way to save your CD  collection is also the easiest way to access them.  Namely:Get some software to rip all of the sound files from every CD you own and save it in *.wav format, which, as I understand it, is basically lossless (that is, you don't lose sound quality.)To put this in perspective, a 2 TB external hard drive will hold the entire contents of approximately 2,500 to 4,000 CD's (depending on genre and how full the CD's are.)Once you have converted all of your CD's to *.wav files that are instantly accessible via your computer with zero shuffling around, then convert all of the *.wav files to MP3. You can easily put several thousand CD's onto a single external hard drive of about 500 Gigs that you can then hook up to your car.You can do this for thousands of commercial CD's, but also for the hundreds of self made CD's you put together, either from LP's or what have you.</comment>

<comment>Yes, .wav files are good as you loose no sound quality.  But FLAC files are better.  FLAC is an open source format.  It saves about half the space which may not be important now.  What is important is meta-data of the music.  FLAC is better at holding album covers, song titles, artist info and a few other things.FLAC is lossless compression which means it uncompresses to bit for bit identical files of the original.  Plenty of ripping software can access online databases to fill in the metadata as you rip the CD automatically.Of course once on a hard drive or SSD, you need some backups.And I would also comment that having kept CD's indoors on a shelf where they face no temperature extremes or humidity I have lost zero CD's to aging effects. I have CD's going all the way back to the initial releases in the early 1980's.  CD-R's and CD-RW's however are all over the map.  Some have been around a long time and some died within 5 years.   Oddly I have had better luck with CD-RW's. Worst luck with DVD-R's.  Slightly better with DVD-RW's though neither are as good as CD-RW's.  </comment>

<comment>And even if you have your music on a hard drive and backed up, there is something called bit rot. Basically, because data on hard drives is so packed in, it is susceptible to background radiation and such randomly flipping a bit every so often. So, your file get corrupted, then backed up, then you no longer have the file. A cd or DVD is still better than a hard drive for archive purposes.</comment>

<comment>"The notion long favored among hackers that cosmic rays are among the causes of such events turns out to be a myth"From the Slang Dictionary definition of Bit Rot.You seem to be operating in total ignorance of EDAC schemes which are very sophisticated and can recover data which has suffered numerous errors.Overall in the long (and medium) term it is much cheaper and much less effort to back up onto multiple hard drives, replacing each one as it starts to fail.</comment>

<comment>Hard drive bitrot is hardly a myth.  There are a ton of articles that discuss the problem in depth and especially how it relates to RAID setups (e.g., http://arstechnica.com/informa... ).  Beyond that, the use of hard drives is certainly easier, but might not be cheaper when you consider the NAS cost, hard drive cost, hard drive replacement, yearly electricity, etc. vs. the relatively cheap cost of writable blurays.  I believe Bluray cost is about $.02/Gb for discs while hard drive cost is about $10-25/Gb.</comment>

<comment>Hard drives haven't cost $10/Gb in a long long long time. You can right now purchase a 4TB drive from amazon fro $153.99, that's 3.85c/Gb. A 25-pack of writeable Blu-Ray discs is $22.99, or 91.96c/disc. Each disc can hold 25Gb, so 3.68c/Gb. Are you arguing that hard drive bit rot is a way more widespread problem? Or are you trying to use your seventeen hundredths of a cent savings per gigabyte to justify your personal backup system? If you are super concerned with cost/Gb, use 3TB drives, 3.55c/Gb, cheaper than your blu-ray system by thirteen hundredths of a cent.</comment>

<comment>I personally don't care about cost BR is impractical.  The previous comment brought that up.  I use a raid system that is backed up by a WHS.  My main point is that bitrot exists and is something to be aware of, especially when using RAID, since one flipped bit can cause a RAID 5 rebuild to fail.  Most consumer NASs, such as Synology, do not have any mechanism to error check for this, except for occasionally scrubbing healthy drives to correct parity.</comment>

<comment>a 4TB hard drive costs roughly $150 here in Canada, which is $0.0375 per GB. You can't count HD electricity use etc. without also counting electricity use for reading discs, as an optical drive usually uses well over double the wattage of a hard drive. I am truly not sure where you get the absurd $10 per GB number as it has been many a year since hard drive storage cost nearly that amount.Now, take into consideration the time it takes you to shuffle each disc around, and the effort and money that goes into setting up a physical storage space, and the inability to access info from more than one disc at a time without having multiple disc drives. And oh man, the time to rip each disc, break it down into 25GB or 50GB chunks, and then burn it? Ouch.Now consider with the hard drive, you can have a single big media library accessible by all of your electronic devices any time you like without having to consider moving discs around. You can sort your whole library, make playlists, etc. etc. all not possible without re-ripping data from the discs.</comment>

<comment>I agree about FLAC files, but I've noticed that they are often only about 1/3 smaller than a WAV. Do you use foobar2000 as a media player? I love how you can add extensions like Dolby Headphone Surround to it in combination with other extensions like a mixer or equalizer and it plays nearly every format.</comment>

<comment>I have just been listening to a  thirty-year-old compact disc... and it still sounds good. Backup makes sense in the event that I must move to a smaller living area.</comment>

<comment>in my spare time.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget to replace the hard drive every 5 years or so. Sometimes sooner depending on the brands nowadays. I guess by this article's logic HDD's have a fraction of the lifespan of CD's...and they're usually kept in temperature-controlled areas and especially not handled or shaken around.</comment>

<comment>Wav is the worst. AIFF is lossless.</comment>

<comment>The longevity of a magnetic Hard Disk Drive is not better than the one of a CD, and the same is true for the Solid State technology such as Flash and SSD Drives, for instance, background radiation, cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts can destroy the information stored on a solid state memory device in less than a decade.The solution may very well be in crystal holography, 3D storage of information in crystal lattices, hopefully provided in the near future by the significant advances in nanotechnology we are beginning to experience. Redundant algorithms and quantum computation techniques may add up to, combined, provide some long lasting (hundreds or thousands of years) storage.Until then, we are condemned to hop annoyingly between ephemeral storage methods with our beloved digital content. Cloud storage may fall short of the stability demands too, given deep enough perspective on the long term stability of such kind of services...</comment>

<comment>So use a RAID array. </comment>

<comment>Adding redundancy to the equation (provided that RAID is used that way, and not to improve performance solely), does not solve the problem of longevity. The life expectancy of a device, is expressed statistically in terms of its MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), and adding redundancy does not improve dramatically the MTBF, actually, it may not even improve it at all, it just prevents early failures, but assuming that the RAID array is composed of equal MTBF components, eventually even the backup devices will fail within the MTBF window, and that lifespan will not exceed one or one and a half decade at best, with magnetic or even solid state disk drives.</comment>

<comment>You are missing the point. I recall that I have lost one hard disk in the last 20 years, due to hardware failure. (I threw out a few others that were too small.) I did not lose any data from it, because every hard disk I own is backed up once a month to some other hard disk, either removable or in another computer. The backup programs run automatically. There is no chance I will lose more than a few days of data from the failure of a single disk. I would have to lose 5 disks, including removable ones, two stored off site, plus the cloud servers disk for important data. The chances of that happening are zero in any scenario short of nuclear war.Hard disk data is FAR MORE robust than any previous type, including all forms of paper data. You can always lose paper to a fire or flood.I have not lost any important data since the 1980s. I have often accidentally erased or overwritten files, but I never lost anything.I have checked for copy errors and long term drift, by comparing files backed up years ago. I found none.</comment>

<comment>Some math on newer array configurations:http://www.oracle.com/technetw...</comment>

<comment>I said "backed up once a month." I meant at least once a month. Anything in a current work folder is backed up every morning and afternoon, or before I start in making lots of changes.The main reason I back up twice a day is because I sometimes want to look at a version of a document from yesterday or a week ago. I don't worry about hardware failures any more. They are extremely rare, and I am immune in any case.They have programs that watch your disk and copy anything that changes. I found that defeats the purpose. 99.9% of the time, I want to go back to the old version because I screwed up. I made things worse, and I want to toss out all changes and go back to yesterday's version. So, I don't want it overwritten every few minutes.</comment>

<comment>If there's a fire, your disk drives will be destroyed with the paper. If the room with your drives is flooded, you drives will get damaged too. The paper though, may be dried and still functional. So fire and flood require an offsite backup and aren't a reason to choose hard drives over paper. Hard drives give the illusion of safety, which you seem to realize, as you have a proper backup regimen. </comment>

<comment>You wrote: "The paper though, may be dried and still functional."Probably not though. Plus, I have paper files from the 1970s that are unreadable."So fire and flood require an offsite backup and aren't a reason to choose hard drives over paper."If it is really important, paper should be copied and stored offsite too. But that costs a lot of money whereas it costs nothing to make a removable backup disk and put it in another site. I can put every document and photo I ever made in several places offsite at no cost. It is 0.5 TB. There is no way paper can ever approach that level of security. It would cost tens of thousands of dollars to do that with my files, and it would fill ~5 file cabinets. (I used to have that many. I scanned the documents and trashed most of the paper years ago.)"Hard drives give the illusion of safety . . ."I would say paper gives the illusion of longevity. Not to mention the fact that you can't find paper documents, whereas the X1 program lets me find anything I have written since 1978.Individual electronic copies are fragile. They can be destroyed with a static electricity discharge or a fire that paper would survive. However, electronic copies backed up in multiple locations and in the cloud are the most reliable form of data storage yet invented.In the near future, I expect DNA storage of computer data will be perfected. A prof. at Harvard is working on this, as are some other people. All of the data in the world would fit in 6 ml of DNA, and DNA can be preserved for hundreds of thousands of years. So that will solve the long-term data storage problem for a long time to come.At present, there are more bytes of data on hard disks than there are grains of sand on all the beaches of the earth, according to the NHK.</comment>

<comment>I have paper files from last week that are unreadable.  Penmanship counts.</comment>

<comment>"Probably not"I've had minor basement floods and as long as the paper is not too wet and can be properly aired out, paper can survive a flood.And if you can keep paper dry, and away from fire, it's longevity is unmatched. I have many books at home published between 1865 and 1900. All are readable. Bindings need replacing on some of these, but their info is fine. No hard drive, or any magnetic media will last even in optimal storage for that long.And off site storage isn't free. You have the cost of extra drives, and someone is paying for that other location that you're freeloading off of if you're not paying to use the storage.</comment>

<comment>You wrote: "No hard drive, or any magnetic media will last even in optimal storage for that long."There are several things wrong with that statement:1. You do not know how long magnetic media will last. No one does. There is no doubt that some of it has lasted 60 years. The MTBF for hard disks is 130 years, but that can only be measured with large numbers of hard disks.2. Magnetic media is likely to improve. Other digital media will be invented. Researchers are making progress with digital storage in DNA. That will last for hundreds of thousands of years. It *has* lasted that long, in some instances.3. The longevity of the medium does not limit the longevity of the data. The material in the brain cells in your body is all new. There is not one molecule that was there 10 years ago. Yet memories and skills remain from decades before that. As long as the data is copied from one disk to another it will last indefinitely. For your personal data, this copying process now must be done by you, or your children, but in the near future it will be made fully automatic. It will be built in to the computer."And off site storage isn't free. You have the cost of extra drives . . ."The cost of computer data storage is between 100,000 times and a million times cheaper than paper. Disk cost about $50 per terabyte, which is roughly equivalent to 1 million books at $5 each, with a megabyte of print in each book. If you print books or stacks of paper yourself, it costs much more than $5 per megabyte.So, if we are talking about costs, computer storage is way better. Plus it is getting cheaper rapidly. With DNA storage it will cost essentially nothing. All of the data in the world will fit in 6 ml of DNA.</comment>

<comment>My understanding of paleontology is that DNA doesn't last much more than 10,000 years in a useful form, but burial isn't optimal storage.What magnetic material from the 1950s is still readable?Open reels that have been well kept from the late 60s and 70s are degraded now to the point that you may be lucky to get one play out of them without serious dropouts. This I've heard from frustrated reel owners.  One was carping that cassettes from the 1970s are surviving better than the reels.Just so we're on the same page I understand that digital storage is generally better than paper. I only object to your extreme view that you can guarantee data survival easily with digital.  You can't. Keeping offsite backups current is time consuming, and the week you forget is the day your house gets hit by lightning.  RAID is not a failsafe either.  It only protects against limited drive failure, but not data corruption. Any RAID guide worth it's salt will tell you that RAID is not a backup solution. </comment>

<comment>"My understanding of paleontology is that DNA doesn't last much more than 10,000 years in a useful form, but burial isn't optimal storage."The people at Harvard (Church et al.) say they have samples 100,000 years old that are intact. I wouldn't know. Anyway, you can make backup copies easily. And rapidly. Church wrote his own biology textbook into DNA and then copied it 70 billion times, making it -- he said -- the most reprinted biology book in history.They estimate the theoretical lifetime of DNA storage is 3.5 billion years."What magnetic material from the 1950s is still readable?"Mag tapes at the Census Bureau and elsewhere. As of a few years ago they were intact. Data tapes, not music.Keeping backups offsite is not time consuming if you regularly go to the offsite site for other reasons anyway. For example, keeping a personal backup in your house and your mother's house, or your house and the office.</comment>

<comment>Suggested place for a back-up of a back-up: a bank safety-deposit box.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you are buying a better grade of hard disk.  I've had probably 15 tp 25% of my drives (on multiple computers, some are external) fail before the three year point.</comment>

<comment>Precisely!Your experience mirror my own exactly.</comment>

<comment>I do not know the longevity of a CD, but I have some hard disk drives that have been running fine since the 1990s. More important, they are all backed up to multiple other removable hard disks, and/or to the cloud. The chances that I will lose data to hardware failure are very small. The MTBF for one particular hard disk is not the limiting factor.You can back up hard disks more easily than CDs or other media.</comment>

<comment>True that, actually, I have also a "backup mindset" regarding the storage of all my data. But the issue I was tackling with my reasoning was the fact that it is annoying to have to depend on backups and backups of backups because the current storage solutions are not optimally adjusted to our own lifespans as living biological entities, and at a certain point, the promise of having a quasi perpetual storage (at least in our limited perception of what is perpetual) system seemed easy to fulfill with optical media. It turns out it wasn't fulfilled at all.</comment>

<comment>I see it as just another kind of maintenance, like cleaning a house or checking up on a car. It is slightly annoying but its just a routine.</comment>

<comment>I never trusted optical media. I had some bad experiences with the early CDs, and quickly abandoned them for networked hard disks and removable hard disks.I have been backing up data since the days of the reel-to-reel computer tapes, like the ones shown in "Apollo 13." Actually, those things were fast and reliable! But I never trust anything recorded in only one place. I have backup software that works automatically, and I periodically run compare programs to be sure there is no drift in the data.</comment>

<comment>I recommend you use automatic backup programs. Yes, you have to "depend" on backups, but it should not take any of your time. You should not have to think about it except maybe once every month or two. That is how often I cycle two removable disk to an off-site location.I have compressed backups and also complete, file-by-file copies of disks.</comment>

<comment>Eh, I have just the opposite experience. I have plenty of CDs from the late 1980s that still work.I don't think I've ever had a hard drive last longer than 4 years -- this includes both internal and external.I'm so paranoid about hard drive failure that I back everything up to both an external drive and Backblaze -- and data on external drives have their own backup drive.</comment>

<comment>If your hard disks do not last longer than 4 years, you need to check your computer power supplies, or get a good UPS and surge protector. My office is just down the street from an airport control tower that gets hit by lightening often. Power surges fried two computers and a UPS before I bought a really good UPS.The MTBF for hard disks is a million hours; 130 years. So you should only be losing one a year if you run 130 of them.</comment>

<comment>3 to 4 years is not that unusual.1. Moving a laptop around while the hard disc is still spinning damages them -- we all do it when we're in a rush, close and pack our computers before the driving as fully turned off or gone into sleep mode.2. External drives used for backing up data are regularly spinning. Time Machine, for example, runs every hour. And early this year, Backblaze released a study of the drives it uses finding that the average life ranges from only 1.5 to 2.5 years (of course they're spinning them 24/7).I suspect most people don't notice how short hard drive lifetimes are because they replace their computer around the 4 year mark, and probably external drives even sooner (because they decline in price so fast).And I replace my external drives as soon as I can hear the warning signs of failure.</comment>

<comment>As you say, older disks were not supposed to be moved. The ones they make for laptops are supposedly shock proof. I try to not move laptops. The one I have now has only an SSD.I don't use external drives for things like Time Machine. I use a networked drive. The external ones are not cooled properly, in my experience. If you leave yours on all the time, that would explain why they only last 4 years. I turn 'em off and unplug 'em, to prevent power surges from clobbering them.I have computers a lot older than 4 years with hard disks intact, plus some hard disks older than the oldest computer. They are in computers and used strictly for backup. When I trash a computer I always put the hard disk in a caddy or in a static proof bag as a backup.The best kind of external drive is connected with e-Sata instead of USB. I don't see e-Sata equipment much these days but I have several caddies and flat cable extenders on the back of computers. An e-Sata caddy drive runs at the same speed as an internal disk, but it lives on the shelf where the power company cannot hurt it. (The power at my office is awful!)</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that happened to me.   I happened to just brush the external drive while it was writing, and the whole thing gave up the ghost.  I asked my local computer store and they said they could send it to a specialist repair shop but that they sometimes charged up to $900.   Eurgh.</comment>

<comment>That's why I'm so paranoid and have all my externals (not used for backing up data) clone to another external, and then do a double backup of everything to Backblaze. If something catastrophic ever happens and I lose both my primary HD and the backup, I'll just pay Backblaze $190 to ship me my backed up data on a 3 TB drive.</comment>

<comment>Thank God for Moore's law. The precious info you saved on a diskette 20 years ago was a hassle to back-up, as was the data on the CD, and the DVD, and on your 20GB HD from 2001. But it's so easy to back that data again now because the volume is so puny.</comment>

<comment>I look forward to storing all my data on tiny data cubes. ;)</comment>

<comment>Cough cough, records. Can't be beat. </comment>

<comment>So back up the backup.</comment>

<comment>As someone who has kept dozens of CDs in his car over multiple summer-winter cycles, I find this article suspect.  The only CDs that have I have ruined are the couple that have had other plastic materials melt onto them.  I doubt that even in the hottest conditions, my car achieves the 175-degree test conditions used by the researchers.  And yes, my collection dates as far back as 1988 and includes some home-burned compilations.  Those CDs are likely to outlive me, and I hope to hang on for another 40+ years.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I have no idea what they are talking about. I've been listening to cds since the 90s and the only ones I can't play anymore are the ones I've scratched up.</comment>

<comment>they are talking about cds from the 80s and some of the crap cd-r brands that barely worked on a good day, like a memorex</comment>

<comment>What CDs from the 80s? We were using cassettes. I'm pretty sure cd-rs didnt even come out til the 90s.</comment>

<comment>If you could afford them, CDs and CD players were available in the late 80s. Most people still used tapes, but not everyone. CD-Rs didn't come along until the 90s. I remember buying a fairly cheap Memorex CD burner for $200 around 1996.As it pertains to the article, I still have CDs burned from that old Memorex, which wasn't the best quality burner at the time ($200 was really cheap, the market was still around $600 for most models). Guess I need to dig them out and see how they're doing.</comment>

<comment>How quickly they forget!The launch of the CD:autumn 1982 - Japanspring 1983 - Europeautumn 1983 - North AmericaCD players were expensive at launch, but rapidly dropped in price.</comment>

<comment>they mentioned 1987's Earthbeat CD.   the article is explaining how the oldest professionally produced CDs are falling apart which explains to us all that, no matter how well we've handled our discs, they're all going to the crapper.we've always known cd-rs were crap</comment>

<comment>I did a google search to refresh my memory. CD-Rs didn't come on the market until 1991. The CD-R recorders available at the time were insanely expensive. It didn't become practical for people to record music on a cd until the cd-rom became standard with computers in the mid 90s. Pretty much lines up with what I remember from my childhood. I was recording tunes on cassette tapes until then.</comment>

<comment>You should back up the CDs anyways, CDs and magnetic tapes were never supposed to last more than 30 years.</comment>

<comment>Even in the heat of Miami, I have some old CD's that still play decades later, and I've had newer ones that deteriorated prematurely. It seems to depend on the quality of the disk, and the dyes used. Really early CD's had a layer of metal evaporated onto the substrate. Those are the absolute best I ever used, but now, all CD's and DVD's use organic dyes that are subject to deterioration. My collection is as old (or older) than yours, and the Florida summer heat I'll match up to the heat anywhere.</comment>

<comment>I would suppose that most of whatever has been put on CDs is available as digital files, and digital files have almost no limits to their life, so long as the stuff gets backed up and/or copied as necessary.My prerecorded CDs, the oldest of which go back to about 1986 or 1987, still seem to be in generally good shape.  A few have suffered disc rot, where they've lost the reflective layer in little spots, but most appear to be completely intact.  I'm not sure about the ones that lived in my car for the last number of years, though.  I'm now using a USB drive in my new car, so no more CDs in the car for me.</comment>

<comment>A 1963 Blue Note copy of Jimmy Smith's "Back At The Chicken Shack" shows no wear at all played on a high end turntable.  Vinyl is very very stable, and older pressings have outlived the master taped used to make them. </comment>

<comment>Uhh ... congratulations?Really I don't know what this has to do with the issue at hand.</comment>

<comment>I think he is explaining why a lot of serious collectors maintain large vinyl collections.  It is by far the most durable medium for sound recordings.</comment>

<comment>Digital sound recordings saved on multiple hard disks and on the cloud are probably more durable than vinyl disks.</comment>

<comment>I would like to agree  with you, given the evolution of my own saved audio collection.  And I note from your other comments that you also like me save all materials in multiple configurations (although my hard disk save rate is not as good as yours.)But let's face it: we are depending on multiple save sites (because of potential failure), an outside infrastructure (cloud), and an over-arching architecture (electricity.)By contrast, analog recordings from Edison cylinders up through DMM LP's are actual physical sculptures of sound, and furthermore, the reproduction of that sound can be purely mechanical and doesn't even require electricity (speaking as someone who used to experiment with lazy susans, various pointy objects as styluses, and pie pans and aluminum foil as sound horns decades ago: sound was lo fi, but audible and satisfying.)  So, not to be overly conservative, vinyl on balance is still best (plus, it will survive that nuclear war, too. ;-))</comment>

<comment>We do not "depend" on electricity to preserve the data. When the electricity fails, the data is inaccessible for while but it is not lost.Years ago, hard disk data was sometimes scrambled at the moment the power failed, but that seldom happens these days.</comment>

<comment>Yes and no.  An LP can sit on a shelf, ignored, for a generation.  A digital recording requires this constant maintenance to keep it viable.Or do you hear of someone finding a parent or grandparent's digital file and resurrecting it.  Humans naturally will forget to or be lax in maintaining things.  An analog LP is somewhat resilient to this neglect.  </comment>

<comment>It does not require constant maintenance. I have 20-year-old removable hard disks that are completely readable. I have not maintained them at all. I just left them on the shelf. I have documents and e-mail from the 1980s that are completely readable, in plain ASCII.</comment>

<comment>Some external hard drives fail if you let them sit for long periods of time without using them-- it happened to me. I've had about three external hard disks fail through no fault of my own. Never owned a record that "failed" on its own.</comment>

<comment>You never dropped a record? You never scratched one? You never played one too many times, or had a bad needle that destroyed it? I did.People remember old technology with fondness, forgetting its faults. If you were forced to go back to LP records today, or to 78s, you would probably find them intolerable and all too easy to destroy.</comment>

<comment>Maybe I wasn't being clear enough. I meant that I've never had a record "fail" as a result of it sitting on a shelf-untouched for a length of time. I've had three external hard drives fail after sitting in drawers for length of time.and btw, i have a huge vinyl record collection. they are incredibly durable. far more durable than CDs. My favorite aspect of vinyl's durability is the fact that you can have varying degrees of "damage" to a record, but it still functions, where as when a CD gets a defect, you can't play it at all.</comment>

<comment>Well, if you do not play a record or read data off a disk, it does not serve much of a purpose.I suppose the disk was destroyed by static discharge when you first removed it from the drawer. I doubt it failed on its own sometime when it was unpowered and untouched.No one argues that individual hard disks are robust. The MTTF may be a million hours, but they are fragile and they can fail catastrophically. They are more fragile than paper or LP records. They sometimes seem to me like like writing on soap bubbles. However, the ability to duplicate them quickly and automatically, or to back them up to the cloud, makes them far more trustworthy than any previous method of storing data. When backups are done correctly data preservation is orders of magnitude more reliable than any other method, even though the medium is not as reliable in some ways.You have to separate out the reliability of content preservation and the reliability of media. The two are completely separate qualities with computer storage. They were not separate with previous methods of preserving data.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. And there seem to be two conversations going on here as well. One about data preservation and one about mediums for playing music.The disks seemed to suffer from mechanical malfunction though, with weird clicks and stuff emanating from their boxes. I may have just been very unlucky and purchased a string of duds, but I don't really trust external hard drives for data storage anymore. I mean, I still USE them, but I have two running and they are mirrored.As far as music mediums, I'm not going to argue one over the other, because they are heavily subjective.</comment>

<comment>". . . where as when a CD gets a defect, you can't play it at all."That is incorrect. Audio CDs have extensive error correction and redundancy built in. You can scratch right across one and it will still play. I saw a demonstration of that when they first came out. That was a major selling point.I don't know about data CDs or DVDs.I do not trust writable DVDs. I do not trust any computer storage medium I can see or touch. I am from the mag-tape, floppy, and removable hard disk error. Brrrrrrr. If you think computers are unreliable now, you should have seen them in 1975.</comment>

<comment>I don't really care what kind of error correction redundancy is built into CDs. When a CD has a scratch bad enough to effect it, you can't listen to that track AT ALL. It glitches and quits. I have had countless CDs do this over the years (who hasn't?). Records with similar damage will keep playing. I have records that are CRACKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH on one side that still play from start to finish without skipping or popping! You cannot say the same of CDs, that's for sure.I will say that records are far more vulnerable to heat and humidity than CDs are. Although CDs can still be destroyed by sitting in a hot car over an entire summer, records will be destroyed sitting in a hot car for minutes..</comment>

<comment>"Audio CDs have extensive error correction and redundancy built in. You can scratch right across one and it will still play. I saw a demonstration of that when they first came out. That was a major selling point.I don't know about data CDs or DVDs."Unfortunately, I do. It doesn't take much to make a DVD, or a large section of one, irretrievably unplayable. I handle mine very delicately, by the edge only, because even a finger-smudge can screw them up (though in that case you can--sometimes--fix the problem by wiping them clean). I have a DVD-by-mail Netflix subscription, and this problem has come up a number of times (though Netflix is good about sending replacements).</comment>

<comment>Vinyl can't be wiped out by EM fields. So I'd have to hand the win on this subject to chicken.</comment>

<comment>"Vinyl can't be wiped out by EM fields So I'd have to hand the win on this subject to chicken."And computer data stored in multiple locations cannot be wiped out by ANYTHING. So I win.We are not talking about the media here. We are talking about the content. One cell in your body can easily be wiped out. Every cell is replaced in a few years. But the data they contain in their DNA is intact, and the memories stored in your brain are mostly intact. The media is fragile but the data is robust.When you compare 1 vinyl record to 1 hard disk, yes, the vinyl is more robust. But that comparison makes no sense. You have to compare 1 vinyl record to the Googleplex, or to my 6 backup disks in two locations.</comment>

<comment>"]And computer data stored in multiple locations cannot be wiped out by ANYTHING."Depends. The right sort of natural disaster (see "Carrington Event") might do it.</comment>

<comment>I think it just goes to show how inventions and decisions that are older than most of us aren't obsolete just because we grew up taking them for granted</comment>

<comment>So you're saying that you have a functioning Rek-O-Kut machine and that you back up all your modern music files on vinyl?</comment>

<comment>A Rek-o-cut is a brand, most often for playback.  A record lathe is what you're thinking of, te best ones by Scully. </comment>

<comment>It appears that in the future it will be easier to play music recorded in the 1890s that music recorded in the 1990s.</comment>

<comment>A lot of the more recent inventions and decisions say more about our increasing need for instant gratification and less about the long term ramifications of said inventions and decisions</comment>

<comment>In the 1970s there was a lot of handwringing discussions about obsolete computer data formats, such as Census Bureau tapes that could no longer be read. (That particular example was apocryphal, I believe.) People said that formats and playback equipment was changing so quickly, computer data was ephemeral. There were plans to print out all important data.You do not hear those discussions much any more -- for a good reason. Think about graphic images. In 1980 there were probably a few million images in various computer formats. They were mostly unimportant things like advertisements being assembled in primitive page layout programs such as Rage Maker. Today, there are trillions of images in the .jpg format, and any one of them can be read by hundreds of thousands of programs, no matter how old the .jpg image is. The .jpg standard may become obsolete sometime in the next 100 years, but there is no way programmers are going to forget the .jpg format algorithms. Programs will probably be able to read it thousands of years in the future. Furthermore, computers are getting smarter and faster, and they will "know" how to convert to a more modern format.People were willing to abandon a few million unimportant images in 1980. They are not going to abandon just about every photo taken after 2000.Furthermore, multiple backups of images and other data ensure that it survives far longer than the individual hard disks it is recorded on.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  Available backup space has exploded and cost per terabyte has collapsed.  Short of nuclear war, the only reason data is lost nowadays is because somebody didn't back it up thoroughly.</comment>

<comment>Or perhaps a modern-day Carrington Event will wipe it all. Or certain material simply won't get backed up enough because the audience for it is too small.</comment>

<comment>When I was in Peace Corps and lived in the jungle, back at the turn of the century, my CDs were completely destroyed by the environment.  I got back just in time for the RIAA lawsuits and so my music collection has never recovered.</comment>

<comment>Utter nonsense!</comment>

<comment>I guess new bands will sell mini external hard drives or download cards at shows. People sure as hell don't buy em off band camp anymore. You win iTunes</comment>

<comment>Everything dies baby that's a factBut maybe everything that dies someday comes back</comment>

<comment>That's only true in Atlantic City.</comment>

<comment>Individuals can copy their CDs to hard drives or similar technology, but what would a library do?  A library can lend a physical CD, but how can it lend a file?  Would library music sections be replaced by private services, like YouTube?  Will those who have no internet be excluded from borrowing music?</comment>

<comment>Files ripped from one CD can be burned to another CD.</comment>

<comment>Is it legal to replace a copyrighted CD with a self-made copy?</comment>

<comment>I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding is that the answer is 'yes,' as long as it's for personal use, you can make a copy- just as you can make a backup of software in case the original disk gets damaged.</comment>

<comment>The question is also how would a library lend items without a physical medium, e.g. when CDs, become obsolete.</comment>

<comment>Libraries are already doing this and have been for years. They loan ebooks, which are files downloaded onto devices, as well as mp3's. You need a device and a library card, but that's usually it. Digital rights management is used to have some degree of control over the files and how they can be used. Increasingly, it's not about "owning" material, but licensing it. Libraries lend pdf copies of articles to each other as well, but there are rules about how they can be used. (Usually, the file needs to be destroyed and/or can't be widely distributed. Of course, there's also not a good way to tell waht a person does with the file after they have a copy.)As for your question about CDs, I believe it's only legal to copy CDs you yourself own (the idea being you can create your own back up copy).</comment>

<comment>The old CDR's barely worked when they were new. I've had a horrible time ripping them to iTunes after many years of sitting on a shelf. The ones I stuck labels on have fared worse than the ones I wrote right on. I always assumed the label messed up the rotation of the disc as it played somehow. I've never had a factory-pressed CD fail, but then again, I never abused mine.The bigger risk in terms of losing music is the move to streaming services, which essentially outsources the storage of music. One never knows how they will preserve things, or even if they will, if the streaming service goes out of business or if a song goes long enough without ever being requested.Fortunately, we have music nerds who will keep copies of music in seeming defiance of common sense. They preserved all the oddball folk records made in the late 20's in spite of most of the old records going into WWII material drives. But even music nerds seldom appreciate the music right as it is released. So it has to sit around by accident, waiting to be discovered. The streaming services are the enemies of this process.</comment>

<comment>Not sure I'm buying this!  I still have and it still plays just fine, my very first CD from about 1986 Rush "Tom Sawyer".  As far as I can tell my entire CD library all still play just fine.</comment>

<comment>Sounds alot like what happened to my old 8-track collection.</comment>

<comment>Why not simply digitize the discs?</comment>

<comment>Even if the Library of Congress decided to digitize every CD in their collection (a huge undertaking, since they have the largest collection of sound recordings in the world), they would still want to preserve the original. It's important to know how to maintain that collection as long as possible, so they need to know the different sorts of conditions that can kill CDs.</comment>

<comment>Nitrogen atmosphere, in a freezer. That should stop the aluminum from oxidizing.</comment>

<comment>I have old music CDs that I bought in late the '90s and early 2000s sitting on a shelf in my basement collecting dust.  I don't know if keep CDs standing up instead of laying down is any better</comment>

<comment>If they are in their jewel cases, then it doesn't matter. Otherwise, stand them up to keep the pressure off them.</comment>

<comment>Just wait until a solar flare comes and deletes everything we own lol.</comment>

<comment>I thought CDs would last for decades... Noooo, my early Beatles set.......</comment>

<comment>There's a similar deterioration problem with reel-to-reel audio tape from the 1970s and '80s -- including the high quality "name" brands. A sound engineer told me he often must heat old tapes in the oven for a while to keep them from turning to powder before playing them for transfer.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the oxide that captures the signal will literally strip from the tape that it is coated onto.  This has been a recognized problem in tape preservation for awhile, and it retarded the conversion of a lot of recordings from the early part of the 20th Century too.  What happened is that the original wax matrices (which had the original signal) were then taped beginning late '40's, then the matrices were tossed, then the tapes degraded, then ..... you got nothing.The way they got around it was by the painstaking method you described plus steps forward in converting the vinyl signal.I have seen degradation of cassettes from the 1970's.  The problem seems less one of stripping than howling.  This involves treating the tape inch by inch with lubricant.  Well, it worked for me.  Eventually.</comment>

<comment>Your "inch-by-inch" reminded me of something else. This same engineer told me he frequently must sit there and touch the tape every few seconds, to discharge static that would mess up the transfer. Sheesh!</comment>

<comment>Thats why there is something called MILLENIATA folks, it will keep your files, music and photos for over 1,000 years.  Check them out at http://m-disc.com to learn more, if Congress would only pick up on their technology and not retest what archival and Naval libraries have already tested and proven... The individual use of CD's will continue to decrease but for an archival purpose hard disc drives are still more reliable than what's available (Cloud, SaaS products/ideas etc.).  Sony is developing tape that can store terabytes of information which is still vulnerable to data degradation but will last longer than the typical CD.  Anyways read more about Millenniata they along with LG, Panasonic, HP are already tackling this problem but apparently Congress would rather waste their own money and time on research then hop on what's already been proven.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that just another optical disc with a fancy coating?</comment>

<comment>hold on to your cds!  25 years from now theyll be cool again.  just like records.</comment>

<comment>25 years from now they won't play. Unlike records.</comment>

<comment>i dont believe that.  this seems a little overblown.  you mean to tell me that my cds from the 90s-00s wont play but my dads doo-wop 45s from the early 60s still do 50+ years later?</comment>

<comment>That is the idea, yeah.That said, I've still not had a single of my old music CD's fail, and many of them go back to the 80's.</comment>

<comment>Yup. The materials used to make them are different, so it's no surprise their durability will be different. </comment>

<comment>The reason we don't see the "debris" from discarded media formats, isn't because they distintegrate that quickly.  It's merely because people clean the mess up from time to time.</comment>

<comment>So CD's that are 20-30 years old are becoming unusable, yet my vinyl collection keeps playing and playing and playing and...........</comment>

<comment>It's quite a loss for everybody.Only a very few shellac recordings were re-recorded on vinyl.  And we lost a huge amount of music when we lost vinyl because an artist's work may not have had mainstream appeal.I was born in 1950 and by 1970 had an enormous collection of records that took up bookcases on several walls.  I continued to add to them for another 20 years.Small labels (or mainstream) with artists who may have had only one or two albums before they disappeared.  The music on some of those records was recorded live with great care taken to get the best possible sound.All gone now.With the albums, I had reel-to-reel and cassette recordings, too - they were capable of even better definition.  When was the last time you saw a Nakamichi Dragon (I had one).I digitized some of that music:  LPs and Tapes.  The technology for doing that in the early 1990s barely existed and digital storage was very expensive.But I burned a lot of CDs with MP3s (lossless wasn't common at the time) and the computer drives that held the source material have died long ago.I still have those CDs, though I haven't listened to the majority of them in a long time.It was sad to see that those may have passed into time, too.OTOH, those recordings I uploaded to USENET are still there, so that might be a good place to store them for posterity.</comment>

<comment>It's a real problem, and has been for a century and more. Remember when records were wax cylinders? Well, no, because there's essentially nobody left alive who remembers Edison's original recording format. For that matter, remember records? I do, but try finding LP's or anything that will play them. I've got a sizable collection of VHS tapes, and need I say more?Every time a new format or medium comes out, people have to switch over--and inevitably, things simply get lost, never transferred to the newer media and eventually succumbing to time and accident. For instance, Hollywood has lost the only copies of large numbers of old films from the silent era and the early days of "talkies" because they were recorded on fragile celluloid and destroyed, sometimes in bulk lots in vault fires.That's why so-called "e-books" will never replace printed books: the latter can be read by anyone literate in the language in which they are written, in any era, without requiring the "right" technology, while the former will always require a compatible display device.</comment>

<comment>and the "digital rights" to access the 1's and 0's that make up the text.</comment>

<comment>Actually there are plenty of people my age that use records. I have quite a large collection - both of records made anywhere up to 60 years ago (maybe even longer) and of records being pressed today. People who "DJ", particularly electronic music use records. While many start out with digital formats today, and some have switched over since starting with vinyl- there are still those who use vinyls. There are also those who take samples from vinyl - even though they don't ultimately use the vinyl live. I think vinyl is also still popular amongst the "punk" scene - where bands/labels still continue to press and sell vinyl - in most cases simply for fans to listen to and not  to be used to produce new music.</comment>

<comment>"try finding LP's or anything that will play them."here's a start:http://www.recordstoreday.com/...http://www.recordstores.com/http://www.vinylhunt.com/A simple Google search will find a store near you</comment>

<comment>Okay, if you make the effort, you still can--but you do have to make the effort. And it'd be a lot harder if you had to search without the Internet. For that matter, I can easily find old VHS tapes if I want (and I've ordered a few because I just couldn't find those titles in DVD; I have a dual player). And I suspect it'll get harder as more years pass.The underlying point remains: newer media are simply more fragile and more evanescent, and every time the "free" market forces a switch to a new one, some things get lost.</comment>

<comment>I backed up all of my CDs as .wav files on a hard drive a long, long time ago. So, no worries here. Unless the hard drive dies. But, of course, I'm about to backup the backup. Redundant backups, people. Makes copies of copies and you should be good.</comment>

<comment>I think that's the best option - although I've read that the Library of Congress has had some trouble with digitally stored media in that file formats become obsolete. I had a similar experience when I decided to get my term papers off of the laptop I used in college. I had to convert them all because my current computers wouldn't run the software to read the files. That's a much bigger problem for the L of C!</comment>

<comment>The article is wrong about where the data is stored on a CD.Lafrance wrote, "there's a plastic polycarbonate layer, a metal reflective layer with all the data in it, and then the coating on top." While that's true for homemade CDs (ie, 'burned' discs), it's not true for commercial discs, and the article is about the latter. Commercial discs store the data in the plastic layer. They're pressed and the plastic has lands and pits left in it which cause the laser to reflect with different intensity because of the difference in the thickness of the plastic the beam passes through. This is quite like the way vinyl records were made in that the audio is stored as indentations within a spiral groove that are stamped into plastic by a metal 'negative.'The master for a commercial CD is made by burning the pits into glass with a laser, and then a metal negative is pressed from it. Stamping plastic with a metal negative is a very efficient way to produce thousands of identical CDs, but it would make no sense for creating personal CDs. The discs we burn at home 'write' the data onto a recordable disc using a process similar to how a glass master is made. A laser creates dark spots in a photosensitive dye on a CD-R. With a CD-RW, the laser uses intense heat to melt a reflective metal alloy and make opaque spots. Lower heat returns the alloy to its reflective state.All three kinds of disc use changes in reflected light to represent 1s and 0s. On CD-Rs and CD-RWs the data is stored in the reflective layer, but on commercial CDs the information is actually stored as pits and lands pressed into the plastic layer.</comment>

<comment>Man, CD's were marketed to us as a "permanent" substitute for cassettes. When they started appearing in the record stores, we were told that as long as you cared for them, they would last "forever."</comment>

<comment>.... glad I kept my records! But I've had relatively few problems with CD's I got over 20 years ago. The key is take care of them.</comment>

<comment>scaremongering.cds etc kept in good condition will still outlive most of their users.</comment>

<comment>"All of the modern formats weren't really made to last a long period of time," said Fenella France, chief of preservation research and testing at the Library of Congress. "They were really more developed for mass production."--Perhaps that's true BUT...the MARKETING pitch for CD's and DVD's, was that they would "last virtually forever".I know that I am not the only one who got snookered by that clever little bamboozle. I guarantee you some other commenters will corroborate what I am saying.</comment>

<comment>In 2003, I made a bunch of mix-tape CDs & wote all over them with shapries; they work just as good today as they did back then. & in the event of a computer crash, I burn all of my mp3s onto disc for backup. Bad habit of losing tiny things like flash drives.Why in gawdz name would they not install DVD drives on laptops? Not all video games are direct-download & still have to be installed by disc.</comment>

<comment>The CD/DVD drive is heavy and expensive.  Not including one allows manufacturers to sell cheaper, lighter laptops, and while you are correct that not everything is available via download, the vast majority of consumers can get everything they need without physical media.</comment>

<comment>Well, yes and no. Movies, songs etc. still have to be stored SOMEWHERE, so the problem remains--it's just shifted into the cloud.A while back I read that computer manufacturers want to put EVERYTHING in the cloud, even stuff like Word and Excel and any documents you created with these programs; your home computers and other devices would essentially just be terminals a la the 1960s though of course more sophisticated. I think that's a dreadful idea and hope it never happens; if it does, kiss your privacy goodbye forever.</comment>

<comment>That already is happening.</comment>

<comment>Motors take a ton of power.</comment>

<comment>What I find interesting is that the record companies like to say that when a customer purchases a music CD, he is getting a license for the use of that music on a CD (as opposed to other media, or sharing with others, etc.), which should mean that someone who rips a copy from that CD to back up that CD from its eventual physical demise has not violated the terms of the contract.  But if someone does that, then all of a sudden, the customer has actually purchased a physical item, not a license for its use.  DOUBLE STANDARD!</comment>

<comment>Always have files backed up on other drives. The CDs themselves are also back ups. Store in FLAC or SHN  for space. MP3s are a dated hold over from Napster days and the quality drop is very noticeable (from a WAV file to a high bit rate mp3). No wonder people think a digitally remastered LP sounds better on a good system than a file a 1/5 the side of the original going through ear buds...Conditions may affect CDs - heat and damp cause oixidation, generic felt tip ink used on a CDR will probably eat through the label, which may rot away due to conditions as well. Proper CDR pens should be used but even that ink can corrode, but not damage the disc. I have noticed some CDRs deteriorate just from sitting on a shelf. But that does not worry me, a new one is easily made.That they are not made to last is another black mark on the music industry. We do not rent what we have bought. Oh, and LPs are not error free, They collect matter in the grooves and other little faults whether a needle corrodes the plastic or not.This is why music purchased should be on DVD Audio or hybrid SACD at least. Probably Blu Ray as well. That way we know it has been remastered for the digital format and probably quite well unlike some of the other calamities the CD part of the music biz has created.Fortunately with digital media we have the best form of protecting our media such cloud, external drives. But paying loadsamoney for box sets that are going to wither away? I think people will be even more motivated to pirate rather than buy... rent...</comment>

<comment>The additional problem: hard drives have even shorter shelf-lives than CDs.  Archiving is becoming a problem, because no physical medium is stable enough to last for decades at a time like much of the old analog did.  (I've got records from the 1930s that still play.)  So now what?</comment>

<comment>I ripped my entire 1,600 CD collection to a Western Digital 1.5TB external hard drive as lossless WAV files. It took about 1.2TB leaving me some room for any future CDs I buy. I then backed that up again to a newer 3TB WD drive. Problem solved for $220 and a couple months time.</comment>

<comment>If you think only CDs do this, you should see old floppy diskettes! Some brands actually grow a living MOLD on the surface. Apparently it likes something that's inside the coating that makes mylar into a floppy diskette. You can sometimes wash the physical mylar data cookie it and still get the data off, but earlier is better.</comment>

<comment>The first CDs my dad bought when we first got a CD player still play fine (Paul Simon 'Graceland' & Fleetwood Mac 'Tango In The Night') and these were bought around 1987-88. I've never had a pro-duplicated CD degrade, but plenty of CDRs I've had skip all the time.</comment>

<comment>Planned obsolescence? Why, it's the soul of capitalism. Ironically, the tape cassettes onto which I transferred all my vinyl albums are still working just fine. What's the next piece of techno-crap coming down the profit pike?</comment>

<comment>"If you're willing to part with your old CDs, the library will happily destroy them for you."FYI - This is incorrect.  The library is not accepting donations of old CD's.</comment>

<comment>And then they wonder why we don't want to pay for music…</comment>

<comment>Yeah, like being able to buy a movie in a $5 bin when the soundtrack CD is $15.</comment>

<comment>It's because of the laser radiation that your discs are exposed to every moment that disc is spinning, the disc falls apart due to exposure to the radiation.  Try putting your eyeball on the laser for 45-74minutes and see how well it holds up.You will literally see what I mean.</comment>

<comment>In 1983 after hearing my first CD at an AES demonstration I declared the compact disc "the greatest single mass deception since the election of Ronald Reagan." I was correct. It was a stupid format: an analog of a digital bit stream pressed into plastic as pits and land surface representing 1s and 0s in a spinning format. Never mind that the 16 bit 44.1k resolution is absolutely not sufficient to archive analog tape recordings never mind engage the brain and keep it interested in the "music" produced by the format. My 40 year old records still sound far superior to any CD edition and that's just an easily demonstrable fact.</comment>

<comment>Maybe with sensitive test equipment.  I'd like to see such a demonstration; no one has been able to do so in my 35 years as a DJ.  (These arguments have been tediously regular ones.  There are still people religiously advocating the use of green markers on CD edges and monster cable for their speakers.)  Human hearing just ain't that good, even at its best.</comment>

<comment>if you are suggesting that cables do not make a sonic difference then you haven't really listened. If you are suggesting CD transfers from analog tape are transparent to the source you haven't used the most sensitive test equipment available: your EARS. I suggest you watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>I'm suggesting that some people are hearing what they expect, not what is there.  This is superstition/religion to some.  Cables can indeed make a difference.  But "Monstar Cable" is no better than decent quality wire I can buy at a hardware store.  It's all about resistance.  Electrons don't care what brand name is slapped on the cable.  They care about FLOW.Another way your wallet gets hoovered-out without any real benefit are the "gold connectors."  Yes, indeedy, gold is an outstanding conductor, and if your connectors were solid gold, it would indeed impact your sound!  But most connectors are gold PLATED (which is why anyone can afford them).  The more critical thing, then, is what lies beneath.  Many are worth no more than the crap they toss into the component box for free.  The only true benefit of this is that they sometimes corrode less easily.I'm not "suggesting" CD transfers are transparent to the source.  I'm saying that no human being on the planet can TELL if the transfer was done right.An interesting video.  I'm more "sold" on getting better playback equipment moreso than dissing the CD.  When it comes to CD sound, my biggest gripes have been far less with the format and more with the engineers who screwed it up.  I've done a bit of remastering myself, and regardless of what format you're talking about, the engineer is god when it comes to the end result.</comment>

<comment>Actually the "superstition" resides among those who take seriously double blind tests applied to audio…and your level of cynicism based upon a lack of experience is telling. It is NOT "all about resistance". Many can TELL if the transfer was done correctly by knowing who did it, with what A/D converter and from what source etc. However, no CD in my experience, made from an analog tape source, sounds correct. Not one. And not since the beginning of the CD era….</comment>

<comment>Don't mistake knowledge for cynicism -- LOL!  When it comes to speaker cable, it's resistance.  What else IS there?  We're talking about a piece of wire.  (Or, to be more accurate, a bundle of wires.)  Whatever the case, the only measurement that matters is resistance.  Wires don't have a "frequency response."  (Resistance can CHANGE that response, though.  The idea is to get beyond the point where that matters, and that is determined by the gauge of the wire vs. wattage running through it.)I've conducted several double-blind tests.  In fact, one was for some friends who used to write for Stereo Review.  I found the results of most people who claim to have "golden ears" to be little better than tests done with ESP cards.  But there are indeed exceptions.  As I said before, my hearing is no standard to rely on, as I've spent 35 years in bars, nightclubs, wedding receptions and broadcast booths, and before that I was a drummer.  My hobby?  Shooting!  Yup -- all loud stuff.  It's a rare individual who can spot the CD, vinyl and even Dolby C or S cassette on CrO2 tape.  Rarer still: the person who can discern the 256 kbps or higher MP3 from the CD.That said, I love it when I play my CDs that were made from recording an LP.  It's almost comical how the "audiophiles" say it's "so warm, and so detailed compared to the CD."  I've had people accuse me of lying and storm out when they found out my "trick."  Sonically, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the 44.1 red/orange book format.  As I see it (or hear it), it's all about the engineering process, although I'll also agree that the AD/DA conversion is extremely important as well.  Hopefully we've gotten better at that since the '80s.  I've used the AVID systems Digidesign stuff when I master.BTW: Thank you for the great video!  My wife and I both enjoyed it very much.  (She works in TV.)  Really interesting stuff -- especially the Red Skelton show bit at the end.  I'll be sure to share this with my fellow DJs and audio geeks.  :)</comment>

<comment>Double blind listening tests often produce "stupid" results. Double blind was used to produce MP3s of "CD quality". Which is RIDICULOUS. We're not talking about drug trials here. It's music. In any case there's much more involved than 'resistance'. There's also inductance and capacitance and how the three are balanced. There's also conductivity. And the connectors and the metal and the plating. On a high resolution system cable differences are not difficult to hear. In fact on my website analogplanet.com  I posted files of two different phono cables and the vast majority of people who downloaded the 96/24 files heard differences and heard the SAME differences. I will be doing more of this soon.</comment>

<comment>P.S.: I don't believe in "golden ears". I do believe though in trained experienced listeners versus neophytes, particularly in "blind" test. I could tell you stories of being challenged to "blind" tests, getting all identifications correct and then having my results tossed and me declared a 'lucky coin' because the average test taker didn't do as well. The blind test folks have a major AGENDA.</comment>

<comment>Me neither.  As I said, I've got some measurable hearing damage and am jealously guarding that I've got left.  But I do know what to listen for most of the time.  My double-blind was admittedly armchair, but my only "agenda" was to debunk a certain couple of "golden ears" claimants.  That I achieved, although they both could hear a damned sight better than me!  :)</comment>

<comment>The first question that comes to mind, then, is "why?"  Why would double-blind testing produce anything other than verifiable yes/no chartable, useable data?  They're the backbone of many sciences, not to mention a way to verify extraordinary claims.  The simplest answer, of course, is that it does.  For most listeners on everything but the very best audiophile equipment, an MP3 that is indistinguishable from a CD is a reality.  Our hearing just isn't good enough to detect the differences.Case in-point: during the video, they began talking about bass roll-off.  Engineers know that oftimes there is so MUCH bass that is, by and large, inaudible (below 20 Hz) that it makes no sense to record it.  Human hearing is such that, if we could hear bass as well as we can midrange, a bus idling at a stop a mile away would keep you up at night.In any case, I'm happy that engineers are never satisfied.  They gave us FLAC and Ogg-Vorbis, etc.  I'm also happy that technology has made cheaper, higher-capacity hard drives possible so that NO compression is necessary.  Soon, keeping files at higher bit rates won't be an issue.Of course, connectors, plating and other barriers to conductivity are very important and can become obvious sound-wise.  I've always made my own.  I was referring to the cable (speaker wire) itself, and interconnects, which are often nothing more than what I can buy at Home Depot, but they're charging a small fortune for it.  (And yes, that includes the oxygen-free stuff.)  That's my real gripe.  Then again, how many people are going to order and solder their own connectors?  <sigh>I'll take a look at your site -- sounds interesting!</comment>

<comment>So many things to say here.....1. Say what you want about Reagan, he's the last president who I actually liked, and aside from JFK, the only president during my lifetime who I'd vote for if he ran today.2. I wouldn't call the CD a "deception"....  The problem with CD playback, from its inception to today, is that most CD playback equipment just doesn't cut it.  The vast majority of CD playback rigs just emit too much RFI, which kills the sound.  (I've heard analog taken down by excessive RFI as well.  Vinyl with an active digital source connected to the system will sound worse than the same vinyl with the digital source powered down and disconnected from the system.)3. I thought the CD was a medium I'd never embrace....  Until listening to a Wadia 7/9 combination at a (now defunct) store in Cleveland back in the early 1990s.4. One can get GREAT sound from CD, if he diligently listens, and addresses the real problems that plague the playback.  Especially RFI.5. In my opinion, the single biggest problem digital audio playback (not just CD) is RFI emissions.  The higher the bit rate, the higher the emissions.  (I think this is why a lot of people in the mainstream think MP3 is a superior playback medium.)  But for some reason, it seems like the problem has been either ignored or discounted as a problem.  I think CD playback products of recent time are no better than what was put out in the late 1980s and early 1990s.6. The most-enjoyable digital audio sources I've heard have been Redbook CD players, CD changers, or 2-box CD rigs.  I've yet to hear a high-resolution digital audio source that I thought was musically satisfying.  I've never heard a CD quality WAV file that I thought sounded as good as a good CD player.  And there is something very wrong going on with lossless playback decoded in real-time.7. I've yet to encounter ONE CD that became unplayable after a long period of time.  The CDs that I own that were produced in the 1980s play with nary a problem.  (The only time I recall CD becoming unplayable over time were CD-Rs sitting inside a hot car daily over about half a year.)8. I still prefer the sound of vinyl....  But good CD playback does not make me want to fire up the turntable.9. There is very little correlation between performance and price, when it comes to digital audio.  One of the best DACs ever is the Philips 935 CD Changer DAC section.  Buy one cheap on eBay, gut the analog output stage, and replace with something good, it will beat 99 percent of what's out there.10. When people hear good CD playback, they think it's high-rez.....  When I hear high-rez, I don't hear more resolution, I just get a headache quicker.</comment>

<comment>The biggest issue with CD is the brick wall filtering at 20kHz. Filters for many years--actually until recently--were terrible. They rang and it was audible. Other issues too. Which makes your comment about headaches from hi-res difficult to understand. By raising the sampling rate, you avoid the brick wall at 20khz which should result in fewer headaches. Plus 24 bit depth is a huge improvement from 16 and can be heard easily on good gear. I have seen a research paper showing brain activity listening to CDs and then to hi-res files. The brain fires up  listening to hi res because all of the inter-aural information in life is well above 20kHz so when it is filtered out the brain loses interest, which is one reason people don't pay rapt attention to music on CD the way they did on vinyl, which can extend well beyond 60kHz. When the same people were played just the above 20kHz info, there was no reaction but combine the 20-20kHz+ the UHF info and the brains lit up. I can think of no reason why high resolution digital audio would induce headaches any more than HDTV would compared to NTSC television (other than the programming!)</comment>

<comment>Transfer them to cassette or open reel tape. I have open reel tapes from 1963 that still play back OK. These are from radio programs and spot ads that I produced. They are on all forms of tape recorded full track, from Scotch 111 acetate to Scotch 176/177. The records I've transferred to cassette also sound OK. That's my experience. There are those that say the sound will disappear. So it may not work for you.I've found that CDs won't sound the same ever time. I've found that in several CD players. So it has to be something about digital technology itself. It may be that fact that digital is not a sine wave. Analog is.</comment>

<comment>But, those old vinyl albums still play.</comment>

<comment>I just finished reading all of the comments to the article and feel very confused. I am not a computer expert, so while I can follow the opinions and logic stated here, I don't have the personal experience to guide me as others do. I read carefully though because I have a jazz cd collection which is very important to me, along with photos that are saved on my hard drive and phone which are irreplaceable.A few things are coming through to me from the comments.  1. Vinyl is not just the best way to listen to music, in many ways it is the best investment due to its durability.  2. Even though I thought that cds should last for a lifetime with proper care, clearly this is not true. 3. I had better create digital versions of all of the music in my collection and save it multiple ways.Please, in as straight forward of a way as possible, advise me on what I should be doing. Leave out the banter and rhetoric. Also, take into consideration that I have limited financial resources, limited time, and want as low of maintenance as possible to be able to do this.1. Save it in a lossless way (FLAC, AIFF, .wav, or MP3?) 2. Onto a 4 TB external hard drive or what?3. Back that up how? (Cloud, 2nd hard drive, what?)4. Set some kind of routinely scheduled backup of the computer or what?So then I'd have the discs, the hard drive, and the third way.Please advise me, I am serious about moving forward with this as soon as possible.</comment>

<comment>Vinyl records, when properly taken care of, will outlast almost anything.  The high quality plastics (especially those used before the oil crisis in the 70s) don't break down unless humans mishandle them.  I have records made in the early 50s that sound marvelous and play free of any surface noise whatsoever.  Try getting a cd or hard drive to last that long.</comment>

<comment>Convert them to a loss-less format, save them locally toan external drive, and back them up to the cloud (e.g. CrashPlan). You can also leverage Google Play Music to have them readily available in the cloud (it supports FLAC).</comment>

<comment>My first CD-Rs from 1998 were nonfunctional less than 6 years later.  But it was all stuff I could re-download and not have the 2 second gap.</comment>

<comment>The best way to preserve music on CD's is to re-record it onto vinyl.</comment>

<comment>If you put your CD into a machine with ITunes, it will import them as AIFF, AAC, or MP3. There are other free programs, such as Audacity, to do the same.</comment>

<comment>so what about putting the stuff on an external hard disc drive or a USB key?</comment>
