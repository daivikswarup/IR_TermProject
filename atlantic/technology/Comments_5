<comment>No mention of China? Where1/4 of the world's population lived, is missing from this supper , supper accurate map? Guys... really need to hire some competant editor and writers here.Funny thing is, this researcher interviewed is Chinese. LOL</comment>

<comment>Mmmmmm, Chinese supper maps.They are delicious but you'll be lost again in an hour.  </comment>

<comment>Facebook has relatively little penetration in China, compared to elsewhere, largely because of the Chinese government's  "Great Firewall", but also because of the presence of China-centric social media competitors, which aren't blocked (but are monitored by the Chinese government censors).</comment>

<comment>Plus it could be used against them in probably the same manner as wifey is giving access to Western Civilization's critical structures</comment>

<comment>So, got any more paranoia to peddle today?</comment>

<comment>facebook made population density maps of places where previously no good such maps were available. China has a massive population but it's government has a pretty good idea where most of them live. Because a large proportion of them are living in multistory houses in urban environments there local registry system will be much more accurate than anything you could get from a satellite picture,</comment>

<comment>Apropos the article: Kiswahili word for "white person." Well done. Yes, China is left unmentioned from this super map. Perhaps they were busy eating supper?</comment>

<comment>Not me !!!!</comment>

<comment>Nor any sailors at sea, evidently.</comment>

<comment>the only thing I noticed was in two of the comparison pictures someone has their left and right confused. See the hand with the L on it is left and the one with the R is right, same as your shoes.</comment>

<comment>Considering he married a Chinese mainlander and just in the 60s they murdered a minimum of 60 million of their own because they were educated, the concept of Red China having access to detailed personal data worldwide is a cause for alarm.</comment>

<comment>How do we know that Facebook is so limited?When you walk into a store you will be met by someone who has pulled up your face profile and will ask you if you are interested in a product similar to the one you bought on (date and time) or any other conversational question letting you know you are not a secret that will blow your mind that you are in a database you didn't know existed.</comment>

<comment>This is scary. I don't want this, It's sad seeing tech evolve into this NSA spy tool kind of thing, and I don't even live in the US.</comment>

<comment>Great idea - calculating the distribution of population simply by counting houses.</comment>

<comment>Uhh... remove me from your databases or get sued.</comment>

<comment>That won't work in this case. It's a publicly known fact that a house exists in a certain location (though not identified as your home) and as no trespass occurred when taking an image of that house, then you have no right to remove that knowledge/image from the public domain.</comment>

<comment>Facebook has a 14,000 word terms-of-service agreement for its use.  It was written by attorneys.</comment>

<comment>Facebook is mapping devices, not people.</comment>
