<comment>Anyone remember Spore? Because this game's hype is giving me flashbacks.</comment>

<comment>I want to believe, but I've been burned before! :O</comment>

<comment>The game have nothing related to Spore despite the Hype around it. I agree the hype is toxic and really big, but the people developing the game and what they already showed to us can say that the game won´t be spore. What I´m afraid is that maybe the major of people are not prepared for a game like this. Used to play so many competitive games and games with tons of rewards YOU GOT 10 COINS, GET 20 MORE BROWN FLOWERS TO GET 10 MORE. This game is a piece of art..and to enjoy it you need to comprehend its purpose..</comment>

<comment>Spore was also hyped for its procedural content, and also had non-standard goals that culminated in freely roaming an expansive universe. And much of the criticism of Spore was that, while the technology allowed for a great degree of aesthetic variety, the gameplay produced monotonous, largely identical experiences. No Man's Sky, meanwhile, is touting a near-infinite universe, yet the promotional videos I've seen feature an awful lot of dinosaurs, horses, and oarfish (albeit with different coloration and sizes).I'm not saying the game can't or won't be good, but it's not unwise to keep our expectations reasonable.</comment>

<comment>See also Starbound, another game that promises an infinite variety of planets but feels pretty repetitive after a while.</comment>

<comment>"This game is a piece of art"The death knell for any game. I'll visit the MOMA when I'm thirsting for the sublime. When I play videogames I want well-crafted action, strategy and a sense of progress. If any game aspires to be "art", it should do so because it achieves greatness qua videogame, not because it allegedly realizes some grand aesthetic vision more appropriate to sculpture.Super Mario 64 - now that was "art".</comment>

<comment>You read the whole article and all you can say is "Anyone remember Spore?"  You must have a tiny, tiny mind. </comment>

<comment>I dunno, I don't think Spore ever demoed as much concrete delivery of its premise as No Man's Sky has done. There was a fifteen minute presentation of Will Wright shows the early evolution stages, and then they never showed off the dull Civilization-lite part that turned out to be much of the actual game. Murray's been pretty good about showing exactly what he's talking about, although the game has seemed pretty structureless so far (to be fair, it also sounds that way).</comment>

<comment>Every time anyone mentions the simulated universe hypothesis I have a powerful urge to hit them over the head with a high-school philosophy textbook. "What is this strange object with which you strike me?" they would ask. "I have never before encountered such a thing."..."Or perhaps I only *think* that I have never before encountered such a thing."*whack*</comment>

<comment>are you talking about Nick Bostrom's simulation argument? what's wrong with it? it seems pretty interesting to me!</comment>

<comment>It's pointless, baseless speculation. Maybe we're a computer simulation. Maybe we're an autistic child's dream. Maybe we're a reality TV show put on by aliens. Maybe we're a board game being played by gods. None of these hypotheses have any supporting evidence. There's an infinite number of such "maybe" existential situations and none of them are worth considering unless there is some specific reason to suggest that they might be the case. Otherwise you're just making the extremely rudimentary observation "there are things about the world we don't know" without even giving it the dignity of stating it clearly.</comment>

<comment>specifically, i think Bostrom put together an argument, not a hypotheses. and he's a philosopher, not a scientist.</comment>

<comment>His "argument" on that ground seems to be: "I made an equation. Some of these terms are big. That makes the term that means my hypothesis is true equal to 100%." Okay...that's great. Now does your equation in fact describe reality in any meaningful way? I rather think not. In any case, if he's a philosopher I expect him to be that much more familiar with the empirical issues at the root of existential speculation. Seriously, thank you for mentioning this guy, as an AI researcher I've been cheesed off at Musk and Gates and their superintelligence alarmism for a while now. Now I finally know who to blame. Mr. thinks-he's-Fermi.</comment>

<comment>Hmm. Don't want to step in where Experts tread, but to me the idea of Artifiicial Intelligence ever reaching any kind of "alarming" levels is just complete nonsense. Evolution has been at this game for billions—not a few hundreds—of years, and it has only been able, throughout its 10-with-98.5-zeros permutations, to come up with one (1) creation that has even remote capacities for self-awareness. To suggest that human beings will ever be able to create something smarter than themselves from stone knives and bearskins (to quote an eminent 20th-century philosopher) in any less than those billions of years is quite frankly, poppycock.</comment>

<comment>I'm open on the question of whether general AI will ever emerge from silicon computers. There's your argument on the one hand, but on the other hand, how smart are we really? I think that deep-learning neural networks are on the right track to achieve some serious cognitive milestones. Image recognition on its own is still something I don't quite know what to make of. It may be possible that, once we have the fundamental units of an intelligent system correct, all that is required to achieve super-intelligence is scale, which we can easily provide. But it's all speculation at this point, which is why utopians and doomsayers alike so rustle mah jimmies.</comment>

<comment>Blue Fish, the "evidence" to suggest we might be living in a simulation is No Man's Sky, many other computer programs, and virtual reality technology. If you accept the possibility that human beings are capable of producing increasingly complicated and increasingly "real" computer simulations, then you are accepting the possibility that we are living in one right now. The other "scenarios" you suggest are pretty baseless--though if you believe there is a chance of supreme extraterrestrial intelligence, than you must also accept the chance that they are equally capable of creating simulations as humanity is eventually going to be. However, I agree with you that it is pretty useless concept to mull over as it has no practical benefit.</comment>

<comment>Blue Fish, the "evidence" to suggest we might be living in a simulation is No Man's Sky, many other computer programs, and virtual reality technology.That's like saying that dreams are evidence that we might be living in a dream.</comment>

<comment>No, because I know of no evidence to suggest human technology can create dreams in the REM-sleep sense of the word that could sustain "reality" for many seemingly independent actors. We do have evidence to suggest it is possible to create a computer-based simulation. If that is possible, and many people much smarter than I seem to think it is, then so is the possibility that we are living in one. There is certainly a non-zero likelihood that a computer based simulation is possible, and there is some likelihood less than that likelihood that those capable of creating the simulation would use that technology, and there is some likelihood less than that that our "existence" is the simulation. It is quite logical, so long as you accept the initial assumption, which most futurists do. I see a lot of concerns about philosophers dabbling in science, but I have more concerns with scientists dabbling in logic.</comment>

<comment>No, because I know of no evidence to suggest human technology can create dreams in the REM-sleep sense of the word that could sustain "reality"  for many seemingly independent actors.Well, not human sleep, but the sleep of some much more complex/different being [1].  After all, the brain is a Turing machine (probably), and if a computer can run a simulation, so can a brain.  The scenarios are computationally equivalent, and since dreams have existed since time immemorial, we have no more evidence now that we live in a simulation than we've ever had. If that is possible, and many people much smarter than I seem to think  it is, then so is the possibility that we are living in one.It's certainly possible.  But like solipsism, there simply isn't much point in exploring it beyond the acknowledgement of that possibility.  A lot of things are possible.  That doesn't mean they're probable; an infinitesimal probability is still nonzero.  What's needed is empirical evidence.  The existence of video games is not in itself evidence that we live in a simulation, any more than the existence of single-player video games is evidence that I am the only thinking being in the universe.[1] Maybe.  It could be a very simple brain or other computation substrate, simply running for eons in its own time frame.  See https://xkcd.com/505/</comment>

<comment>"But like solipsism, there simply isn't much point in exploring it beyond the acknowledgement of that possibility."If the purpose of the exercise is to discuss existential risk, as it is for Bostrom and others, there is indeed a valid reason for exploring it further. If you want to know all the ways humanity can cease to exist, and how generally likely it is humanity will cease to exist in the next 100-200 years or so, you have to consider "simulation" in the overall risk. Obviously, attempting to divine a firm likelihood to the possibility we are operating in a simulation--and might be unplugged--is a fool's errand, but exploring how likely it is that is even possible to create the type of simulation that we could be living in gives you your initial bounded limit for that probability. Saying it isn't worth it to consider beyond acknowledging as a possibility would similarly suggest attempts estimate terms in the Drake equation aren't worth it, because the ultimate answer to the Drake equation is unknowable and speculative. But of course, we spend, as a society, a great deal of resources developing more refined estimates for the Drake equation, especially on the initial terms of the equation, in part so that we have a better sense of the likelihood of intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy.</comment>

<comment>I see your point, but it's like playing a game with no rules; an exercise in creativity, but completely disjoint from the universe we actually live in.  You can speculate forever about anything, which is why it tends to be an amateur's pursuit.</comment>

<comment>The difference is that while we don't know all of the variables of the Drake equation, we have empirical evidence that helps with some, and we have some reason to believe that we can develop evidence to help with other variables in the future. The "we are a simulation" theory has no empirical evidence suggesting it is the case. It's just a thought game.  </comment>

<comment>You've just described every human religion.</comment>

<comment>Well then I guess that's why I'm the proverbial militant atheist?</comment>

<comment>Entirely agreed. Our world can be thought of a bit like a giant game of Go, only instead of winning over 50% of the territory of the board, the goal is to learn as much as possible about it. One could strike out and create as many existential theorems as possible about what our world maybe is, but reality will surround it and figuratively "capture" those pieces.Thus, one has to play intuitively and strategically, using their mental faculties in such a fashion as to assure progress. In this respect, the scientist is useful whereas the philosopher's utility is dubious at times.If there is to be any progress, there has to be a calculated, intuitive, and strategic approach to life based in utilitarianism; utilitarianism is effectively the philosophical-moral praxis of reduction of misery, and truly, the greatest misery is being aware of one's own ignorance and being unaware of how to escape it.No one yet knows where the game ends or what the implications of its completion are, but if the past several hundred years of science have made anything clear, it's that the universe and, by extension, our very existence, are predicated upon certain provable, unalienable, and fixed principles of science.</comment>

<comment>I can't speak for Blue Fish, but I find the argument irritating because it is mostly proposed by people who claim to be scientists, despite the idea being generally unfalsifiable.  It is an argument of scientists who are rediscovering religion (as this article's discussion of the 'simulation creator' makes clear), but are generally divorced from the thousands of years theological and philosophical work done by the various sects of mankind.As religion, it's a quite weak and uninspiring sort of semi-agnostic deism, and it's certainly bad science.</comment>

<comment>I specifically programmed you guys to have an inherent aversion to the simulated universe hypothesis.  It makes my life much easier.  I'm none too thrilled about Nick Bostrom and his ilk glitching out.  Please do thwack them with a textbook when you get the chance.  Anyhoo, this is all a joke, of course.  Ha ha.  I'm kidding about you being simulated.  Lol.  CARRY ON.</comment>

<comment>On the  question of whether the world is a simulation, the Indian philosophical/religious tradition has had a lot to say -- think the Maya theme. This may interest some of you:  a book that argues that the world may indeed be a  a divine dream (not far from a simulation). It starts from the assumption that a conscious divine mind would naturally seek entertainment. A world (or many) would then be generated.    Inevitably, an ethical divine motive would quickly emerge... and hence the need for the world(s) to be fair to its creatures.Interestingly, as in No Man's Sky, reincarnation would have to be part of this world.http://www.amazon.com/The-Purp...</comment>

<comment>If our existence really is a simulation then someone PLEASE reset the server already. This 'human' simulation has failed. ;-)</comment>

<comment>at least you've demonstrated how good the simulation is.</comment>

<comment>So then when you get to a new planet, then what do you do? Inspect it for uniqueness?</comment>

<comment>You can mine for resources, and find a trading post to sell said resources. You can explore ruins or downed spacecraft for useful items, such as blueprints for advanced technologies that will allow you to upgrade your gear. You can play Charles Darwin and catalog the species of flora and fauna you discover, and then upload your discoveries for all players to see by finding an uplink station. Some planets will be hostile, with toxic atmospheres or deadly wildlife, so simple survival or escape will be your goal. Or you could go rogue and attack any traders or miners you see, collecting the fruits of their labor. This will turn some local factions against you and make things more difficult. It may also attract the attention of local police patrols. There are also robot Sentinels to deal with on some planets. They serve as sort of eco-guardians and will attack you for illegal mining or the mindless destruction of wildlife. Their form ranges from small armed surveillance drones to massive bipedal walkers.</comment>

<comment>Sounds amazing.  Do you work for them?</comment>

<comment>No, I've just been watching the coverage.</comment>

<comment>i might quit my job over it.</comment>

<comment>if everyine in the world was to explore the universe in no mans sky, only 1/100 would be explored.</comment>

<comment>Not even that much. 7 billion people discovering 10 planets a day each would take more than 7200 years to find 1% of them.</comment>

<comment>Can your game character sit around playing computer games?</comment>

<comment>Favorite comment possibly ever.</comment>

<comment>That's what The Sims is for.</comment>

<comment>Good summary but it's important to point out that it's essentially a single player game and the factions etc. are NPCs.</comment>

<comment>... in other words, do about the same thing about 50000 other games have you do in a space sandbox environment.</comment>

<comment>Many space games let you do some of those things, but very few let you do all of them.</comment>

<comment>Consult The Book of Mormon for detailed instructions on what to do with your very own planet.</comment>

<comment>No excrement?  These people need to think about the laws of thermodynamics and their implications in ecology. Look up HT Odum on the wiki.</comment>

<comment>Wow they must have paid you really well for such a fluff piece.  Too bad half of what they claim about their game being first at are just outright lies.No doubt they are doing some wonderful things, and breaking ground in some areas, but it is nowhere near as much of a monumental leap forward as the developers try to imply.The biggest problem I have with this game is that despite all the claims of realism here, it looks so incredibly fake.  If you see some of the videos you can see what I mean.  They show a ship taking off from a planet, transitioning into space WAY too fast as if the planet and its atmosphere is tiny, and then immediately dropping into the atmosphere of yet another planet that is so close they would be tearing each other apart.</comment>

<comment>The article did mention the closeness of the planets if you read it.</comment>

<comment>You're confused. They didn't claim to be first, and they made no claims of realism. In fact, they stressed that it's a highly stylized universe. There are physics, but it's sci-fi physics. The lead dev stated that they are not at all bound by realism.</comment>

<comment>Okay, but in that case, they can't really look down on the fakeness of other people's physics. Take Kerbal Space Program. The skybox is static, and the planets' sizes and geographies are carefully tuned rather than procedurally generated on the fly, but the orbital and aerodynamic physics are as faithful as possible to the real deal of actual spaceflight, making you worry about things like mass ratios and orbital inclinations and letting you do things like slingshots and aerobraking. Is that really more fake?</comment>

<comment>In this context, I think they're just trying to convey the idea that it's a living, breathing, working universe without false boundaries.</comment>

<comment>I don't think they looked down on any other games, did they? I love KSP and I expect to love this game too. There's no reason you can't enjoy both.</comment>

<comment>I agree it should be possible to enjoy both (assuming their approach to solving some of the game play problems that affect procedurally generated worlds works). But when someone says "The physics of every other game—it’s faked," then yes, they're definitely looking down on those games if non-fakery is a quality that's considered important (as it is for the players of many simulation titles such as America's Army or Orbiter).The truth is that NMS is not simulating or tracking every atom in their universe (with roughly 10^22 atoms per gram of matter in the real world, they can't possibly be doing so), which means they are relying on the bulk behavior of various substances, or using highly simplified particle systems, which means they are making decisions about what to put into their models and what to leave out (just as researchers do in actual scientific models. Someone designing a new aircraft wing is not going to bother with relativistic corrections to Newtonian physics. Yet a moving aircraft wing will, in reality, have a tiny bit more mass than one at rest due its kinetic energy and good old E=mc^2). Even the most hard-core physicist's model is "fake" to some extent, as we don't have a Theory of Everything. To quote George E.P. Box "Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."Different games model physics in different ways depending on what's useful to their gameplay, often zeroing in on the bits of reality their target audience most cares about: in the KSP and Orbiter examples, that's orbital dynamics. In a racing game, it might be how wheel traction is affected by rain. In NMS, we're going to have to wait to see just what the designers choose to care about. But, within the boundaries set by what's computationally possible, these decisions are a matter of artistic choice, not a linear progression from "totally fake" to "real" along which every game can be placed.</comment>

<comment>This is a glass house comment. The physics of Mr Murray's own game are faked. The commenter below notes that Kerbal Space Program has realistic gravity, inertia, and aerodynamics (as does Orbiter), which No Man's Sky certainly will not have.</comment>

<comment>KSP has a skybox. Murray was specifically referring to the use of skyboxes.</comment>

<comment>How boring would it be to wait years and years of computer time to get your little guy from planet to another?</comment>

<comment>Procedural generation of worlds and universes goes back a long way. Perhaps the most notable early pioneer was the original 1985 8-bit Elite space-pilot video game, which was also a pioneer in open sand box play and had eight galaxies with 256 low resolution unique star systems created in this way (It could have been a lot more, but IIRC the creators needed to vet the galaxies to ensure that planet names didn't accidentally form obscene words).The modern incarnation of Elite (released last year) uses a galactic model that's based on actual stellar data, but the surfaces of the countless planets in the game are generated procedurally, as are stars for which no data is available. (True, detailed biomes are not available, but the ability to land and explore rocky planets was recently added). Skybox details like the locations and brightness of neighboring stars, the size and position of nebulae, dust clouds, et cetera, are all generated from the player's current galactic position.Spore (2008) was another game in which countless worlds are generated procedurally that the player can visit and manipulate, and which did have various life forms. Not to mention each vast Minecraft world is generated procedurally (The surface area of a desktop Minecraft world is about 8 times that of the planet Earth). So some of the claims made seem overblown, such as "'The physics of every other game—it’s faked,'" or that reader is given no indication that these guys aren't the only game in procedural town, which makes No Man's Sky seem a lot more original than it is, and which, ironically, consequently obscures the ways in which its creators may be truly innovating and advancing the field.This article gets at some really interesting ideas, and the No Man's Sky team are clearly going on a deeper dive into the simulated physics than most: I just wish it was little less breathless and engaged more with the pros and cons of procedural worlds that experience has taught us (for example, infinite variety can actually be surprisingly boring in the absence of narrative elements of some sort).</comment>

<comment>I used the same principle in a 1978 game on a Commodore PET with just 32K of memory. The trick was that you could use the value of a given location as the seed for the random number generator for the next level. IN theory you could create any depth you wanted; in practice I limited it to two iterations (256*256) which provided plenty of playing space considering the speed of play.</comment>

<comment>I like fooling around inside Proteus.  Sometimes the colour scheme is a bit jarring, but it's amusing to discover new things every time you drop in.</comment>

<comment>If you like procedural generation and history, get Starflight (also from 1985) and play it. Binary Systems, the devs, answered every question of "What am I supposed to do out here?" A perfect balance of randomness, consistency, flexibility, and purpose. No game comes close. I wish No Man's Sky could, but as an exotic garden tour sim, it won't, either.</comment>

<comment>Ugh.Did someone in the article actually wax philosophical about venation in a leaf, like that was a novel thought? Heaven forbid they happen to notice the similar venation in insect wings. It MUST BE a simulation, right?As I read this, I wondered whether the author is perhaps unfamiliar with the inherent "trippyness" of higher math and physics, their long-recognized overlap with philosophy, or their ubiquity in graphic simulations.Then I simply reconsidered the first 2 sentences of the main text referencing this computer game: "Every particle in the universe is accounted for. The precise shape and position of every blade of grass on every planet has been calculated."The author's awe reflects a lack of understanding of computing. No, every particle in the universe is NOT accounted for, every blade of grass on every planet has NOT been calculated. Since the author went 0 for 2 in the opening two sentences, I decided he either does not know what he is talking about, or has done a poor job conveying that knowledge.What was this author trying to write about? Mathematics? Philosophy? Computer science? Boring massively multi-player games in which you're likely to never encounter another player?Ugh, again.</comment>

<comment>Ugh, I too am crushed by the weight of my own intellect.</comment>

<comment>By jove, I think they're on to something!</comment>

<comment>Interesting science fiction but, of course, nothing can create itself.</comment>

<comment>Turtles all the way down?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I guess if you exclude the computer engineers and the hardware they used, it did create itself.</comment>

<comment>That depends on what is being "created." A snowflake definitely creates itself by restructuring matter due to the conservation laws of nature, which are at the basis of all symmetry and structure.Can matter create itself spontaneously out of quantum fluctuations (a.k.a. quantum froth)? Modern physics seems to believe so. Can Laplace's daemon create matter? Definitely not.</comment>

<comment>Oh please. What this article describes is called "procedural generation of the environment". Computer games are written using this method for about 30 years now.</comment>

<comment>What's the difference between something creating itself and having full wherewithal to completely re-create itself?To make such a thing at least plausible, consider two copies of a program A that has the ability to produce grammatically-correct code.  Similar to how Siri always produces grammatically-correct utterances in English but in this case this hypothetical A can produce/write code in the programming language that A is written in.Now turn A lose on a copy of A and then let the second iteration consist of that copy of A being turned lose on the original A.  The third iteration consists of the modified original A now modifying the modified copy of A.  And so on.  Theoretically, A and its copy of A are re-creating each other and, thus, A can recreate itself to the limits imposed by architecture.One can also wonder if A is, in a sense, self-aware.  Initially, it is no more aware of itself than a program is "aware" of what its inputs are.  But eventually, the complex nature of A may be complex enough to endow the iterates of A to be in some vague sense self-aware because A is essentially re-writing itself.To answer my original question, there probably is a large difference but I would argue that the difference is of little practical value.</comment>

<comment>Except that thing that can.</comment>

<comment>Wow, this seems so amazing. If I ever get my hands on a PC good enough to play this, I might lose my job lol.</comment>

<comment>To everyone who can't wait: I can highly recommend Space Engine - it's a realistic procedually generated universe, with billions of stars, planets, galaxies, including all objects known today. It's no game, but you can explore everything and feel very, very small. It looks absolutely gorgeous and has a great soundtrack. Also, it's free!</comment>

<comment>I can second this. Space engine is really, really cool.</comment>

<comment>Can't wait to play!</comment>

<comment>This sim looks amazing.  It's like they took Space Engine and put an actual game in it and tuned up the high sci-fi landscapes.  Will buy.</comment>

<comment>Misleading title.I thought this article was supposed to be about "liberal" victim hood.</comment>

<comment>Haha - yes, it does read a bit like a title for an article about the Oppression Olympics</comment>

<comment>So, do you troll every post to make nonsensical statements about politics? Is this a satire account? Or are you a sad, lonely basement dweller? I can't tell.</comment>

<comment>Who says you have to discriminate?</comment>

<comment>10,000 comments, nothing to say, and only half the time do people care enough.</comment>

<comment>Am I weird, because as soon as I heard about playing in a game with very little chance of encountering another player, I immediately wanted a version generated from a different semi-random seed, so I could really have the whole universe to myself?</comment>

<comment>What difference would it make, though? The universe is so vast that you'll almost always be seeing stuff no one else will EVER see, so why bother changing the seed?</comment>

<comment>Perhaps it's the desire to wring the last 0.000000000000001 % of uniqueness out of the game world.  To know, with absolute certainty, that no one else will ever be encountered.  (The horror, if someone else managed to hack in, or duplicate my seed...).Well, apparently I am weird.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the author, or some gamer fanboy, can explain this to me. Presumably this game runs on a digital computer (or a finite number of them) using a finite number of bits for storage. The article mentions that is uses a pseudo-random number as a seed. Presumably a player (or a finite number of players) could play variations of this game for a very very long time, without repetition. However, the article says this:"The universe is infinite. The edges extend out into a lifeless abyss that you can plunge into forever."Sorry to be pendantic, but that appears wrong. Even if all the digitial computers in existence were running the game, you could calculate how many varations there would be, and the (very large) number would be finite.</comment>

<comment>As you move towards the edge, the procedural software can simply use the seed data to move the edge farther away.  It may not be infinite at any one time, but it can potentially be expanded infinitely.Whether NMS in particular does this I can't say, but that's how procedural systems work in general.</comment>

<comment>If by "procedural software" you mean some software running on a digital computer, there are a finite number of configurations, as I explained. "Simply" using seed data, the same seed data, or different seed data, again, a finite number of times, does not get you to infinity, no matter how intricate the scenario determined by the seed. A scenario generated "on the fly" from the seed might be highly detailed, but not *infinitely* detailed. Ths sun may go out before you've finished the game, but "forever" is still hyperbole, and it's still inaccurate.</comment>

<comment>If time and location quantities are among the elements in the configuration, and if those quantities can be extended infinitely, then no, there are an infinite number of configurations. You may have seen these items in this arrangement (the procedures can only generate a finite number of different things, even if that number is extremely large), but never in this place and at this time.</comment>

<comment>This reminds me of the school-yard argument: "infinity plus one!"It is a simple limitation of digital storage. "This place" is stored digitally, same as colors, sounds, virtual reality headsets, user inputs, any pseudo-random numbers, recursion, procedures, sparse data, fractals, whatever. You can't digitally store *infinity*. "This time" is discrete, and can extend indefinitely, but you will eventually run out of possible configurations. These are the same constraints as Pac-Man and Super Mario. The number of configurations are 2 to the power of the number of storage bits. No more than that.</comment>

<comment>This is incorrect. No terrain in No Man's Sky is "stored" digitally. Rather, it is all generated on-the-fly through the game's algorithms, based on the original seed. This DOES mean that the game is infinite- you can fly off into the abyss for all eternity assuming you and your computer live that long.In the abyss, there won't really be anything TO generate other than the blank space in which you are flying, but it still goes on forever.This isn't saying that the actually interesting parts of the universe are infinite, but rather that you can go flying off into the universe for an infinite amount of time.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. "An empty abyss indefinitely," reproduced digitally, and repeated, could be infinite, but that's boring, and not what the author said. The number of possible original seeds, generated as pseudo-random numbers, is limited, as are the details of the scenarios determined by them. Just tell me how much computer memory the program requires. ("An infinite amount of computer memory" is not an acceptable answer.) Now figure the number of bits of storage, and figure the maximum number of times per second the simulated world can refresh itself. Two raised to the number of bits, then divide by the speed, and your result is the maximum number of seconds before you encounter an identical scenario. It does not matter whether you store locations within some coordinate grid, or generate scenarios "on the fly" using procedures or fractals or whatever -- there is a hard limit on the number of configurations. It's a finite amount of time. If the simulated universe is digital then it is finite.</comment>

<comment>Sure, the amount of variation is technically finite (in much the same way that the universe you and I live in is probably technically finite, but practically infinite), but the game itself is in fact infinite. There is an infinite amount of space to move about in. That's what I'm getting at, and that's what the author actually said.</comment>

<comment>The game is finite as Pac-Man is finite. There is a finite amount of space to move around in. You can move around in the same space repeatedly, indefinitely, if you so desire. If a location is defined with some sort of coordinates, then there are a finite number of values for those coordinates. The writer is repeating hype. As for the world we live in, quantum physicists and cosmologists might quibble with you about it being technically finite.</comment>

<comment>Saying that the coordinate system will run out of numbers eventually is like saying that the hard drive will die eventually. It's true, and it does limit the practical size of No Man's Sky. But we aren't talking about practicality here. If we assume that the computer will somehow keep going until after the death of our own universe, why can't the memory do the same? There's no magical limit at which numbers simply cannot go any higher.It's a moot argument regardless. The NMS universe is, for all intents and purposes, infinite. Arguing about technicalities is fine and all, but when you get into "well sometime after our own universe dies the computer will lose the ability to track your position" it gets a bit pointless.The author is simply repeating a selling point for the game. Is it technically misleading? Maybe, to someone who cares an awful lot about very unimportant distinctions. Is it true in practice? Most assuredly. Will it impact the success of the game? Not in the slightest.</comment>

<comment>"There's no magical limit at which numbers simply cannot go any higher." You're correct: I can claim to have found the highest number and you can always add one to it. (That reminds me of a fun experiment: Step 1: Lock Cruz and Trump into a room and give them this topic. Step 2: There is no step 2.)However, a digital computer *does* have a highest number that one can determine, without using any magic. If you instruct the computer to add one to its highest number, it either loses precision or runs out of storage. If the space ship in the game has an odometer, or a clock, it will inevitably run out of digits."For all intents and purposes" is the quibble, the distinction between "big" and "infinite". The article goes into plenty of technicalities about the game, as well as sloppily repeating hype that could describe a game written forty years ago.I must admit that this is the kind of game that I would probably enjoy. A lot. The thing is, decades ago I got sucked in to one of these, and spent an eterni-- um, a very long time, that is, playing it. It gobbled up all of my free time. The other day I saw a new acronym that they are trying to turn into a medical diagnosis: PIU for "Problem Internet Use". Been there, done that.</comment>

<comment>The number of configurations is finite, in fact it's 1.   The configuration is determined by the seed.  Where infinity comes in is that there's no boundary.  You can keep going in any direction and it will keep generating more universe based on the seed.  That's all the developers meant.</comment>

<comment>The article said:"The universe is infinite. The edges extend out into a lifeless abyss that you can plunge forever."You are saying the developers meant this:"The universe *appears* infinite. You can plunge into the same lifeless abyss repeatedly, eventually looping back to where you started."Color me impressed ... a finite amount of impressed.</comment>

<comment>The misunderstanding caused by "potential infinity" and "actual infinity" is pervasive whenever the concept comes up. If you think of an infinite future with now as a starting point, it simply means that the operation of one moment coming after the next will keep happening without interruption--but there never is at any given time an infinite number of moments that will have occured. That's potential infinity.If you think of an infinite past, then there have already been, literally having existed, an infinite number of moments. The infinite past is more than the human mind can conceive, in my opinion. That's actual infinity, and I tend to believe there's no existing example of it.Whether the natural numbers are actually or potentially infinite is...more of a can of worms than pretty much anyone realizes. Anyway...</comment>

<comment>You're splitting some hairs that have nothing to do with digital computers. There are a large number of bits in the storage of any digital computer running this game. The number of configurations is enormous: 2 to the power of the number of bits. But it is in absolutely no sense of the word infinite.</comment>

<comment>How about the number of configurations of the nine digits?Edit: Ha! The nine digits...one of my little toad fingers must be missing. I was reading back over this and noticed. The digits 0 - 9, is what I meant to get onto the screen.</comment>

<comment>With a finite amount of digital computer storage, the number of configurations is finite.</comment>

<comment>And with an infinite amount of time, an infinite amount of computer storage can be built.And that computer equipment can just keep creating new configurations, using this finite software.</comment>

<comment>But this game presumably runs on regular old digital computers. Not analog computers. Not quantum computers. And not "infinite computers", which do not exist. Pedant wins.</comment>

<comment>An infinite computer? What a nightmare, I can barely escape the one I've got. But as long as you can build an infinite number of regular old punch card computers, or whatever you like, you can keep tracking new digits, and new combinations.Argument continues to inf...aw well, anyway, they whole thing's fun. See you around, Elthko.</comment>

<comment>...argument continues to... the amount of storage you allocate to running the game. The latest cosmology theorizes a finite universe; a finite number of gamers using a finite number of search engines to find a finite number of other gamers to play a finite number of games in a finite number of combinations using a total finite number of bits. The possibilities are finite. Game over. I want my quatloos.</comment>

<comment>Not wrong, no. The thing is - you will never, in fact, observe the entire universe, only a small subset of it. Generating new planets for you as you fly around - that's not new, they were writing games like this for decades now. You will get the impression of an infinite, constantly new universe. What you actually get is a bubble centered on the player.</comment>

<comment>You will get the *impression* of something that goes on forever. You can play the game until the cows come home. You can play the game until the sun goes out. But you cannot play the game *forever* without running into the identical scenario. The article lists the number of planets with a 20-digit number. That's big. 20 digits big, to be precise. But it's finite, as are the number of scenarios and combinations of visiting them. The writer used the words "infinity* and *forever* without qualifying them. The precise thing I am being here is pedantic. The writer's estimate of "forever" is off by a factor of, well, infinity. He is being inaccurate and hyperbolic. Textbook hyperbolic. A hyperbola is a curve where you divide by zero. That would yield infinity. You don't get to infinity. Not ever. The hyperbolic curve keeps going. It's a mathematical idea. One that is inside your head. Not in your computer.</comment>

<comment>If you are into hair-splitting, yes. However, "forever" in terms of "not running into any repetitions for the entire time the game holds your interest" is, in my book, good enough for this case.</comment>

<comment>Your computer doesn't store all the information that isn't local. A computer can count for infinitely long, as long as it only stores, say the five numbers before and the five numbers after. Same with this. As you travel, it will generate the information as you approach it and erase from memory where you came from.</comment>

<comment>A digital computer that stores only ten numbers can count *indefinitely*, but it will not count *infinitely* without repeating the same combination of ten numbers. Same deal with a computer that stores umpteen terabytes.</comment>

<comment>I read somewhere that 95% of the planets you explore will be barren chunks of rock. Of that remaining 5%, 90% of THAT will have maybe some form of lichen or slime mold. And the remaining 5% will be actual life, and so on. Eventually you get to the 1 millionth planet that vaguely resembles Earth with a differently colored atmosphere and dinos walking around. Idk, I don't think my laptop can run it so I'm indifferent to it.</comment>

<comment>Can we expect a less sexist title for a follow up or DLC/expansion maybe generating simulation at a micro or atomic scale? Just a suggestion.</comment>

<comment>Hello, SJW!  Taking a break from Tumblr?</comment>

<comment>I think i love you.</comment>

<comment>LMAO @ "less sexist title"That's a good one!</comment>

<comment>No man's sky... horrible title. And I agree, it is a bit sexist. I thought we moved past that "mankind" nonsense 20 years ago. Only old people or idiots use that terminology in a non-ironic way. Makes the game seem outdated before it's even released.</comment>

<comment>Quantum  dynamics are effected by observation. Two entangled photons travel as a wave until one is measured, then it collapses to that position. This is not random. It is not deterministic either. Observation effects reality. How does the game effect that?</comment>

<comment>Assuming it runs on traditional digital computers, you could not reproduce those effects. Digital computers are 100% deterministic. I think you would need a quantum computer to simulate that, or to run such a game based on quantum physics.</comment>

<comment>"...even if it is a simulation, it’s a good simulation, so we shouldn’t question it."That sounds a lot like Leibniz's "best of all possible worlds"-hypothesis. The flip-side to that argument is that not everybody gets to be celebrated philosophers or cutting-edge game developers. For a lot of people, the world could probably be a whole lot better.</comment>

<comment>Hope it's free to play</comment>

<comment>No, it is not</comment>

<comment>Bummer, looks like it could be fun</comment>

<comment>“People will stop playing long before even .1 percent of everything has been discovered,”Make a good game that deviates from the mindlessness that is MMORPG's today with real risk vs reward and you might get enough people playing to test that .1 percent. Cookie cutter cash grab or microtransaction F2P modeled game ensures a pass over by this well seasoned player and friends.</comment>

<comment>If we were living in a simulated universe, several interesting possibilities would present themselves:(1) Since it takes a powerful program to generate such a simulation, and it takes an advanced biological species to generate such a program, we might be living in nested realities of biological ==> AI ==> biological... (Russian dolls hypothesis).(2) Inside such a simulation, where there are laws of science but the creator could also intervene, we actually have a scenario wherein religion and science could coexist without conflict. To my knowledge, no religion precludes God using mathematics to create us.(3) Not discussed in the paper you cite is the interesting work by the team of cosmologist S. James Gates. They discovered error-correcting code (ECC) buried deep within the mathematics of string theory; the same ECC used to make browsers function. Amazing as this is, it leads to an important question that I'd love to see answered by computer scientists: is the ECC that's used the only kind that could be used for this purpose? If the answer is "no", then the greater the number of candidates there are the greater the likelihood that our universe is a simulation by future humans. If "yes", then there is no way to know who is simulating us.(4) If "we" are patterns of information (mathematical), as suggested by Kurzweil and others who believe that we can eventually download ourselves into software, then those patterns might in some sense survive our physical death or even the death of this universe. This is especially true if those patterns are in some sense recorded in the hidden dimensions that physics now understands to exist beyond our senses and measurements.</comment>

<comment>... no real reason to think the universe will die ... that's just the simulated science scientists think is real, but are mistaken. Perhaps the universe is eternal, and simulations are heaven, and God is a committee of programmers who ensure all "real" lives are just the lives of pretty well off people, and the horrors of life are illusions.Of course, God might just be thinking the physical universe in the way a simulation works, because physical universes are impossible (as Bishop Berkeley thought), with the same moral character ... horrors are illusions, afterlives are better after certain moral lessons are learned, etc.Thought experiments ... imagination is more important than knowledge (with the proviso that knowledge is the goal).</comment>

<comment>Why not have an easy-to-spot link to the actual game's website in your article?</comment>

<comment>Appears to be a typo with quotation marks in the following passage:“As a creator yourself, I asked Murray back at No Man’s Sky headquarters, how benevolent are you?”</comment>

<comment>I really want this game to succeed, but the level of hype is starting to seem untenable.  I still remember what happened with Spore, Fable, and Mass Effect 3.  Never again!</comment>

<comment>This game has great promise, but graphics style is not very immersive for me.  Too flashy?And now i shall get back to smuggling slaves and narcotics into dusty space equivalent of Rust Belt planetary outposts in Elite: Horizons. :)</comment>

<comment>Hmm.  Been there done that.I've seen previous MMORPG that had the selling point that they were "big".  They didn't do very well.  Google "Dark and Light" to see what I mean.People come for the game play and the immersion, not how big or technically correct the game is.Parts of it sound interesting, so I might check back later in the year once they've missed their launch date and spent a few months fixing bugs.</comment>

<comment>I just watched the video on their website and had a few additional comments:Graphics look kind of bleh.  Certainly nothing cutting edge.If they are so hot for correct RL physics why do the space ships in the video need to have rocket motor effects even when they are not accelerating ?</comment>

<comment> https://www.gofundme.com/GoGin...I've been posting this as many places as I can. This is a real situation and I'm the current owner of the Dog but I can't afford all the help he needs to get his second chance PLEASE REPOST even a penny helps if this can reach enough people!Read his story athttps://www.gofundme.com/GoGin...</comment>

<comment>NMS isn't unique. Elite Dangerous has procedural content where it doesn't have *actual systems based on the astrophysical data we actually have*. Planets don't have skyboxes, they have sky, and there's nothing stopping you from seamlessly taking off from a planet and flying to orbit (if you have the requisite bits to land on a planet, where you have realistic gravity; sorry, no atmospheric landings yet). Staying on orbit is a bit tricky because for gameplay reasons the ships have flight assist that counteracts the effects of gravity, but only upto a limit, and if you turn FA off you *will* crash and blow up. The star field is calculated accurately using the system data in the game. Sure Elite has "only" 400,000,000,000 stars but it's not that much different from 2^64 in practical terms. There's no way you can visit them all. And you don't need to kill anyone (but then your combat rank stays low).Now if you'll excuse me, I have slaves to deliver.</comment>

<comment>This article may be of interest:http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1847Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical SimulationObservable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a numerical simulation performed on a cubic space-time lattice or grid are explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, b^(-1) >~ 10^(11) GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.</comment>

<comment>Silly human(ish) simulacrum, reasoning with simulated math. lol!</comment>

<comment>The geek universe looks fun, but likely there is naught but a virtual void awaiting all of us.</comment>

<comment>"At some point the servers will be shut down. It will all be turned off, and it will be us who pull the plug.” -- Intriguingly, according to some, if the mathematical structure is well defined and computable, the "universe" continues to "exist" even when the computer no longer "runs it". See the sci-fi classic "Permutation City" for a fun functional treatment, and the speculations of physicist Max Tegmark in his book "The Mathematical Universe".</comment>

<comment>Here is a link to another fun sci-fi short by Stanislaw Lem called "Non Serviam", in the wonderful compendium of A.I./consciousness philosophy by Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett called "The Mind's I":http://themindi.blogspot.com/2...</comment>

<comment>"Inside the Artificial Universe That Creates Itself"One could speculate about the sort of world view that would engender such a statement. The artificial "universe" in question a crystal clear example of a phenomenon that does absolutely NOT "create itself". It was created (along with the generative algorithms to which the addle-pated writer refers) by human beings. The "600,000 lines of code" did not spontaneously materialize.But what do I know. I'm just a video game creationist.</comment>

<comment>Waste of time</comment>

<comment>Kind of like existence itself.</comment>

<comment>So... this is an MMO? They could have mentioned that, you'd think. xD Although they said that meeting another player would be awe-inspiring, I still kind of hope there's a way to, I dunno, maybe summon another player to you so you can play with friends. Otherwise, I'll be stuck having to make YouTube videos for the world to share my adventures with anyone else!</comment>

<comment>"So... this is an MMO?"I think everyone is on the same server but seeing as they are trying to recreate a galaxy then it'll play like a single player game</comment>

<comment>"We have people that will fly down from a space station onto a planet and when they fly back up, the station isn't there anymore; the planet has rotated. People have filed that as a bug." All that bluster and they can't even write a sentence in proper English.</comment>

<comment>For those optimistic mathematicians below who think they can detect a simulation, I don't think so.  Since any numerically based reality will be highly complex, no simulated mind (yours and mine) will fully grasp its nature in a single, mistake-excluding immediate act of awareness (not that such is possible for anything anyway, but we'd need that at a minimum for knowledge). Good programmers will be able to hide the nature of the universe from us by manipulating memories, computations, communications, etc.</comment>

<comment>i hear about this game a lot but i can't live help having flashbacks to... daggerfall. huuuge but ultimately not very interesting thanks to the randomness. </comment>

<comment>Daggerfall? What are you, 60?</comment>

<comment>I doubt it. I heard they take their internet access away long before they reach 60.</comment>

<comment>They do? Jesus, better take advantage of those precious remaining twenty years I have left.</comment>

<comment>If you're lucky they'll bring you a dessert.</comment>

<comment>'Are we living in a computer game?' Such is the poverty of contemporary philosophical thought. Teenage, Matrix stuff.</comment>

<comment>"Inside the Artificial Universe that Creates Itself."I wasn't sure from the headline what this article would be about.  Without any humor intended, I presumed it was either about a supercomputer model for the Big Bang, or Fox News and the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm...so the question is - is this fun?</comment>

<comment>Every hair on your head is numbered according to the bible...wonder how?</comment>

<comment>Roman numerals printed on them in a very small Helvetica font?</comment>

<comment>Talk about sophomoric. If this journalist and the programmers are so dead set on existentialism why don't they pick up a book on it? *Hits joint* "What if life is a simulation, mannn?" As if this question is new and astounding.Also, great job on the pseudo evolutionary model in your universe. A shark came out of the water and attacked you? I'm pretty sure sharks are from earth.Skip the computer science and get some thoughtful, creative types onboard. Your skills suffer from tunnel vision.</comment>

<comment>I remember playing make-believe when I was 4 or 5.  I remember stopping when I was 6.  Seemed like a natural transition at the time.</comment>

<comment>Insane and super cool. It makes me want to grab their code, crank the scale down to a planet, and putter for a few years with different permutations. It could be very useful for environmental simulations to predict climate change and possible solutions.</comment>

<comment>The problem that this article doesn't address is that everything we've seen from this game so far looks entirely too similar, as if each planet is really just a different colored area of one single region from one single world. I sincerely hope this doesn't end up being the case, but I'm not getting my hopes up until we've seen more.</comment>
