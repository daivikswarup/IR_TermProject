<comment>Beautiful. It's too bad it isn't economical to make new churches as magnificent as they were centuries past.</comment>

<comment>Beautifully written piece on an exciting project I am proud to be part of. Minor correction, we tested in Hagia Sophia Thessaloniki, not Hagia Sophia Istanbul. The latter is currently a museum, while the former was indeed a church during the Byzantine period and converted to a mosque during the Ottoman period (in 1523), but since 1913 has functioned as an Orthodox church, not a museum.-Spyridon Antonopoulos, PhD, City University London</comment>

<comment>Thank you for taking the time to write. I'm sorry for the mistake. We've corrected it.</comment>

<comment>Yeah Science, BÃ®tch</comment>

<comment>This is a really exciting and interesting project. I have taught art history, world history, and literature and I always try to use music of the period and culture to help bring things to life. The music is a crucial element and nothing creates the emotional atmosphere more quickly and powerfully.But I find the idea that the great architectural changes of the later Medieval period were at least partly inspired by sound fascinating. And the information about how a space was "tuned" to create acoustic effects is really cool.Placing the art, architecture, and music in context to understand their ritual interaction is a very powerful way to get into the minds and lives of people in the past. This is a chance to experience their inner life, not just chronicles of wars and plagues.Bravo to the researchers and thank you, Adrienne, for sharing this with us.</comment>

<comment>Great piece, thank you.Reminds me of a professor of Roman history I had back in college telling us how Romans complained about how noisy city life was, especially traffic noise. Cobblestone streets, wagon wheels, horse hooves. Very clattery, apparently.</comment>

<comment>What amazing research! I would love to hear some of this someday. It is remarkable to think about.</comment>

<comment>Conversely, try explaining to a youngster that we grew up in a world without ubiquitous 'beep's.  Pong seemed wonderful when it first came out, my cat would chase the dot on the TV screen.  Now every bloody device, from washing machines to smoke-detectors to reversing trucks incessantly 'beep beep beep' to get your attention.  It's enough to make me envy the deaf.</comment>

<comment>The people who actually built things rarely wrote much down until relatively recently. One of the few surviving sources from the Roman era, Vitruvius, had a chapter on acoustic design, reflection, resonance and the like. Acoustic design has always been challenging. Until recently, there was no way real way to model the acoustics of a space, so there is always a lot of tuning after construction. Look at Avery Fisher Hall in the 1960s or Carnegie Hall and the mythical "dead floor" in the 1990s.I'm curious though. Did they use microphones or microphone arrays? If you have a controlled sound source and use a microphone array, digital signal processing will let you record the totality of the space and then explore it using beam synthesis. There are some spaces I would love to experience with a full space panorama and full space acoustic profile.</comment>
