One needs to see in the larger context. If a leader organizes a gathering and there are people shouting for destruction of India then it is natural that police will take such a leader to custody. What is wrong with that ? Assuming he was not arrested and the slogan shouting students only were picked up and then if it happens that leader was the master mind, then same you will turn the other way and say police didn't even think of arresting the leader and how foolish they are. <br/><br/>
Coming to Courtroom incidents, they were definitely minor when compared to what happened in the University campus - anti India sloganeering. Do you agree with that or not ?? <br/>
So let us not loose focus on key issue. I am not saying guilty should be let off. I am sure they will be punished as per law. There is no way they will escape. <br/><br/>
As far as a distant listener I like Bassi in the way he argues his case. He in fact called for open debate with Kejriwal (as he is fond of criticizing him) and Kejriwal never reciprocated. As a CM he is just passing some random comments which is shameful.

                            Madam, if lawyers can take law into their hands and police just sits behind the excuse that they don't want to escalate the situation is absurd. Job of the police is to protect the people and uphold the law. The Delhi police in this case did neither. Hence Delhi police is equally guilty of breaking the law and dereliction of duty. If you think that later the Delhi Police will take care of the goon lawyers, then you're dreaming. What ever happens the law must be upheld. And i'm sorry to say, Delhi Police Failed Miserably. No wonder we have seen so many cases of crime happening and the police personnel just stand there and watch. They have definitely forgotten the oath they took.

But for students, it seems you think its ok for Police to swoop in and terrorize students and arrest some of them for shouting a few slogans on their campus, that somehow in your opinion did not qualify as a matter to be left for Students Union and University administration to sort out?

                            It is the toughest job in the world, without doubt, made all the more difficult by political interference. Add indeed, all the factors mentioned, creed etc. If the law itself is suspect, then is it time to remove sedition from the statute books. If not, then this sort of situation is likely to arise again and again. We know that Hafeez Sayeed calls for destruction of India and freedom for Kashmir almost every other day. The JNU and voice from other campuses is shouting the same as the LeT man. Why is one wrong and the other right? Other than one sits across the border and the others are within India. You as a police woman must know better then most, once you have reached a point where you harbour such resentment and hate towards your very own, it is not going to take much to push you to the other side. This is well known. If inaction on the part of say, UK authorities is analysed, they ignored such voices for a long time hoping they would go away. They did not. The voices turned into action and not just against the UK. Many of those guys joined terrorists across the border.

And even after the vote was against seperation, the government said that in future if there is again momentum in favour of separation, they will conduct a referendum again. I will give you 2 more examples. In US, students protested against their own government againt vietnam war and nobody called them anti nationals even though they wer eprotesting when the country was at war. In US again, a person burnt the national flag and the supreme court ruled that the constitution provides for freedom of expression and it is the duty of the state to provide security such people.

                            Kiran Bedi has got it all wrong in the case of the Patiala court violence committed by lawyers, an MLA and the visible police inaction. Like her political counterparts, she first diverts the issue to the sloganeering at JNU. Whether I support or oppose what happened at JNU is immaterial. The government thought is appropriate to arrest Kanhaiya Kumar and press charges of sedition against him. So far, so good. The government and police have a right to take action as they deem appropriate. Now it is for the police/government to prove his guilt and Kanhaiya Kumar, his supporters and his advocates to prove his innocence in a court of law. That is supposed to be the due course of law and justice in the country, or atleast what I thought it was. It is for the courts to decide and mete out appropriate punishment or otherwise.<br/>
Now before he is produced in court, he is beaten up, his supporters, his advocates, media reporting the events are all beaten up – by a bunch of lawyers and an MLA belonging to the ruling party at the center who also controls the police in the state. Ms. Kiran Bedi talks of ‘collateral damage' and how the police chief Bassi tried to reduce it. This excuse sounds so lame that even Ms. Bedi herself would not believe it. Take the case of the Nirbhaya rapists and murderers. The anger and hatred in the hearts of every citizen across the country was palpable and mobs were waiting to lynch and beat up the accused while they were being taken in and out of court. Still, the police kept their faces covered – no one even knew what the accused even looked like. How is it that the police was very effective in protecting the murderers inspite of the blood-thirsty and righteous mobs? They could have very well allowed the crowds to manhandle the accused and watch as mute spectators in order to avoid ‘collateral damage'. Infact, the people would have praised the police for helping to get rid of such vermin from the society.<br/>
She talks about the challenges for Policing in this country today of "a billion views". Sorry, Ms. Bedi, it is precisely because of these ‘billion views' that police action in the Patiala court case was more necessary than ever. A billion people have now seen that if you shout ‘Bharat mata ki jai' and indulge in violence and arson the police will not touch you. You will suddenly become a ‘Patriot' and a ‘Nationalist'. Moreover, you can do it again and again repeatedly in the same fashion at the same place and become ‘heroes' overnight. And atleast half of those billion viewers now genuinely believe it to be true because of the police complicity and inaction.<br/>
It was the duty of the police to intervene and arrest the lawyers and the MLA who were breaking the law on the spot - in full media glare and public view. That would have sent out the correct message that it is not alright to indulge in violence and take the law into your hands however ‘Nationalistic' your intentions. That message needed to be seen by the billion people, if we are to have a country of law-abiding population. The delhi police in failing to execute their duty have done a grave national disservice and infact have in their way, contributed to future growing lawlessness. <br/>
Ms. Bedi says that if the police had taken action there, the lawyers would have demanded a judicial enquiry into the police action. Now come on, give us a break.  Is speculated judicial enquiry sufficient reason for dereliction of duty in the present? And what if there is a judicial enquiry? If the police action was for the right reasons – to protect law and order and to uphold the law of the land, why do they need to fear a judicial enquiry? They needed to have taken that first action to set the optics and messaging right even if it meant an escalation of the situation to where the army has to be called in. <br/>
The problem today is that the police has become accustomed to ‘avoidance' in the garb of controlling law and order situations, rather than upholding the law, protecting people's rights under the constitution, and taking action against the law breakers. How else do you explain the police lathi charging and rounding up of law abiding people who gather to kiss(!) and spread the message of love, instead of rounding up the opposite set of people who threaten to create trouble if people kiss! This is the height of ridiculousness and this is being perpetrated in the psyche of the citizens daily by police actions or inactions – both in inappropriate direction and measure. Sadly we see this mistake being repeated by the police all over the country every day, which is one of the main reasons we see today in this country, growing brazenness and a dangerous understanding of right and wrong.<br/>
Finally, Ms. Bedi talks of the court and the bar council taking action against the law-breaking lawyers. The court ofcourse needs to book them for contempt of court, the bar council ofcourse needs to debar them from practicing the profession since they do not seem to have gained much from their education.  But these actions are not expected ‘instead of' police action! They have to be ‘in addition to' police action. They are offenders under the IPC, and need to be booked as criminals under the IPC which means police action is immediately and inarguably necessary. <br/>
When lawyers and law makers break the law, it becomes all the more pertinent and necessary to not only take swift action against them, but also to do it in full view of a billion people so that the message goes out loud and clear that no amount of nationalism gives anyone the right to break the law. If Mr. Bassi wants to atone for his sin and set the record straight he needs to address the people of this country through his hated media channels in full view of a billion people, after the arrests, that breaking the law is not alright – even if you are the only last remaining nationalist in this country.

                            Its seriously laughable to hear such a distinguished and accomplished public servant to offer comments like "police force wanted to minimize collateral damage and since events were being recorded police could go back and do their investigation". So should we do away with much of the police force and just install cameras everywhere? She also conveniently forgets the police reforms proposed by many committees now and again that general policing and investigation should be two different arms of law and should not be under political oversight. Any reasonable person would find the chain of events absurd. A Govt. MP lodges a complaint, police comes in to action and arrest the student leader without any proof or evidence. Hell, now they say they wouldn't even oppose his bail. Which means, we don't need him custody anymore.<br/><br/>
And, the stupid definition of sedition was carved out by British rulers. Does it make any sense to say 'Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection toward the government established by law in...shall be punishable with life...' in a democratic nation? Forget this is the definition of sedition in Indian law, the definition is nothing less than what someone like hitler want.

                            Dear Kiran Bedi jee,<br/><br/>
After a nice &amp; big background in the start of your opinion/blog finally you spoke about matter, thanks but still unfortunately the real issue is missed in your blog. I wondered, weather you really missed the real point or you conveniently overlooked so that you can be within reach of political system.<br/><br/>
You have shared that <br/>
"The police being criticized or verbally accused of a hasty arrest may be a group's perspective, but when such voices get louder, it spreads serious mistrust."  <br/><br/>
OR   <br/><br/>
"Why were lawyers not arrested for the disruption and attacks?"<br/><br/><br/>
Well these issues are debatable and for sure one can has a view on this side or the other side... but are these real issues? Not sure if you are confused or smiling?<br/><br/>
Well the real issue is why couldn't police protect people from being attacked in side court premises &amp; inside court room?<br/><br/>
Attackers are lawyers or liars or outsiders, that's not a concern ... concern is that are people safe in court premises &amp; in court room? Please let me re-phrase it, are people in police custody safe in court room? or police is going to say - well it's thin ice, we want to avoid confrontation?<br/><br/>
If you really want to have improved version of any thing including police behavior / and services; you need to educate &amp; train the people in the system; and so that you can educate people who are part of system, you need to tell them deficiencies shown by them. You have not raised the mistake done, how can you expect them to improve? Instead you have tried to create thin ice between debatable issues &amp; their deficiency. Well you can't hide deficiencies behind thin ice of debatable issues.... <br/><br/>
Last question, are you on politician's side or on policing side ... trust me you can't be on both sides.... God bless you..

Madam.. stones were thrown on the people..what if someone was so badly hurt to loose his life of got injured for life. <br/>
So if a lawyer is going to kill someone.. instead of stopping that beast.. police should actually record everything so that they can take action afterwards. I salute your.

                            Police has taken action as per law. Courts are the real masters and they are the one of the pillars of democracy. I think court would act as per the constitution and do well.  Criticising Police force is easy. For example in Tamilnadu in the last regime, we faced two situation of the same kind. <br/><br/>
1. Chennai Ambedkar Law college which is situated inside the highcourt premises, two students were attacked by group of students and police did not intervene in the incident as they felt law needed a permission from Principal for taking action.  But unfortunately one of the two students got permanently physically handicapped due to that.  Now JNU action has prevented that kind of situation.<br/><br/>
2. In the same Chennai again during the last regime Lawyers have agitated within the premises of High Court and attacked every one.  Police intervened and took serious steps to contain the situation. But the Honourable Justices of the High Court have not supported the action and this led to the enquiry and punishment of the concerned police personnel.  <br/><br/>
In both the incidents Police has taken opposite view to the current view. But they were criticised by Media and Public.  I think we as a matured democracy should accept that certain aberrations are bound to happen (including JNU incident, police action) and know how to deal with them without arising the passions. So many innocent people were arrested by Police and so many time courts have come down heavily on the police force and still system is like that and we cannot punish police for maintaining law and order.

The Police Commissioner cannot say that he did not want to escalate the situation. It is hos job to book offenders and ensure peace. Not booking offenders is not a choice. The whole incident and the response is a shame on the  judicial system, the police,and the administration.

                            you talk about prevention, however the level of prevention for you starts at the policing level.  Its not unexpected however, since you do have a huge policing bias. Based on your comments the Answer to most of the problems would be better policing. <br/>
Do you really want india to be a police state? <br/>
What about freedom of expression? is the fabric  or foundation of our nation so thin that a speech in delhi by young students would have tragic consequences.? Why are we even following a british law that was meant for a colonial rule and not a democracy which should promote peace and freedom and not persecution. <br/>
Didn't the police think about the lesser evil before barging into JNU? It seems you use an argument when it suits you?<br/>
You are pretty correct regarding the complexities that police face, have you ever understood the complexities that a common man or a student face. <br/>
People say - Even if kanhaiya Kumar did not say those ghastly slogans, he did not do anything about it, didn't excuse himself or "police" the accused?<br/>
Is it fair to not only expect but demand of a person with no policing power to police people in his university or meeting, but give a clean check to police to let the lawyers break the law. Even If I agree with you, how come lawyers and MPs get a show cause notice while a Student gets arrested. Why didn't the police arrest the lawyers at their home, or when the halla ended. How come a MP gets charged and bailed the same day, while Kanhaiya sent to jail. I understand most of these questions will have technical reasons such as different cases require different approaches. However to an outsider like me this just looks UNJUST. <br/>
Do you want out next generation to be do things because they are scared of law, or to have a better understanding of whats right or wrong and have more intrinsic reasons for not doing those things?

But police  and army are the only groups where they are perfectly secular as per my observation. Than why not politicians ? but again it is all-out power race and that inspires them to do everything and anything. Why we allow student associations to be tool of political parties ? we must try to keep university campus education and cultural activities centric only. It is responsibility of university authority to create safe atmosphere and must not allow outsiders and for that need to check photo ID also need to have CCTV cameras in campus at all places. So prevention is better than cure . Curing treatment has  serious side effects also.

Arrest should succeed the evidence not precede it - especially when the bail can not be given by the Metropolitan court (it will be the competence of Session court) where the accused is being produced. The speech by the accused which I have seen on the youtube is nowhere closer to sedition. In fact, he clearly repudiates the slogans raised earlier and reaffirms his faith in constitutionalism !

Many people are blaming Commissioner Bassi and his police for inaction against lawyers in court but I believe there action at that stage would have aggravated the situation and these same media people would have haunted police on action.

                            The author has sold her integrity to the BJP. To defend her colleague so shamelessly for not arresting goons. It was apparent that they were there with the sole intent of beating up the victim, yet Mr. Bassi chose not to arrest them since it was the "lesser of the to evils". Oh C'mon. A persons physical being was being harmed by thugs and goons and the cops chose to ignore them for their "connections" and their own political paymasters. Give us a break Ms. Bedi and stop preaching and sermonizing. You are just full of it.

                            Thank you madam for such a nice article. Unfortunately very few people can understand the ground level problems. I think the decision of police was the best among possible 3 decisions. There is no doubt that the best govt system in democratic system but sometime I ask question from myself do we deserve for democracy or Chinese system of government is best suited for us. Sometime, I also feel that we are moving towards a civil war like situation.

the umar guy said " we are not alone, there are many politicians who are with us"<br/><br/>
"there are many politicians who stand with us"<br/><br/>
Politicians who stood a soft corner in JNU case initially were CPIM leaders, Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal <br/><br/>
Leave every  issue aside  and arrest these 3 first.<br/><br/><br/>
It's time we teach anti nationals a lesson.<br/><br/>
Arnab did the right thing.<br/><br/>
Watch umar khalid video from 10 Feb, in which he himself says, he is not alone in this.<br/><br/>
No question of doctoring that video.<br/><br/><br/>
First say anti India, then get recorded on video, then say that others have doctored the video.<br/><br/>
these leftist have left no shame in themselves.

                            Mrs Bedi. I've always had immense respect for your views but your defence of the current dispensation hardly stands up to scrutiny. In all fairness Mr Bassi has brought this upon himself. For someone who professes at the drop of a hat to be the upholder of law in the capital, who doesnt think twice before putting into jail sitting MLA and ministers of the Delhi govt on the most minor pretexts, who is happy to book a young student on a serious charge of sedition. For such an officer to be seen to be choosing "the lesser evil" when dealing with a set of hoodlums who have been caught in the act on the camera of the nation's media, not just once but twice is certainly not the best defence he could have put up. He has gone out of his way to demonstrate his loyalty to his political masters at the centre but this time, I am afraid, has gone a wee bit too far. I am afraid in the India of today there arent too many places to hide when an officer of the law decides to play partisan politics

                            Dear Editor, The headline of the article is misleading . While it suggests that Delhi Police has sa weak case against Kanahiya , but in fact Kiran Bedi is praising Delhi police for doing a tight rope walk. was this spin accidental and pure error of judgement or deliberate and mischievous?

                            @Navtej Singh: yOU CHOOSE TO READ WHAT YOU WANTED TO READ. For me its a balanced article unlike your Ashutoshs and Manis etc. I liked the point that the FIR is changeable and the crime/charges registered can become less after the court checks the evidence.<br/><br/>
The problem has been that every political party has tried to draw mileage out of the event esp Mr Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi. They did the same at Hyderabad... added no value whatsoever but created more disturbance than before.<br/><br/><br/>
Its time we ask ourselves - Should Education should be separated from politics ?? Its pity to see Mr Kumar who comes from a humble background (don't know how much struggle it is for his parents to educate him) being caught up in such a matter. He could have been an asset for the society had the focus been education.

                            To all the half-wits who think they can do what they want without understanding the "Responsibilities" that go with their "Rights"....hope you have read the other article - "man who flew Indian Flag on top of house is denied bail in Pakistan". Stop the FARCE under the guise of Young people and Freedom and come back to doing what you are supposed to do - sit and acquire knowledge. It is NO brainer to understand the people - the Kanhaiya Kumar kind - who will live in the hostels on Government Subsidies and keep doing course after course and finally end up becoming third rate citizens who will NOT contribute anything to the society. If you fellows have guts; stand-up for yourself first. After all; of what worth is a fellow who can't even fend for himself and live off the tax payers money.

                            Let's not overdo this billion people and external forces drama. The police must be both firm and fair. When they goof up, they should say sorry and back off, as the NYPD did when they arrested IMF's MD on a hotel maid's false charge. And the channels have no business going ballistic over morphed videos which they do not have the patience / diligence to check for authenticity.
