However, the way a section of media and polity is sensationalizing Rohit Vemula unfortunate suicide, so as to win political points, only reinforces the belief that the democratically elected Modi government is working for the good for the country and this has rattled all the opportunists and vested interests whose illegal and unethical activities have been impacted. <br/><br/>
May Lord Ram help Modi ji in his vision of betterment of the country. I would dedicate the following shloka for the well being of PM Modi:<br/><br/>

                            @random: Their is a video on youtube which clearly shows and proves how the deceased Vemula instigated violence in the Uni by purposefully tearing up the ABVP flag. When confronted rohit is brazen about his actions. He goes to the length that he will tear up anything and everything which is saffron may it be even his mother's saree. This video even though popular on youtube has not been shown in any News channel because that video will clearly sabotage the support for Vemula. Their is also a video where the father of Vemula frankly denies Rohit belonging to Scheduled Caste. Numerous videos are their which proves to a larger extent that Rohit was guilty to some extent. Just because a person is deceased you cannot consider him innocent. Now since the opposition have prioritized JNU and Vemula case over GST, we can clearly understand where all of this is coming from. I am very sure the opposition is not going to allow a single parliament session to run controversy free. They are quite capable of creating a controversy in the absence of it. They have proved  it in Ishrat Jehan Case and now they are again proving it with JNU and Vemula case.

                            Shame on RG and AK. I being 70 years old also, my blood boils when I hear nasty shouts of Bharat ki Barbadi. RG and AK as Indian Leaders, why not yours? So called Student Leaders, who gave or listened to such destructive, derogatory slogans, either they are hand in gloves with the those who gave these slogans or they are so incapable leaders(I refrain from using "impotent leaders") that they did not react or stop Bharat ki Barbadi slogans. And to those Leftist, do they remember what their Mai Baap China did to students at Tiananmen Square in1989 ? 1000s of students were massacred and more than 10000 students were arrested.They just asked for democracy in China and not Barbadi ( India is so tolerant that even after 10 days, police are not able to arrest 5 students also, who gave anti national slogans ). Politicians and Journalist should have united and asked Govt  why no action against Bharbat ki Barbadi slogans. Journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai and Rahul Kanwal stand exposed to who their masters are. So RG, AK (though I like u) show that you are Indian first and you don't tolerate Bharat Ki Barbadi slogans, also as leaders, tell and educate students to oppose such miscreants and also ensure that because of you and likes of you, these miscreants don't go Scot Free.

                            What has Rohit Vemula got to do with SC. He got fake SC certificate and confirmed by his father. The common thread of all these university protests is Afzal Guru, which in any other country would have been hounded by everyone. Making heroes out of terrorists and supported by anti-national students, regional and national parties can only happen in India.

                            You can easily identify the number of maoists and leftists in this "student" procession of 654 participants......I feel pity for the plight of Rahul Gandhi to be addressing a group of maosits and leftists......

                            One thing is for sure students are falling victim to phobia as they believe they are bringing revolution despite falling into trap of anti-national elements, may this is new cool in their campus.<br/><br/>
The least thing and first thing if they want to do justice, kindly do it towards your parents by studying for which they paid and struggled to live for.<br/><br/>
If you can't understand your parents expectations, you shall also never understand your country expectations from you.<br/><br/>
As citizen you have rights but also duties, without duty you don't serve anybody except false sense of nationalism.

                            Absolute shame on Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal- supporting anti-national students and promoting their views. Students are supposed to go and study instead ruining the Indian Universities name. Pathetic state of Country!! Sick people never worked for India in last 60 years and not letting others who want to work now...

                            congress Rahul Gandhi creates, instigates, supports the issues even anti national acts against India and then blocks the PARLIMENT PROCEEDINGS in the name of not controlling by the Govt. Congress is happy in doing all such activities against India.  This is the real congress, who without power how they indulge in , damage the name of india.  <br/>
Now government  does not bribe and you cannot bribe the Government, hence so called congress and others feeling jittery.  All acts of Congress is well understood by people much better this time quite openly. Thanks for opening the eyes of Public.<br/>
By your actions, the more you indulge in the more Congress is going to reduce the numbers in parliament than 2014.  CONGRESS HAS TAKNE PEOPLE FOR GRANTED AND IT HAS EXPERTISED IN CREATING PROBLEM TO PRESENT GOVT DAY IN OUT, SINCE THEY ARE NOT ABLE DIGEST WITHOUT POWER AND SOMEBODY IS RULING.  MAINTAIN, CONGRESS UNTIL MORE PEOPLE  UNDERSTOOD your real enemies of india.

                            Why have you gone there ? Just another opportunity that you think will derail the government ? Grow up. You have some responsibility for your country. GST bill has been there for last 2 session and nothing has been done about it. You will conveniently not see that will you ?<br/><br/>
This is deshdroh also what you are doing. The country will pay heavily if important bills like GST are missed.
