However, the way a section of media and polity is sensationalizing Rohit Vemula unfortunate suicide, so as to win political points, only reinforces the belief that the democratically elected Modi government is working for the good for the country and this has rattled all the opportunists and vested interests whose illegal and unethical activities have been impacted. <br/><br/>
May Lord Ram help Modi ji in his vision of betterment of the country. I would dedicate the following shloka for the well being of PM Modi:<br/><br/>

                            @random: Their is a video on youtube which clearly shows and proves how the deceased Vemula instigated violence in the Uni by purposefully tearing up the ABVP flag. When confronted rohit is brazen about his actions. He goes to the length that he will tear up anything and everything which is saffron may it be even his mother's saree. This video even though popular on youtube has not been shown in any News channel because that video will clearly sabotage the support for Vemula. Their is also a video where the father of Vemula frankly denies Rohit belonging to Scheduled Caste. Numerous videos are their which proves to a larger extent that Rohit was guilty to some extent. Just because a person is deceased you cannot consider him innocent. Now since the opposition have prioritized JNU and Vemula case over GST, we can clearly understand where all of this is coming from. I am very sure the opposition is not going to allow a single parliament session to run controversy free. They are quite capable of creating a controversy in the absence of it. They have proved  it in Ishrat Jehan Case and now they are again proving it with JNU and Vemula case.

Their only job is to divide people on the basis of cast and religion. All Indians are asking what efforts have been made by these leaders to appeal to Jaat agitating leaders and crowd to be peaceful and don't damage public property. Do these people have any sympathy who have suffered heavily due to looting and arsening. Who will compensate their losses .

                            Shame on RG and AK. I being 70 years old also, my blood boils when I hear nasty shouts of Bharat ki Barbadi. RG and AK as Indian Leaders, why not yours? So called Student Leaders, who gave or listened to such destructive, derogatory slogans, either they are hand in gloves with the those who gave these slogans or they are so incapable leaders(I refrain from using "impotent leaders") that they did not react or stop Bharat ki Barbadi slogans. And to those Leftist, do they remember what their Mai Baap China did to students at Tiananmen Square in1989 ? 1000s of students were massacred and more than 10000 students were arrested.They just asked for democracy in China and not Barbadi ( India is so tolerant that even after 10 days, police are not able to arrest 5 students also, who gave anti national slogans ). Politicians and Journalist should have united and asked Govt  why no action against Bharbat ki Barbadi slogans. Journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai and Rahul Kanwal stand exposed to who their masters are. So RG, AK (though I like u) show that you are Indian first and you don't tolerate Bharat Ki Barbadi slogans, also as leaders, tell and educate students to oppose such miscreants and also ensure that because of you and likes of you, these miscreants don't go Scot Free.

To direct the attention of the public from their error in JNU, they have again taken up Rohith vemulla case in their hand.
