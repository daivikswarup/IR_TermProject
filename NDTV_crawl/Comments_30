                            Disappointed with the quality of this article. The headline refers to GST which is what made me read the article but more than 80% of the content had nothing to do with GST. It was only a cursory (almost an afterthought I would say) that GST was referred. I think this is the crafty thinking of an accomplished politician that might have prompted the use of the most important acronym in recent times - GST - to increase number of readers. Sad that even someone as accomplished as Derek could not conjure up a decent article aligned to his chosen title.

                            @HopefulofGST: GST will increase the inflation in 2019 elections if passed now. So Modi will do some nautanki and postpone passing GST until next year, but he will keep blaming the opposition for that. All is in Modi's mind is 2019 elections, not the interest of the nation.

TO ALL THE HOPEFULS OF GST . . . LET ME EDUCATE YOU A LITTLE! GST IS A MERE CHANGE IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM NOTHING MORE. IF YOU WRITE SOMETHING UNDER A PARTICULAR NAME AND THAN UNDER SOME DIFFERENT NAME, IT WILL NOT PUT MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF THE PEOPLE OF INDIA.<br/><br/>
ECONOMY MEANS SOMEBODY SELLS GOODS AND SERVICES AND SOMEBODY BUYS GOODS AND SERVICES.<br/><br/>
WHERE IS THE MONEY TO BUY GOODS AND SERVICES??? SO UNDER WHAT HEADING YOU WRITE WHAT IS BOUGHT AND SOLD DOES NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE.<br/><br/>
THIS IS ANOTHER LIE OF MODI THAT INDIAN ECONOMY WILL BECOME BETTER AFTER GST; ONE MORE LIE TO THE LONG LIST OT LIES. AND IF THE GST BILL WAS SO IMPORTANT THEN WHY DID BJP NOT ALLOW IT TO BE PASSED FOR 5 YEARS; THAT MEANS BJP IS ANTI NATIONAL??? DIL SE NAHI THODA DIMAG SE BHEE SOCHO!!!!!!!!

                            Great going Sir. Even without you being present in the Parliament sessions you are getting your questions and suggestions across. Decision on GST Bill should be taken care of only once all the Rajya Sabha MP's come back after their respective electionn, then only can there be a fair view at the decision making because everyone has an essential input towards it. This was a brilliant insight to what you do in the Parliament sessions. Thank You.

                            Sir, the questions you posed in parliament are very relevant and need answering. It's good that this will be addressed and we as your readers would love to hear what the outcome of these questions are. As for the elections in West Bengal, it is a known fact that TMC will win in a landslide as there is no relevant opposition. Thank you Sir, for the explanation about the affairs of the parliamentary meeting as well. It was very helpful to the average Indian.

Bengal elections are around the corner so the focus is rightly in Bengal. Sir, there is an election to fight for sure but the win for TMC is assured.

                            Those are some strong list of questions Sir. You are absolutely right that its the job of the Parliament to discuss, debate, deliberate and legislate. Will be waiting for the answers and we will surely miss you during the session . Thank you for detailing each and every aspect and helping us understand everything. Things look very good for TMC in West Bengal and we are 100% sure that TMC will win hands down and will keep up the good work.
