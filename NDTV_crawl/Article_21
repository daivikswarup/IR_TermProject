New Delhi:Â                             Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu may today convene the first meeting of a committee set up by the Centre to look into the quota demand for the Jat community in government jobs.
The Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs Minister, who heads the panel set up by the Centre on Sunday, said all the minute aspects related to the Jat reservation issue will be looked into meticulously.
"A committee has been made and I am thinking of calling the first meeting today. We will check what could the possible solution be, what decision was taken on this by the earlier government, what did the Supreme Court say on this issue, what was said in the review petition and what does the Constitution state on the (reservation) issue," Mr Naidu told reporters in Delhi.
He also appealed to the people of Haryana, especially the Jat community, to help restore normalcy.
"Politics or blame game over it will not lead us to any solution. The (state) government will look into the damages incurred due to violence... Whenever the situation cools down, we can all sit down to discuss a possible solution," he said.
Yielding to pressure from agitating Jats, the BJP had last night announced setting up of a committee under Mr Naidu to examine the quota demand for the community in government jobs.
Apart from disruption of vital road connectivity in Haryana, the violent agitation, which has so far claimed lives of 12 people, also affected water supply to the national capital.
