Secondly, there are clear videos available on Youtube which show him leading the anti-india slogans. Then where does the question of his religion come up.

                            One can understand the pain of a father particularly when the son has been sent to educate himself and not raise anti-India slogans, which has to be decided only by a court of law. Umar's father is right that he should surrender but his apprehensions about his son's security is not misplaced and the government should ensure that hooliganism should not replace rule of law just as anti-establishment should not be conflated with anti-national as some media channels are bent on doing. The JNU incident is among a series of incidence, starting with the Church attacks, to show the Modi government in poor light but there is also no doubt that the Modi dispensation's handling of certain incidents and events are questionable and inept. Thank god for the advent of social media that MSM is not having a free run on public opinion.

He is a traitor who thinks anti-india terrorists Maqbool Bhat and Afzal Guru are heros and his event poster talks about indian armed forces as occupying forces in kashmir. You still say he is not anti-India. He dont want to accept he is an Indian thats why he did not take India passport.

                            If you see/read the comments of the parents/relatives of any offender of law, may be in Nirbhaya case or this case, it has a remarkable similarity. First the offender is innocent and police has implicated him because of some grudge. After some proof comes to light then "We are shocked to hear this may be some friends have spoiled him". Once absconding then "we suggest that he should surrender to police". once goes to court they hire the best lawyers to defend him, and when convicted, the comment is "there is no justice in India ,this is a Banana republic"<br/>
Mr Sayed Qasims comment is similar to this.

                            Umar Khalid was the main organiser of the anti national event at JNU. He misled the administration on the pretext of organising a cultural programme. Now they claim that outsiders created the ruckus. How it is possible for outsiders to come without being informed/invited by the organisers. You cannot gather hundreds of outsiders at the appointed time without coordinating and networking. Umar's views at the time of event and subsequent discussions on TIMES NOW is a proof of his views and approach. Lets also note that he is not a student from Kashmir where people do have a different opinion on the issue of Afzal and Kashmir's status. He is an Indian Muslim from Maharashtra. It is disturbing that an M Phil student from Maharashtra has so much hatred against the country. He is not an innocent student but a M Phil Scholar. He is matured enough to understand the implications of his approach in which he is challenging the unity and integrity of the country. He is the one who started the fire. He cannot now scream the heat.

By the way look at the subject chosen by Kanhaiya lal-- PhD in social reform in South Africa? You are bloody cartoon, if you do not have ability to understand the social structure of place from where you come from i.e Bihar how is India or you going to benefit from studying affairs of South Africa? Just look at the present condition of Bihar in today's time. The poorest state despite producing so many civil servants. What have those Bihari Babu's done to develop your Bihar? Similarly, the study Kanhaiya lal-- is doing is share wastage of time, money &amp; no consequence to development Bihar or anybody or any country. By the way the crime rate has soared up in the poorer strata of society after end of apartheid in South Africa &amp; poor black kids do stunts on moving trains or commit crimes. They are trying hard to break barriers &amp; trying to integrate into mainstream public without help of any reservations in jobs or study. Indian Universities shall drop such bogus subjects for PhD, which are of no consequence yet provide opportunities to people like Kanhaiya lal to ensure his stay in university politics which shall graduate him to another lalu in making !
