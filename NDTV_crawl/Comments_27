                            Oh they have to follow the procedure, buy the lawyers/thugs who beat up journalists and students can go scot free and hold victory rally? The judges typically have a privileged upper caste background and a particular kind of political sensibility, sort of reactionary mindset. Dalits who have been killed in a massacre frequently don't get justice, even if there are convictions, they are set aside by the higher courts. But if upper caste people are massacred, then it is a different story, then it becomes about terrorism and national security - it is seen through a different prism. If you have a lot of  money like Salman Khan, then the justice system is like a piece of cake for you, if not you are at the mercy of the police.

How could he accept the police statement that they cannot provide protection be it any place in INdia?? Are they accepting that there are places where they have no control over?? <br/><br/>
Even if so, the judge could have asked the Police to take their very real apprehension of a physical attack on them and asked the Police to come to mutually agreeable place and then arrest them. What did the Judge mean by the word "whims and fancy" when all that the students told were that they fear an attack on them and the whole world has seen what happened to their friend????!!!!!!!<br/><br/>
