                            What freedom of speech some of the traitors are talking abou? Using tax money for food, books and fees. Subsidized housing and telling people of India every house will create a Afzul Guru, telling the nation Pakistan Zindabad . We will fight until India meets barbadi. These poisonous snakes have the gall to talk of freedom of speech. They should be happy they are living in India. If it were countries like their spiritual paradise Pakistan , they would have been brutalized and eliminated talking like this under the pretext of cultural event. Leftist English media instead of condemning their thankless behavior , singing duets with them. Shame on English media

                            Pretty good statistics on JNU. Kindly share the source and the originals so that the numbers can be turned into facts.
