<p>Here comes a 5 to 10 point rise for Trump tonight.</p>
<p>Trump is self-funding, which makes him more of an outsider than his rivals. If Trump can survive hammering Bush on 9/11 in South Carolina, survive a clash with the Pope, survive all the other verbal grenades he's thrown, then I think any tax return stuff would be a piece of cake.</p>

When the Obamas took office they were crying the blues about all the money they owed for Student Loans. As of two years ago their Tax Returns reflected a Net Worth of 12 Million Dollars. Then the Mass Media does a piece on "How the Obamas are paying for their daughter's college.." Give me a break.</p>
<p>I have been looking forward to his taxes.  If he doesn't produce them like Hillary has he is finished.  Pony up Trump were waiting.  Nothing eles can be said until they are on the table.     WAITING<br/></p>

<p>And George Will fought hard to keep Reagan out of the White House!  Cruz 2016!</p>
<p>Trump has been around a very long time and has a closet full of skeletons, why hasn't anybody started digging them out ? We already know he I no a Republican ! </p>
