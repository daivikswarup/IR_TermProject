<p> These women are beat.  They are a case of beer women or a fifth of Jack Daniels. </p>
<p>She would leave you too just like the poor souls in Bengasi.</p>
<p>Bill has a new home if she is elected</p>
<p>After slick willy dropped a huge "wad" here the least they can do is elect his wife.<br/></p>
<p> Is this because Bill has been such a good customer?</p>
<p>The biggest difference between Hookers and Hilliary, Hookers will stop screwing you when you are out of money!!!<br/></p>
<p>The irony is stunning.<br/></p>
<p>They just want Bill's cigar nothing more to this</p>
<p>The Bunny House is a historical site. There are several placards inside exclaiming "President Bill Clinton Slept Here."<br/></p>

<p>I think they aren't aware which Clinton they are really supporting.</p>
<p>For five hundred bucks you can watch Hillary wipe the server in the bathroom.<br/></p>

<p> Looks like Chelsea to the right of the "S"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hillary should feel right at home! Of course, she gets paid much more for her favors!</p>

<p>Bill worked their tail, uh, his tail off campaigning at the Bunny Ranch.  He handed out boxes of cigars to the "ladies", uh clientele.  Hillary said he didn't have to go but Bill insisted that this was a "hands on" project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hillary laughs about defending child rapist<br/><br/>Audio unveiled decades after it was recorded revealed Hillary Clinton celebrating the fact that an accused child rapist she represented was set free in 1975 – despite the fact that she insinuated that she believed him to be guilty of the crime. <br/></p>

<p>Bill must have visited Carson City to drum up his, oops votes.</p>
<p>Business must be slow at the ranch..the demand for bunnies is down, neo-socialist economy and all... or maybe they are just trying to up their market share of democrats? I'm reminded of Michael Jordan when he was asked to run for office as a democrat back when he would have won any office in the land handily. He replied, "No thanks. Republicans buy shoes too you know." These ladies should consider that little jewel of wisdom. Still, I wonder if they're offering any promotional considerations to switch parties or a promise to vote a certain way. Just sayin'.</p>

<p>The Hookers support of Hilary's campaign is about a serious as Hillary making it into the WH....not really happening. This is just a great big advertising/promotion for their services. But I'm sure the Hillary squad is taking them seriously. Sheesh!</p>
<p>Actually Bill asked them to endorse his wife.  He has fond memories of the days he drove through Nevada.  Hey Bill, the one holding the H in the Hillary sign is a looker. This is the same group that supported your run in the 90's  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that's Hillary country.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Is that Chelsea in the picture  on the far right?</p>

<p> Hey, I thought Hillary got rid of all Bill's girl friends? How naïve do you have to be to think that socialism and higher taxes will give people more money to spend on hookers? Are the hookers in Russia or Cuba doing better than Vegas? Even if they are, Vlad and Fidel will be taking the cash away from them.</p>
