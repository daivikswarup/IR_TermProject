<p>Trump...only one who can beat Hillary.  And why she's on the ticket is beyond me...she carries lots of baggage into this election...a serious target for Trump common sense...</p>
<p></p>
<p> Its so funny, how all the pitiful news stations are talking about how its too late to stop Trump and how devastating it will be to the country if he wins lol! Makes me feel great to see them so angry, they aretrying to start a stop Trump movement, that will only make people love him more that's what they don't know</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Who are these fools who are voting? What a waste of a vote. Stupid Stupid Stupid. </p>
<p>I am a conservative, but I will not vote for Trump, I would rather abstain from voting.  Trump will and can not beat Hilary. </p>

All aboard !!<br/></p>
<p>I look at it like this, Either Dem candidate will ruin this nation quickly as they will get their policies in place even with a Republican Congress. We would be overrun by immigrants with no jobs skills while the Dems push for only high tech jobs as O is doing now. If a run of the mill republican gets in it's more of the same, tax tweaks to make it look like they're doing something among other non working fixes. With all the agendas of the left and the right we still can't afford them. The economy is number one and Trump is the only one with a chance at getting it right. It's time to do something different in order to expect something different. </p>
<p>How many immigrants from Syria, Afghanistan etc has been brought into the country while this election process dominates the news?</p>

<p>Hillary and Trump have the highest unfavorability ratings in their parties, but it should hurt Trump, but not Hillary? How does that work? </p>

Hope and Change was a fiasco, but Trump has been more detailed in how he plans to "make America great again" than Obama in Hope and Change. He just said he would change the Health Care situation, not which direction he would go with it. People just assumed he would bring in law suit caps etc that had been discussed for years. Not O'care as it stands today. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Sad how they just don't get it.  They created the idea that Trump is all those awful things by misrepresenting what he says time and time again.  He called Rosa and the Fox anchor a name after they insulted him mercilessly and he hates all women.  He thinks migration from the south should be subject to the same scrutiny that immigrants from the rest of the world must adhere to and he is xenophobic.  He says that we have to fix our screening process to keep terrorist out of the country and he hates all Muslims.  People can hear what he says and although it is often brash...it is not what the media has sensationalized it to be.  It is why no one trusts the media and we laugh when some pseudo-intellectual talk show host or media type provides us some analysis given to them by the corporate sponsored think tanks to manipulate us....the gig is up.  The ugliness that follows is the result of manipulation and outright lying by politically correct politicians for decades.  It's done!!!</p>

<p> Trump can only win by his divide and conquer approach with others in the Republican field. He is the only candidate who consistently loses to Hillary in a head-to-head, and consistently has the highest unfavorable rating. These consistent poll results are not aberrations; they are the result of his petulant, inarticulate, blustering and unintelligent style that feeds on the public's anger but insults their intelligence. That's why he's hit his favorable ceiling that has never seen the 40% level. He is a side show that panders to the media's obsession with ratings and profits, the metaphorical car accident that passers-by can't help but watch. </p>

<p>Trump business skills should be questioned a little harder.

This will mean nothing to his supporters because he can do no wrong in their eyes but to others well we will see</p>

<p>Trump is trying to protect America. The quaran verses 8:12, 5:33, 9:5 all call for the slay and /or maiming of Christians and Jews. Before you compare it to the Old Testament I don't know who all the -ites are but I do know who the unbelieving Christians and Jews are and 4.157 denies the crucifixion of christ. Says we brag about it but it didn't happen. Trump is an American not a sell out pc supposed Christian selling America out to another God.</p>
<p>Ummm the Jews deny the crucifixion of Christ, they don't believe any of the new testament. Muslims on the other hand do believe in Christ as a great prophet.</p>

<p><br/><br/>Those Alinsky-type tactics of ridiculing voters to make them fall in line, using statements like "Trump gets his support from non-college-educated-blue-collars" won't work anymore. It's been thoroughly debunked. CBS NH exit poll results show that Trump won the majority of voters in EVERY demographic including 38% of the vote from those who have some college or were currently enrolled in college, 32% of the vote from those with college degrees and 23% of the vote from those with postgraduate degrees.  <br/><br/>Trump also got 32% of voters with incomes over $100,000 and 31% of voters with incomes over $200,000 ~ almost 3 times as many as any other candidate. <br/></p>

His support has not changed when GOP had 17 candidates compared to when there was 6.. That means 70% of the gop voters are not for him.. You can not win a general election with 30%.. I don't disagree with you that the type of voters are across the board, you have a lot of anger out there. We can not vote on anger we must vote on who has the best understanding of the issues, the best solutions, who is most electable and who can heal/unite this country!!! Sorry but as an independent pollster Trump and Cruz are your 2 worse candidates. 70% of the independents will not vote for them and this has not changed . The GOP voters need to stop voting on anger and get to the details or we will see the Dems in the WH, the Senate go over to the Dems and the Supreme Court going to the Dems in the majority.. We deal with facts not anger or the media sound bites..</p>
<p>This is the same thinking that brought us McCain and Romney... it's not going to fly this time..</p>

It was his father who made the $$ and the Trump Empire not his son.. His father saw how his son wasted $$ and established his estate into a trust so that his son could not lose it all.. So many people refuse to do the research on all these candidates but we independents have to.. GO research and you may learn more about Trump but trust me you may not like what you find..</p>

Trump Vodka also failed.. Again Trump has the $B because his father knew how crazy his son was and setup his estate into a trust.. Trump has no control over the bulk of the trust and the investments.. So Trump had no control over the bulk of the $$ but he does get something like $30-50M each year from that trust and you are right if he had invested this properly he be up there with Buffet &amp; Gates.. He'll make the 19T debt look like pennies after 4 yrs, debt be in triple digits.</p>

So many people are so angry that fail to accept the facts.. Anger is what gave us Obama and the only thing that is stopping us from getting racist Democrat Trump are the electoral votes.. The GOP nominee will need to get 90% of the independents and right now 70% of the independents have stated they will never support Trump or Cruz.. Also, Trump can only win 30% of the GOP voters so just like in 2008 they stayed home. So no way can Trump have a chance of getting the electoral votes or even the majority votes to win in a general election. </p>
<p>Yeah that's what real clear politics stated as well. Trumps ceiling is very low, but dedicated</p>

Trump is not getting the independents and based on the Dems pollster he is not getting them either. A big 6% of Dems will go with him if it is Clinton and only 2% if it is Sanders.. We pollsters call our people just don't take a sample like you GOP .. Trump loses majority vote and definitely loses the electoral votes.. BTW, Cruz loses as well.. Only Rubio and Kasich are favored by Independents with Rubio higher than Kasich. </p>

Trump continually can only get 30% of the votes as the field decreases.. when gop had 17 candidates he got 30% and SC with 6 candidates he got 30%.. Just think 70% of the independents have stated they would never vote for trump or cruz.. You gop voters are hilarious and kidding yourself.. Trump loses to any Dem candidate. The only one who has a chance of winning is Rubio..</p>

<p>Well this is the problem with the media establishment. They're accustomed to controlling the narrative and it's slipping away from them. They cycle from delusion to tantrum mode with ever greater frequency. Until this last Tuesday I was an undecided. But listening to the panic on the night of the SC primary I was made nauseous. Now I'm leaning Trump. I don't care about the details anymore. Just burn it down!</p>
<p></p>
<p>What are you talking about, the media establishment is pumping trump into everyone's homes 24/7...</p>

The one where Jindahl also commented that the GOP has to stop being "The Stupid Party". Trump will get some Dem votes, but masses of ex-GOP independents will vote for D nominee. Also, don't preclude the phenomena of the McCain campaign's co-chairman, who admitted, after Palin fiasco, that she didn't vote, I think you will see a lot of that in GOP, people that are so repulsed and outright afraid of oblivious narcissist overboard cannon Trump that they will stay home or cross over. </p>

Most people are somewhere right in the middle and Trump represents that the best and is also why he will win. Bernie who?</p>
<p></p>
<p>The media does treat Trump unfairly. It is so obvious it needs no further discussion. But that is NOT why Trump attracts voters. To try to say only old angry white voters is ridiculous. Just look at his rally's, folks of ALL ages, color and personalities. His attraction goes much deeper than he tells it like it is, he tells what we CAN be as a nation if Washington could just agree on ANYTHING and make it happen. I believe he can and will win, despite all the lying, conniving and deceitfulness of his doubters and MSM. We have tried everything else with massive failures. Let Trump right the sinking ship we are all on and if feelings get hurt in the process so what. Sometimes, people need an old fashion shellacking.<br/></p>

<p> I am not a Trump fan, but I will admit I have said that the politicians have had their chance!!!!!!!! Maybe it's time the government was run like a business, couldn't be any worse than the job that the crooked lawyer politicians have done!!!!!! I will vote Trump.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hope the bankruptcy laws apply to the government so trump can fix that. Hehe</p>
<p>I don't understand the disdain that Trump has with Cruz. I don't like the way Cruz talks but I don't think he is a bad person. He did stand up against the machine in DC. I don't think Rubio is seasoned enough to be president at this time. Kasich reminds me of a crazy uncle. Carson is not assertive enough. I guess that leaves whoever wins the nomination because it will be a cold day when I vote for the hag<br/></p>

<p>They pray for a Cruz nomination, he loses big to either  Sanders or Clinton. So does trump against Sanders, less so but still loses to Clinton in all the swing states.</p>
