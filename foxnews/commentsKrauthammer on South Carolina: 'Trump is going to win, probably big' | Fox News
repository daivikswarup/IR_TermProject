<p>Mr Krauthammer epitomizes establishment thinking. He still believes that, despite the win in SC it could still be a three man race. First its about delegates and momentum.  I write this post the SC primary and Trump got nearly all - or ALL the delegates. Even if he only wins half the SEC states and then goes on to NY and Michigan in winner take all primaries... I am not seeing how he can be stopped. Who is going to do it? Cruz? Rubio? Not  a chance - especially as this all needs to happen within 30 - 45 days. Where is Krauthammer getting his math? I would really like to see those numbers - and have them explained to me. </p>

Old school Republicans just can't let go of the power. Trump will win. I just hope he does everything he says.</p>
<p>Trump would have to work with Congress if elected.How would that ever happen ?</p>
<p>I would love to go to Cuba before Americans destroy it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He's going to win no matter what. That's how sick we are of you establishment people selling out our country and trying to push us into your new world order. </p>
<p>Hurts, doesn't it, Cabbagepounder.<br/></p>
<p>The money changers tell both parties what to do.  Ever wonder why the GOP having both the Senate and House didn't defund or unravel the Socialist society we have evolved into?  The bankers control them, bought and paid for.  Mr. Trump is simply one of their minions.</p>
<p>Please don't support Hillary Clinton.  She doesn't have a clue on how to fix anything.  <br/></p>
<p>Instead of goinmg to Cuba, President Obama needs to go to a mental hospital. <br/></p>
<p>We're sick and tired of a sick Washington DC.  President Obama has done nothing to fix American problems.  <br/></p>
<p>If we fail to elect Donald Trump, we have failed to solve American problems.  <br/></p>
<p>Seven people shot and killed in Michigan.  We need Donald Trump now!<br/></p>
<p>All the pundits just blatantly assume that Cruz and Rubio are going to take all the votes that Kasich, Carson and Bush leave on the table.</p>

<p>I watch CNN now because FOX is obviously happy with conservative rhetoric, platitudes, promises, bravado, and oratory skills.  Conversely, they are also content with gridlock and bending to/with the Progressive movement in terms of policy.  Trump is NOT their man.</p>
<p>CNN is not the answer.  Any media outlet dubbed Constantly Negative News is probably not the best alternative.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is not the answer.  I believe he's an intelligent guy and would appoint intelligent people but, what does he really stand for?  Certainly conservatives who are starved for honest, decent leadership know he's not the answer.  He's a demagogue, another Huey Long with a much bigger ego.

<p>They were better than the others, but lately getting worse.</p>
<p>Could it be that either way we end up with a Democrat in the White House again? If Trump gets the nomination, he has a great chance of winning the Presidential election (Trump himself said he's more of a Democrat than a Republican). If he doesn't get the nomination, he will run third party (known as The Ross Perot maneuver) to ensure that his good friend Hillary gets elected.<br/></p>
<p>Krauthammer should be quiet until the votes are in.  Fat chance for the news glory hound.  Why?  Because Americans like to feel they've voted for the winner and they'll say so, even if they didn't.  ie it may sway the election, like announcing winners before all polls close.</p>
<p>None of Fox's Exit Polls agree with the voting results.  The vote is the only poll that counts. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Rubio 2016! Cruz says he's different than the establishment, but he uses the same sleazy political garbage to get people to vote for him just like a well oiled, super pac having, piece of DC garbage.</p>
<p>Those polls are meaningless at this point.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not sure why the pundits think that if the bottom three drop out that those votes go to "someone other than Trump".  Carson votes would mostly go to Trump.  Kaisch votes would mostly go to Trump.  Bush votes would split between the establishment candidates, Slippery Cruz and Clueless Rubio.</p>
<p>Rubio is a liberal. Cruz is the grand inquisitor</p>
<p>Really going out on a limb there, Chuck. </p>
<p>Who needs Krauthammer  tell  us that Trump will probably win SC big. I know it pains FOX news to admit this. This may be the kiss of death though as the "experts" have been right about very little in this election cycle.</p>
<p>Ted Cruz is within 4 points of Trump in the polls. Yes Donald, you actually have to spend money to wini support. Ted Cruz has the ground strategy because he knows what works. When the other candidates end their campaigns they will most likely endorse Ted Cruz because he is no Johnny come lately.</p>
<p>Hes within 4 points in his best poll. In poll(s) plural, trump has been ahead by far more than that in almost all polls. Oh, and BTW, Cruz is one of the least sincere, fakest politicians I've ever listened to. He says only what he thinks his followers want to hear. It's a facade. He is Romney 2.0</p>
<p>Or Clinton 3.0</p>

<p>hillary robbed bernie in nevada, i belive she will become the nominee though because thegame is rigged and it will be trump vs hillary and tump will win.</p>
<p>Hillary didn't rob Bernie. Socialism did. It gave the delegates that Bernie worked to get to Hillary. That sums up socialism. Take from those who work hard and give it to someone else. Perfect.</p>

<p>I think the good doctor needs another dose of his own medicine to understand that Trump will be the nominee.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Agreed. Just like they threw Ross Perot in the 92 election to split the GOP vote so Billy Bob could win. If Trump is not the GOP nominee he will cry he was treated unfairly and run on a third party ticket. Once again splitting the GOP vote and paving the way for and Clinton.</p>
<p>Time to retire hammer</p>
<p> In a one on one race, Cruz beats Trump by 20 points and gets the nomination.  There are a lot of uninformed, irrational people who want a demagogue who can address their anger. I understand people are angry (I am mad as heck).  However, Trump should be running on the democrat ticket.</p>
<p>Wrong</p>
<p>Correct, he is an independent.</p>

<p>He thinks the odds are that Trump is going to win, probably big. Holy Molely, how can anyone look at the numbers that place Trump 14 to 20 percent ahead of  Cruz, and not come up with such brilliantly impotent  profundity? Unless Trump gets accused of child molesting in the next few hours, he's going to win...big.  Have to hand it to Fox reporters. They not only look brain dead...they speak to the brain dead and promote as newsworthy that which would be obvious to an 8 year old.  These commentators get paid a lot, too, dont they?  Why did I work so hard to become educated. </p>

<p>Krauthammer using the term 'establishment vote' here indicates to me that he thinks the establishment has ownership over these voters, that's really a crock, voters are fed up with the establishment. Admit it Krauthammer, the establishment is toast and, while Bush is a great governor, Americans are going to make certain it isn't business as usual in Washington DC, and that is why Bush's campaign for president is toast. The establishment no longer has the influence over voters as you are trying to imply, and the purge of 20 - 30 year career politicians has begun. The sooner we bring on the term limits the better.  Get use to it Fox, you aren't to keep this fact on the shelf and hidden form just minded Americans. The word is TERM LIMITS!  Stop acting like communist and censoring the FACTS.    TERM  LIMITS!</p>

<p>So, separate but equal...that is old school.</p>
<p>Face it my Republican Colleagues. The race is essentially over and Donald Trump will be the nominee. 50 percent plus of the voters in the Republican Primaries are sick and tired with establishment candidates. This is why we are at the crossroads of the "Great American Experience". Cruz and Rubio need to protect their bread and butter! Politicians are career minded and feed off the people. The experiment has failed and we need non establishment candidates!</p>

<p>Sure keep telling yourself that.  I'm not a huge trump fan, but you need to deal with reality.</p>
<p>If we select Trump as our nominee we are guaranteeing another four years of Democrats in the ashore House.  I can't believe my fellow Republican voters are this stupid.</p>
<p>You sound like the ones we heard in the last two elections, only McCain can win, only Romney can win....great job.</p>
<p>The biggest news from these fox pundits..krauthammer..Rove and the ilk..Is what they DONT say..they never say as they did with W how confident they are in the eventual GOP nominee..that they will win in November or even have a prayer for that matter</p>
<p>Feminists, in the name of freeing women from male rule, told women they couldn't be stay-at-home moms. Now anti-establishment leaders, in the name of freeing the grassroots from the establishment, tell voters they can't vote for establishment candidates.</p>

<p>I have great respect for The intellect of Charles, but he is obviously trying to set up a Trump win as "lower than expectations". I always thought he was a straight shooter with us till now. With respect, I would like to hear or read his analysis of lowering middle class wages and living standards for the past 3 decades following terrible "free trade" deals and open immigration and their impact on the middle class. Trump has given voice to a new nationalism in the people. Where are the other politicians, maybe  they are "bought out".Just a thought.</p>

And over 90% don't want Bush.  Trump not being a conservative is what attracts people to him.  Conservative Americans are extremely angry with all the "conservaties" who have "reached across the isle (or jumped with both feet) to join the liberal/progressive democrats in destroying this country. To us the label of "True Conservative" is an insult to the REAL true conservatives, the American people.  These self proclaimed true conservative politicians and pundits are disgusting.</p>

"W" was the last one to try to use the military to build democracies. It does not work.<br/></p>

Rubio is being led around by his donors. He's for a comprehensive reform until he gets opposition. Then he abandons it. He is very hawkish on the middle east, which means the Israelis will manipulate him into going to war in Iran for more non-existent weapons of mass destruction. Cruz, Carson, Trump, and Bush are laughable when you think about qualities you want in a president. Kasich is the closest they have to an acceptable candidate but I doubt he has a chance for the nomination. <br/></p>
<p>every day they say hilliary is going to jail for breaking the law.guess what she is not in jail face reality.mccarthy was right about the bengazi hearing it wasnt about bengazi it was to take hilliary numbers down so she wont win the dnc.guess what no jail or she would be there and she will be madam president.the gop is so scared keep saying she broke the law and she is going to jail give us a date please.the gop has said that for over a year.if you broke the law you would go to jail now</p>
<p>Bernie is going to win the nomination.</p>

<p>Rubio won't win because he is the new darling of the Republican Establishment, and Cruz will have a very tough time due to his presentation. Trump may well go all the way to nomination,and I think he would eviscerate Sanders or hiliarous in ANY debate. It is becoming more and more clear that the dems are QUIEATLY looking for another candidate, or will just have one nominated at their convention. </p>

<p>how could you vote for rubio when he is absent from voting on important issues in the senate when he dont show up he has missed 68% votes.he is absent for work over 50%from senate meetings.were is he?look at his voting record.it is open record.look at how many days he is at work.open record.we would be fired if it was us for not being to work.he wants to be president with a record like that are you kidding.you dont need to mudsling his work record speaks for himself<br/><br/></p>
<p>Rubio can't manage his own finances and lives in a huge  debt despite earning top dollars. He never had a real job in his life. Cruz is a sleazy lawyer, he uses tricks to cheat. Nothing changes under Cruz or Rubio. We will have open boarders and crushing debt, no jobs under them.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Trump 2016!!! Trump is a true patriot .The rest of the bunch are bought politicians. No more Clinton, no more Bush. Enough is enough.<br/></p>
<p>Trump is a guy who has been very close to the Clintons his whole life, he will be very similar to Bill Clinton Im sure, He is no republican. We have a chance this election to vote in conservatives with values. Those candidates are here for the first time in over a decade. Rubio/Cruz these are our future! Trump is the past. Rubio and Cruz are men with values that would lead us on a course of real greatness. It would effect us for a generation!  </p>

You need a moderate. It is a fact. The reason that Reagan won (and the establishment did not want him) was that he was the Governor of a very liberal state and knew how to reach across the aisle to get things done. Rubio and Cruz say whatever is needed to get elected (like most politicians). Of the lot, I like Kasich and Bush because they have executive experience and understand how to build consensus. Governors make the best presidents.</p>
<p> Do you know what you get when 32 Fox News' reporters are in the same room? A full set of teeth. </p>
<p> It's not that Trump cannot be bought...it's what has Trump bought? He really does believe he can own it all.</p>

<p>We are so excited to vote for Donald J. Trump! So sick of establishment democrats and republicans! Time to clean house and get new people that don't have ties to lobbyists! </p>

I flip between stations when at the gym and MSNBC has had some very thoughtful commentators. Of course, they have some very liberal hosts but the political commentators are fairly neutral. FOX is predominantly right wing (with commentators actually favoring one candidate over another). What happened to fair and balanced?</p>
<p>We are done trusting the GOP established politicians. Sure, Cruz talks a great game , but he is already bought and paid for in full as are all the other candidates on both sides.</p>
