<p>Is Pope Francis going to have all of the walls torn down that surround the Vatican?</p>
<p> Pope Francis likes to follow the teachings of Jesus and US conservative Christians don't.</p>
<p>The late Pope John Paul II well understood that American capitalism and the civil society created by it has lifted more souls out of poverty than any other government in humanity's history.  Unfortunately. Pope Francis has been steeped in socialist broth since his birth, and has never grasped this fundamental concept.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Christianity; A religion based on the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.<br/> To profess that anything about Donald Trumps life, proposals, relationships, compassion, demeanor, or treatment of the weak and vulnerable is a reflection of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, is as baseless as his profession that he is a follower of Christianity, and can only be spouted be those equally deficient of its characteristics. To allow him to hide behind this cloak is to aid in the redefinition of what Christianity stands for, as well as its destruction. Donald Trump is the very antithesis of its principles, and the Pope could do no less than to point that out.<br/><br/></p>
<p>Judge Napolitano is absolutely correct.  Francis needs a bridle for his tongue to restrain his diarrhea of words. It is none of his business to interfere with political matters in US. Furthermore, he is a heretic and schismatic. Unless he is replaced soon, it will spell the downfall of Catholicism. Pope Benedict XVI, where are you when we need you?</p>
<p>Before Vatican 2?  Would this guy rather be uttering words in Latin that no one understands?  The Pope can opione on this if he wants and he wasn't speaking with infallibility anyway.  Further, all he was saying was that being inclusive isn't Christian.  </p>
<p>But it's OK for politicians and TV news personalities to "opine" about morality and religion, not to mention economics, national defense, and medical procedures? Oh, right. they are experts in all areas.</p>
<p>americans should not care - or listen to- what a foreign socialist says about OUR country and elections.  regardless of his position as Pope, he is NOT the one to judge !  that is above his pay grade!!!!<br/></p>
<p>The Pope is speaking as a spiritual leader; not a political leader.  As Pope, and head of the Church, he is responsible for the spirtitual well-being and conscience formation of all Catholics. I do believe his comment was misunderstood (there is an unfortunate history of this occuring). I believe he was speaking to Christian BEHAVIOR and did not intend to have it understood that Donald Trump is not a Christian. Please be reminded that Pope Francis was asked a question about Donald Trump; he did not intentionally bring him up in conversation. Another gotcha move by the media that was on the plane back to Rome with the Pope!</p>
<p>Not only do I think that the Pope should not try to judge who is and who is not a Christian, but Donald Trump should not have made comments regarding Ben Carson's faith as a 7th day Adventist or judging Ted Cruz's faith as a Christian.  Donald should keep his comments confined to policy issues and he should stop trying to judge whether or not Ted Cruz is a Christian. <br/></p>
<p>The Pope needs to start with tearing the walls down around the Vatican. </p>

And if the President wants gun "control" he should not have any (professional trained) security personnel. But somehow that <span>principle </span><span>doesn't apply to any other situation, e.g. if you're against abortion, go adopt an abandoned child. If you're against welfare, go work for a charity. If you think that war solves terrorism, go sign up.</span></p>

The climate change faithful make mistakes by ignoring current data that is contrary to the models that climate change leaders have said are settled science. <br/></p>
<p>This is the only pope to ever stick his nose into politics, something he knows nothing about.</p>
<p> The Pope should leave religious beliefs to sleazy politicians to push.</p>
<p>The Pope opines outside his area of expertise?... So does Napolitano.... BTW; what is Napolitano's area of expertise?.... Really...</p>

<p> So Christian teachings is outside the Pope's area of expertise??? He was stating the Christian view not the secular nationalistic view</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course the Pope knows nothing about a "Good Christian". Give me a break.</p>
<p>Where did the pope tell anyone who to vote for? He can state his opinion about anything he wants. Who made Napolatino in charge what the pope can and cannot say. FOX drags this goober out to give biased opinions. He looks like a holdover from the Sopranos. </p>
