<p>Ok, well, Have a good night friends, thanks for what you do, I want to clean up the dirtbags in Admin, all ideas welcome.</p>
<p>I think some cloud info on Barry is appropriate, as we have lost 3k spec ops from Barry COIN and ROE.</p>
<p>If you all on the inside can give us a hint how to move Barry out quicker, we are all ears.</p>

<p> Yep, real transparencies under Obama's rule. Thank goodness he will be gone soon. Please, we need a conservative in the Oval Office, not Hillary or Sanders.</p>
<p>The Obama virus will soon be eradicated.</p>

<p>just shows how bad it has really become in our government...no more integrity...get rid of the politcal appointees.<br/></p>
<p> Affirmative Action hard at work!</p>
<p>Just another example of Obama's transparency.  Remember all those promises he made to get elected?<br/></p>
<p>Anything to protect the "incompetent One". That's Obama for all you kool-aid drinking Grubers.</p>
<p>More dog whistles from Nunes. Hasn't been right yet</p>
<p>i'm telling you...when it is all said and done the DEMS are going to have to add a big hemorrhoid to their donkey logo to commemorate Obama's disastrous presidency  <br/></p>
<p>No wonder Obama is protecting Hillary...he ordered the same thing done to cover the truth about how badly he's failed in the middle east<br/></p>
<p>The personnel may alter and delete ....but there is always the original version still in the system - residing in the server. Of the utmost importance is 'who' gave the order for the deletion. </p>
<p>Personnel.. do not have the authority or access to do so.. you gotta wear gold on that uniform. <br/></p>

<p>His Royal Highness of the Oval Office has ordered us to not deliver bad news. He wants to report to his subjects that he's doing a mighty fine job.</p>
<p>The rest of the world must think that the American people are the stupidest people in the world for electing this lying,corrupt,incompetent,POS not once but twice.</p>
<p>And for some voters, twice in the same election. </p>

<p>I'm sure that the altering and deletion of records shifted in to high gear as soon as Obama appointed his black buddy, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin, to head up Central Command. Once all the files were deleted, and the cover-up complete,  Obama fired his lackey and appointed a new head of Central Command, Gen. Joseph L. Votel. What a disgrace. <br/></p>

<p>Hey, what difference does it make now?  That was Hillary's comment about Benghazi and so the military can use the same rationale.  In today's US government way of running things, anything goes and it's all ok to do.  Seems that's the mind set of this government, but then, we have a president who has done nothing but those type actions all his life and he's incapable of thinking he's doing anything wrong.  On top of that you have Kerry who lied all about his Vietnam service, Hillary who's lied all of her life, Valerie Jarrett who is simply a lie all the time, and on and on and on!  <br/></p>
