<p>Only 2 candidates are independent enough to represent American workers:  Bernie &amp; Donald.  The rest are corporate shills, relying too much on corporate donations.  Every other candidate will help corporations outsource American jobs, replacing Americans with illegals and immigrants to boost profits and reduce wages.  The news media itself is a corporate shill, more interested in corporate profits than American wages, no matter what false rhetoric they promote.</p>

<p>Trump specialty is casting aspersions to his "mob" on twitter and 
grabbing a news cycle of attention. He has done it several times to Mr. 
Cruz-for his staff repeating CNN's breaking news on Carson and then on 
whether he also was "eligible" to be President. I am sure this is his 
history of dispatching opposition as a developer, but I am sure it is 
not-presidential</p>

<p>One might forget many Black Americans including the current president have European ancestors. The same is true of Hispanics. In recent presidential elections the GOP has had 2 black candidates and 2 Hispanics. How many has the Democratic party had?</p>
<p>Only The current president</p>
<p>Trump is the candidate of European Americans.  90% of Republican voters are of European derivation.  The Democrats are the part of minorities and dissaffected groups such as homosexuals.  Because the nation is being flooded with non-Europeans, this may be the last presidential election that a pro-European candidate has a chance of winning.<br/></p>

<p>As America has gotten sick and tired of her self-serving, lying, progressive political class, the apparatus media is revealing it's true nature by openly attacking outsider Trump while endorsing the candidates birthed from the same mother. If this doesn't change in an election with long term results, I fear it will be relegated to change on the field of civil war. Our constitutional republic is under assault and close to being overthrown.</p>
<p>I am sick to death of the Bushes and sick of the Clintons and sick of career politicians in general.  We know what their politics are; we know what they have done or will do.  And we know that a Congressional house full of Republicans or Democrats doesn't matter one iota; they are all good ol' boys owned by the lobbyists, cramming their pockets full of dirty money, and NOTHING is going to change as long as we keep voting in the corruption that IS Washington, DC.  I want my country back and I am anxious to take a chance on someone who is non-PC, a known success, a take-charge leader and can tell the lobbyists to go jump in a volcano because we are mad as he!! and we're not gonna take it anymore.  If the truth offends, so be it.<br/></p>
<p>let me saying the real truth, Mr trump is someone who needs to be a more famous, and when i hear some of his speech, i think that i am watching his TV show on MBC 4. like an " entertainment ", he will not deserve to be  a president of United Stated.</p>

I Find that rather funny don't you Mr Barry from Honolulu ? Perhaps the American People should Demand from their Congressional representatives a complete Autopsy and complete investigation and lets find out once and for all who did this, trust this if it looks like a Duck and Quacks like a duck, Mr Obama Its a duck with a trillion dollar Quack !</p>

<p>I agree with Laura Ingraham on this as well.</p>
<p>I kind of agree with Ms. Ingraham on this one. In that regard has anyone noticed Trump's uncanny resembance in speech and attitude to David Mamet's Al Capone in The Untouchables?<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>No doubt Trump is playing hardball. I think the pundits will be increasingly surprised (dismayed??) to see Trump get away with crushing the Bush legacy. Conservatives/evangelicals, as much as we supported Bush during the Iraq war, know deep down that it backfired and we don't want to go down the regime change road again. The reality is, Trump is setting himself up to be much more competitive in the general election by making such a clear-cut break with the Bush legacy. He refuses to have that albatross hung around his neck by Hillary, Bernie, or the media come late summer/fall.</p>
<p>Trump will destroy whoever attacks him.  U don't want to get crush then don't attack.  hahaha pansies...</p>

<p>Yeah good luck. I'd rather have an incompetent socialist to an egomaniacal ignoramus. At least with Bernie he's not going to do much damage since all his promises are impractical. If you would vote for someone who claims he can make "America great again", you better ask what 'great' really means.</p>
<p>@infideli, Obama isn't having kittens--he's actively trying to promote Trump by denigrating him. By insulting him, he's calculating it will ignite people like you to vote for him to "show Obama". It's equivalent to rooting for the 16 seed in the NCAA tournament to beat the 1 seed because your team is #2. Democrats know they have a weak field. The only way for them to win is for Trump to win the nomination. It will hand the democrats both the Senate and the White House. And if that happens, you can blame yourself.</p>

<p>You took the works right out of my mouth.  His political ideology which has been documented too many times is that of Senator Sanders.  The difference is that Sanders is not a raging demogue who is dangerously unbalaced.  The latest real polling shows post debate that he is in a virtual tie with Senator Cruz.  Further, the Republican party powers that be will never let him be their standard bearer.  Take heart as things are looking better and, if you do, pray.</p>

<p>When Trump is elected you can bet countries like Iran, China, and Russia will be much easier to negotiate with. Am sure he won't beg Iran to take $150 billion from us so they can buy better weapons and support more terrorism.</p>

<p>Like Marc Cuban said, after Trump is elected, you're going to see something completely different. He knows him. Trump isn't a loose cannon. He's an alpha male that knows he can't let up for one minute and still win. If he tones it down, he'll be set upon like being attacked by hyenas.</p>

<p>Compare him to hillary talk about greedy grubbing politician the Clinton are at the top bill wants in the white house to chance some more tail around really that's your choice over Trump he blows the Clintons away</p>

<p>Loose canon wow Obama a loose canon a loose canon worth 5-1o billion if he was that bad he would not be successful</p>
<p>Trump is far ahead of all Republicans. I can't see how anyone can't see that. His negatives have been going down from the start. His positives have been going up from the start. What is it You don't get? Obama's giving birth to kittens over his successes. The media have thrown every kitchen sink they have at him. This weekend he's walking away with South Carolina. After that who's going to stop him? He's not dependent on " likely voters" Republican or not. Trump is winning.</p>

<p>I am not to fond of any of the candidates for the GOP and definitely can't stand Hillary or Sanders but Trump is a totally loose cannon in my opinion. We already have a mental case in the White House now.. why would we even want another one??? Isn't 8 years of a psycho enough for one nation??</p>

<p>Give Trump credit he is a clean slate most recent president who would be able to No have  not tried pot or coke the guy's a straight shooting money machine</p>
<p> I do not know why Jeb Bush has any support at all. What his supporters do not understand? At the end of George W Bush presidency, economy was in gutter. In this campaign Jeb Bush has spent hundreds of millions but still at the bottom. These brother do not have any handle on economy, they just know how to spend and have no idea how to spend optimally and also get the work done. I think Senior Bush failed to teach these boys this important lesson. They are good sons but have no idea how to work by spending minimum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A vote for Trump puts Hillary in the White House. Plain and simple. No swing voters will vote for him and a maximum of 35% of Republicans have a favorable view of him. He can't work with others, and he doesn't even have the support of Republican governors. Please don't throw your vote away!</p>

Plain and simple. Also, Jack, Trump didn't stumble blindly into this race. He has to play the ball where it is,which is the confused mob that is America. He does nothing without a plan to win. A television show does not a winner make. He never loses. Be thankful for even one term of Trump. That's all he'll need. Then establishment law and political students can resume talking our problems to death.</p>

<p>I'd rather waste a vote on Trump than any of the "Establishment" Republicans.  What has come out of them in the last eight years?  They can't pass a budget.  Where is their alternative healthcare plan (and I don't accept "free market" as a plan).  Investigations of the Clintons only wasted money.  I'll bet on a wild card at this point.</p>
<p>Consider how Trump acts when confronted with his competition, he lashes out with insults and attacks at the lowest level, no regard for anything but payback... now consider if he was President and his first meeting with Putin the Russian leader treats Trump less than he feels is deserved and perceives it as a slight to his office, how do you think Trump then acts? Does he brush it off? Does he laugh it off? Or does he act like the man we've seen over the last 8 months and lashes out using the might of the nation as his hammer? We all know the answer... and that's after he goes after China, life becomes a very dangerous game with a man like Trump with his hand on the buttons.<br/></p>

This man has been meeting and doing deals with leaders and heads of corporations since the 70's.  Has ONE of them come forward and said he did a dirty deal?  No.   Not one.  He's going to straighten out this country because we NEED it!   How in God's name will we sustain this crippling debt?  Four more years of "progressive" spending - totally out of control - and we are a country gone under.  There will be no country to fight over, left or right.   TRUMP 2016!</p>
