<p> I love all you frothy mouthed people,, you would not know a good candidate if it kicked you in the pants,,,someone who does not owe any pac, or party favors ,, is not bought and paid for , like the rest of them,, maybe we can get a clean sweep an get all the deadwood out ,,,</p>
<p>The idea of Trump vs Sanders or Clinton feels like a waking nightmare that is coming true. Then when I start pondering "Maybe someone can swoop in and save the day..." I am reminded Cruz and Rubio are the next two behind Trump. I am generally a pretty optimistic guy but it's definitely starting to wane. I know it's bad when my wife says, "Trump vs Clinton....I may have to vote for Clinton. Trump vs Sanders....we may have to look into moving to Canada."</p>
<p>Krauthammer is a hack, he's been turned by the GOP establishment. I used to listen to him, now I just change the channel.... hot air, all about his pompus attitude. GO  TRUMP, party like it's 1776!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> The GOP will lose if more corruption is aimed at Trump  The Trump supporters will not vote at all in protest!  Everyone loses and you get Hillary!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why is the GOP against Trump and also Cruz seems like they don't want their apple-cart upset. I used to be a proud Reagan Republican but now I am thing of going independent.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>Not everyone voting for Cruz, Rubio, Bush, etc, is voting 'against trump'.</p>
<p>Well you can bank Jeb,Rubio, and kasich voters are anti trump, Cruz and Carson could go to trump</p>
<p></p>
<p> Oh, it will consolidate - and just in time. There is no way the GOP party elders (Reince Priebus, the Board, etc.) are going to stand idly by and just hope that everything works out. If the GOP allows Trump to become the nominee, they will lose the White House, the senate, and the SCOTUS balance will go hard left. Too much is at stake here to gamble that Trump can win it all - he simply can't. Even ~60% of Republican voters do not like him. (!)  In the meantime, the media is having a "field day"(literally) with creating another horse race. It's all about the ratings:  $$</p>
<p>The RNC and the establishment Republicans are doing more damage to the party than the Democrats.  The establishment Republicans are disenfranchising their own base.  As it stands now I believe the establishment Republicans have already lost to the Democrats, because of all the in fighting, and negative propaganda they are spewing.</p>

<p>This is a continuation of Fox news  efforts to stop Mr. Trump . Trump will not be controlled by them or the big donors. I was an avid Fox watcher but have cut my viewing to about 50/50 with CNN. Cnn seems much fairer to me.</p>

I still watch some of shows but do switch channels when they start the establishment propaganda. CNN is far from perfect too but some of their journalists are professional. One America News is another option that I have started watching.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>If we don't stick with TRUMP 2016, we will get what the MEDIA wants. We don't need no stinking RINO's, TRUMP 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe the GOP blows and that is why Trump is winning. Some major introspection is needed.  Anti-science, anti-anything-Obama, anti-big-Gov't is not a strategy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>if you don't like Trump, pick one of the remaining candidates.. and pick a Natural Born Citizen.  Governor John Kasich is the only remaining governor in the race.  He helped Newt Gingrich and others design the Balanced Budget we had when Bush became president.  John Kasich took a massive deficit in Ohio, and, using the same formulas, turned it into a surplus.</p>
<p> Remember that political pundits do what they do for a living: Talk about policy. Now, Charles is a very astute and normally highly accurate analyst. However, my view is that, you cannot evaluate Mr Trump on the basis of the past and what he has said in the past.He - like many of us - see this country slipping away, and we/he want to stop that slide, by being bold if necessary.  The GOP Establishment offers what the Pundits offer -- lots of talk about policy, followed by little to no action! We are tired of that. The Democrat socialist party wants to lead America in Soviet / European Socialism, but America is not going to have that! I served nearly 30 years in the Navy to defeat Socialism and Communism, and I'm dammed if I'll vote it in!</p>

<p>Thanks Krauthammer for the math lesson!  If Trump already has all the supporters he is going to get and all the other candidates drop out except one then Trump will lose. That's easier said than done.  The big "if" is when a candidate drops out will any of his supporters go to Trump. If some do he could still win.  If not he will lose. Addition today! Stars for everyone!</p>

<p>Hmmm... Krauthammer is assuming that every pro 'other; candidate vote is really an anti-Trump vote. If you buy that assumption then perhaps Krauthammer is right... but it would be a first in in the history of  primaries... and even if true would not say much for the 'other' candidate in that they get the vote because their voters are voting against someone rather than for themselves. I don't buy any of Krauthammers arguments in this arena - he has been anti-Trump from the get go, and as time has gone on he is now beginning to live in fantasy land. </p>

<p> I've been saying that for 3 months. But the egos of the rest of the field prevent them from dropping out. So, Trump will either win outright, or there be a brokered convention. I'm sure that is what Bush is banking on. Hang in there and then the coronation (like Hillary).</p>

<p>Good pts but i think the winning combo is Rubio/Martinez. Susana helps neutralize the latino and female vote at least somewhat. She gets the GOP 2 more % pts in the electorate. Yes Kasich helps deliver Ohio but Martinez will better strengthen GOP chances nationally in regaining Nevada, Colorado, Virginia, Florida. All of this while still having a great shot at Ohio also. I believe she is the ONLY choice for VP if the GOP wants a clear victory.</p>

Rubio and MArtinez sounds like having a Hispanic duo at the top of the ticket. I can see how that might pull in 2% more of the Latino vote while losing 40% of the American vote. Super good plan. Yeah right.</p>

He is going to go through all the departments and find the waste and fraud and cut it. He is going to allow the people who have money offshore that have wanted to get it back into the US for years, to get it back here for a small fee. He will bring companies back to America which will bring jobs back by placing tariffs on them and making the tax rate here affordable. He also put out a great tax plan if you would go to his website and do some reading before spewing nonsense. ALL of these and many more plans he has put out will help the middle class tremendously.</p>

Period.  The people supporting him are angry and disaffected.  For the most part...they have not voted previously, and will not vote this time.</p>

<p>After South Carolina there needs to be a weed out of weaker candidates, those candidates need to bury the hatchet and back the strongest non Trump.</p>

But the small problem is : there's no "strongest non Trump".<br/></p>
<p>GOP can't even get out of their own way to push Trump out.  Haha how could they even try to lead a country.  Let alone the biggest best country in the world.  Jokers</p>

"People" can express themselves by voting. Did you ever heard about the word "people" ? GOP, Ds and the Media are not the people, my friend. This is why Mr. Trump will be the 45th president. Very simple, indeed.<br/></p>
