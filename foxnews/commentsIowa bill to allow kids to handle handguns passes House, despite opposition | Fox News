<p><span>The Second Amendment is a doomsday provision, one designed for those exceptionally rare circumstances where all other rights have failed -- where the government refuses to stand for reelection and silences those who protest; where courts have lost the courage to oppose, or can find no one to enforce their decrees. However improbable these contingencies may seem today, facing them unprepared is a mistake a free people get to make only once</span></p>
<p>a thought occurred to me... Why not train your kids to use BBs and airsoft until they are of age? It is safer, can still train them, and I think is a good compromise</p>
<p></p>
<p>We had 4H 22 rifle/air rifle activities at our local school when I was in school. Kids that participated, were instructed to bring their cased rifle to school, on the bus. You carried your rifle to the classroom, put them in a closet, then took them out of the closet after school. The 4H instructors supplied the ammunition, and we practiced on a makeshift range behind the school.  </p>
<p>Yes but the generation that raised you were better parents in general than the generation that raised us</p>

Many parents these days don't take the time to instill morals and values in their children.</p>
<p> If more children were taught respect for  and how to safely handle firearms, there would be fewer tragedies.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Went through firearms training at eight years old and was actually more complex then my POST training by the state government. Could hit their targets with a rock.</p>
<p>With proper training and super vision no problem.  My parents let me start shooting at 10 years of age.</p>
<p>I suspect to read about these two girls one day. I'm betting they will be winning many trophy's in shooting competition's 1000+ yards in the near future, you go girls :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>stop telling us what we can or can not teach OUR kids. stay the _ out of our lives.<br/></p>

<p>Still suffering from a vacancy of the cranium I see. Probably why  your lack of comprehension is so predominant</p>
<p>That is an untrue and bigotted statement.  As a conservative libertarian who is a staunch 2nd Amendment supporter, I spent 18 years working as an LEO (in the real world,  not your progressive liberal fantasy world) taking scores of illegally possessed firearms off the streets.  Other than parrot liberal anti-gun talking points, which are based on lies, fabrications, half truths and false statistics, what have you done for YOUR community to proactively curb the Villeneuve's problem in this country?</p>

<p><span>"What this bill does, the bill before us, allows for 1-year-olds, 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds, 4-year-olds to operate handguns,” Democratic Rep.says ... Don't they always overthink a reasonable/logical bill - Yet don't worry about consequences  of bills that meet their chosen agenda? (marijuana, 15 dollar minimum wage, fracking, gun free zones, etc)</span></p>
<p> It is still a lot safer out in public with all the guns ,than in a mothers womb</p>
<p>lol! </p>
<p> I had m first gun was 7. I bought my granddaughter her gun at 8,but her brother is now 9 and I wouldn't trust stick. it all depends on the child.</p>
<p>Listen up Liberals ----I have a Buddies Little asian daughter who is 80 Lbs shooting My 44 MAGNUM  with mid range loads and she shoots up all my reloads I can give her !!!  DEAL with it !!<br/></p>
<p>Note that the law doesn't prohibit kids from being armed.  It prohibits them from even TOUCHING a handgun, even under close adult supervision.  <br/><br/>That is just childish.  <br/><br/>A quick Google perusal of Department of Health statistics shows that kids in Iowa are no less likely to be accidentally shot by handguns than other states.  The law is having no effect, not surprisingly.<br/><br/>I taught my kids to handle guns from the earliest ages they could possibly do so.  The result is that guns hold no fascination for them.  Guns are just a fact of life.  They don't play with guns because they know they can go shooting with Dad any time they want to.....and, in fact, would probably like to do so less often than I make them do it.<br/><br/>Let parents parent.  It's OUR job.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Actually typing in accidental gun death for children by state pulls up the CDC which tracks it.   May not be directly the department of health but close.  Swing and a miss by jiggy</p>
<p></p>
<p>I got my first handgun when I was 12. Grew up in the woods so was no big thing to go out shooting by myself. Surprisingly, I never shot myself or anybody else. It should be up to the discretion of the parents who know their children's maturity and responsability level, and not the government, who knows virtually nothing at all about anything at all.</p>
<p>On my 13th birthday my parents gave me a Ruger Blackhawk 22 cal single 6. I still have it and plunk tin cans.  Kids can be responsible if you teach them.</p>
<p> UNBELIEVABLE....GEE NOW THEY WILL GET TO PLAY COPS &amp; ROBBERS WITH REAL GUNS!!!!!</p>
<p>Liberals shoot liberals all the time. How about we ban all liberals from owning guns? I bet it will cut the murder and crime rate by 99%.</p>

<p> I was shooting guns as a kid when I was 10 years old because I was taught to respect them and was taught serious gun safety....and  I remember even being  scolded for  pointing a cap gun carelessly ...those gun safety lessons have stayed with me all my life... and teaching gun safety and develop  shooting skills in kids is a positive thing.</p>
<p>what is sad is that Mom and Dad should be able to address this on a need to need basis and at most have the children pass a test by the shooting range. Why do we need a law for every little thing. The Liberals are taking this to levels that it does not need to go. Just more division from the left and as always leaving the rights of the parents and children out. I am glad the bill passed. And hopefully it is signed into law. When I was a youngster we took a gun safety class and then got a permit. What is the big issues here anyway. It is a sport for some kids. Let them have some fun and learn. </p>

<p> For all the gun control nuts here.  There are about 357 million firearms in the US. There are about 36000 deaths linked to firearms in any way yearly in the US. Simple math shows that means .0001 percent of firearms were involved in any way in deaths. What percentage of drug dealers are involved in deaths? How about drunk drivers? Or better yet, gang members? </p>

The NRA has taught gun safety and gun responsibility for years. And the NRA is made of up over 5 million Americans. The problem is with people; the say they are brought up, the ones who don't take their medication and the civil rights people fight to make sure they don't have to, and judges handing down lenient sentences so that people never seem to pay the consequences for right and wrong.  I was born in Kansas. I was hunting in Kansas when I was a kid and bird dogging for my dad on hunting trips as soon as I was old enough to learn to stay behind the gun line. These girls are blessed with a father who stands up for them, teaches them gun safety and responsibility and the proper way of getting things done through legal government action. In my sixties now, I love looking back on hunting trips with my father, shooting trap, and target shooting.  The first thing he taught me was safety and the difference between right and wrong. The problem with guys like you is that you want to make good people in the world responsible for people who do wrong.  <br/></p>

<p>Gun control as I taught my children is a good stance, line of sight and two hands.<br/></p>
<p>Patriots are made when government is abusive, this is the true meaning of the 2nd Amendment and it lives and breaths thru out America today as it has for the past 240 years.<br/></p>
<p>No crime to hennas, no charge to insane would ever make me hand over my rights and liberties for the out come of what is to follow would be far worse. <br/></p>
<p>Kids watch tv, and go to the movies, they know all you have to do is pick up a gun and pull the trigger.  If you are going to have weapons in the house, it's going to draw their attention. There is nothing wrong with teaching them about it, to respect it, and safety.  But most importantly keep the weapons secured.  Remember these are children, and you can't be watching them 24/7.</p>
<p>To the liberals that hate the 2nd Amendment, you should know because of that right you can post your hatred for this country and not be jailed for it.<br/></p>

<p> I'll try to keep this short. I have two sons, 4 and 6, and they both know how to shoot a gun and drive a car/truck(with a manual transmission). They both do so under my close supervision. Both my sons know the danger and consequences of what a gun can do because they have seen me shoot deer, opossums, and many other animals. I did not shoot these animals because I am a crazed gun wielding shoot'em all wacko but rather because I enjoy the taste of wild meat and I also don't like to see an animal suffer. I also know the consequences and effects of what a gun can do since I have spent the last 22 years serving this country and spent the last 15 of them bouncing back and forth between one sandbox and another. I just retired from being in the Special Operations and have spent years teaching countless foreign militaries how to properly use a gun to defend themselves. Because of this I believe I am fully qualified to teach my own sons how to properly handle a weapon. Unfortunately I have seen first hand what a gun, RPG, explosives, etc can do to a person and it's not pretty. I want my sons to be able to safely handle a weapon and defend themselves, defend me, defend other family and friends if God forbid they need to. If this upsets some of you well to bad, I am not going to apologize for this. They are my sons and I will raise them how I want.  </p>

<p>Many children are more stable and mature than the liberals.<br/></p>
<p>Most aren't</p>
<p>By all means, instill all your fears in your child. Good parenting</p>

<p>So libbies, no one is asking you teach your kids about guns and that is fine.  Stick to teaching them how to bake gay wedding cakes, go on welfare and steal cable TV. You know, what you are good at.</p>

<p>ARM THE KIDS! WE NEED MORE GUNS SO WE CAN ALL FEEL AWESOME! GUNS MAKE YOU AWESOME! YOU CAN'T BE AWESOME WITHOUT GUNS! 'MURICA!</p>
<p>There are better things to teach your kids than gun safety. Just don't give them a gun in the first place.</p>

STOP  2. DON'T TOUCH  3. RUN AWAY 4. TELL A GROWNUP .  These simple rules, if followed, will ensure gun safety for very young children and liberals of all ages.  Be safe.</p>
