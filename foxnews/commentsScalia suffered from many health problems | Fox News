<p>"<span>Scalia suffered from many health problems" especially the very one that killed him at the ranch!</span></p>
<p> Supreme Court Justice, life long Catholic, 9 children and one a Priest.  Dies in sleep at 79.  That sounds like a pretty successful life to me.</p>
<p>I take umbrage to Your comments.  A Supreme Court Justice can certainly be called successful in a way.  However, how can anyone consider a person successful one who because he doesn't take care of his health so as to become obese and become diabetic, who wrecks his health by smoking, and who flaunts his unhealthy lifestye.  I don't care if he's a lifelong Catholic, or if his son is a priest.  Who cares.  We all know that the population of priests are full of closet homosexuals, sexual abusers, and those who know about them and allow it.  And do Catholics have higher morals than the average population?  Show me any study.</p>

<p>An autopsy would have also determined if there were any physical causes of cognition changes.  His recent opinions seemed a little out of character.  The family might have wanted to avoid that.<br/></p>
<p>Quite a role model: Drinks every day, smokes cigarettes, eats like a pig, and refuses to follow scientific evidence about his health. Yeah, a real intellectual giant alright.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but when a morbidly obese 79-year-old smoker dies of a heart attack, my first thought is: <strong><em><u>CONSPIRACY!!!!!</u></em></strong></p>

<p> Unbelievable! A list of thins he could of died from. So SOP is no autopsy on any member of supreme court? They just drop and blame it on health issues? Natural or not, SOP should be autopsy to discourage foul play.</p>
<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:6e2bc949-c2e1-4070-b6de-5ea28c3a0a70@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">PeterHayden</span></a> Ask your local medical examiner.  No, an autopsy is not SOP.</p>
<p>The only "foul play" here was that of Justice Scalia himself.</p>
<p> If anyone killed him, it would be Ted Cruz. Scalia would have been the only one standing between Ted and him turning our government into a theocracy</p>
<p>I believe, again, if the family would had thought something was not right they would had asked for an autopsy. That is, if they thought his life was taken in purpose. However, this seems more and more a case of just plain health failing or a private matter that would look very sordid if it comes up. So, I believe an autopsy would fire back for conservatives. </p>
<p>Scalia's health did not "fail". Scalia failed to take care of his health.</p>
<p> Honestly, I do not believe anybody killed him. If anything out of the ordinary took place it may have been something personal. Perhaps he was not alone, and frankly who cares. </p>
<p>No autopsy was necessary?  What a joke!   We will never know what really killed him and an autopsy would have settled it.  That one was not done is very suspicious, no matter what anyone else says, especially a sheriff who happens to be a Democrat.   You can't tell me no one thought one was necessary, that there would be no suspicions.  To say otherwise is ludicrous.  </p>

<p><strong>Well there is some good news in this story about no autopsy for Scalia,,,,if one morning Obama is found deceased in his bed THERE WILL NOT BE AN AUTOPSY DONE</strong> </p>
<p>Is that why they did no autopsy and rushed his body out of Texas before any second thoughts could bring about an autopsy?</p>
<p>His health declined after being exposed to Obamascare Ponzi Scheme<br/></p>
<p>Family declined an autopsy because they didn't want it to get out that Scalia suffered from dementia.</p>

<p>Re
“Scalia suffered from many health problems”; Was the final health
problem due to binary chemicals?</p>

<p> Why is it that the word "probably" is used? If there had been an autopsy there would be an actual cause &amp; people would accept it. Did he have his C-pap machine with him? Why was their a pillow over his head? Sure, he had a list of "health issues" but no one knows which malady caused his death specifically. Until then, it's rather suspicious given the fact that Obama has cases on the SC docket.</p>
<p></p>

<p>So he had a lot of health problems.  I have to imagine that he had deaththreats made against him over the course of his lifetime, being in the high profile position that he was in.  We don't know his cause of death, due to incompetence.  </p>
<p> Very convenient circumstances.  That alone should have warranted an autopsy.  </p>
<p> He was 79 years old, smoked, was over weight, had diabetes, etc.  He died a good death.  What do I mean by that, he was on a vacation, doing what he loved hunting, with his friends and died in his sleep.  No nursing home, no hospitals, surgeries, no dementia, no pain.  Quick, sudden and in his sleep.  Many a person would've been happy with that type of death.  RIP your Honor.  </p>

<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:7da704d6-fc44-4f4b-a773-d38a056aa93e@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">lemmdus</span></a> I was thinking the same, however with him having diabetes it would be easy to be injected with too much insulin by him or some else and nobody would be the wiser. </p>
<p>so now the spin is to recite his health problems, many of which are standard for someone around his age give or take 10 years.  BIG mistake not doing an autopsy to confirm cause of death.</p>

<p>His most serious health condition was asphyxiation caused by a pillow...</p>
<p>All his health problems &amp; yet he lived to 79.............that guy was truly "Superman" both physically (all things considered) and certainly intellectually....................... Of course the Conspiracy crowd will be working overtime now............... maybe a Ninja "suction-cup" walked up the side of the building at night and stuck the Justice with an umbrella tip that contained Delerium-25...............................maybe?</p>

<p>How about dying in TEXAS</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hogwash Obama had him killed</p>
<p>One question.....back when Kennedy was offed by the D.C. crowd, it was Texas law that there had to be an autopsy. There was a big stink that the Feds stole the body without allowing the proper autopsy. Have the laws there changed since then?? Just asking.<br/></p>

<p>maybe he was the one hold out from obomas band of slack jaws forcing perversion on our land ? and obooger had him offed ?<br/></p>
<p>Maybe you need to suffer the same fate.</p>

Just maybe. Case in point  - current administration. Perhaps the president would have made a few correct decisions with 10 more years of on the job training.
