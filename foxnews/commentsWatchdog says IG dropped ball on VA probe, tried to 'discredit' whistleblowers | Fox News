<p> Trump might not be the answer to all the problems and he has some flaws too, but we need to get this country out of the hands of the establishment and headed in a new direction.  Every week we read the same stories and the establishment does nothing about it.  Lets make America great again and make sure we vote out all the incumbents and vote in a new face to take on the establishment.</p>
<p>The VA is rotten to the core.  Discharge all Regional and District Directors, all Senior Service, and Secretaries.  In short, Medical and Asst Medical Directors on up.  You can't change one apple in the barrel and not expect the contamination that is rampant to stop.  That's how infection works.<br/></p>
<p>Mandate that all members of Congress and the White House staff, present and retired, and their families, ONLY receive care through the VA and the problem would be fixed in 60 days.</p>
<p>The individual(s) involved at OIG need to be terminated and prosecuted, then banned from public employment for life. Of course, there's almost zero accountability in government because of decades of the incestuous relationship between government employees, their unions, and the democrats they bankroll</p>
<p>These Governmental entities are not above scrutiny, their employee's are not above the law just as no citizen is above the Law, how the idea of prosecuting  people for coming forward and exposing the wrong doings of government or business has been allowed to happen  i cannot understand.  Laws are made and passed by congress and the Senate therefore the law makers are responsible for these egregious actions upon the people ,when they are supposed to be protecting the rights of the citizen they instead have allowed the citizens rights to be violated.</p>
<p>Failure at its best <br/></p>
<p>We need to send our vets to private docs and hospitals, then pay the bill. No insurance would be involved. It is already being tried on a limited basis and it is working. We should sell every V A hospital and fire every doc. Why do so called conservatives support the V A socialized medicine scheme? </p>
<p>Obama's near single digit approval rating from the military says it all....and liberals want to elect the female version of Obama. More of the same.</p>
<p>My father was killed in action in Korea. I gave my legs in Desert Storm. My oldest is still dead in Iraq somewhere. We were wrong. Wrong to fight for the American Gov. It IS evil as the enemy says.  11Th. ACR Dark Horse Air.</p>

<p>The VA has utterly failed those who have served and it's a disgrace!  More disgraceful is the claim that putting a veteran in charge would "change things!"  Only change been made at the VA is more aggravated veterans not receiving services! <br/></p>
<p>within this lawless, obfuscating obama cabal, nothing gets investigated...scandal after abuse after outrage...nothing</p>
<p>Once again republicans fail. Don't know why any military member would ever vote R. Senseless.</p>

<p> hi</p>
<p>The public sector unions are far more important at the VA than the veterans.  The best thing that #45 could do in 2017 to fix DC is to disband all of the public sector unions.<br/></p>
<p>Bah!  This administration looks at the military only as cannon fodder for social experimentation.  Otherwise they wouldn't give one rip.</p>

<p>I'm U.S. Army retired  and have been using the VA Hospital in Dublin, GA for the past 13 years.  I've had two major operations during that time and can't really complain about my medical treatment or the availability of care I need.  The only time things get bad is when I'm sent to Atlanta to see a specialist, then things start going downhill rapidly.  Fortunately, my trips to Atlanta are infrequent. The medical doctors and nurses at the VA have been fair to excellent, it's just the army of often worthless hospital staff and administrators that turn things into a nightmare.  Nearly all of them are affirmative action hires and it shows.<br/></p>

<p>HEY POLICE AND CURRENT MILITARY? WHAT-CHA GONNA DO WHEN THEY COME FO YOU PENSIONS AND BENE'S LIKE THEY ARE IN SOME PLACES NOW?</p>
<p>Criminal charges need to be brought against ANYONE in the VA IG office who tried to prosecute whistleblowers. Better yet, just go through and fire the top 10 percent of the VA management nationwide. That will get  the attention of the remaining 90 percent that they better do the jobs they were hired to do, or they'll get fired too.</p>
<p>Us veterans have been saying it for YEARS now that the VA Office of Inspector General is really the VA Office of Enablers and have NO interest at all either in investigations or prosecutions for misconduct. This is one more nail driven in the coffin of "oversight" at the VA and is the start of making a very good case to legislate a new FIX at VA that concisely switches over police authority against the VA to the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. We are fed up with partisan majorities who run the House and Senate Veterans Committees and only cherry-pick enforcement issues according to how well it serves their hate-crime purposes for the next election day. It's time that veterans and medical patients get real and genuine police protection from the Dept. of Justice and never mind the baloney and deceptive Office of Enablers that OIG has truly become. ---- Sue Frasier, Army 1970, national veterans activist.</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, if Trump gets elected some of these gov. crooks will finally get fired and/or jailed instead of promoted with a healthy raise.  The American people have had it and one way or the other the Belt Way is going to get the message.</p>
<p>enough is enough.  What we need is a list of the names of those responsible including their home addresses, pictures, phone numbers, and info on their family members.  Maybe some veterans who have lost loved ones will pay them a call. </p>

<p>The incompetence and corruption of officials in the Obama administration is killing American veterans.</p>
<p><span>Why is it that when two Dept. of Veteran's Affairs
employees,Diana Rubens and Kimberly
Graves, defrauded the VA for $400,000. prosecutors in the </span><span>U.S.</span><span> attorney's office for the </span><span>District of Columbia</span><span> wouldn't bring charges against them? Not only not bring
charges against them but they have not been fired and if it's the same ole when
government employees commit crimes, they'll probably be given bonuses. Seems
like we have laws for us common folk but our President, Congress and government
employees can commit crimes and there are no consequences. Is this Carolyn Lerner any relation to Lois Lerner?</span> <br/></p>

<p> What a surprise!  Corruption and incompetence in government!  The surprise is that about 10% do over 90% of the work the rest are parasites to the taxpayers.</p>
<p> Just like the Lois Lerner scandal in the IRS, Liberals LIE, DENY, BLAME, Destroy all evidence, It's all they know. How do you think they lost 96 million dollars ? They split it between all the leaders and destroyed the evidence. Liberals do not actually know how to be responsible, that is why they push for Public Union tax funded jobs, they can never make it in a real job where you are held responsible for a task before actually getting a bonus for failing.</p>
<p> most corrupt administration ever.</p>
