<p>Privatization will be much better than current conditions<br/></p>
<p>Get the Union PATCO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>rinos screwing us all over again , keep up the good work you are just making sure  trump will win the presidency . <br/></p>
<p>Privatize, it's safer.</p>
<p>Privatizing Air Traffic Control is the best thing that could happen to aviation.  It should have been done in 1981 when PATCO went on strike.  Currently, the things government are doing to ATC are pathetic and will ultimately downgrade it to a very unsafe profession.  Government does not know what's best for aviation and never has.  Time for a change, actually it is way past time for a change.</p>
<p>The very idea of "privatizing" essential elements of our safety and security is a terrible idea.  We have to look no further than the Pentagon to see how the greed for profits undermines all that we need from these agencies.  Forget it, we may risk our children in the Pentagon fiasco, but we will not risk our own skins with <span>some corporation's lowest bid and untrained employees guiding our airplanes. </span></p>

<p>I am not surprised. To think the RINO's would reduce the size of government is a pipe dream !</p>

<p>If the FAA was in charge of Cell Phones they would be the size of a football, cost $5000 each...the battery would last 3 minutes and the range would be 500 feet...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Let's hope the FAA has to shut down all commercial flights, starting sometime in March. That's the one sure thing that will guarantee the GOP congressional majority will end in November.</p>
<p>This is an age of automation.  Air safety is the topic.  Air Traffic Control can be 100% automated from gate to gate and be 1000 times safer.  You con equate our current system with the U.S. Post Office.<br/></p>

<p>Have you missed us?  /aside from a few isolated incidents, it is apparent that you do not support Trump. WHY?  If you are fair and balance.  Every chance you get you produce some political hack fro Tom Ridge, or //////doodleberry in South Carolina  or some other talkinghead, that will try to scare people into not voting for Trump.  WHAT GIVES?  Is fair and balanced not what you want to hear?  Aside from Eric on the five, and BILL, you display a not so FAIR AND BASLANCE&gt; WHY?</p>
