<p>No Slam Dunk = kerryspeak for I'M GONNA CAVE IN AND GIVE THEM WHATEVER THEY WANT, like I did for Iran!</p>
<p>A cease-fire with Syria is going to be difficult? It's not a "slam dunk"? Wow, what insight and incredible perceptiveness that the rest of us just don't have. That is why he is Lurch and we are the lowly citizen peasants. Next he will be figuring out that Iran will violate even more of their, "agreememt" that they signed. It is all just so unpredictable, but with Lurch on the case he will keep us in the know on these things because we can't see them coming on our own. Thank God for the Lurchmeister.</p>
<p>More should have been said about if Turkey is going to comply. Also, other than the US, the UN and relief organizations say the death toll is between 400 - 450,000. Finally, both ISIS &amp; Al Nursa can stop this dead in it's tracks any time they want. Sounds like more poor planning too me.</p>

<p>Tell ketchup man we missed the boat when we overlooked Assad's crossing of His Majesty's red line.</p>
<p>Kerry is about as sharp as a box of wet mice... ha! ha!</p>
<p>Lurch works for Iran, not the US. He is Obama's <span>Midam. </span></p>
<p>Kerry is dumber than rocks</p>
<p>If they won't work with Kerry, offer them more concessions. It worked in Iran <br/></p>
