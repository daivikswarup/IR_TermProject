<p>The Bible talks about the "By their fruits you will know them"--it's like the fruits of your labor--it has nothing to do with food.  WIN BEN WIN!!!!<br/></p>
<p>As long as that fruit salad of life doesn't have any watermelon in it.</p>
<p>The most decent, intelligent person we have running for President and the media has all but dismissed him.  They've not given him a fair chance, instead hopping on the circus wagon.  No wonder this country's in such bad shape.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Is the comment a bit cryptic? Perhaps. But seems like the media is trying to turn this into a Quayle/potatoe moment. Sad. Seems like a very thoughtful, well-grounded man worthy of our consideration.</p>

More truth in your statement today than in any previous point in US history...</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think Kasich was the most presidential. He had good answers and was specific. I think I like him more and more.</p>
<p>GOP...Thanks for all the entertainment guys, really... and don't worry.... you got used to the first black president and after last night.... you'll get used to the first female president too.</p>
<p>It comes down to the issues. What someone looks like has absolutely no bearing. When I go to isidewith.com and take their lengthy test, I answered questions about issues. I only agreed with Hillary 26% of the time. So that is why I cannot vote for her.</p>
<p>All of the other candidates have systematically plagiarized and incorporated Ben Carson's ideas to address our substantive divisive issues into their campaign planks.  However he believes in what he says. He is not a duplicitous lawyer or career politician and he is exactly what America needs, at this time, to lead a disjointed, A.D.D. afflicted citizenry to nourish its roots without bloodshed.    </p>
<p>Cruz is on record with his votes and the ideals he has fought for for years. So I disagree that anyone is taking ideas from Carson. I like Carson, but not for POTUS. Surgeon general or an embassador to Israel might be a good fit. But not POTUS in my opinion.</p>
<p>Carson is the only one of the candidates on both sides that can use his brain to think with!</p>
<p>I think Dr. Carson would be a great president! He's smart, logical, and will fight for the American people. It would be great to see a race between Trump and Carson. The rest of them need to drop out.</p>
<p>I respect him, but just the way he has handled himself in these last few elections shows that he just does not have leadership skills. I think he would be great as the surgeon general or perhaps an embassador to Israel.</p>
<p>I think Carson is the best of the bunch, and Rubio and Cruz are the worst.  But, of course, the Americans are constantly voting for lawyers that say and do anything to get elected, and then betray the people who elected them.  The Trump supporters seem to be fed up with that nonsense, but the Bernie, Hillary, Rubio, and Cruz supporters still are clueless to how politics really work.</p>
<p>I honestly do not know much about Rubio 's record, but it is well documented the Cruz has done exactly what he promised to do. Also his voting record shows that he also votes exactly as he said he would. The cannot be said of Trump. First he has not even had access to all the info that Cruz and Rubio have had access to so I am not even sure he even understands what is all involved in being POTUS. Plus his voting record shows that he does not have conservative values. He just says he does now being I do believe he wants the power of the title POTUS.</p>
<p></p>
<p>About the only thing I don't like about Ben Carson is the insurance industry made him what he is today. Too big a problem for me to overlook..</p>
<p>Big bad insurance! Saving millions of lives every day, it's hard to think of a more positive force.</p>

<p>No, it's his comments below news articles.</p>
<p>mmmm</p>
<p>Trump will be President. The others are his ladies in waiting.</p>
<p> Why is he still a thing? He wrote a fictional autobiography. He has absolutely no management experience of any kind. He looks like he's asleep while standing there. I'm not that far behind him in the polls.</p>
<p>Really a shame the Democrat outsider is preferred over Carson. Trump has a loud mouth. Carson has great ideas.</p>
<p> Carson was the only one that didn't get on my nerves at last night debate!</p>

<p>I don't see the problem with this comment. I've heard worse from others. Obviously the media felt the need to pounce on whoever they could and this time it's Carson.</p>

Overwhelmed with the burden of the sins of our nation, we cry to you from 	the depths of our hearts and seek refuge in your motherly protection. <br/>	Look down with mercy upon us and touch the hearts of our people. Open our 	minds to the great worth of human life and to the responsibilities that 	accompany human freedom. <br/>	Free us from the falsehoods that lead to the evil of abortion and threaten 	the sanctity of family life. Grant our country the wisdom to proclaim that 	God’s law is the foundation on which this nation was founded, and that He 	alone is the True Source of our cherished rights to life, liberty and the 	pursuit of happiness. <br/>	O Merciful Mother, give us the courage to reject the culture of death and 	the strength to build a new Culture of Life.<br/>    <br/></p>

<p>Mary is asleep in the grave according to the Bible. She is not the Savior. That would be Christ. She will be resurrected at the Second Coming along with all who are asleep in the grave. Just as is explained clearly during the account of Lazarus.</p>
<p>I appreciate your prayer. But i must bring to your attention that in 1 Timothy 2:5 it clearly states that there is ONE mediator between God and man and that is Jesus Christ. Please read the verse and pray about what it means to have Jesus as the ONLY mediator. Though I realize that this is the Catholic tradition, Praying to Mary or any human is idol worship and is an affront to God.</p>
<p>Carson  is not going anywhere.  Whoever you support is now moot.  It is Trump vs. Clinton and either one is no good for America.<br/></p>
<p>Wow, I'm not a Carson supporter, but this was a pretty harmless reference compared to Trump claiming he could shoot someone and still get elected.  I'm sure the media can do better than this sort of coverage of Dr. Carson.  </p>

<p>Dr ben carson who is one of the best doctors that i have ever appreciated in my life, i read one his books, i watch his documentary and even thought i have listened some of his great speech during his compagne. when i have done all those things , i have realized that he deserves to be the president of United Stated. as we may know, in 2015, during a dinner in the white house, he made a great speech, even obama was really awstruck what carson said in there. he mentioned " an eagle has two wings, one left and one right". this quotation has contained a huge meaningful. and also when he met a speech to students graduation, one the great university in USA,  he said " if the people  often think the same thing on everything, one of them is not necesary" .</p>

<p>The guy doesn't get it - He's so far out of the running that nobody cares about his opinions.   His fruit salad moment shows he can't really put together a logical concept of how he would choose a nominee for the Supreme Court.  Good grief he's had over a week to come up with something.   He is wasting his time, his supporters time - he is a nice guy but he is irrelevant to this race now.</p>
