<p>feckless foreign policy accompanied by ridiculous leftist mantra... </p>
<p>Barack Obama has about as much sense as Daffy Duck!  He has no reason other than a campaign promise which he had no business making in the first place.  This is just his "I am King" mode.  He does't know how to legislate and has no authority to do so.  Community Organizers have no business becoming President.  Shame on those who elected him! </p>
<p>Barack Obama is a long time goofball.  He should have hanged all those terrorists, and dumped their bodies in  the middle of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>It is actually a fact that it's a jihadists recruitment tool...he the president releases them and They are recruited...that simple !</p>
