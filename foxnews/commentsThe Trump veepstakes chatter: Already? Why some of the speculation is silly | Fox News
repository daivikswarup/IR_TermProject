<p>Sorry, Mr. Kurtz, the US Constitution does NOT require a running mate. The Vice President is chosen by the electoral college in a separate vote. In fact, we already have a precedent--John C. Calhoun was elected and served as Vice-President under John Quincy Adams, and again to serve under Adams' bitter political rival, Andrew Jackson.<br/></p>
<p>Academia folks</p>

<p>Maybe Scott Walker.</p>
<p>I think Rob Ford is looking for a job.</p>
<p>I like Kasich for the presidential nomination, but the VP slot isn't bad.<br/></p>
