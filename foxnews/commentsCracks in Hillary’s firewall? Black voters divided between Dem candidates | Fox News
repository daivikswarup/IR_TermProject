<p>The Clinton's have helped the Black community by passing mandatory sentences. Placing more Blacks in jail than ever before.  </p>

<p>This is a very interesting election year; Trump's abrasiveness gains him points, Clinton's old-school race bating gains Bernie points. Me thinks the black voters are just as disenchanted with the establishment politicians as us white guys.I hope so. Either Bernie or Trump would be a wonderful change.<br/></p>
<p> When I heard Ms. Hillary barking like a dog...this song came to my mind.. <strong>"The  B  T  H is back"</strong> especially when she is mocking her opponents the Republicans. </p>
<p>Why are the hookers supporting Hillary? Why would they want their image/reputation sullied by association with such a criminal? </p>

<p>If Hillary wins the election, look at the money the US citizens will save.  There will be no need for security at the White House.  All that is needed is Hillary's barking.  <br/></p>
<p>Hillary there is a dog barking contest in Vegas tomorrow.  Have you entered the contest?<br/></p>
<p>It is amazing how these Democratic people are.  Here we have Hillary pronouncing she is the champion for women.  I ask, was she a champion for women, especially for Monica L. when then Bills Willy was getting so much attention.  Do you not think that the President of the USA, took advantage of an employee in Monica.  Come on Hillary, start telling the truth, you are nothing but an opportunist that is looking after yourself and yourself only.  <br/></p>

<p><span>Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, turned off many voters by cashing in after their government service by accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in speaking fees and honoraria from special interest groups and universities. Dozens of polls in recent months confirm that while Democratic voters view her as more experienced and better prepared than most to lead the country, shockingly high majorities say that they question her honesty and integrity and don’t believe she has their best interest in mind.</span></p>

<p>I'm surprised by these comments. The racially identity of the United States is changing rapidly. Soon neither party can possibly win an election with only the majority of whites. Not saying we should pander to any particular group, but demeaning language like this ensures republicans will NEVER return to the white house if this is how their most loyal constituency perceives other people.  <br/></p>

<p>My lawn jockey is not voting democratic this year. He is sick of being just another black man doing nothing, standing in my front yard. Although he has a phone, free health care, govt assistance for food and housing (which I love) he feels Hillary and Bernie just don't get the black, man anymore. He is rallying the other "jockeys" in the neighborhood and drumming up a write in campaign for Kevin Krigger....</p>

<p>Blacks can't decide who to vote for on the Democratic Ticket? I guess it boils down to who is giving away more free stuff. :_) </p>
<p>"This weekend, Bill Clinton said Hillary should not drop out of the presidential race. Yeah, when asked why, Bill said, 'Because then she'd come home.'"</p>
<p>Bill's really got quite a following with Vegas hookers<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pretty sad for the dem party that voters are considering a socialist. The republicans are a mess as well.</p>
<p>Hillary barks like a dog that just got neutered <br/></p>
<p>Hillary's standared answer is, ( "What difference does it make at this point")</p>
<p>Trump said the Media would go after him, if he "barked" like Hillary!  LMAO</p>
<p>Ok BRB GOTTA GO HIT JOHN LOL:)~</p>
<p>Hillary needs one of those dog collars so she wont gnaw at her cankles<br/></p>

<p>Why can't we just talk without all the demeaning snide remarks~~ we might learn something~~</p>
<p>Hillary's vocal chords need a face-lift too<br/></p>
<p>Onfarr we can agree to that</p>
<p>Bill Clinton said that barking ain't nothing new, i use to make her howl at the moon when she was a young pup.</p>
