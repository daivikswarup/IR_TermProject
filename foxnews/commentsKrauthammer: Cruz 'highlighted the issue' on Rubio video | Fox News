<p> Cruz should have fired himself</p>
<p> Cruz is done by his own doing.</p>
<p></p>
<p> I think it's hillarious that Rubio goes around boasting that the Democratic Party fears him more than any other GOP candidate. Marco, don't flatter yourself.</p>

The guy with all the establishment money and party endorsements. That is an establishment sellout guarantee.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The issue is the lies, deceit and overall dishonesty of Ted Cruz. Firing this guy was just his attempt to deflect blame and take the heat off himself. You are dealing with a person who claims the mantle of Christianity but in no way lives the values and teachings of Jesus. <br/></p>
<p> FOX will never allow the issue to be cured.  </p>
<p>Someone should unplug Kraphammers <span>respirator</span></p>
<p>I dont see what else he could have done Charles. It would have dragged on and on.<br/></p>

<p>Cruz is always apologizing after the damage is done and after his campaign has done something else unethical. As far as I am concerned Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole a lot of Carson's votes with a lie and then apologized. CRUZ IS TRYING TO CHEAT HIS WAY INTO OUR WHITE HOUSE. Don't be fooled America, this guy is a foreigner, not a American.</p>

Cruz already fired the misbehaving staffer.</p>

Of course not. Obama is a foreigner.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p> Rubio is pulling the wool over people's eyes, those of us who know him in FL know he cannot be trusted, he is as slick as Obama!</p>
<p>so...somebody please tell me why the Bible is even an issue? It has NOTHING to do with our Constitution, it has NOTHING to do with our politics, at least it's not supposed to and now these GOP dopes are fighting about it? Seriously...can we get these zealots out of our politics and just legislate by logic?<br/></p>
<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:b7aa8db2-3ba0-4839-b0f6-f55320e0d7f9@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">MichaelHiller</span></a> Remember that the founders of our nation were all creationists. It didn't occur to them that the secular government and politics that you're espousing would happen. Of course they didn't want religion to be established or endorsed by the government, they feared an over reaching government and put limits on it. To think that religion has nothing to do with the constitution or politics is ridiculous and out of touch with the majority of America.<br/></p>
<p>Man, Michael is correct.  We have the right to worship in our churches our way.  We also have the right for the churches to not invade our government.  We are granted the freedom from religion also.  The majority of America would probably still have segregation if they got their way.  That is the beauty of our Constitution.  Everyone is granted the same rights, regardless of the majority, except those rights concerning gun ownership.  That is a whole other subject.  Suffice it to say that Michael is correct and the majority has no say under our Constitution, thank God.  The Constitution has no reference to any religious document.  Religion has plenty to do with politics, but not to the rule of law.  Sorry, but you are wrong.</p>

<p>Karl Rove is still waiting to see if Romney can win Ohio.<br/></p>

<p>This particular issue aside ... why does anybody listen to Charles Krauthammer?  DOES anybody listen to Charles Krauthammer?  What has he ever done to improve life for Americans?  He's been a partisan hack as long as I've been aware of him.<br/></p>

<p>what a CROCK,, give the man NO CREDIT for doing the right thing,, biased sell out establishment media,, want more of the same? Vote Rubio!<br/></p>

It makes you look small.  Where did you go. Hello, hello... </p>
<p> the evangelical vote is split between cruz and trump. two of the biggest hypocrites on the planet. lies, profanity, and dirty tricks.</p>
<p>Another report states that the man said, "That's a good book there. All the answers are in it." </p>
<p>If this was just an isolated event it would be passed over, but seems this stuff just keeps happening. </p>
<p>Cruz is toast.  </p>
<p>So how many Karl Rove incorrect statements has Cruz staff put out so far ?<br/></p>
