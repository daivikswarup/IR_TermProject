<p>No worries, these are the folks in charge of our security</p>
<p>Hey Obama , how about your goons exercising a little gun control?</p>
<p>I had a friend, that I worked with, lost his badge during a chase and fight after an armed robbery.  He had to go through a full investigation from two agencies to explain how his badge got torn from his shirt.  No one complained about the investigation because it needed to be done.  If anyone one if us had lost a firearm we would have been terminated unless there was a very, very good reason why.  The feds lose that much stuff and nothing comes fom it.</p>

<p>Obama wants to control OUR guns?  When his people can't event keep track of their own?  Typical Democrat- do as I say, not as I do.</p>
<p>We need more immigrants....NOT!<br/></p>
<p>The 100% negative posts/messages here give a true picture of the sad state of our country under Obama and explain clearly why people are fed up with politicians.<br/></p>
<p> Ah, the sheer incompetence of our government under Obama.  They know they will never be fired.  DHS hires people of questionable intelligence anyway.  Look at those TSA employees (a lot hired under Bush).  You know they were harassed in school and give them a little bit of power and you see how it goes to their heads.  Plus the fact that you can look in their eyes and see that no one is home!!!</p>
<p>The TSA basically competes with McDonalds for employees.  And remember, Bush didn't want it.  Congress forced it down his throat.  The Dems wanted another government bureaucracy that would join a public Union and vote Dem.  Which is exactly what happened.  And are we any safer?  Nope.</p>
<p> Typical government controlled agency.. No badge, no gun, no work.. YOUR FIRED ! in the words of D. Trump.... Sloppy agents, equal job opportunities for others........</p>
<p>So... who's gotten fired and jailed for this?   Right... nobody... that's what I thought....   The Obama corruption machine....   <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Check with the Mexican drug cartels...   they probably bought them from DHS at a discount so that Obama could squeal that American guns are killing Mexican citizens...    <br/></p>
<p> Maybe Obama should practice "gun control" within his own administration before pointing fingers at the law abiding citizens of this country who own and "CONTROL" their firearms.</p>
<p>Abusing the American taxpayer is completely normal to liberals .</p>
<p>No lose, sold DHS is corrupt.</p>
<p>Convenient, another government agency that now needs to be disbanded.</p>
<p> Another shining example of Obama's America, and the complete inadequacy of the Gimmiecrats to be in charge of anything above mop purchasing. Nothing or value can be sustained using blind hope, trust and emotions, above common sense and the understanding of your enemies and history.</p>
<p>We have never seen such betrayal of our country in government before. IRS, DOJ,SOS,DVA and BLM. It looked very much like an attempted socialist take over that failed and is being covered up. Going by the example of Germany it comes from unions. Unions who feel they have the right to negotiate over the laws. People died and unions have protected the people who didn't help the vets. It's too much when our veterans die and unions protect the jobs of those who let them die.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How can this happen? Is anyone in charge of our government?</p>

<p>Have they checked Hilary Clinton's computer? I bet she has all that stuff hidden in there along with everything else!</p>

<p>Now, you liberals should understand why so many people want Trump. Actually, i would be happy with Trump, Cruz, or Rubio, over what we have had to endure for the last 7 years. Excuses no longer resonate with the majority of voters anymore.<br/></p>

<p>We speak of "responsible gun owners" and then read something like this.  I have never lost or had a weapon stolen, not in half a century.  I did lose my Star badge when I was a Boy Scout, but it was returned by another member.   Perhaps DHS hires nitwits who shouldn't be allowed to possess guns or sharp objects?  </p>

<p>There is no excuse for losing a firearm...none.  The same goes for a laptop, or a badge.  Cell Phones are easy to lose, as we all have done just that...lay it down to grab your wallet, or purse, drop it while arresting a perp, or grabbing someone... been there, done that.  But those are all reportable items and the reasons lost should have been explained.  Not reporting a lost piece of gear is reason for termination.  So, why are any of these agents or officers still working?  If DHS cannot terminate someone for not filing a report, what good are they?  What's worse, BTAF&amp;E, itself, has lost 100s of firearms...LOST...meaning they didn't know they were lost or nobody told them they were lost.  So, who's running this show?<br/></p>

<p>The same thing happened right before 9/11.  I was in Korea at the time and the weekly safety briefing came with a warning that there had been a rash of lost ID cards and the Black Market was paying top dollar for them.  I don't know how they knew that but to say they had captured someone with the IDs.  Hard to believe that Homeland Security Personnel are so lax with their ID cards Badges weapons and Cell phones.   If you lost your weapon in the Army you were pretty much going back to civilian life with no hope of Government employment.</p>

<p>Of course, no "officers" were fired for "losing" their identification, or having their firearms "lost" or stolen. I think the incidence would be much lower if the employees understood they would be immediately fired and be subject to investigation and prosecution for losing or selling those items, and the same for failing to report the incident.</p>

<p>Every day under the Obama Administration something has gone wrong in this once great country of ours. I hope we can endure one more year and then start rebuilding our standing around the world.<br/></p>
<p>I can understand losing a cell phone, maybe even a badge.....but for God's sake losing a hand gun or rifle is just pure stupidity.  Someone needs to be held responsible for that stupid move!</p>

<p> Just another Fast &amp; Furious deal. They had to dump the tons of ammo they bought a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>And they were probably sent over to ISIS so they will have something to go along with the fake passport....</p>

<p>Plan A by the  administration they put the guns out there so they could cause an incident so terrible they can declare Marshal Law.  This is not normal people I mean really they make the DHS look like irresponsible children.  They are suppose to be protecting the Nation does this look like something a responsible adult would do.</p>

<p>In 25 years as an LEO, I never heard of such a thing...  Maybe ONCE, the result of a burglary -- I'm not sure.<br/></p>

<p> They weren't stolen, they were given to the illegals to keep themselves safe.  Never know when a law abiding CITIZEN of the USA may want to hurt an illegal in this country.  It's in the news all the time.</p>
<p>the affirmative action president and his affirmative action appointees incuding j johnson at dhs do not know how to govern nor are they capable of management  - but they do like riding around in limos</p>
<p>Wonderful!  And who is responsible for this incompetence...?  Anyone being held responsible?</p>

<p>That's what happens when you entrust our nations security to HS dropouts.<br/></p>
