<p> Don't vote for Ted Cruz.  He is "not telling the truth" on some of the things he is trying to convince us on regarding himself.  We need a "real man" in the White House.  Not some half foreign person, who will take this Country even farther down the drain.  Can you really see Cruz or Rubio standing in front of Putin and trying to discuss politics?  Ha-ha-ha  Putin would laugh in their faces!</p>
<p>A vote e for Cruz will likely be a wasted vote...</p>

<p>This is not all that complicated. It was codified in the Naturalization Act of 1790. There are only 2 types of citizens, "natural born" and "naturalized".  As he is a citizen, and did not have to apply to become a naturalized citizen, then he is natural born.</p>
