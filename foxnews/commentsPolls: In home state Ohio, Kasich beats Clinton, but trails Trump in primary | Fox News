<p> John Kasich is a nice man; Hillary Clinton is an insufferable c-word.</p>
<p> he needs to beat Trump before he worries about hillary<br/></p>
<p>The article is implying Kasich would be a wise VP choice for Trump to win back Ohio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Win Ohio or lose it all, the whole Nation is at stake. </p>
<p>All republicans beating Hillary. Good News<br/></p>
<p>Kasich will need to stay in the race after he is crushed in Ohio on Super Tuesday by Trump. He can serve Trump as SS. That's about he can be good for.<br/></p>
<p>#Kasich #Kasich2016  YES HE CAN.  Makes sense.  </p>
<p>Kasich is desperately campaigning for the VP nod from Trump anymore and merely humping his leg disturbingly to get his attention.</p>
<p>Yes. He's smart.</p>

<p>Trump will lose to Clinton. The primaries have become a game to Trumps cult following. I don't think they care about the consequences and what it means to the country. Come November, we choose who the next leader of the country is and the country will choose a politician over a businessman even if that politician is Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>They needed a poll to come up with kasich winning his own state. Derp</p>
<p>Kasich could walk away with this if he could just add some excitement to his pitches. He needs a "bombast" coach who can Trump him up s a little. at the next debate, if he were to walk over to Trump and just slug him in the mouth he could be our next president! And I'm serious!<br/></p>

Maybe they're both right.....or wrong.  One thing is certain and that is Washington is seriously broken and one person will do little to fix it. </p>

<p>Donald Trump is in the right place at the right time in history</p>
<p>Just think if their is a broker election for GOP, Trump loses!! Maybe that is why Kasich  and Carson is staying in for Trump can not get to 1200.. Interesting.. We sense he is gambling with fire and it would be better if Cruz, Kasich and Carson drop out and let this be a true primary for the GOP.. Splitting the votes among 6 candidates no one candidate is obtaining 80% of the votes and as such is not a winner no matter who it is.. A winner is one who can carry the party and getting only a third of it may be good for the candidate but not for general election to win.. It is a fact people.. </p>
<p>It might be your fact but this is Donald trumps time to be our next president</p>

Will not go to trump like you for he is worse than Kasich.. Trump ideas are not thought out on national level and the man shoots from the hip.. He has no real plans of substance and his immigration, foreign, security and tax plan is one of the worse.. Will destroy the middle class.. His immigration plan alone will not fix illegals coming here for the majority have been coming to this country on Visa for over a decade and million of americans lose their jobs each year to them.. Trump is giving amnesty to all illegals with his Touch Back idea ( US tax payer sends them back to country of origin and we bring them back in which they are then deemed citizens).  Out of all candidates Rubio has the best plans.</p>
<p>Why doesn't Kasich just drop out. He's not going to get the nomination. The only thing Kasich and Carson are doing is giving the nomination away to Trump. Enough - get out of the race! </p>

<p>Please report the polling numbers in proper context. A few months ago, Trump was leading Kasich by 10 points in a Quinnipiac poll. In their recent poll, the lead has been reduced to 5 points, and an even more recent poll by another organization, the lead is only 2 percent. That suggests that Kasich might (in Ohio) catch Trump in the stretch and win by a couple heads. How this will translate in other states, we don't yet know.</p>

<p>With district gerrymandering after 2010,  all voices are not heard in Ohio, but in a general elections every vote counts.. do your research people!  Kasich couldn't deliver Ohio to Mitt Romney because Kasich can't fix the general elections</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gee, the governor of Ohio doing so well in Ohio..... Whodathunk.</p>
<p>Clinton wins big in Nevada….53% to 47% is a BIG win?…since when…since the media wants you to think was  big…that's  since when</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kasich doesn't know if this is his purpose? Then, please drop out, John. We need a fighter.<br/></p>

<p>He would make an excellent vice president</p>

<p>Sorry, it's not going to happen</p>
<p>Hillary continues to slid in the polls. Priceless.</p>

The FBI could supply that happiness by offering her a pair of bracelets.<br/></p>
<p><span>Kasich can beat Clinton but cant beat Trump - that is very telling </span></p>
<p>Doesn't matter. Once kasich drops out and supports the GOP nominate in the general, hillary will be toast.</p>

<p>So The Donald Nominates Krayfish as VEEP and loses to Hillaty and then Krayfish gets to play Bailin Pailin guest shoots for the next half decade.</p>
