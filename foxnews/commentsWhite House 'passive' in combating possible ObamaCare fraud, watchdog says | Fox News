<p>Welcome to obama land. It's like Disney land but here the democrats get everything free.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obama SUCKS!!!<br/></p>
<p>Garbage in, garbage out. ACA is a complete and total failure. Wait until you think you are going to be getting a tax return this year if you don't have health insurance. SURPRISE!!</p>
<p>Is anyone shocked at this?  What does the gov't do that isn't filled with waste, fraud and corruption?  Time to scale back, way way back, on the size and scope of our gov't.  </p>
<p> Trump 2016   Trump 2016      Lets get this over with and finally get someone in there who can balance a budget and get career politicians out.   We need Donald Trump.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes folks, libtarts and conservatives, we will all pay for our presidents indiscretions, uhh..  goofs.</p>
<p>Millions of illegal alien Latinos are enrolled. Obama's team even came to Salinas California to  teach illegals how to enroll in Spanish. </p>
<p>Of course they are passive about it. They knew from the beginning Obamacare was built on lies. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>FRAUD In the Obama administration ? Oh say it aint so . LOL<br/></p>
<p>Qualify? Dems don't care as long as it pads the enrollment numbers. </p>
<p>so things are going as planned  </p>
<p>Obama only wants the GLORY of getting obamacare established...he doesn't give a flip if it works or not</p>
<p>In other words  The government screwed it up and we pay for it. No surprise.</p>

<p>The White House is passive on a lot of things that demand its immediate attention.</p>

<p> Oh fraud doesn't matter.  All that matters is the successful socialization of American Medicine.  It doesn't even have to work.  In fact, it is preferred that it doesn't work so that they can ad fixes to it to gain tighter control.</p>
<p>again I say we need bigger government</p>

<p>I am shocked that this administration would condone fraud.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord Baby Jesus that I have Tri-care which is about as low as you can get for health insurance because some of my buds that aren't making 6 digit figure can't afford $1,000 a month health care do to Barry's initiative. Instead they are forced to take two jobs just to afford the insurance that he wants us all to have.</p>
<p>Obarrycare was designed to get as many illegals on the government dole as possible.<br/></p>
<p> the irs can't even fix the acceptable fraud of at least 10 billion a year in known fraud and say it might be fixed by 2020! WHAT A CROCK!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>it's going to ILLEGALS.. so Obama won't look at it.. COVER UP is his middle name </p>
<p>The WH has been passive on everything and everyone for the past 8 years. Obama is the biggest fraud of them all.</p>

<p>We see people with EBT cards and food stamps driving brand new GMC Yukons in California all the time. People constantly cheat the system and the government just rubber stamps approval for any and all who apply. <br/></p>
<p>Of course the W.H. is passive about OblunderCare rip offs. It's not his money! <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>" Passive Aggressive"?  Whatever it takes to get a destructive outcome for the US. That is Obama<br/></p>
<p>"Passive", that's an understatement. The obama administration doesn't believe in the Rule of Law</p>
<p>Obama and the Liberal Democrats are protecting this failed Law. How many Billions or is it Trillion's that will be lost again to the People that Obama said himself would not gain from this law? Just when is the Majority just going to raise up and go to Washington and run this guy out of town?  </p>

<p>Ignores the fraud because Obama is a fraud.</p>
<p>Obama will jail someone that's saved $30 per month by shaving some income, but will not jail doctors for double-billing in Medicare. By law, if you have Medicare, the doctor gets a small copay and the government pays the actual bill. Some doctors double bill by also sending the patients bills for his services, which is illegal. He cannot bill for more than what Medicare pays. Lots of doctors are cheating on it, have for decades.</p>
<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:3813e912-c3e2-4033-9d26-ee73d31a13bc@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">usapatriot1</span></a> Some doctors do cheat, but not all. However, one thing you should understand....the government does not differentiate between an honest mistake and fraud. As far as they're concerned, it's fraud regardless, and we get penalized BIG TIME for it. I have 2 coder/billers who review EVERY patient chart for errors, because it's cheaper to pay them well than it is to have the government on my back if I or another doctor make a coding mistake.</p>
<p> Adds a whole new meaning to, "It's the law live with it."</p>
<p>Now we wouldn't want Obama to do anything about this because it might reflect poorly on his legacy, would we?.</p>
<p> Fraud is a good thing for this boondoggle power grab. The more money that goes through it, the more successful the Marxists will claim it is.</p>
<p>Interesting that very few people are upset about the ACA forcing citizens under the pain of substantial fines to purchase a product from a third party, whether they want it or not.  To carry the thought further, what would the public's reaction be if the government told us we all had to buy a Ford, or a Chevrolet, or a Chrysler, whether we drive or not, whether we have use for a car or not, and whether we prefer and can afford a Porsche, Toyota, or Audi?  And, that a portion of what we pay for our cars will be used to buy cars for those who can't afford one, for whatever reason.  What if we all have to buy a certain brand of wrist watch, or TV, or orange juice, or any other consumer good?  The entire ACA was a travesty taking away one of the rights Americans have long enjoyed, the right to buy what we want, when we want, and from whom we want, yet Congress and the Supreme Court did nothing.  Now, we find out that there is widespread corruption and incompetence in the management of the ACA, and people are surprised. Has anyone looked at other government-run agencies/operations?  The Post Office?  Amtrak? Social Security?  Medicare?  The entire educational system? Our country's infrastructure? We have kept our heads in the ground like so many ostriches for decades, and NOW we act surprised? <br/></p>
<p>The Big Zer0 0bama built this.</p>
<p>Of course the Dems. are passive about fraud within ObamaCare; exposing fraud and doing something abut it would make their pet program look bad.</p>
<p>Now, no one expected that this administration would ever admit such a mess.  Did they?</p>

<p> This is not just a "passive approach."  It's turning a blind eye.  I suspect the Obama administration may see this as an acceptable form of wealth redistribution.</p>
<p>what was the point of obamacare? they said 30 million uninsured, so now there's 20 million uninsured. they said health care costs would go down, they went straight up. they said bankruptcies would go way down, they climbed up. </p>

<p><strong>I removed myself from public opinion and family  influence at the age of 12 to come to know what my unique feelings are about politics, religion and other things that can be associated with each.  My immediate and extended family seemed to be about 35% Republican and 65% Democrat.  All seemed to consider themselves Protestant, Christian or Agnostic. <br/><br/>The first thing I realized at this young age is no one in my extended family had the same opinion of how one could define a conservative or liberal and the same with Republican or Democrat.  I then realized that there are no Republican or Democrats left in the way that most Americans care to remember them.  The two familiar party “tags” evolve about as fast as technology does.<br/><br/>Between the age of 12 and 16 then, I came to realize what I feel naturally is that I’m a “Social/Fiscal Conservative”.  That is… I support giving a HAND UP (not hand out) to all deserving people so they can have a better life.  Many people deserve a lot more help than others and they should get it if they make an honest effort to do better.  A Social/Fiscal Conservative root is infinitely variable to accommodate unique identities.   <br/><br/>And… always be an alert watch dog for Government waste.  Demand that your Representatives do the right thing by protecting taxpayers contributions to the coffers.<br/><br/>I’ve come to know that people have to be very candid and free of outside influence  in order to grow and understand who they are as a unique person.  Reckless and forceful opinions coming from both sides of the aisle are influencing our citizens of this great nation in a very negative and destructive way.  I wish more people were inclined to understand who they are as an individual instead of lazily signing on with the rapidly growing Socialist come Marxist  force that is taking over our government and country. And, on the other side…people on the so called “far right” are just angry people who do not want to help anyone in true need and are ready to shut our country down just to be different.  There is a difference between spending “good money” (investing wisely) and spending “bad money” (wasting). <br/><br/>Listen up Americans… the NWO is not a good thing.</strong></p>

<p>Did you actually expect anything different from this incompetent adnmistration</p>
<p>Congress do your job and get rid of Obamacare! It is only benefitting insurance company's. It is failing because it has never been about providing healthcare it has always been about getting at 150 billion dollars from the medicare system. Now that those dollars are dwindling down insurance company's will cut and run. REPEALOBAMACARENOW!</p>

<p>ocare IS fraud</p>
<p>Fraud has always been there and will continue to be there because US citizens keep re-electing the same people that allow it to happen.</p>
<p>Americans do not have an honest federal government that works for the American people. This federal government has become a cancerous blob of bureaucrats, union workers and career politicians who rule over Americans with impunity and total disregard to American law. Americans need desperately realize just how bad government has become.  </p>
<p>Love your comments. Keep thinking like that. We need more positive thinkers!</p>
<p>When an agency, any agency, or government funded regulator has been defrauded the agency or regulator should be defunded dollar for dollar. If not corrected then 2 for every dollar of fraud. This means get fraud under control or risk going under. </p>
<p>Go ahead blame the Democrats for fraud.  Republican fraud concerning their pet project, (the military), doesn't exist right?  Is it any wonder Americans are looking at an outsider when it comes to the next POTUS.  Anyone with any common sense knows all politicians, (except mine, of course), couldn't care less for the average tax payers money.</p>

<p> Obamacare taxes the heads of our children enrolled in group plans for this?  Obamacare taxes our health insurance carriers' total premium volume for this?  Obamacare taxes our medical device manufacturers, flushing high paying American jobs down the WH toilet for this?  Obamacare taxes name brand medicine makers, thus removing most, if not all, name brand medicine from our insurance plans, and for this?  Obamacare mandates the premiums for our children and young people must double or triple in price, so adults who've likely never met a premium invoice, can enroll for free. </p>
<p>The Obama admin always takes a passive approach when it leads to the downfall of America ! </p>
<p>Obamacare making everyone dependent on the government...a prime tenant of  Alinsky's Rules for Radicals...Obama's primary playbook</p>

<p><strong> "<span>investigators found that the administration has struggled to resolve eligibility questions affecting millions of initial applications and hundreds of thousands of consumers who were actually approved for benefits."

<p>The WH being “passive” is nothing new because obama’s
miserably failed presidency has been a passive one. The only time obama isn’t
passive is when he’s violating the U.S. Constitution by signing unlawful

<p>While Team Obama and his democrat cheerleaders in congress, maybe passive about billions of wasted taxpayer dollars with Obamacare, please do note their passion about all those couple of millions being spent on those Ms. Hillary congressional hearing and now their passion about "saving" maybe a couple of hundred millions by closing down Gitmo by requiring the spending of several hundreds of million taxpayer dollars on "improving" detention facilities inside our U.S. to house these terrorist.  Funny how democrats can be passive and passionate with our tax dollars.</p>
<p></p>
<p> Does this surprise anyone?  </p>
<p>Does anyone really think the Obama is going to do anything to put a crimp in his legacy? His camp is passive because they are looking for a way to spin this or hide it completely! Otherwise he'd have to admit his baby is a birth defect!</p>

<p> Who didn't see this coming?</p>
<p>One only need to look at the namesake of this dreaded scam against the taxpayer to know its a fraud .</p>
<p>Huge heist from Americans. Millions went to friends of Obama, Hillary and other Dems. Wonder why everyone wants Trump? Not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obamacare was a scam, and many fell for it! The problem is that it's another welfare program, and we all know how difficult it is to stop offering welfare once it is passed out among the mass of receivers!</p>
<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:1479241c-bf08-46b2-984c-ac879eb7718f@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">KelleyLV</span></a>  Cut it by 33% a year for the next 3 years. It will  give people time to find a job.</p>
<p>They are passive when it comes to any fraud....voter fraud, welfare fraud, obamacare fraud, benghazi fraud.....and especially email fraud.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that adding 1000s of pencil pushers, spending billions on software, and giving free reign to trial lawyers, pharmaceuticals, and insurance companies, while cutting the pay to hospitals and doctors, would not be a great idea?</p>
<p>Illegals are getting coverage under the table. Another of Obama's lures to fill the country with them. They fill the emergency rooms.</p>
<p>Health Insurance is now affordable, healthcare not so much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Say it ain't so. Anyone not drinking the koolaide saw this coming before the Democrats passed this piece of snit.</p>
<p>Eligibility questions. . . .on millions. . . Hmmm, sounds like just ANOTHER well designed 100% Democrat program.</p>
<p>Obamacare is nothing more than an attempt on the part of this administration to break white middle class America, and guess what?  It's working. Obamacare MUST be repealed. And shame on Chief Justice Roberts for voting yes for this travesty.</p>
<p>Not just white middle class, but whites in general.</p>

<p>Proof of another Obama, Reid, and Pelosi lie to the American people!  These cronies all yelled that Obamacare would be payed for by stopping medicare fraud!  Again another government program laced with fraud and abuse that drives health care cost through the roof and the nation still has over 20 million uninsured people! <br/></p>
