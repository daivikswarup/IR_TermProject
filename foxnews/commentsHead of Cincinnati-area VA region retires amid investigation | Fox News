<p>They need to do an investigation.  Especially on people resigning, Hetrick found out he was going to be fired (removed), so he quit (retired).  Is he going to get to keep all his benefits without an investigation happening?  I want to know he is clean.</p>
<p>I know he quit because he has filth written all over him.  No Benefits!</p>

Investigation needs to keep going and the Bureaucrat needs to be brought before the court. </p>
<p>Whay arent these VA managers, who have been responsible for so many deaths, being tried and sentenced?  </p>
<p> It would be amazing to just ONCE see someone held accountable!  Will this EVER happen?  Every Vet in America would love an answer to that question!</p>
<p>True civil servant....grabbed his fat pension and ran when the accountability ghost loomed</p>

<p>307,000 American Veterans are dead, that requires trials and executions for all involved this staggering loss of life.</p>
<p>Of course we have some dirty water in the government and the VA. But throwing the baby out with the bath water is not the solution. We also have dirty water in private corporations and among the elites that want to privatize everything. Let's put clean water in the tub and keep the baby, not more dirty water with somebody else's germs.</p>
