<p>The best part is that Trump is doing all this for us (America) not for himself ...Why? Because he loves America &amp; knows just how Great Our Nation is &amp; will be with the right leadership which is Trump!! ...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rubio  .Cruz &amp; the others should just drop out &amp; get behind Trump so we can focus our efforts on crushing the Dems progressive failures that are ruining OUR Great Nation.</p>
<p>Trump</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Donald got 3X the votes as did the entire Dem ticket...ASSKICK STRONG !!!</p>
<p>What's interesting is the Dems only got like 12K voters in Nevada....Look at the number who voted GOP!  Now that was a HUGE turnout!  Go Conservatives!!!! </p>
<p>To all those that say he is a "wolf in sheep's clothing"... all the republicans have continued to let the democrats push the liberal... oops, I mean progressive, agenda forward without stopping or challenging them.  And, the republican party controls both the house and senate.  Who is the wolf in sheep's clothing.  Donald Trump is the only one that is calling all of them out on it.   Go TRUMP!!!</p>
<p>Depressing. . . . . .</p>
<p>The stupidity of the American voter knows no bounds.</p>
<p>Hate to call people stupid. I prefer to refer to them as un thoughtful.  I have yet to hear specific and thoughtful plans. I can just envision a trade of gun control for tax cuts or  Obama care for eminent domain.</p>
<p>Yes, we voted obama in twice!!!</p>

<p>Ummmm no....more like a one, one punch. Trump is a democrat. Always has been.</p>
<p>I highly doubt that.  We may as well elect the the CEO of exxon . Really what's the difference.  It's time to bring back the Constitution</p>
<p>It's more than time to bring back the constitution. Trump certainly won't do it. It's not in his nature because he is not a constitutionalist republican. He is a reality TV millionaire that is all about him first.</p>

<p>I'll hold my nose and vote for Trump, in the vain hope that he has changed. Which I highly doubt.</p>
<p>I am so done with voting for the lesser of 2 evild . Voting for Trump is like voting for Ted Kennedy.</p>

TV has killed America, people think they know Trump because he's been on a "reality" TV show. News from the future, if he's elected you'll never admit voting for him. I understand people are upset but come on Trump is saying what he thinks people want to hear. If you can't see that then you're blind or don't care to see the truth. </p>
<p>Clogging what? No one is saying anything except for me.</p>

<p>What is it exactly that gets you all wet in the loins for Trump?</p>
<p></p>
<p>And you have looked into his past and seen all of that?? He is telling you what you want to hear. He doesn't believe it, nor will he gave the power to do it even if he did, which is highly doubtful. Just quit already. You are being played. If you like being played then more power to you. I for one consider myself smarter than that.</p>

<p>FOXNews, this page of yours stinks of bias.  "Carson, Cruz, Kasich, and 2 more candidates"?  I know you'll say, "Oh but it's alphabetical so as to not play favorites."  You should rank them in the order that the country does so as to be unbiased.  Quit fighting it, support the Donald and make sure everyone of your viewers do as well in order to form a more perfect union and thwart any possibility of a Clinton or Sanders holocaust.<br/></p>

<p>And you lack critical thinking. Trump is no conservative. Look into his past. Look into what he has been and what he has done and what he believes in and supports. If you do that and still support him then you will get exactly what you deserve, to the down fall of us all.</p>
<p>I'd say as an understatement, Trump has done pretty well for his first time running for president.</p>

<p>CNN is the Clinton News Network. Of course the are willing to make Cruz look bad. He poses the greatest threat to crooked government but they are doing all they can to dump on him. Look how he has stood for the people before running.</p>
<p>I believe it is the establishment that is out to make Cruz look bad. He is the best chance this country has for someone to stand by the constitution. Disliked by all because he does not conform in his stand for the people. They say republicans do not like him, those are the ones that promised to defund planned parenthood but voted to fund it.</p>

CNN very clearly implied Carson was dropping out by saying they had never seen anyone do this (heading back home) before if they were seriously running for president. Also, it's been proven Rubio's camp started suggesting Carson was dropping out an hour before Cruz's camp. Rubio and Trump are both sleezebags. Neither can own up to their horrendous positions on issues dear to conservatives. Cruz has held true to his positions and has been unjustly smeared.<br/></p>

<p>I like to watch MSNBC on a night like tonight - as the meltdowns are entertaining.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I would like the Trump News network to try to go at least 30 secs between saying or posting the word Trump,</p>
<p>TRUMP<span>2016</span> </p>
<p>Last week it was "Hookers for Hillary" in Nevada -- This week it's "Strumpets for Trump".<br/></p>
<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:8b5518fe-0c21-457e-9962-a3b0c9a02043@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">dcarhoun</span></a> There is always the possibility that Hookers For Hillary comes out not so much as support for Hillary, but for her husband... Possibly a frequent contributor to their business if you would believe the rumors and his conduct while in office.</p>
<p>Trump is going to win. As he should. He brings the most to the plate, Democrats are crossing party lines to vote for him. We need this to win. Rubio will not win against the liberals.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:ff852c33-6974-4ee3-b355-1cdf29df6b78@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">coreartsdesigns</span></a>  Trump puts the pedal to the medal! (y)</p>
<p>Yep, he sure brings a lot....like multiple bankruptcies, his mafia ties, his debt that he still owes Goldman Sachs and Citi bank. Not to mention his foul mouth and even more foul temper. Yeah we really need someone like him with his finger on the button, don't we?  Personally, I think not.</p>
<p>The Democrats are crossing party lines because they have nothing but empty promises for more free stuff we can't afford.   Mr.  Rogers could win the election of he were the nominee!  This is our one chance to vote for a real, true blue Conservative who has proven consistent.   This is why the establishment fears Cruz so much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fox News you are losing me as a viewer, we all watched you because you reported the news.  Now you are trying to Make the news.  Stop misrepresenting Cruz, you know you are.  I understand you supporting trump, your afraid of him and he boosts your ratings.  But why do you support and do Rubios dirty work, of lying about Cruz.  Shamefull of you, you are tearing us apart.</p>

<p>The voters aren't listening to you FOX, CNN, or MSNBC bad mouth Ted Cruz, it's not working!  People are loving him in an overwhelming way whenever he talks substantially about the issues that matter to the American people. People are listening to Ted Cruz, not the nasty media!</p>
<p>Don't worry bernster  the hilldabeast can't win all the coin tosses and card cuts.</p>
<p>Mr.. Trump will bring out the all of the citizens as one group together  in higher percentages than Clinton did.  He is a leader who will win and has one ambition and that is to make 'American Great Again' </p>
<p>sanders supporters when your tired of getting screwed and cheated by clinton, VOTE TRUMP</p>
<p>how many dems are going to stay home or vote for trump lol what a shame for them its like an the face for Hillary and bill trying to think abou how he can take on so many hookers at one time</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Under 10,000 votes for the both of them.  Tells you what you need to know.  Democrats are not thrilled with either one of them and just stayed home.<br/></p>
<p>Who is the least worse? Cast your ballot for them. That is the state of affairs of US politics. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Given the proclivity of the clinton campaign to lie and cheat... really... WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?</p>
<p>I love Fox News so much and there slogan FAIR AND BALANCED it's a tea party outlet for right winged paradise form the relanazation that no one cares about your old fashioned views where China is the enemy and Russia is our freind.</p>

<p>Hit-Lary does not deserve anybody's vote.  She received 6000 votes  out of 460,000 registered democrats and 1.2 million voters in the state.  How pathetic.</p>

<p>Still worry</p>
<p>Voted for Hillary, Nevada people are dumb as a wart.</p>
<p>Nevada people? Dude she won with 6k votes that is nothing</p>
<p></p>
<p>Someone says Vegas had lost its luster! That's only when Clinton is there. I totally agree with 'asway' below. You want to know the truth about Clinton, go to Youtube or any of a ton of other sources &amp; get informed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lets see, less than 12,000 people cast their Democrat vote out of how many people in Nevada??????????????  I'm not a rocket scientist, or mathematician, but that number looks awfully small????????? </p>
<p>S/he's done it!</p>
<p>Yikes.......Las Vegas has obviously lost its luster.....Reid/Clinton.....</p>
<p>It was still pretty close. Hope she loses in the end, I really don't want to have to move.</p>
<p>Trump</p>
<p>This will tell you all you need to know about Hillary Clinton - Go to Youtube - "Banned Documentaries - Episode 1 - The Hillary Files"</p>
<p>People are voting stupidly and not voting for obviously better alternatives in the GOP and stand to lose the very democracy that allows them to vote stupidly if either democrat wins ! </p>
<p>I guess the habit is hard to break...the last two elections set the pattern</p>

<p>It's humorous to hear the Clinton camp announce this as a definitive landslide victory.  It's nothing o the kind.</p>

<p>With 84% reported, Hillary only won by 5%.  She is losing her base faster than a hog in quicksand</p>
<p>Hillary is a hog in quicksand.</p>
<p>I'm all for Hillary to win, she will be easy to beat in the presidential race.. </p>
<p>Clinton will win and be President of the US, there are not that many haters in the US that will vote for Trump</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>If she wins the nomination DOJ will be ordered not to mess with her.   We're doomed.   Run, run fast with your wallet.</p>
<p><span>Go to youtube, search "Hillary Clinton: A Career Criminal" and watch the video. Hope the republicans put this video front and center when the general election starts.</span></p>
<p>Sanders is so far outside the economic wheel house of most Americans--even Democrats--that even the lying, amoral, and felonious Hillary Clinton can beat him!!, even if it did take heavy support from the less-than-well-educated service workers union.  No real surprise.</p>
<p>As the Oracle predicted; president elect Simpson will have to restore the shattered economy after president trumps disastrous term (s).</p>
<p>The question should be who's the best of the worst! This election is such a circus!</p>
<p>It will boil down to making a judgment of  evil of two lessers.</p>
<p>I find it unimaginable that Hillary has not used the word "Socialist" against Sanders. Does she think this will lose her votes in today's America? Understandable why the GOP is laying off ... they want to face the "socialist".<br/></p>
<p>I find it even more questionable that Bernie hasn't used the word espionage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I don't trust anything Hillary does, somehow she cheated or had people cheat for her<br/></p>
<p>She is judged not to be trustworthy or even likable.  If she wins the general election I will sever my relationship with cable TV.   Luckily my contract expires in 01/2017</p>
<p>I thought for a second it said 58% vs 52% not that I was shocked knowing its the democrats....</p>
<p>Another super delegates win for hillary? Looks like Bernie carried the Hispanic vote.  Bad news for queen. What going to happen in the general?</p>

<p>Amazing news .  Hillary wins all 10 counties by high card pick. ;) </p>
<p>If the progs ever run out of under subsidized people to exploit, and "victims" to coddle, they will be through. I'm voting for America and We the people to continue winning of our own endeavors and decisions. The Hill-Bernie platform feels like a guilt trip on us due to our lack of taking care, and helping of one another. They will distribute the "help" and regulate outcomes since We the people are not smart enough to run our own lives.</p>
<p>The way Clinton protects classified information....yea that's who I want running the country. Oh well after the indictment comes out that should take care of her run for pres.</p>

<p>Nevada democrats rated "Terrorism" as last on the list of  priorities, with the economy being first.. I guess they don't think an ISIS  or any terrorist motivated shooting like San Bernardino can happen in Nevada, particularly in the Casinos. Ignorance and Ostrich thinking abounds in the United States. No wonder we're such easy targets.</p>
<p>No security No economy!!</p>

<p>An honorable person such a  candidate for President should know when to quit, and not drag her party and supporters down with her. </p>
<p>She's not honorable</p>
