<p> I have seen Barry's golf swing and he pretty much sucks.  He should stay home and play with himself!</p>
<p> The man s a classless Communist <a href="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">p</a><span><a href="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@ick</a> with a chip on his shoulder at all times.  Why would we expect anything different.</span></p>
<p> Obama is the worse thing that happened to America. If it has anything to do with anti-American he'll rush to the front. He's not a good man.</p>
<p>Once again we witness the fact that the Obamas lack class.  Can take them out of the ghetto, but can't take the ghetto out of them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>  I wouldn't want my fathers murderer at his funeral either.</p>
<p> Looks like Obama has a very important golf game; rather than attend a Justice Scalia's funeral. I guess we all have priorities.</p>

<p>Obama shows the true colors of his agenda and loyalties once again.  The most anti-UNITED States president in history.  Visit Communist Cuba and miss an honored Supreme Court Justice's funeral.  He has done more damage to American interests, traditions, Constitutional integrity, etc, than any enemy we've ever had.</p>

<p> This article is as bad as Fox News seems to be becoming.  In this week of watching your shows, I have yet to hear any of your commentators tell the American people that Mr. Obama, while in the Senate, personally filibustered the nomination of  conservative Justice Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court in 2006, who was nominated by Republican President Bush.. Do you suppose if you told us, we might wonder if perhaps Mr. Obama is embarrassed to go since he is now crying the Republicans may just do the same thing to his now own probable wishful liberal nomination to the High Court.  Also it would be good if Fox News would cover the fact that Justice Scalia ruled against some of Mr. Obamas liberal positions.  Just Google "Obama filibuster" and you can read it for yourself. Obama now saying, through the White House, that he regrets what he did is just too damm late !</p>
<p></p>
<p>We should be happy that a petulant, vapid, embarrassment of a president won't sully the memory of an intellectual giant like Antonin Scalia by attending. Better off if he plays golf.</p>
<p>Security reasons, what a joke. The real reason is he's to busy packing for Cuba and since he can't pull his race card there is no benefit in him attending. Gotta love the White House spokes person though... Not attending due to security reasons is laughable. <br/></p>

<p>Spiritually speaking, people who are possessed or heavily oppressed by demons cannot enter into the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ who is present in the Holy Eucharist in the Basilica (in the Tabernacle). During the consecration of the hosts during the Mass proper (here the Funeral Mass), the Lord's real physical presence (body, blood, soul and divinity) is also made manifest.  Such people will feel nauseous, weak and have to leave the building.  The presence of our Lord Jesus Christ is why satanists steal the consecrated host. </p>
<p>Oh, come now. Why should we expect Barack Obama to show any class? When does he ever?</p>
<p>Obama doesn't believe in the Constitution so why should he respect someone who lived and breathed the Constitution?</p>
<p> Obama feels that he must stick to the important things...He has an appointment with Sharpton..and Farrakhan.</p>
<p> If the American people have to choose between two Globalists ( Bush/Clinton ) because of the superdelegates , they are done .</p>
<p> A thug in a suit is still a thug .</p>
<p>They should stop referring to Jill Biden as Dr Jill Biden. Her PhD is in education. She's not a medical doctor nor does she have a PhD in an area that would warrant being called Dr. When I was in college, people like Jill Biden who majored in education were considered to be doing that because they couldn't cut it in any other areas. Self aggrandizement is very unattractive. <br/></p>

<p>It is a shameful thing that a sitting President is so lacking in common decency that he would refuse to attend the funeral of a 30-year veteran of the Supreme Court.

<p>I cannot remember who it was but there was a countries leader that died whom the president did not see eye to eye with.  The rest of the world had its leaders go to the funeral, who attended for the US? An ambassador.  This really got criticism from the leaders of the rest of the World.  So Obama's idea is that if he does not like you he is not going to respect you.<br/></p>

<p>There is a simple explanation as to why barry isn't attending. Scalia was white and conservative, two things barry hates</p>
<p>Trump's going to have him back in the cotton fields soon enough.</p>
<p>Maybe Obama is finally catching on that nobody wants him there or anywhere for that matter.</p>
<p> Obama has already got plans to have a "Choom Party" with his buddies, Willie Nelson &amp; Snoop Dog, on the roof of the White House and he can't get out of it..........He's already ordered snacks for the munchies.</p>

<p>They should eulogize Justice Scalia profusely, and then show a video montage of Obama Golfing every where he goes. There's no shortage of  clips. </p>
<p>Obama accepted a Nobel Peace Prize and has been talking about his political and countless other "enemies" ever since. </p>

<p>Liberalism is the definition of intolerance and close-mindedness. <br/></p>
<p>And yet, where was the outrage when Scalia didn't show for something mandated in the Constitution he claimed to love so much... the State of the Union Addresses... yes PLURAL?</p>

<p>Justice Scalia's family  probably told Obama he wasn't going to be speaking, giving a Eulogy, so Obama figured why bother attending if he couldn't be the center of attention.  Thanks again to Justice Scalia's family. </p>
<p>Personally I don't know how Obama could show his face at the funeral.  He has expressed nothing but disdain and contempt towards our U S Supreme Court and its members; especially Justice Scalia!</p>
<p><span>Biden will be at Scalia's funeral and Obama is paying his respects on Friday. </span><span>Even if Obama did attend it's not like he could hug anyone bc we saw how Republicans reacted to that with Christie. </span><span>The bigger issue at hand than Obama not attending this funeral is the fact that Republicans don't want to let Obama do his job and appoint a new justice despite him still having nearly 25% of his term left. How shady is that? It's not his job to go around attending everybody's funeral but it is his job to appoint a chief justice THAT'S the difference. Maybe stop worrying about things that aren't part of his job description and worry about Republicans' stubbornness to let him actually do what is.</span></p>
<p>What did Obama do during his first two years in Office when Democrats controlled both the house and the Senate?</p>

<p>@gymbag  when the democrats had total control they did nothing productive just like now. term limits would solve a lot of stalemates. Unfortunately that will never happen but a revolving door would sweep out the worthless and encourage new blood to come in and get the work done. All politicians are alike and the dems have been lying consistently during Obamas reign. Benghazi just one of many examples. And they are so bad at it, they keep getting caught. O was supposed to bring everyone together and he has done nothing because his heart is so full of hate for white people he cannot function. We are more divided now than ever. That is his legacy.</p>

<p>And exactly who is surprised by this?</p>

<p>obamma, our boy king, paranoid, narcissist president will turn Scalias death &amp; funeral into a fundraising event.<br/></p>
<p>O not going to Scalia's funeral says much more about him than Scalia. Somehow I don't think Scalia is surprised.</p>

<p>Is this the same president who recently feigned regret in his SOTU speech at his inability to bring both sides of the aisle together?</p>

<p>Good.  Most Americans don't want to see this traitor at a solemn memorial to a real American hero whose memory will live on long after the memory of Barack Obama is thrown on to the trash heap of history.</p>

<p>Well since the judge was white he will not be attendance. Had it been a young black criminal killed by a cop we know at least three high ranking members of his cabinet would be in attendance.</p>

<p> Must be difficult for Secret Service to protect this man on the golf course. If anyone is looking for him they just need to check the golf course.</p>
<p> Its Golf day Stupid, nothing should interfere with round of golf. When asked at the Press conference about Obama playing golf on Sat. Earnest was vague which means Obama is definitely golfing. Amazing how disrespectful this man is. If it fits his ideology he respects it, if its is the other side or anyone who disagrees with him he fully disrespects it. He doesn't deserve people's respect because he refuses to be a person of respect. </p>
<p>The judiciary is equal to the presidency,  even though a POS race-baiter thug occupies that office now. I'd spit on Obama's grave.</p>
<p>jerk, ideolog</p>
<p>I wonder if he will attend Fidel Castro's funeral?</p>
<p>actually I am happy this piece of s#it doesn't show up because Judge Scalia deserves the respect he has earned through his actions. The traitorazzhole is probably spending the day on the golfcourse or writes sympathy cards for some of his 'sons' from the hood who got killed during the commission of a robbery.</p>

<p>275/7=  39 Rounds per year of an av3rage of one round every 1 1/2 weeks.  I do not know another person who could do this and work.</p>
<p>275 Rounds of Golf while president. I don't think I have played that many in my life !!</p>
<p>Obama is a disgrace, not only as an elected official, but more importantly as a person. This complete lack of patriotism cannot be defended by any reasonable human being. <br/></p>
<p>Obama, you don't get a second chance for a first reaction.<br/></p>
<p>Obama could care less what people think........ He lives in his own warped world.......<br/></p>
<p>Golfer in chief has a round or two scheduled</p>
<p> His BLM buddies done went and spooked him with all their stories of ghost in white sheets running around the graveyard.</p>

<p>How about an investigation in his death. Seriously sound fishy like everything else going on..</p>
