<p>The GOP Broke Their Pledge With Trump...  Not the other way around..   If he ends up having to Go Independent...Then He Still Gets My Vote..</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rubio may as well quit now. Whether it's Rubio and Cruz or Rubio and Trump. Most Cruz supporters will vote trump and most trump supporters will vote Cruz.</p>
<p> Trump has not been treated fairly from the begging.  Just like sanders.  If you want wall street and the establishments.  Go Trump....</p>
<p>Immigration policy a disaster, foreign policy a disaster,  trade deficit a disaster,  budget policy a disaster,  budget deficit a disaster, education system a disaster, health care system a disaster. Anyone up for more of the same?</p>
<p>How about the other thousand tickets?</p>

On the other hand, I and many of my friends applied for tickets the first day they opened and NONE of us were offered tickets. They claim tickets were distributed by lottery but they certainly made sure people they wanted there were offered first.</p>

<p> Get rid of all audiences for the debates.  They detract and waste valuable time with their unsolicited responding and applause.  It was pretty obvious at the debate that the audience was extremely pro Bush.  That was no accident and Priebus is lying through his teeth.  I don't believe anything coming from the RNC or the DNC for that matter.  Clinton and Bush are the establishment candidates and the parties want the status quo to continue.  Well, Americans have had enough.  Go Sanders and Trump !!!!!</p>

<p>I agree jynxcat.   Kasich would make an excellent President.  He has the experience and the right temperment.</p>

I don't think Kasich is the guy. He's good. I like him, but it really needs to be either Cruz or Rubio. We all need to pick one of those two and take Trump out.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>First thing that needs to happen is bush needs to drop out.</p>
<p><a class="fyre-mention fyre-mention-livefyre" data-lf-handle="" data-lf-provider="livefyre" property="url" rel="nofollow" resource="acct:4963fc90-e59b-4fdd-ac35-8c6098bd5d78@foxnewsprod.fyre.co" target="_blank" typeof="Person" vocab="http://schema.org">@<span property="name">dadeo71</span></a> I think Bush, Kasich, and Carson really need to drop out on Sunday, after SC. Nice guys, but it's time to focus. What I'm trying to figure out is can/would Cruz and Rubio be able to combine their delegate totals at some point and gang up on Trump? Can one of them give the delagates they will have won by April for example to the other and push that candidate ahead of Trump?<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Trump is this campaign seasons Ross Perot, dividing the Republicans,  except he's doing it from within. He needs to crash and burn sooner not later so a real Republican can go on to win the White House.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Clinton or Sanders would beat Cruz or Rubio in a election because they would exploit their youth and inexperience.</p>
<p>God's grace and mercy is the only thing that made America great, and the
 only thing that can continue to keep America great. A narcissist leader
 cannot do that! Please wake up all you Trumpians. I get the anger, but 
we don't need another liberal narcissist in the Oval Office. Trumpians 
prove that the conservative side has a "low information" crowd just like
 the liberal side. Investigate what he really stands for. How will he 
make America great?</p>

<p>Cruz and Rubio are the two least experienced candidates running and have the same amount of experience as Obama did when he ran.</p>
<p> Trump projects a personality that is not favorable to some voters, reporters,tv hosts, "ESTABLISHMENT" politicians and now the RNC . All of this campaign foreplay and reporting is nothing more than a psycological attempt to persuade voters to shift to the candidate that THEY favor to be the nomineee. I look beyond the promises that ALL candidates pledge and seek the best person suitable for the job considering the condition that our country is in. Clearly, Trump is the most capable candidate to turn our country around while preserving the  FREEDOM and rewards for hard work by many Americans. Hopefully, this election will be determined by free minds that are not controlled by the media or communists within our country.</p>

<p>Trump doesn't need to do this. He keeps contradicting himself. He wants the PR to attract Democratic voters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in a duel at highnoon  between O'Reilly shooting memos from his memo gun, and Trump, shooting tweets from his tweeter gun, O'Reilly would be left on the ground on main street, near the saloon, with sprawled legs and blurred vision wondering why he ever dared to challenge Trump, "the Trumpinator",  to a duel with his silly memo gun.</p>

<p>Remember, Trump doesn't need the GOP, the GOP needs him. Trump has a different kind of base. If he doesn't become the nominee, he'll run as independent and carry his base with him, Dem, Rep and Independents. People who are tired of the establishment. Trump is already hinting that option.</p>
<p> now our elections are equivalent to "reality" tv. </p>
<p>Obama is a very good speaker and made a promise of Hope and Change. Everybody cream their pants everytime he talks. Now you see what we got. Remember, Trump is the only one who speaks using plain rough language.  </p>

<p>And THAT is a bald faced lie. The RNC gave 200'tickets to Linsey Graham and 200 more to Nikki Haley. Trumps people got 14. While it may be technically correct that "the campaigns got 642 tickets", that doesn't quite jive with Trump's campaign getting 14 tickets. If we were awarding Pinnochio's for lying, Prius would get 8 out of a possible 4. This guy just proved, beyond doubt, that the RNC is trying to rig this election.</p>
<p>Uneducated South Carolinas who are backing Trump are far removed from the fact that Trump is made in the same image as Bernie Maddoff. Even though, Trump himself was screwed by the scam that brought down maddoff, he's a mindless con artist who scammed students of thousands of dollars using a fake University that he setup for that purpose. </p>
<p>Trump doesn't owe the gop a thing. The rnc, fos, Rush and the rest of the right wing media propaganda machine has been against him from the beginning. When he wins the nomination they will have to support him.</p>

<p>I am ssupporting Trump. None of the GOP hopefuls has any solution on our economic problems and our rising 20Trillion dollar debt.  Trump is the only one talking about it. He talks about our trade deficit with China and what causes the deficit. Trump talks and understands Currency Devaluation which causes our trade deficit , where I know that no other candidates, Rep or Dem, even know anything about it. We will not have a "National Security" if we have a very weak economy. Just to remind you guys, by the time Obama leaves office we will owe 23Trillion. </p>

<p>Please Trump run as an independent. We really don;t feel like spending all that money to bring you and the GOP down together. We will let you do it on your own.</p>
<p> Trump fans please bother to notice that DT expects a stacked deck on his behalf every time. The debates are to be treated like Trump rallies with no other participation allowed.

<p>I am voting for Donald, GOP or Independent. </p>
<p> I just want to know how it feels to know in advance that your party has already lost the presidential race. I mean, wether trump gets the gop nomination or he takes his dog and pony show on the road as an independent, the gop is lost. I mean, wow, you guys completely shot yourselves in the ahs with this nut. It wont even be a race....</p>
<p>Priebus has it backwards. The RNC is supposed to support its candidates. The candidates instead are told to support whatever schemes the RNC has decided on, whether they're crooked or honest. This is why the GOP is so screwed up now and why they're giving Trump so much grief. He's running against their rotten schemes instead of being their water carrier.<br/></p>
<p>Trump 2016 GOP or Independant</p>
<p> How many did Donald Trump the front runner get?  You yourself said in the previous debate that you a lot  to Nikki Haley and Lindsey Graham to give out.  Did you think they would share with anyone.  Nikki Haley does not have a campaign, nor does Graham.  Why can't you just be truthful Mr. FNC?  The US voters are smart and there are candidates and RNC leadership that  think they are not intelligent enough to see what is happening.  You should all be shamed.  But, of course you all who have taken finances from donors have an obligation to them.  So sad.  You are all insulting yourself and your candidacy.  And Reince Prebius, you have made it known you have it in for Donald Trump, you are so unfair!  It is plain that the voters are the ones who choose the  frontrunner, but all leadership think they should choose the President, not the people, and is an insult to the Constitution.</p>

<p>On Fox, "We the People" is code for "Me, the Person"</p>
<p>I posted below as I'd just heard about the WSJ poll (which has been way off before) so to the point that the audience for the debate wasn't stacked, it was reported in more than one source that the SC RNC handed out most of them and Graham got a bunch.  So we know who he put in the audience.  I even saw one report where they found a mike among the booers.  The booing was incredibly loud.  Once Trump made his "donors &amp; supporters" comment, it stopped.  Interesting, huh?  Well, <span>Priebus</span> can say all he wants to that it won't stop, but I will.  It is rude, immature and crass to behave like grade school children AND it makes it hard to hear the answer on TV.  So give the tickets to people with some manners or I'm gone from watching the debates too!  Just saying . . .</p>
<p>Like the RNC is going to admit  to its underhanded tricks. They already said that wanted  a brokered convention. I wouldn't put anything past the RNC or the DNC when it comes to holding onto power</p>
<p>Ted Cruz's parents expatriated to Canada and Ted was brought  here as a 4 year old so the Parents did not live in the USA, That Is a much different scenario  than a Child being born to a serviceman or  a missionary Or the Parents being on vacation! Maybe.... Edward Snowden one day will have kids and they will run for President! ,George Washington would love that!!!!</p>

<p>I dont know how old most of you are but I lived a life here where you can say what want, live like you want and the choices were unlimited. Thats all been taken away from 2 generations, take my word for it, it may be hard for you now to try and think for yourself, but you will get used to it, may even surprise yourself how well you are at it...........</p>

<p>Trump cant win a general election, too many republicans will stay home</p>
<p>Look if Trump was a dem, and me being a lifelong repub. I would vote for him, why? Because this country needs someone like him, the whole country our kids, everyone, unless your so hateful and scared, dont think for yourself, or on crack everyone should see that.....</p>
<p>You real dems out there, dont worry, the chance of either of your folks winning is almost zero, and I feel your pain, but my guess Trump will be there for the whole country including the dems, we will all get along again....</p>
<p>Polls show trump losing to clinton by 5 and sanders by a landslide. Rubio is the only one who beats both</p>
<p>Trump is the greatest thing to ever happen to the DNC. </p>
<p>nd you all believe the head of a political organization and its memo to a Fox news reporter??...LOL</p>
