<p>Ahead of the Nevada Democratic caucuses this weekend, a group of sex workers operating under the name Hookers for Hillary is going all in for Hillary Clinton’s campaign – touting her positions on health care and other issues.</p>
<p>According to The Guardian, brothel owner Dennis Hof and the girls at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch launched the pro-Clinton project shortly after she entered the race. </p>
<p>In interviews with the newspaper, they described their support as an endorsement of Clinton’s efforts to combat domestic violence as well. And one simply described it as a case of women helping women.</p>
<p>“We’re helping Hillary and we’re helping ourselves. Women should help other women, right?” Entice Love, a 26-year-old sex worker, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/15/hookers-for-hillary-clinton-nevada-caucuses-bernie-sanders-moonlite-bunny-ranch" target="_blank">told The Guardian</a>.</p>
<p>The group, <a href="http://hookers4hillary.com/" target="_blank">on its website</a>, offers a four-point rationale for supporting Clinton: her defense of ObamaCare; her foreign policy experience; her support for agencies “that protect the public’s health”; and even her opposition to “supply side economics.”</p><div class="ad-container mobile in-article"> <div class="ad gpt" data-ad-init="1" data-ad-slot-rendered="1" data-rendered-size="300x250" id="mobile-300x251"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics/elections_1__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="250" id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics/elections_1" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics/elections_1" scrolling="no" src="javascript:&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style='background:transparent'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;" style="border: 0px none; vertical-align: bottom;" title="3rd party ad content" width="300"></iframe></div><iframe frameborder="0" height="0" id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics/elections_1__hidden__" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics/elections_1__hidden__" scrolling="no" src="javascript:&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style='background:transparent'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;" style="border: 0px none; vertical-align: bottom; visibility: hidden; display: none;" title="" width="0"></iframe></div> </div>
<p>On the latter point, the group says husband Bill Clinton presided over the “most prosperous time in Bunny Ranch history, which coincided with a tax increase” on wealthy Americans.</p>
<p>“A return to relying on the disproven theory of trickle-down economics would only serve to exclude the vast majority of hard-working Bunny Ranch clients from having the discretionary income to enjoy with their favorite Bunny,” the group says.</p>
<p>The endorsement and efforts on behalf of the Clinton campaign are a departure from 2008 and 2012 when the clique was backing the libertarian Ron Paul.</p>
<p>But Love said, “When I’m looking at who I want to pick for the presidency, I look at what are they doing that I can relate to that will be of benefit for me.”</p>
