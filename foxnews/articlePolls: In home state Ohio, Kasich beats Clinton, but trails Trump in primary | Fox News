<p>While GOP front-runner Donald Trump is out touting his numbers in Ohio, a fresh poll released Wednesday indicates primary rival and the state’s governor, John Kasich, has a better shot at beating the eventual Democratic nominee in the key swing state come November. </p><div class="mod-16 active"> <div class="ad-container"> <div class="ad gpt" data-ad-init="1" data-ad-slot-rendered="1" data-rendered-size="300x250" id="mobile-320x50_300x250"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_0__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="250" id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_0" scrolling="no" src="javascript:&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style='background:transparent'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;" style="border: 0px none; vertical-align: bottom;" title="3rd party ad content" width="300"></iframe></div><iframe frameborder="0" height="0" id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_0__hidden__" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_0__hidden__" scrolling="no" src="javascript:&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style='background:transparent'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;" style="border: 0px none; vertical-align: bottom; visibility: hidden; display: none;" title="" width="0"></iframe></div> <p class="advert-txt">ADVERTISEMENT</p> </div> </div>
<p>The Quinnipiac University poll shows Kasich beating Hillary Clinton by 17 points, 54-to-37 percent, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by 19 points, 54-to-35 percent.</p>
<p>Trump also leads in a head-to-head matchup with Clinton, but just by 2 percentage points, 44-to-42 percent, according to the poll.</p>
<div style="width:100%;margin:10px 0;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="600" scrolling="no" src="https://w.graphiq.com/w/6FzXMt5XmHb?data-uid=&amp;data-campaign=4961b87d2c" style="position:static;vertical-align:top;margin:0 auto;display:block;width:600px !important;max-width:100%;min-height:600px !important;max-height:none !important;" width="600"></iframe></div>
<p>Kasich has persevered in the bruising 2016 GOP primary battle, now among the five remaining candidates from the early field of 17. However, he has yet to win a primary or caucus and continues to poll at about 10 percent nationally. </p>
<p>The governor has dismissed suggestions he quit the race to allow the Washington establishment to coalesce around Marco Rubio or even Ted Cruz in a bid to take on Trump. His strategy appears to be to survive long enough to get to Ohio and win the state’s March 15 primary, then potentially surge. </p>
<p>“The last thing I worry about is how we’re going to do in Ohio,” Kasich told reporters Tuesday in Georgia. “We’re going to win Ohio.”</p><div class="ad-container mobile in-article"> <div class="ad gpt" data-ad-init="1" data-ad-slot-rendered="1" data-rendered-size="300x250" id="mobile-300x251"><div id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_1__container__" style="border: 0pt none;"><iframe frameborder="0" height="250" id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_1" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_1" scrolling="no" src="javascript:&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style='background:transparent'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;" style="border: 0px none; vertical-align: bottom;" title="3rd party ad content" width="300"></iframe></div><iframe frameborder="0" height="0" id="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_1__hidden__" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" name="google_ads_iframe_/4145/fnc/politics_1__hidden__" scrolling="no" src="javascript:&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body style='background:transparent'&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;" style="border: 0px none; vertical-align: bottom; visibility: hidden; display: none;" title="" width="0"></iframe></div> </div>
<p>The Quinnipiac poll shows Rubio and Cruz also ahead of Clinton in a hypothetical match-up, by 3 and 5 percentage points, respectively, in Ohio. </p>
<p>“The four leading Republican candidates either tie or lead former Secretary Clinton in Ohio, considered the best microcosm of the national electorate and a must-win for the GOP,” Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Still, the Ohio primary itself may be far from a shoo-in for Kasich, a popular and moderate Republican governor. </p>
<p>Quinnipiac, in fact, released a poll Tuesday that showed him trailing Trump, who has won three straight, early-balloting states -- New Hampshire, South Carolina and now Nevada.</p>
<p>That poll showed Trump leading Kasich in Ohio 31-to-26 percent among likely Republican primary voters.</p>
<p>Republicans have not won Ohio in a general election since 2004, with nominee and eventual President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to do fantastic in Ohio,” Trump recently told Fox News. “I just think we’re going to win a lot of states that frankly Republicans are not used to winning.”</p>
