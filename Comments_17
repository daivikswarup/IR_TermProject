                            Even the allies are against BJP.Goondaism by BJP brainless thugs, exports down, economy down, sesex down, petrol price up. That should say something about the future prospects of BJP in India.<br/>

                            I guess if Modi was allowed to rule some positive things would have happened, but it's RSS and Amit Shah ruling the country now, so don't expect more development

                            @Sathish Babu: True. Very true. But India voted for a single man and not BJP and that's the mistake. Our Hble PM can't handle these thugs and his dear friends.
