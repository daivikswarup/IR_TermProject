Jind:Â                             Leaders of 35 non-Jat communities today threatened to launch protest if any action is taken by BJP against its party lawmaker Raj Kumar Saini in connection with the Jat stir for quota.
Attacking BJP, a backward class leader Surya Prakash said that the party was trying to shift the blame for the agitation on Mr Saini.
"If any action is taken against Saini, then 35 non-Jat communities of the state will hold a protest and BJP will be responsible for it" he told reporters after a meeting of leaders of 35 non-Jat communities.
Before taking any action against Mr Saini, it should act against Jat leaders like Union Minister Birender Singh, his wife Premlata, state BJP president Subhash Barala, state's Finance Minister Abhimanyu who, he alleged, fanned the agitation.
Centre should compensate those whose shops were vandalised by the mobs during the agitation, Punjab Minister Sant Lal Chugh said.
