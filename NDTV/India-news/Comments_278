                            Such brazenness is only because they know BJP and fekuji are behind them  - if journalists and students are not safe on the premises of the court, where are they safe?

                            I strongly believe in our judiciary &amp; law and order system. We should not take law in our own  hands. We have elected a party to govern so we should trust them. And I think that if anyone is taking law in his own hands means he have no trust in our elected government.

That is exactly the case of the JNU students as well - so let us go bash this fake lawyer up first and then let him prove his worth in court. What a 'kalank' this guy is to the profession of law! Actually his caliber is quite suited to his sansakars really! Wonder what his Mother would think of him now?

                            People should stop violence in the name of nationalism, it is sheer madness an punishable under law. If mob justice becomes the way of justice, then we should justify Jats demands who have burned Haryana with an official loss of 37000 crores.
