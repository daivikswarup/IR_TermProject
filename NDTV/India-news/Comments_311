                            well done Mr.Rudy. A dignified gesture for a minor omission.Still it is a reflection of the fact that every little omission or commission will be made a mountain of by an opposition bereft of real issues. So one creates issues and an overactive , creative media is always happy to magnify them, blow it out of proportion and oblige their one time masters.
