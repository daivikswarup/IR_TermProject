                            Dear Modiji please remember that announcing attractively captioned schemes is one thing and really seeing that they are actually implemented well I s another. You are very good in making announcements and there is doubt on that. But when it comes to implementation lot of questions are yet to be answered. Digital India, Skill India, Swach Bhararh, Smart cities, Make in India and now Rurban....sole searching is required....!!!

                            To implement Rurban government must bring cultural awareness among masses is very important. Only with statements it is not possible.  <br/>
India has forgotten city culture intellectual importance is vanished from cities and money from beokerism culture is dominated. Mohallas forgetten to respect a professsor but bowing before pety criminals.  <br/>
Now in India, all cities have migrant Labour culture and in  same way Europe and USA cities have Asian and midlle east migrant Labour culture.
