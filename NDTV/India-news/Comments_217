                            I saw the demonstration by students of Jadvapur university on TV. the slaogans were anti-India. It is obvious that the demonstrators are not for the unity of India and will work against India. These guys should be punished for anti- India activities.

                            Trust me, majority 99.99% of Bengal don't care about Afzal or Kashmir ki aZadi. Publicity stunt. They want media attention.

                            why these buggers did not protest against the government of the time which hanged him.. they are all finding every opportunistic situation to protest against the current government in the name of intolerance even for acts done by earlier governments.

                            If raising pro-azadi slogans for Kashmir is not anti-national then what is anti-national ? Are you people so ignorant ?  Do people like Saha know atleast what this country is and how it was integrated. A soldier struggles day and night guarding our country in harsh weather conditions and you people instead of providing moral support to them, stab them and their families at the back. Its time to take back citizenship of all those people who support terrorists. If you support them, then go to pakistan.

                            The Govt's strict and prompt action on JNU matter is commendable. Such actions should have been initiated long back, which the previous Governments in power failed to do. Its high time that Center should look deeper into W. Bengal for such anti national activities in the name of democracy.

                            THERE IS NO CRISIS IN HANDLING. THE HANDLING WAS VERY MILD. THESE JOBLESS 20 SOMETHING KNOW NOTHINGS WILL TEACH THE SUPREME COURT WHAT JUSTICE IS? THEY WILL ALSO TEACH PEOPLE LIKE US WITH JOBS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND DEGREES WHAT DEMOCRACY IS BY BURNING OUR FALGS IN OUR TAX RUPEE FUNDED INSTITUTES. I HAVE ONE SUGGESTION FOR THEM. GO DO YOUR "CULTURAL" EVENTS IN YOUR OWN UNIVERSITIES. I WANT MY TAX BACK. MY MONEY WILL NOT BE SPENT TO SUPPORT SUCH IDEOLOGIES. PERIOD.

That's your double standard!!<br/><br/>
March by Jadhavpur Uni. screamed - they want freedom of Manipur and Kashmir &amp; eulogized Afzal who attached temple of Democracy!! That's bullying!! You provoke separatists and strengthen terrorists' jihad!! Jubi Saha from uni. asserts that Afzal was a hero.<br/><br/>
Double standard!! Don't get kicked where it hurts the most when Nation shows double standard because Delhi police have already exhibited super-standard paying no damn attention to the attacks on media at Patiala House Court Premises.

                            Whole of this planet knows that state of Kashmir was &amp; will remain to be an integral part of India. Even Pakistan &amp; their supporters in India, like we have seen in JNU &amp; now in this university in kolkata,also understand this.But since you get your pay cheques from Pakistan or from terrorist organisations, you have to at least show that some work is being done to justify the money being paid to them. Actually this is not their mistake, these people like afzal &amp; his supporters are just a result of failed contraceptives or no contraceptive at all. I am sure, our Indian army will not get bothered by these anti national shouting and screaming. They are always their to guard our motherland against enemy (outside or inside both). Anyways what about the terrorist "umar khalid", has be been arrested or still on the run. It really makes me laugh be imagining his situation now, his mommy surely must be tired of changing his nappy every than n now, delhi police fear must be making him peeing in his pants like a leaking tap. May be he should go for Diapers...
