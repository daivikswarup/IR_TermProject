                            Pakistan meets separatists as sympathizers and supporters. India supports freedom fighters of Baluchistan and Sindh. Thus Indian envoy must meet the oppressed Baluchistan and Sindh leaders going inside Pakistan.  If Pakistan refuses then stop Pak-envoy to meet Kashmiri separatists.

                            Let the tension go sky high. Pak will not be taking any action against anyone and you all know it.

                            One used to blame congress Govt. For not taking any action against Pakistan. Who is stopping BJP now. In fact India should not take any action as it will be counterproductive.<br/><br/>
The best thing will be no more surprise visits and no more talks till  they start behaving. We must make sure we are very strong if required.
