While he talks big, he never commented on the corruption under his rule in 10 years from 2004-2014. Double standards.

                            Raga or should i say Rag. You have nothing to respond to. The facts stated by the minister are what they are. You and your Comi friends are trying to target a tolerant Hindu diaspora who live with a dream of India. An India where everyone is equal, an India where the law is equal, an India where life presents same opportunities and challenges for everyone, an India where there is freedom to move, freedom to speak, freedom to do business, freedom to buy and sell property. An India where freedom comes with consequences as does everything in life. An India whee NOONE, NONE can say India is bad to live and still continue to enjoy for whatever quality of life the state and the system provides. Now it is your time to face the music. You want to fragment the Hindus into Dalits, Pichhda, Rajput, Brahmin, Bania and sing of atrocities that have been committed on Dalits by their own Hindu brethren. You on one side say change is the only constant. Yes may be 3 centuries back there were some rules and ways of life which are now not existing. The current lot of non-Dalits have lived in India for 69 years without complaining why they have been given a deal which restricts opportunities for their kins. 69 years is 3 generations on non-Dalits who have lived in an unfair world. Your governments which have been ruling the country for 60 out of these 69 years have been incapable and inefficient to bridge the social gap and instead of bridging the gap you have further widened the gap for your own political gains. The non-Dalit in India still wants Dalit reservations to continue but would also like to see reservations for their economically, physically, mentally challenged kins. What is wrong in their ask? Why is a suicide by a Dalit scholar a bigger issue than a suicide by a non Dalit scholar? Why is "Bharat ki barbadi" not an anti-national statement as per you? Why should that be let go as "childish behaviour"? Why is it that no Non-Dalit comes out on the street and says such slogans? Why are you on support of students at JNU who raised these slogans? What is the need to celebrate Mahishasur Martyrdom Day? What is wrong if I do not like a cow being killed? What is wrong if I thrash someone who hurts my national and religious feelings?

                            really fed up of seeing all these.. the big question is whether the parliamentarians are going to do something for the country . as a citizen of this country, the demand is dont waste hard earned tax payers money by indulging in petty school fight type of things. the result will be citizens will discard you. already lot of parliament time has been washed away. the demand is GST,DTC and key reforms have to happen. then the respected MP's may stage dharna or shout as the case may be. Dear Members of Parliament, Please dont disrupt the proceedings and waste hard earned taxpayers money.....
