                            What ever be the outcome of this Sedition case etc,one thing is for sure.Kanhaiya Kumar,Umar Khalid and Co has got a bright future ahead.They will soon be chief of some left party and lead cushy lifes,like their present leaders Prakash Karat,Sitaram Yechury,Brinda Karat,D.Raja and co who never fought an election (leave alone winning them) and have any meaningful presence for their party in indian political scene yet enjoy all the perks of being in top of political life and TV lime light which comes with it!!<br/>
These brats are too cuNning and clever.They understand life and its choices much better than us morons,who will keep putting up with what ever tamasha they show!! <br/>
On the other hand some over patriotic people taking law into their hands too needs to be condemned.It is not their patriotism,rather their overzealous attempts to prove their patriotism which is the problem.They too unfortunately is keen to grab the headlines and be noticed by the powers that may be and then be rewarded.<br/>
But frankly boasting of beating up a student while in police custody that too for 3 hours is pure rubbish as the attempts by Umar Khalid and co in denying any connection to their anti-india slogans!!.Thats human tendency-we would boast more if we feel there are people clapping for and we deny any connection to an event if we feel others are objecting to it-simples!!

I just can't cease to get amazed by the IQ and the common sense of the great Indians and the great intellectuals like Brahma Gupta, Arayabhatta and Chanakya would be so proud of the intelligence of the present generation and their political acumen. India will be the super power of this world by 2019 or is it already? Thats what Jutely and Feku seem to claim if not in as many words. Please vote jumla party back to power in 2019 as well without fail. Please its a humble request.

                            There is a law of the land and everybody is bound to obey that. Kanhaiya Kumar may be a law offender, for that he has been arrested also, but law also says ordinary citizens does not have the right to punish an offender. The suspect is considered as innocent until unless it is proved in a court of law. If ordinary citizens takes the law in their hands, tomorrow there may be a retaliation for them also.  As said in Bible "Whoever is without sin among you, let him be the first to cast a stone at her." Patriotism cannot be measured by the fanatic display of emotions.

To me it seems the 'lawyers' are bragging and all the bleeding heart liberals who said that the JNU students were only sloganeering as they were kids should also ask this very basic question and let the bragger lawyers be. No point giving them undue publicity unless the plan is to disrupt parliament.

                            If JNU students supported hanging a terrorist , then such action is absolutely wrong. They should be punished.  But if the same students never spoke any thing anti - india and which does not amount to sedition then the government at the center has taken absolutely wrong. <br/>
But what ever it may be either its anti-india or Sedition, No one has the right to take law into their own hands and the Lawyers who behaved like goondas which does not match their professional ethics and which had brought such a great shame and disrespect to the entire lawyer community, such lawyers like Chauhan,Sharma and other who participated and misbehaved , the judiciary and bar council of india should immediately take action and cancel their license and FIR be filed and they should be punished accordingly.  Recent India TV sting operation video should be sent to concerned department to verify its authenticity and if its proved authentic then Criminal action should be initiated against this so called lawyers and they should be severely punished so that the professional ethics and dignity of the real professional lawyers community are upheld in the eyes of the Public.

                            The destruction wrought in parts of Haryana has been mindless, widespread unprecedented. Large areas have simply been laid to waste.Public infrastructure amounting to 100s of crores has been systematically destroyed.Daily  Lives of millions of  people and economic activity has bees disrupted. The targeting of property of certain groups and areas has shattered their lives forever and the division caused in society may never be repaired. One is almost moved to tears to see railways lines been uprooted, stations burnt, entire freight trains being set on fire, public buildings, power houses, police stations,banks etc etc being burnt to the ground. It is shameful that more force seems to be imposed on a bunch of slogan shouting students that an agitation that has caused much more destruction than any anti-national would have ever dreamed about. And no bunch of flag waving lawyers also to take on the mob destroying the mother land they so claim to be passionate about.

                            I don't understand why there are so many people here supporting Afzal, Kanhaiya Kumar.. Its an established fact that the protest was organised as martyrdom day for Afzal. Do we support this? Afzal hanging was done by congress so the government could have got away by saying 'this happened during UPA rule' but they didn't do that and stood by what previous government had done in interest of the nation. Lets not criticize just for the sake of criticizing. Any anti national elements should be dealt with the most stringent punishment possible. VANDE MATARAM.

                            Seems you forgot that Army is fighting terrorist in Kashmir for last few days and lives of brave soldiers are lost. Your main stay for last few days is behind this story rather than the Kashmir encounter.

                            Lawyers thought .. The country will make them proud to beat Anti nationals. Something JNU students should have done after hearing those slogans.<br/>

                            What the lawyers did was totally unlawful and they need to be punished. <br/><br/>
But my god how many of you are blaming Modi and Gujarat model etc for this incident. All the BJP leaders have condemned this. If Kanhaiya is not guilty, then he sure will be released. Its the courts who decide on his culpability. so let s not carried away and become judges.<br/><br/>
But I cannot understand how you people can support the anti national behaviour of some of the these people.

                            Anybody can be a hero, they must be prepared for the punishment and the consequences. He has to be punished, for whatever explanation he may have. Otherwise India will be a lawless country. He cannot be pardoned.
