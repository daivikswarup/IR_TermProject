New Delhi:Â                             Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula's family has expressed its desire to leave Hyderabad and shift to the national capital as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal promised a job for his younger brother.
Mr Vemula's mother, Radhika Vemula met Mr Kejriwal today, along with her younger son Raja, and told him that since Rohith Vemula's fellowship has been stopped, they had no source of income, sources said.
"In the meeting, Rohith's mother expressed her desire to leave Hyderabad," sources said.
The family, which had been living in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, had moved to Hyderabad after Mr Vemula committed suicide in HCU hostel last month.
After the city government decided to give a job to Mr Vemula's brother Raja, the family may soon shift to Delhi, the sources said.
Mr Kejriwal had yesterday joined a protest in support of Mr Vemula where he accused the Centre of waging a "war" against students and voiced his support for 'Rohith Act', a law proposed by agitating students against discrimination in universities.
Addressing the protesters, Ms Radhika Vemula had attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking "what action did you take against your minister who had called my son anti-national?"
Mr Vemula's body was found hanging in a hostel room on Hyderabad University campus on January 17.
