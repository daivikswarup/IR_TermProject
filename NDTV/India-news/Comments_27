                            Can't believe such a thing happening in independent India. I was under the impression that only such things happen in war torn countries. Is this #makeinindia or #startupindia ????

                            @georgedesi: This is Modi's acche din for the citizens. I think Pappu's scam raj was better than Modi's jungle raj - atleast such horrible things won't happen. There is no fear of law. Policemen were paraded in Maharashtra (BJP rule) - where is the law of the land

                            "Haryana Director General of Police (DGP) YP Singhal on Wednesday denied any incident of indecent behaviour"<br/><br/>
Apparently Haryana DGP thinks that rioting, treason and killing 28 people and injuring 200 people is not "indecent" behaviour.

                            Shame on Haryana Govt and Haryana Police. You both Govt and Haryana Police lost credibility in the eyes of people. Denying the report without verifying the facts is tantamount to fooling the people. Mr. CM and Mr. DGP shame on you, if you have any morality left resign and wear bangles. Looters violated the Haryana by violating our women. The general pubic will not forget it and we will keep it in mind for long time to come. Elections are around. Shame shame. A call of Ex-soldier.
