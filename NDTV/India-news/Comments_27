                            Opposition lead by congress will never relent and will use all the forces and means at its disposal to see that no government bill is passed. This Tamasha will continue till NDA gets majority in both houses on its own. Let us wait.

                            It does not matter what the precedents and conventions of the parliament, if some inflammatory and seditious messages are being circulated inside a govt university's campus, it is the duty of the HRD minister to bring it to the notice of the house. If the opposition parties are seeking apology just for reading out the pamphlet inside the parliament, then people should seek apology from the JNU group for circulating such pamphlet.

                            This was bound to happen when BJP allowed an uneducated person to give speeches, he or she out of over enthusiasm would say something which would be detrimental to their own strategy of pacifying the opposition and bring them to table.

                            The bjp are subverting the issue and are trying to focus on matters not related to the debate at all so that attention is diverted deliberately. Good and correct stand by the opposition in this case. First let the bjp and smriti irani give a reply as to why did sakshi maharaj and rss not face arrests when they praised godse and asked for his statue??? That was an open anti national statement and demand. Anything said or done by the bjp rss should be accepted by the people it appears. Indians have not sold their rights to argue debate or opine to the bjp rss

                            All parties except BJP is talking about freedom of expression. Now when Smriti Irani choose that freedom , just to read what she got, why is there an uproar? So it is not the country which is important for the parties, they only want to block development. The country having lot of issues to be discussed. Instead of doing the work, they only want to talk about dalit, muslim , caste and religion.

                            I saw , many people in this section writing uneducated minister as a remark about Smriti Irani. How many educated are there in other parties? If educated ,is there any woman who can give such a courageous speech? Even RG and Sonia can talk like this lady? And another IIT'an minister also we have seen , continuously, in his advertisement channel. How many of our MAHARANA's AND RAJAS WERE highly educated? Have u heard of famous CEO's in US? Are they highly educated who are running business successfully.How many scientist even now we remember most often are highly educated?Try to have some knowledge and speak. To run a country , degree is not the main thing, but you need wisdom. Not intelligence.

                            It is unprecedented that Parliament  is not allowed to transact its business to debate and pass very important bills having bearing on all round National development in many fields. Some handful of members are daily creating chaos, logjam, assembling in the well of both the houses, continuous shouting  on  some trivial issues  daily manufactured from thin air not allowing any business. The last two sessions also witnessed the same scenes. <br/>
The question is whether our founding fathers did ever imagine that such situation can come when a handful of MPs will not allow parliament to function. They could never imagine that elected member will ever behave in such manner. If in any school, college, office, court, institution such things ever happen, such people will be debarred and kicked out of school, college, court, office and may be proclaimed persona non grata.

                            Two medicines to make students in this country not waste taxpayer's money and the politicians/MPs to do their job for which they have been elected :<br/><br/>
1. Stop all reservation and subsidy from higher education.<br/>
2. Make MPs financially accountable unless a bill is not passed within a specific time frame after judging all pos and cons obviously. Financial accountability can mean putting their pay on hold if the job is not done.

                            Following measures  be considered to overcome impasse in Parliament.<br/>
1.	President is the custodian of the constitution. He may call a joint session and advise and warn all members either to behave and do the business in civilized manner or else such members will be debarred to participate.<br/>
2.	 Supreme Court of India is the custodian of the constitution Hon. SCI should take suo motto notice of logjam in the parliament and give direction to either President of India or the Speakers of the houses to transact the business in peaceful manner. Any body found obstructing the business may be dealt with as the Hon CJI deem fit.<br/>
3.	Election Commission of India is the custodian of the constitution. ECI takes an oath to 'protect, preserve and defend the constitution. If the elected members do not behave in a civilized manner and willfully obstruct the fulfillment of election promises made by the ruling party in the Parliament , then it should step in, give them notices, warn them and still if they do not behave, then cancel their seat and debar them for contesting election for six years orb as they deem fit.<br/>
4.	Is it possible for  Loksabha &amp; Rajsabha TV, that when the some members are shouting, then all the mikes of such people to be switched off and they should not be shown on TV, This is to protect our children and youth from exposure of such unworthy behavior of our respected &amp; elected members.   My grandchildren often asking me why they are daily fighting and who are they. "Inki mummy inko kyon nahi samjhati"<br/>
5.	If possible a parliamentary committee of all parties may be constituted to address untowardly behavior of the members and strict rules &amp; guidelines be framed to check such behaviors. "No work no payment" policy shall be followed for such members obstructing the proceedings of the house.

Somebody who does not even want to reveal their name commented " It is now clear her speech was full of lies and the PM retweets her speech with 'satyameva jeyate'! God save India from this govt.",  It looks like that person has not seen CNN IBN, TimesNow, INDIA Today and NewsX  channels who are showing What Telengana police report was (Telanga is ruled by KCR Congress which opposes BJP). That means Smiriti Irani was only quoting from a report which she had access to from the concerned State government. if it was wrong then action has to be taken on the concerned authorities by the state government and NOT Central government or Smirithi Irrani as a HRD minister. <br/><br/>
People should think and ascertain facts before they comment.
