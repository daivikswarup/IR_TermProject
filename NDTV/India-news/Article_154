Purnea:                             The husband of a ruling Janata Dal (United) lawmaker, who was arrested for allegedly threatening a witness in a case of murder, escaped from the lock-up when she visited the police station, Purnea Senior Superintendent of Police Nishant Kumar Tiwari said on Monday.
The incident took place last night at Maranga police station where Awdesh Mandal, the husband of lawmaker Bima Bharti, was in the lock-up, he said.The Nitish Kumar government once again came under attack of the Opposition over two incidents involving its legislators.
Eyewitnesses said the escape took place when the legislator, along with Purnea lawmekr Santosh Kushwaha, was in the police station and hundreds of supporters of Mr Mandal surrounded the police station to help him flee.
Asked to comment on the presence of lawmaker at the time of the escape, the police said it would be probed.
Sub Divisional Police Officer of Banmakhi, Kundan Kumar, would probe the escape, the police said.
Criticising the state government in connection with the incident, senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi asked whether the "attack on a police station by supporters of husband of a JD(U) MLA was not a case of free run to criminals."
Former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi assailed Mr Kumar over the incident and said his "claim of tightening law and order is dishonesty."
