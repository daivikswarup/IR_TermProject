New Delhi:Â                             JNU Students' Union president Kanhaiya Kumar's brother, Manikant today condemned the police action against the student leader and said that the family will not give up its fight for justice till the end.
"In Kanhaiya's case, it is clear how police can frame charges against a person, arrest him and then torture him without any proper evidence. There is no higher authority from which we expect help at this hour," he said.
"The judiciary is our last hope and we will continue our fight till we get justice," he said.
He is in Delhi with his uncle Rajendra Singh, while three other family members who had come to the national capital with them, have left for their home in Bihar.
"We are also planning to leave by tomorrow after meeting Kanhaiya once again, if possible," he said.
He met his brother Kanhaiya Kumar at the prison yesterday and conveyed his mother's message to not worry or give any explanation to prove his innocence.
He said his mother Meena Devi was concerned about Kanhaiya Kumar after the attack on him at the Patiala House court complex.
"We also told him that the whole family and the village support him and believe that he has not done anything wrong. Kanhaiya replied that the family need not worry about him at all," he said.
Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested on February 12 in connection with a sedition case over an event at JNU in which anti-national slogans were allegedly raised.
