                            Glib speech and emoting on stage or Parliament is the only qualification needed to be minister.Experience, education, domain knowledge, academic excellence, academic research, working experience - all these are irrelevant.If you can talk and emote for an audience, be it rallies or parliament, your career is made.<br/><br/>
Will any of us send our child to school headed by a person with little education?No. But we will entrust our whole education system and universities to a minister with not even 15 yrs of full education! And then we want results!

                            Stop distorting the truth. What Smriti Irani said was that in incidents of hanging there is a chance that people don't die immediately in spite of a pulse rate that can touch around 30 as per previous clinical experience. Two, she made it clear that her information source about this event is the State police. Instead of this blame game in which the media's nuetrality is becoming highly debatable, let the various cogs in the wheel and recorded statements be investigated. How can NDTV be sure if parties involved are speaking the truth, including the doctor.
