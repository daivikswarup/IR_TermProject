                            What about 3G connection disconnecting while download in process??  When I start downloading 5 MB file, mobile 3G get disconnected then I have to again start downloading from start over as the remote server do not support Resume download option. I think this is the trick of mobile companies to loot public money because sooner our data balance over we are bound to purchase new data balance.  Government should consider to curb this menace also.
