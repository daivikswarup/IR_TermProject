Dongargarh, Chhattisgarh:                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a gathering in Chhattisgarh today where he launched the 'Rurban' Mission.Here are the highlights of his speech:
 
Whenever I visit Chhattisgarh it welcomes me with a new surprise, every time.I want to make Shauchalaya a Swabhav across India.An elderly lady of 104 years... she does not watch TV or read papers, but the message of building toilets reached her & she ensured that it was done.Ambagarh Chowki and Chhuria Blocks became free of open defecation with public awareness. This is an inspiration for everyone.Yes, it is true that people are moving to the cities in search of a better life. And we need to plan the growth of our cites accordingly.Today, we are launching a mission called 'Rurban'. The term has been coined by combining the words 'rural' and 'urban'.Through 'Rurban Mission' we have combined the best of villages and cities. The spirit of a village has been combined with the facilities associated with a city.India's economic progress can't only depend on a few cities. Ours is a big nation. This initiative develops villages as centres of growth.It is essential for our villages to have proper facilities, healthcare and education too.Our crop insurance scheme seeks to solve a lot of problems being faced by the farmers.
