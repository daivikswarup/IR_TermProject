                            For how long we would be giving salute to our innocent soldiers who die in countering terrorist attacks . This is disgusting . It is common scene after couple of days. Why this is shown to public . It is demoralising for all. The army or other units should do their work and give befitting reply to these intruders without any media reporting.

                            You will not see a single candle light march from so-called "liberals" in memory of our gallant Officers and Jawans. It needs a lot of guts to take a bullet which is far higher than their level of imagination or agenda.

                            The killed terrorists should be publicly cremated. This will stop these indoctrinated  fanatics from taking up suicidal missions! The Army should be given powers to use poison gas instead of sacrificing soldiers to kill these infidels.

                            I came to this news page from a facebook link. Go and check the comments in FB. Omg, many Indians are calling the three coward terrorists as martyrs and celebrating the death of our soldiers. This is the state of your country. Anonymous guys, i have to admit that you guys will take over India one day. I have no hopes. We give up.

                            At one side we have fully trained and highly professional Army personnel and on the other side are teenagers with improvised arms and shabby training, still they are able to inflict such a heavy damage on us. Time to review our strategy.

                            RIP to the dead.But, it is a matter of concern to lose so many highly trained special forces men in one operation. I hope whatever can be the best in equipment and weapons possible has been provided to special forces. It also a worry that CRPF etc still travel in normal buses that would offer zero protection to small arms fir. With so much money spent of big weapons, we could surely afford to provide basic armour protection to all transport vehicles.

                            as sad as this is, there was no reason for our men to die. For whatever reason the building wasn't  bombed or the tear gas propsitions above but surely they could have just surrounded the building and waited it out till the terrorists gave up - ammo would finish soon or without food and water. Even if it took many days, you would still have 3 terrorists dead/ arrested but our men alive atleast.  really didn't  see any reason  for them to clear the building floor by floor when they had no hostages.  they also had the advantage of being inside and would obviously shoot at anyone comming in...
