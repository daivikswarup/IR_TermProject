Today you had the students hiding inside the university çampus and not allowing the Police to enter and Police avoiding to enter in order not to give room to the group of people supporting the students to criticise and tomorrow it could be a lawyer who after commiting a crime hides himself inside the Court çampus or for that matter a doctor inside the hospital. Where will this end? As expected, all political parties who hate at the sound of word Modi and some section of media have started their political game of portraying Modi and BJP has anti-students after (un)successfully trying anti-muslim  and anti-dalit.

                            Now that these students have surrendered. It is now the duty of the Delhi police to give protection to these students. If they are guilty court will give the desired verdict after looking at the evidences that are presented to the court. No one has right to take the law in their own hands.  The lawyers who should respect the law are taking law in their hand. They should also be punished. Who so ever tries to divide our country should be given harsh punishment by the court of law may be the students of JNU or the leaders of any party irrespective of RULING OR OPPOSITION. The law should be equal for all the CITIZENS of INDIA.  I HOPE INDIA DOES NOT BECOME LIKE TALIBAN STATE. And at this time at least the opposition should allow to function the PARLIAMENT. HOPE MODIJI DOES THE BEST IF ALLOWED BY THE OPPOSITION. My appeal to all the Indian not to give any fodder to the opposition so that they can stall this session of PARLIAMENT too.

                            What happened in JNU was not by chance but by design. It happened exactly at the time when make in India function was starting in Bombay. And most of our media, some foolishly some willingly fell pray to this well orchestrated design of the Western powers - Pakistan combine design. This article here perfectly describes the incidences which started simultaneously whenever the Modi government was in the process to take a forward step. <br/>
Actually this is a part of much bigger game, one which is designed and played by the western powers, China is a headache for them now they don't want another money wielding new power center. They know if India gets good governance, would outshine China in no time and possibly be even a more serious threat to the west than China.<br/>
The western powers with the instruments like Pakistan, the intellectuals and the so called 'national parties' the congress, the left and other regional parities, are very successful in their plans to divide India. The western powers  have been saying this from a long time, that India is too big, to be managed as one nation and it can be better managed if divided into several smaller independent countries. This division would help the westerns powers to set base, exploit the resources and to have more control in the region something they did in the African countries. <br/>
But till now it seems they have been very successful. First with continued pampering of Pakistan to bleed and destabilize India, second internally through the national political parties like the congress, AAP, Left and regional parties, third through silent support to the 'minorities', fourth through activist like Medha Patkar, Arundhuti Roy, Green peace, Amnesty international,..... fifth through some media houses like NDTV and lastly now with the master stroke, in the guise of intellectualism. Its the western powers who preach freedom of expression and speech to the world while in their own countries its more like a regiment rule. Think of this JNU type happening in a western university; these guys who shouted slogans, along with their sympathizer some of whom happen to be professors, intellectuals, artists, actors, journalists and politicians, would have vanished in no time never ever to be seen or heard  and the university closed till 'further notice' which would have been like 'never'. With congress in power at the center the western mission to divide India was treading ahead comfortably. First making the country hollow from inside in terms of socio-economic aspect with scam after scam and with episodes of civil unrest one after another. This was to be followed by the second and final step the physical division of India into several smaller independent countries where these corrupt politicians would be promised head of state and cabinet posts and the so called intellectuals promised cushy positions like chief advisers, chief justice, or ministers. But the 2014 elections caused a problem with BJP coming in. Anyway stage-1 the division of minds is still a super success for the west; the JNU incident followed by several such happenings across the country and latest with Aligarh Muslim University joining in with the tide, and the political parties standing by the anti-national criminals, the media playing straight into their hands and some media houses openly supporting the anti-nationals, the plan has been executed with absolute perfection. Now is the time for Stage-2, the physical division of India over the next 10-20 years, let's say by 2050. <br/>
Dont think this is a joke, this is exactly what happened to the former soviet Union where the mighty USSR overnight succumbed to the dirty tactics of the western powers and split up into many small independent nations and each such nation heading into a future of poverty and despair and seeking mercy in the hands of the west.<br/><br/>
Be aware of this design.

                            There are a few suggestions I 'd like to make: 1. Set an age limit to complete P.hd on the campus. 2. Appoint vice-chancellors who have 'clean' history, do some BGV before appointing them. See that they act impartially during troubling circumstances. 3. Set up a wing like RAW to keep a hawk eye on university activities.  All this may sound overwhelming, but, with increasing anti-Indian elements on the university campuses, this is very important.

                            The only good time Mr. Modu has delivered is for the RSS and their affiliates. They are having a gala time. It's sad to note that public have been fooled again, thoroughly. Conspiracy theory is the invention to hide failure, pathetic.

                            It was an ABVP/// RSS Game.  Who Shouted -PAKISTAN ZINDABAD- in JNU? While some television channels, have portrayed JNU students as antinational, a video has surfaced that has gone viral over social media that shows identifiable ABVP students shouting PAKISTAN ZINDABAD slogans. Four students, who are seen in the video shouting -PAKISTAN ZINDABAD- slogans, have been identified as ABVP activists. One of them has been identified by name as Shruti Agnihotri, seen leading protests elsewhere in ABVP demonstrations. SO,  This is a purely RSS , ABVP ,  Hindutva obsession.
