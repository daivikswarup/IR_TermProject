                            JNU is pillar of democracy. <br/>
Unfortunately British-Slave Mentality can't understand this.

                            The teachers and students at JNU are making the fear of the nation come true that JNU is a breeding ground for Anti Nationals and Anti System. Under the name of freedom the students and teachers who did ask the Chancellor to be in favour of the students try to portray that JNU is bigger than India. Why is everyone in JNU not asking for a quick and fair trial. Why should your representatives not stand trial JNU janta. Is it so because they are from JNU? Why are you hiding traitors on campus. Why did your varsity not go public and ask your students to face consequences for what they have done. You being a so called "prestigious institution" should give your student any extra freedom than a less privileged Indian citizen. Is that your way of thinking? May be the days when you were a pampered lot are over and now the days of a fair government are just making life suffocating for your likes. Come to terms with an Equal India.

                            After reading two three messages in the NDTV site and come to the conclusion that NDTV should improve its neutrality and report actual fact instead of supporting left &amp; congress.( Chennai IIT written letter to President and JNU receiving various request to control this type of activities)<br/>
NDTV should not be imposed judge on any news but it can have an its own opinion  but it should be neutral
