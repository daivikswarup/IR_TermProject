                            yes anyone shouting pro Pakistani slogans..(which has proved itself to be an enemy state of India) needs to be handed over to the police and trashed....  i am surprised by the comments given by Congress  and left parties. if this would have been done in any other country all the citizens and politicians would have stood together against it. only in India such things are tolerated in the name of democracy and freedom of speach

                            Yeah. Natural party act! Thrash people even if they slightly disagree. On this issue, they can do anything as this drama is believed to be against india. I really don't know what's going on. Is some political party instigating this? Is the hero a villain or villain a villain?

                            This owlish man is  so  typical of the sort of hoodlum &amp; goonda party that the BJP  is.  Only in India can  such a collection  of  common  thugs  pass themselves of as nationalists. IF these fellows really represent Indian nationalism ,   I think  it will be a real shame.

                            RSS/BJP Chaddis will soon make India a pre- WW2 Germany where all those who opposed Hitler were sent to concentration camps on the charge of being anti-national.Actually RSS took the british side against Independence, because RSS supported the Rajas/Maharajas whose rule would end when India became independent. RSS has always been against democracy, and wanted Manusmriti to be the constitution of India, so that the upper castes could forever rule the "lower castes". Till a few years ago RSS did not even accept the Tiranga as the national flag, these pseudo-nationalists.
