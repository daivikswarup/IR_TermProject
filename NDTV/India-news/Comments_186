                            Don't know why BJP is worried about what kind of politics Rahul is indulging in? Why can't they ignore him and involve in PURE politics?? In a democracy it is ultimately the people who will decide what kind of politics the country needs?<br/>
If at all Rahul's politics are crossing legal limits then administration can file case.

                            Looting the country? Well why dont this governmet bring changes against those who have looted the country, in court of law. Enough of this rhetorics, BJP promised return of Black money befor election and now black money issue is blacked out. They played the black money theme as if the Gandhis have deposited all the looted money to their Swiss account and guess who did they find in the actual list. 15 Lac duh!!!
