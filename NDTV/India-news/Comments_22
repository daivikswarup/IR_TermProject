                            Instigation for strike or bandh is okay so long as there is no incitement to violence. However, it is highly reprehensible that the state seems to be unabashedly tapping phones of leaders of the opposition. One must recall that late Ramakrishna Hegde had to quit as the CM of Karnataka for alleged tapping of telephones. Do people have the right to ask the CM of Haryana to follow in the footsteps of the late Ramakrishna Hegde

                            The government was very well aware of this way way way beforehand. If they were napping whose fault is it? Opposition plays it's game, remember Anna, your friendly neighborhood anti-corruption crusader. Don't try to blame it on the opposition, if they played you, you were aware of it, you knowingly went along with it.
