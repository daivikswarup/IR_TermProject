                            computer lab also used for anti-national activities. they are really sucking nation's resources for their anti-national activities. cheap room rents, cheap fees and then all added convenience like computer labs to print evreything they want.

                            So this is what these Anti Nationals do with tax payers money they use computer labs(paid for by tax payers) to design n print materials, I think first come first they should all be suspended from the university and have them fork out all the money subsidized during their stay at campus, they think they can make JNU like UC BERKELEY (another hub of radical students), but the difference being the tuition fees they pay a hefty amount so that they're not a burden on system, but these rascals at JNU are doing it on tax payers shoulders.

                            Simple facts:<br/>
1. Event Organized - YES<br/>
2. Funding from external agencies - NO<br/>
3. If there was no Event what were you doing there? - Foot in mouth<br/>
4. Where did the material come from? - Computer LAB on campus. Its free :D<br/>
5. Did you solicit support from other Univs too? - NO, JUST JNU (Ooops, Foot in mouth again)<br/>
6. What do you do with unidentified people in University - We call them ABVP, RSS, BJP Goons :D<br/>
7. So who shouted the slogans: NOT ME TEACHER!!! They did it!<br/><br/>
Finally.. We are innocent.

THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE FROM THE JNU WHICH HOUSES VERY CULTURED AND SENSIBLE PERSONS. BUT WHY WILL THE DELHI POLICE LOOK FOR THE???? THEY ARE DEFINITELY INVOLVED IN THE CONSPIRACY AS CAN BE SEEN FROM THE STING VIDEO WHICH SHOWS CLEARLY THE SUPPORT OF THE DELHI POLICE TO THE LAWYER-GOONS.<br/><br/>

                            They are agreeing that had organized the event with their own funds. AT the same time, they say that outsiders had raised the slogans.  If they are really against the slogans, they would have objected. But they accepted. That means, the outsiders/insiders theory wont work. VIVEK: Suggested that look for those faces in ABVP. If they pertain to ABVP, how could this DSU allowed them inside? If they are new (not known) people, how could they allow them to participate in the event.  Whole story is absurd.  It is clear they want to tell some stories and get away with it.  The JNU is supporting these activities by allowing their labs to do this anti-national events.  So, who inside JNU supporting them?  Profs? Admin? Is it not clear that JNU is poisoned with these elements?  Is it not correct for us to rectify this for the future of our own children?  Parents struggle to educate their children and these people, without knowing the difficulties their parents are put to just to educate them, participate in such activities.  Instead of supporting such cases, parents should come forward to stop this nonsense at least now.

                            From where did these freeloading and feeebooting beggars who are living and enjoying with tax payer's money get the funds? Is the computer lab their ancestral property for designing and printing posters? Who fed and financed them during their vanishing act? There is more than meets eye. This is a fit case for NSA.

                            Wow..comouter lab and fliers..what an irony!! No funding from any external source, coz we are rich enough to organize such meetings on large scale ;) And when did they use the lab to print those fliers? During the time when the sessions were on or in the night? Who let them use the lab for such an activity? All this doesn't even need any close observation as it's easily understandale what is happening inside our universities and how the faculty is encouraging students to be ideologically corrupt. I would like to put a question- What would UPA do if it had happened in their tenure? And what would other intellectuals who are crossing swords with BJP for killing democracy in Indian universities respond? Let's grow up. Just because a religious party is ruling the country, it cannot be questioned on issues related with national security and pride. Drink complan and start thinking, old folks ;)

But these students.s actions put another innocent students life also in danger. But university instead of fixing all this created national issue and BJP took this as opportunity.

                            Look at faces of the young students, to me they do not look terrorists. If terrorists why they have surrendered on their own. Let them grow first with free mind. Analyse the things and correctly and take better decisions in the best interest of the future of the country. You cannot suppress the dissent it will go underground and more difficult to control. Better convince the young minds with discussion and reasoning. That is the best thing for which Alma matter do exist. Do not kill the youngster rather use the police for protecting the water canals, Delhi has not got the water for the last five days. I do not know whether the police can be used to provide water to the people of the city! Any way JNU MUST HAVE GIVEN MORE IAS AND IPS OFFICERS AND OTHER INTELLECTUALS TO THE COUNTRY MUCH MORE USEFUL FOR THE COUNTRY THAN THE MLA FROM RAJASTHAN ,
