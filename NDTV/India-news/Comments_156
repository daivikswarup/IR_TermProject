                            What is the purpose of this news? Is it some kind of Publicity stunt? If it is, it is going to be cheap publicity. If it is not, why is it in the news? Please indulge in responsible reporting

                            Looks like Nitish thought it to be his personal property and rode the bus. Well done conductor for the courage to ask for the money. An embarrassment, not having money and trying to do patna bhraman!

                            This news focus should be on the conductor courage to ask a minister for ticket money rather than focusing on the minister.

                            Who doesn't have money to ride a bus, Manish Kumar or Nitish Kumar? Anyway, the story is so touching I feel like weeping. CM never thought that he would be asked to pay for ticket. LOL.... what a stunt. I am now waiting for Shotgun to say a few kind words for his CM Prabhu.

                            How stupid. I hope he carries a mobile or that too he borrows from people to people to discharge his duties as CM. Getting too low to be in news.
