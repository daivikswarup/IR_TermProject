Today everything is compromised: courts and the judges, police, Newpapers and all the TV studios, every institutional heads, corporate heads all speaking as this new government is all that we needed. Every corporate head and association chief are so scared to say a single word in public against the establishment. See Kumaramangalam Birla completing the line of the BJP. Every figure put out by the CSO is fudged. I wonder how people like Aravind Subramanian remain in the Govt. The only thing I can do is to cry and wait for the next elections.

                            People who wanted Afzal guru has place in the country. JNU run with taxpayers money. If teachers are supporting anti national activities academic purging is essential. Left is no where in legislature where from JNU is flooded with ultra left. I think it is breeding ground. India has plenty of educated wandering.So replacing anti national mind is need of the hour. If kanayalal Kumar goes to Pakisthan he will kicked. Why such group pled for Afzal the terrorist. Even Bengali Muslims like Shaikh Mujibur rehman like people were ill treated by Pakistan .so they liberated and purged sizeable terror minded pak. Read the Pakisthan census to know what happened to non Muslims. We the Hindu majority maintained tolerance and other community population grown. Hosh Mei aawo rahul,seetha raja and co. Don't misuse tolerance. Honouring terrorist has become fashion to identify progressiveness. Shame you all. Wash your sin have 1001 time dandapat Namaskar. Had our security were not alert Afzal gunda would have finished all MPs including so called progressive left preachers. Shame fringe managing JNU. When China attacked India why communist splinted? Afzal followers shame

                            Whoever is in support of modi government is labelled as modi Bhakti and BJP agent. There are billion of people who love india and will condemn JNU incident and demand that the traitors are punished. No one will be mute spectator and watch insult to nation. This does not mean I am rss agent or BJP support. Think above politics and think of nation first. Jai hind.

                            What happened here is not right. I am against the people who protested in support of Afzal Guru and denounced India. It should not be tolerated and strong action should be taken by law enforcement and the court. But beating up people in the court premises is not acceptable at all be it Media or people from JNU. It is a serious lapse of security. If people are to take law into their hands, what is the point of having the Judiciary, Law Enforcement and Democracy. Strong action should be taken against people who indulged in this. I have supported Modi so that India progresses. But when something is wrong, we have to denounce even if it is the people who we supported. Blind support will not take us anywhere. It is not about BJP or Congress. Support them when they do right and criticize when they go wrong. When we do that, political parties will know that people are intelligent and not take us for granted.

                            The leftists should read more. The internet offers vast information. Please try to verify the following facts in the net (1) The British East India Company was owned by a single individual (2) In the beginning of 19th century, China was the richest nation in the world followed by India (3) The Europeans sold opium forcefully in China. The opium dens were used to opitae the civilians. In India the opium cultivation by force created many famines. (4) At that time India never faced any malnutrition because of the great quantity of pure cow's milk. The cows used to be more than the human population. Also the forests of the sub continent was able to provide sustenance for more than one lakh tigers and its herbivorous preys and rich vegetation. Now many forests and vegetation had vanished the tigers total around 2500. Also the milk revolution helped to wipe out the desi cows. (5) CIA was instrumental in installing Mao in China. The Chinese revolution was planned and executed by the CIA. (6) Nobody cares about the demand for a seperate state status for jammu and Ladakh, considred as colnies of Kashmir due to  the stupid Article 370. The Union Territory status for Ladakh was a long-standing demand. So the best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland and then grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh

                            Secular are JNU students. They do not seem to protest outside Chinese embassy when China occupies Indian territory and nor do they protest daily when Pakistan sends infiltrators daily into India. Surely JNU students will be rewarded by China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and USA for being so secular. Isnt it media as media too is so secular like congress party and communists who are silent when Chinese occupy Indian land. I am sure secular Communists will be okay if China occupies West Bengal. Amazing isn't is Indian secularism. Pakistan, China, Saudi and USA and Britain very happy with such great indian secularism. isn't it dear secular media.
