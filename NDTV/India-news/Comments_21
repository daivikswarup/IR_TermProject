                            First he went to TV studio for an interview and congress went down to 44. Then he went to JNU to support anti India campaign and Congress is destroyed.

                            Is godse a martyr then??? He assasinated Mahatma Gandhi. Sakshi maharaj had called him a martyr and a state of godse was also demanded by the rss. That makes sakshi maharaj and rss anti national. Why were sedition charges not slapped on them??? Sakshi maharaj said this openly. The jnu students on the other hand have been arrested only on hearsay and fake videos. Wow. Great going anurag thakur, bjp and it's stooges

                            Anurag thakur should ask the same question to PDP and Mahbooba Mufti, BJP's Partner in Kashmir. These BJP Leaders are hypocrites.

                            This politician used every trick to become an HPCA office-bearer, BCCI Secretary and sponged the sport. Post Lodha Committee, likely to get the boot from many cricket posts. Trying to be conspicuous by making noises in the parliament
