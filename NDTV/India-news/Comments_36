                            I was told BJP is party of RAM, here I find a Ravan. This only proves a point that RSS is a kaliyugi RAVAN with many many faces speaking incoherently. What else a Ravan will do but to object to condoms, he never uses one. If an organization propagates unmarried leaders, this sort of nuances are only natural.

Now look at the reward of loyalty, she has been made the president of this country by Sonia Gandhi.

If his statement is taken at face value, JNU students do not have any time for studies except prolonged unlawful activities.

                            NO one has the right to say any thing about students even if they happen to be 5th Columnists. It is a pity that people who comment do not have any knowledge about JNU Culture. I am an Ex Jnuite of late 1970's and can vouch safe that Students used to consume Alcohol and some of them take drugs. Many outsiders would be staying in the Hostels as guests for the reasons best known to them. IN todays scenario we can imagine the sort of happenings that would be going on in JNU. Let us not shut our eyes and say that all is well or for that matter a leftist who was a JNU alumni saying that it is an excellent institution.<br/>
There is no doubt about the quality of education that it gives. Also can any of the students studying either in deep south, west, east or North say that students and teachers are saints and no less.<br/>
Even when I used to study. Kashmiri Muslims, who were our class mates, never used to consider themselves as Indians and felt they were Pakistanis.<br/>
Today if a few hand full shout slogans then it cannot be left saying that these are voices of dissent.<br/>
What would we do if our youngest son or daughter rebels against the established family norms. We will surely understand their problems and will try to reason out but if he is against the very basic foundation of our family and acts against the family welfare then we will kick him/her out.<br/><br/>
Let us not politicize every thing for the sake of opposing the Govt at the Centre. However I am sure Congress along with its partners whether in power or out of power will not allow this country to progress.

                            it is not about the exact count.. he has said everything in 1000's which means it is an approximation, or he wants to highlight the magnitude of the illS.<br/><br/>
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THESE ITEMS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE CAMPUS, AND IF SO, IT IS TIME TO SHUT DOWN THAT INSTITUTION, OR FLUSH OUT ALL SUCH ELEMENTS IN IT NOW, AND CONVERT IT FROM SOMETHING OF A HAVELI FOR PLEASURE INTO AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.<br/><br/>
If it has been found, it is a very serious matter..

                            Gyandev Ahija is answerable to Assembly, CM and Amit Shah. NDTV is answerable to none and therefore it is reporting one sided story of JNU.

                            These "trends" are trended by IT Cells of political parties. Shouldn't be taken seriously. Never seen NDTV show so much interest in other trends though.

                            @Anon1: Being a BJP supporter, I used to hate these outliers as it used to give likes of NDTV fuel for fire. But slowly I realized, they are the only match for sickular media, commies and congress. They are not worth top government leadership attention. Good going gyandev!!

                            He may have exaggerated the figures, but no one can deny that such activities do not happen in JNU or any central university for that matter. Student unions act as a shield to cover up such activities, if any student is caught and punished that the union will be up in arms against the action.

                            What is wrong? It could be true too, going by the way these JNU goons behave! As these are verifiable matters, why not NDTV investigate this out and publish facts instead of trying to suppress freedom of speech?
