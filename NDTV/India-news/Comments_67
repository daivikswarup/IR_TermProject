                            Can't believe such a thing happening in independent India. I was under the impression that only such things happen in war torn countries. Is this #makeinindia or #startupindia ????

                            "Haryana Director General of Police (DGP) YP Singhal on Wednesday denied any incident of indecent behaviour"<br/><br/>
Apparently Haryana DGP thinks that rioting, treason and killing 28 people and injuring 200 people is not "indecent" behaviour.
