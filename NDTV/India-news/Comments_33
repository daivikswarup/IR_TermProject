                            When all party meet was hosted by PM and officials of NDA government, Sonia and Rahul were absent preferring to send their chamcha's like Anand Sharma and others. Did the media question them till today why they do not attend meetings yet turn around and say Modi never reaches out to opposition? Why media is not questioning them that if it's the Gandhi's who will decide to let their party run or stall the parliament, then why don't they attend the all party meets?

                            It may be worth remembering that the BJP was elected with the biggest majority in history in any general election? So it is only fair that we, as the people of India, should take a step back and allow it to do what the People of India elected it to do. The results are already apparent: Pakistan is on the back foot, our Prime Minister has greatly enhanced India's image in the world and has also taken bold steps to outline ambitious plans to move the country forward by initiatives such as 'make in India', ''swachh  Bharat', a modern railway system, digital India, smart cities, advancement of alternative energy systems such as solar energy, providing bank accounts to millions of people, the attempts at pushing through of land reforms and the GST bill...India is viewed by the rest of the world, specially by the west, as the land of Yoga, Meditation, Spirituality - a subject on which countless books have been written by westerners...a fact which makes me wonder if promoting these isn't such a bad idea, after all! Why is it that whenever we have a good, efficient, highly disciplined corruption-free government with a good vision for the future, we shoot ourselves in the foot and try and sabotage it instead of supporting it and allowing  it to function! If you have even one iota of feeling for your country, you will put aside your ego and move forward with the nation.

                            Who created and nurtured this caste system in independent India. Whenever they talk about Dalits, they actually present them as incompetent, weak and without any self esteem. The caste system is there across universities (even in IITs and AIIMS) for decades. There are always caste groups across all colleges and all such thing keep on happening. No body raised questions earlier. However, now because its BJP Govt, suddenly BJP is responsible for all these biases... something which exists in the system even before BJP was born!

Why they are scared ? they said they will discuss and debate but none of the MP has any serious on the business pending in loksabha. This time suddenly Mayavati ko opposition wale ne prakat kiya and chaos khada kar diya. Opposition's this approach of disruption helps ruling party as people are watching and thinking to clear all of you from the next loksabha.

                            @Seshu: Those who raise voice and termed are dump and put in jail. You goons are spoiling India. So are you saying that if common man is beaten for injustice based on cooked up case ( you know how  Indian police is adept at cooking cases and encounters in the name of nationalism.)  and are we going to mute spectators  and simply be dump. Your Modi proved that he is a useless prime minister with hollow promises and spend India's money on foreign travel and embracing world leaders with no output . Show me one business that created big job here ? Congress bought IT and telcom and internet in India and that was the big job creator. Congress brought Manufacturing sector and provided jobs.

    You must thank BJP for not allowing to speak in parliament "(If so)", Because again you may wander around the neck to collect some suitable words to give befitting reply, and after murmuring few words which all will be out of context or repetition or some other blunders you yourself showcase as a BUFFOON. Please select a good leader by yourself for Congress and Let the Congress workers around the nation feel proud about their new leadership !!!

                            Mayavathi wants the resignation of a minister for a student's suicide. Do they know what is governance? Do they think Parliament is place for making some tamasha? These MP who are disrupting Parliament for no reason of national interest, should be punished severely as they are wasting public money for their time pass. These should be equally treated as terrorists as they are blocking the discussions on topics of national interest. I am not commenting from any party's behalf. It is parliament where issues of national interest are discussed &amp; that is not a place for a student's suicide which we don't know yet the reason. He might have made several sins / mistakes &amp; might be afraid of these &amp; finally hanged himself or hanged by his friends (Investigations are going on &amp; no result has come out yet). Making these nonsense things inside a parliament should be stopped from the MP's be they from any party (Ruling / Opposition). This is a place for discussion &amp; not for fighting.

                            Let's get some things straight about this late Rohit character. He was not a child. So, let us stop calling him a child. He was an immature adult and a coward unlike the JNU students (without going in to the merits or demerits of their case or cause) who are challenging the authorities/University/System/etc and willing to go to jail! Also, where was that born imbecile RAGA last evening? Why was he not present in the Parliament when the HRD Minister was speaking? Too hot to handle?

Please you being the leader earlier of Youth Congress has not blended you properly that you're aware of the students' psychology! You only know to dig the oit like other baffon AK-47 (Arvind Kejriwal) for the the vote banks! Bareily itself is a proof....your own dalits...

                            Congress, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi have no ideology, they can stoop to any level to garner votes. For the 10 years the UPA government was there, country made no progress virtually. Now they cannot handle the good work done by the current government. The timing of JNU row and Jat reservations demand is suspect and seems to be engineered by the opposition to disrupt the budget session

                            Never seen such a immature leader like Rahul Gandhi. Under his leadership cong will definitely go to dark phase.How come he is agreed to fight cpm in kerala and alliance with cpm in WB. Never seen such bankrupt policy taken by any leader.He thought people of India are fool and using last name is giving him dividend.Those days are gone. Party should run by ideology not opportunist policy. Left are always opportunist and always hungry for power. Their history is always anti national be in before independent or after. Also sometimes I am surprised to see biased media supporting such opportunist party. I am not a BJP fan but what is happening now with Left &amp; Congu is extremely shameful.People of india should teach them another lesson.

                            I still can not understand why this Rohit guy is dragged into every post of NDTV. He hanged himself. He did not write any letters as to who was responsible. He was banned from the university and he chose to hang himself. How many people would? I am no bhakt or any of that stuff but an educated middle class guy and I fail yo understand what he was thinking. Having poor parents, he chose to do politics then to study and get a job. Then he though that everyone will clear a path for him and let him have his way. This is politics. It is powerful and also dirty. There will be vendetta and dirty moves. If you cannot withstand it, do not go into politics. Get a nice paying job! You can not have everything in the world. Nobody does man!

No body listens to him except congress workers who are surrounding him as part of congress strategy. A person will be assumed a leader by virtue of his actions, words and gestures. Has he delivered any thing good as his own personal contribution. This type of approach will never help him becoming a leader liked by majority of indian people.
