                            Mr.Kiran, we are Hindus &amp; thank God if he saves our life in a life threatening accident. We then become matured, pious, God fearing and side with truth as part of penance to God. We expect you to do so. Because recently your Helicopter made an emergency landing at Hindon air base after it developed snag. It would have been catastrophic. Probably you would not have been alive to speak lies which you are doing now.  Is it professionalism of Delhi Police, your chained pet, when all goonda lawyers who mercilessly beat Kanahiya, lawyers and Media people, are free? Home Ministry is thoroughly exposed , so don't lecture us about professionalism.
