                            THIS shows how JNU over the years has become epicentre of Anti national activities, I think there is a fundamental problem with the JNU academics, otherwise how on earth these people support Terrorists who has attacked our parliament. <br/><br/>
Advice to ABVP, take care of protests in a peace full manner, otherwise if any one dies their , media will name him Dalit and Rahul and Kejriwal 420 will shed their crocodile tears

                            It's the communist party who is provoking these guys but these are also sensible enough to think what to do or not.The thing is communist party is feared as they are not in authority of power. From the past times they have captured these so called elite universities/institutes as the powerhouse of their ideology and thus involving the intellectual people. Now the BJP govt. is the ruling party and they are appointing their officials in these hub of intellectual people because of that communist parties are scared and for that these communist can take any measure to break the stability of the country whether it is fair or not, whether it is national or anti-national.
