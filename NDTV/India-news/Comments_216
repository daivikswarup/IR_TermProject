                            SC said correctly and why so many anti nationals entering court ? if you are confident in Indian constitution and judiciary then why you need to go to court ?

                            Restriction by supreme court is excellent.Supporters of mr. Kanhaiya should have faith in judiciary.He will be released in case he is innocent. Protesters have become judge by themselves .

                            Even though attacking journalists is not a good thing , some can get very perturbed when their country is attacked and that is what happend in Patiala house. One has to take sensitivity in this case just like religious sensitivity

                            Here are a bunch of students who have indulged in anti-india sloganeering and vowing  to finish off our country and when action is taken against them, there are some political parties and also some section of media questioning the Police and Government as to why police have acted in a haste. But the same people and media want immediate action on the people who have turned violent on the day when this kaniah Kumar was brought to court. This is the tragedy. If these students are not anti-national, what else they are? People should be patient and wait for the Govt and police to take action. In a way, what happened in JNU is good. Atleast we got to see the so many of the students in JNU and else where who could be potentially dangerous to our country itself.

                            Despite a seething confrontation with students and the opposition, the government has said it will not permit anti-national activities.<br/><br/><br/>
Can you please elaborate this statement, what you are trying to imply.

                            BJP supporters don't understand that the mandate is for good governance and not bully everyone. They are in the process of destroying the democratic fabric of India.<br/><br/>
How is it fair that nobody has been arrested when there are enough evidence on the assaults carried out. The police didn't bother either. Shame!

                            Excellent !! Only NDtv has clearly stated essence of orders of the Hon Supreme Court, contrary to mis-presentation by other Chanel/s. Jurnos prayer has been for entry &amp; safety and Hon'ble Supreme  Court has restricted number of jurnos inside Patiala Court to 5 nos and as well directed certain number of police force to be inside &amp; outside the Court, for safety of ALL----- and NOT ONLY for Jurnos safety !!!
