Patna:                             Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar, steps out of home and office without any money in his pocket. And, when the need arises, he waits for someone to bail him out.
At least that is what happened on Wednesday. After flagging off a fleet of City Buses in Patna, Mr Kumar stepped into a bus to see the interiors. He took a seat in the moving bus and the woman conductor promptly handed him a ticket and asked for Rs. 5 - the fare for his journey from Gandhi Maidan to Patna station.
Mr Kumar searched his pockets for money but found none, prompting a senior bureaucrat who was on the bus with him to come to the chief minister's rescue.
Amrit Lal Meena, Principal Secretary of the Urban Development Department, paid Rs. 5 for Mr Kumar's ticket and earned a mention in the chief minister's speech. Mr Meena saved the day for him, Mr Kumar later said in his speech.
This is not the first time, the student leader- turned- career politician has been seen searching his pockets for money, in public. A few years ago, Janata Dal (United) spokesperson Sanjay Singh paid Mr Kumar's renewal fee for his party membership. When Mr Kumar had contested the assembly election in 1985, which he won after two unsuccessful attempts earlier, he had to convince his wife to part with her savings to fund his election.
In his speech, Mr Kumar also suggested that the transport department run special buses for women not just with women conductors but also drivers. He recalled how when he became a legislator for the first time, he would ride the bus to the state assembly in Patna.
