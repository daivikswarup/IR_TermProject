                            Absolutely. It is surprising that these parties taking side of a person who attacked our parliament which is a temple of democracy just for the sake of vote-bank or the political opportunity to attack our government. Instead they should pay the respect to those people who lost their lives to save these politicians.

                            Well said, Sir! Eulogizing terror supporters like Afzal Guru amounts to eulogizing terror itself, and an insult to those brave hearts who took bullets in order to save the MPs, the same MPs who would have been killed. May the gracious God grant some wisdom to these deluded fellows!

                            Justice Dhingra you are not distinguishing the issues. The politicians are not supporting Afzal Guru, they are upholding the freedom of speech of people who have a different view point.Was it not the case that may eminent jurists said that death sentence was not the sentence that could hav been awarded in this case and a lessor punishment should have been awarded based on the circumstantial evidence. I might for one say that Justice A.B. Shah Chairman of the Judicial reforms commission was of the view that the sentence was guided by political considerations. I must also say that I was of the view that if the court was convinced that Afzal was a part of the conspiracy but the police were not able to lay hands on convincing evidence the strongest punishment should be given, because the attack was on our loftiest institution. My view would not be accepted by the judicial community where it would be better to let a murderer go scot free if you cannot prove his guilt rather than let a innocent man be hanged. Any way what is the hue and cry about. Wasn't the SAD thinking of having a memorial erected in Punjab for terrorists whom they considered to be martyrs and wasn't Bhindranwale's posters displayed in punjab now and then. What action was taken by the Central Govt against these politicians. There are numerous such examples.  Is their grouse only against discussion by university students on the hanging of Afzal Guru.
