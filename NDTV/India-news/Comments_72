                            Very sane thoughts and to the point. JNU has lost the script and its raison-d-etre. It does not deserve a single paisa from the tax payors.

                            someone has said in comments that Mohandas Pai has limited knowledge ..what he knows about JNU etc etc...and if he wants to contest elections etc...<br/>
 1] Mr Pai has  enough knowledge so keep quite.<br/>
2] Even a common man now knows what JNU is and what kind of faculty ,teachers and syllabus they have..and what discussions they have ..all the world has seen it.So again keep quite.<br/>
3] If fighting elections is Mr Pai motive anything wrong there..he is a citizen of this country..No?? And even if he fights his condition will be different than what happened to Nadan Nilekani.Got it ?  Tell me why so ?? Because Nilekani backed a wrong horse.<br/><br/>
Kudos to Mr Mohandas Pai.

                            He never been to any university and had knowledge of University environment. What is campus he never experienced. The JNU - is not a laboratory to prepare robots. There are vast subjects. All levels of students are there. There is syllabus. The professors teach the syllabus. The Government appoint the qualified teachers of the subject. There is debates and discussion. Every body has their own view. I think Mr. Pai should get educated first then comment. He was not worth to talk about all this. He has limited knowledge.

                            Leftists are the most intolerant and intellectually dishonest people. Thier only merit is they hound in packs like hyenas in the political jungle.
