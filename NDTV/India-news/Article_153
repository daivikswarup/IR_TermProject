New Delhi:                             The Congress, the Left parties and the Trinamool Congress have been the most aggressive critics of the government in Parliament during the debate on the JNU controversy and Hyderabad student Rohith Vemula. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, the leader of the house in the Rajya Sabha, today took a dig at all three.
"The tragedy of Bengal is now there are three Congress parties: the Congress, Trinamool and the Marxist Congress," Mr Jaitley said, setting off laughter, particularly in the treasury benches. For a few moments, the politically-loaded remark took the focus away from what has virtually become a debate on nationalism to a significant election.
West Bengal will go to the polls in a few months from now. Mr Jaitley's party, the BJP, is looking to make significant gains in these assembly elections. The Left and the Congress, who had a bitter parting in 2008, are again discussing forging an alliance in the state.
The Trinamool, which ended over three decades of Left rule in 2011, has been severely criticised by the BJP in the recent past. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee have often taken to social media to greet and praise each other, while their juniors have squabbled.
In response to Mr Jaitley, Trinamool lawmaker and spokesperson Derek O'Brien quickly retorted: "The Trinamool is no longer with the Congress. We formed a separate party years ago." The party was formed in 1998 after Ms Banerjee quit the Congress.  
Another member shouted, "The honourable minister is trying to rewrite history. "I cede to Mr Derek O'Brien," Mr Jaitley responded.
