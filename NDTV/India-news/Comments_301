                            Lol, just one comment because there is nothing to blame to Modi here. Here one person is trying hard to inspire billion people. He is showing true respect to Indian tradition and culture. Find something controversial, write other vitriolic opinion or conduct other preaching session like Rabish kumar; comments will come out in drove.<br/><br/>
I find it utter disgusting that march by Indian veteran for unity has not been covered at all. Shameless coverage, country has been successfully divided. Indian should not give up but fight these divisive forces to hilt. This gesture of Mr Modi swells chest of proud Indian.

                            Are people still questioning if Modi is an effective leader? For those of you who ask 'what has he done so far?'... this is ONE OF HIS MANY initiatives.

                            Modi must understand the law of diminishing returns. If you continue doing the same nautanki, a point will reach beyond which the returns to scale start diminishing. :) Nobody takes these nautankis seriously anymore.

                            People should be reasonable when criticise. You cannot criticise everything Modi does this is what is happening with congress and other people. This is very good cause. Congratulate the initiative taken by the PM not sitting on the throne and dictating like Rajas.

                            Try selling the Corrupt Goats in Indian Politics and you will have to Pay people to take them . Sure again there will be majority refusal to take them for what Good Use can one put them to . Useless , can't even get a single toilet for all of them .

                            So the actual responsible authority the govt who is supposed to build the toilets is so useless that poor citizens have to build their own by selling their precious little! And here is the government trying to get some points by making a media spectacle of its own incompetence..huh..Why did she have to sell her goat first place ?
