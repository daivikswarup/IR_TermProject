                            You cannot help Bihar is Bihar. Where parents and teachers come to exam hall with books and chits to help their children copy and pass in exams what kind of culture do you expect once those children grow up?

                            In Lalu's regime loot, arson, kidnap, rape, murder etc. are orders of the day.It will be surprising if there is no news everyday.  Bihar deserves a leader like RBY for having preferred Lalu. Bihar is cursed to be Most Backward for 2 more centuries at least.

                            2 opposition  leaders murdered in quick succession. RJD MLA now alleged to raping a minor girl. Is Bihar going back to those dark days when lalu was the Chief Minister? Really hope it doesn't go that way.

                            This is what happens when people vote for criminals and uneducated people as their leaders. There is complete anarchy and lawlessness prevailing in that State. When people voted this is not they wanted the outcome to be. People please raise your voice collectively against the oppression and injustice which is inflicted on our State by these leaders after all don't forget we are a democratic country and it's us who gave them powers. Bihar is being inflicted with rapes murder loot on a everyday basis.. What is happening to this State people..  Let's not be mute to all this and make sure the criminals don't win over the judicial system by muscle money and man power. Just disgusting and deeply saddened with the sorry state of affairs in this Country. What are we heading to guys?!  So much hatred prevailing everywhere.
