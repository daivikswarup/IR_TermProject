                            A tearful farewell to the brave hearts who defend the country. And I condemn the students of JNU who have taken a march against the arrest of the student union President( a just cause), but never raised slogans against the outsiders who chanted anti- India slogans

                            What a terrible irony. <br/><br/>
On one hand this brave soldier laid down his life protecting the honour of the country and on the other hand there are professors, who are fed tax payer's money, in government funded  universities who raise objection to even hoisting the national flag in the campuses saying national flag hoisting "hurts their autonomy".<br/><br/>
I think such anti-national elements(along with their handler NGOs) need to be named and shamed so that the sacrifices of our brave martyr soldiers doesn't go in vain.

                            The sad part of this encounter is that most of the liberated 150 hostages will still fall for the propaganda of the terrorists and side with them. Mehbooba would still love to be a Mehboob of the terrorists. Our politicians can never find a political solution resulting in our brave soldiers sacrificing their lives endlessly. The bureaucrats will get double the hardship allowance for serving in Gauhati as that of a soldier in Siachen while he has no qualms in sabotaging the dues of a soldier. We subsidise the education of JNU students in return for their anti national slogans. Where is our beloved country headed to? I fought two wars for this country and for all this?

                            RIP Brave heart. My salute to you, who have been protecting me day and night. And the congis , NDTV and some moron's want to have freedom of expression in comparison to National pride and security. Let all the people who are talking about freedom of expression be charge with sedition and put behind the bars. They do not know the real freedom they are enjoying and talk rubbish. For them its OK to shout anti-India slogans but when they are questioned they want the freedom of expression. These people are all traitors and I wish they are hung in public.  When they cannot respect the constitution why do they quote the clause of freedom of expression. There is a limit for freedom of expression and that to its for the people who respect constitution not traitors. No country on earth will endorse this anti-national slogans. In other countries by now they all would have been behind bars for years.

                            How can our brave soldiers be called martyrs when they are fighting against those terrorists who are heroes at JNU, Jadavpur and other universities? For so called seculars and those who call 'anti nationalism' as freedom of expression, our brave soldiers are just canon fodder. Exercising my right to freedom of expression, I can say that our brave soldiers should, first, point their guns at these so called anti national seculars at JNU and other universities including anti nationals in the guise of teachers.

                            Look at the percentage of Muslims in services like IAS IPS or Defence. Its close to 0% figure. These snakes are not loyal to their own families, forget about the nation. They are unhappy everywhere, US, UK, France, Israel, India and even their own muslim lands. They have problem from every other religion. Why? Because they themselves are problem to humanity with a paedophilic ideology from a paedo that runs them 1400 years back. These barbaric witless goons will destroy nation in the name of freedom of speech. Remember how britishers entered India? they manipulated some sick Indian traitors to put their foot in the door opening and rest is history. These so called sickular Indians favoring anti-nationals in name of freedom of speech are nothing but the vulnerables we had during british times. But true Indians will stay strong fight and eradicate such traitors before they raise their dirty head. Jai Hind
