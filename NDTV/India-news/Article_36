New Delhi: HighlightsBJP chief Amit Shah asks Gyandev Ahuja to explain "irresponsible remarks"
Ahuja hit headlines for comments on 3000 beer cans, condoms in JNU
#BJPCountsCondoms started trending on Twitter soon after these comments
                                BJP lawmaker Gyandev Ahuja is in the doghouse with his party over his bizarre comments on the Jawaharlal Nehru University or JNU being the den of evils. He has been berated by BJP chief Amit Shah and asked to come to Delhi to explain his "irresponsible remarks", sources say.
On Monday, the legislator from Rajasthan told reporters: "In JNU daily you find 3,000 beer cans and bottles, 2,000 Indian liquor bottles, 10,000 cigarette butts, 4,000 beedis, 50,000 bone pieces,  2,000 wrappers of chips, 3,000 used condoms and 500 abortion injections."
He was speaking at a protest he had organized in Alwar, around 150 km from Delhi, to protest against JNU "traitors".
The comments made the BJP trend on social media with the hashtag #BJPCountsCondoms.
Mr Ahuja, 63, said the condoms are "used for committing misdeeds with our sisters and daughters" and drugs are taken on the campus. After 8 pm, he proclaimed, "cultural programmes are held in which boys and girls dance naked."
The lawmaker, who declares in his biodata that he never went to college, is known for his intemperate comments. He is also famed for acting in Ram Lila every year as "Ravana".
With his JNU list, he wanted to demonstrate that anti-national activities are rampant at the prestigious university.
But his comments have backfired spectacularly at a time his party's government at the Centre is confronting the anger of students and opposition leaders who have accused it of crushing dissent.
Three students have been arrested and three more are wanted on sedition charges for allegedly making anti-national statements at an on-campus event to mark the anniversary of the hanging of terrorist Afzal Guru.
