New Delhi:                             There were angry exchanges, slogan-shouting, multiple adjournments, but no debate in the Rajya Sabha, which was scheduled to discuss the JNU controversy and the suicide of Hyderabad research scholar Rohith Vemula. An emotional and visibly angry Education Minister Smriti Irani attacked the opposition in the Lok Sabha during the debate accusing them of playing politics over Mr Vemula's death.Here are the highlights of her speech:
 
In my 20 months as minister, I have served my country, people without any prejudice.I have been accused that with which authority do I write letters to Universities.Mr Owaisi and I are standing at two corners of the political spectrum. He wrote to me that an atrocity is happening, and for appointment of a lecturer, please see if something can be done. I requested for the matter to be looked into.One student dies and there is a political battle over it. Does the country know that the executive council which took the decision (on Rohith)? Not even one member was appointed by NDA, all appointed by UPA.This boy was used. I will give you proof. I called up KCR Ji as soon as I got to know about the incident... only to request to help in law and order situation. I was told Saheb is busy and he cannot talk right now. My call is on record. I am yet to receive his phone call.Nobody can raise a finger against me. I am taking it personally. The boy was used for politics.The document in High Court says police got to know at 7:20 pm... My friends in Telangana can cross check. When they rushed to the University, they found the body removed. A hand written note which did not blame anybody which specifically stated that "nobody is responsible for the act."His body was used as a political tool. It was hidden. No police was allowed till 6:30 am. No one went near the student. No doctors were allowed to attend the boy. Who was medically equipped to declare the child dead?Have you ever seen Rahul Gandhi go to one spot twice - never. But here he saw a political angle.Office order comes out at JNU. Chief proctor, dean of all schools, students, senior wardens etc. This committee which has nothing to do with the government. The individuals named by faculty: Umar, Anirban, Ashutosh, Rama Naga, Ananth Narayan, Aishwairya Adhikari, Shweta Raj.Many leaders say they are kids, spare them. But how does this depravity get seeded in the minds of our children? Today I am compelled to say this... Are these just slogans? I want to quote a European philosopher A nation can survive its fools and ambitious but cannot survive treason.
