If they really want to serve as they promise in elections why don't they just start working on the real issues like farmer suicide, strenthening the external and internal security of the country, upliftment of the poors the list is endless. But the politics is all about diverting the core issues, otherwise is the Nationalism issue right now. This the time when everyone is more Indaian then any other time in History but still it is a issue. Please be united and show some wisdom to the cunning politicians who wanted to divide the country and rule. These politicians whenever they fail they divert the issues even after 60 years of independence we still struggling for inflation free food, better roads, clean air etc. Make these things issue instead of issues which gives us nothing at the end of the day.

                            We all know that we live in an age of terrorism, and it just so happens, that most of this terrorism emanates from pakistan. Therefore, slogans, such as 'Pakistan Zindabad', coupled with "India Murdabad', 'Bharat Ki Barbadi Tak Jung Rahegi, Jung Rahegi' and calls for the destruction, dismemberment and downfall of India, especially when these slogans are directed at university students by people in positions of authority, should set the alarm bells ringing throughout India, which has frequently been the target of terrorism, especially from pakistan. Instead of condemning such anti-national acts, the Indian media has chosen to mix two completely different issues, and not only completely marginalise the main issue, which is incitement to hatred and a call to war against India, but also thrown a very dangerous red herring amongst the entire student community!! Shame on you.

                            Why we cannot do a Pathankot to our enemy? We have many ultra nationalist Sanghi and Sathi in plenty in this Sangh Parivar ideology driven government rearing to go after the enemies to avenge the crime.I think I.S.I. bribed the NAGPUR, the real rulers who hold the rein and prevented New Delhi to be proactive.

                            For the state of Delhi one more Leader is Born! Unlike many who enter politics through<br/>
social service platform and proove their ability to GOODAGIRI to protect DEMOCRACY, this man is honest enough. He did practice his PRINCIPLES before PREACHING them to form a MOVEMENT(political <br/>
gathering for making available the services in future for a price).<br/><br/>
This entry will also create some balance in the  4 PILLARS of Democracy ( Opponents call them as Pal bearers) when another leader is being pushed up  recently selected from Students leaders to Protect Democratic values!<br/><br/>
It is like USA selling F16s to India  and in a few weeks same quantity to Pakistan!<br/>
Counter balancing helps to retain tension, which is the OXYGEN of Politicians!
