                            Mr. Tariq Anwar is giving new definition to Jihad !! If you give chance to these sort of people--Naturalized Indian Muslims,  may re-write Holy Koran. If some one reads English version of Holy book, there is nothing but, Love, Giving for others and compassion and jihad is a sacrifice for others. I have read the book given by a Sunny.
