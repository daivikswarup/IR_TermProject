                            Congress has been igniting flames across the country. The Patidar agitation in Gujarat to Jat agitation in Haryana. The tape has exposed Congress and Hooda's conspiracy to engulf the country  in flames.

                            Why bullets to head and not to the legs...BJP and its MPs like Saini have completely succeeded in dividing and polarizing Haryana society into Jats VS Non-Jats and they will reap the benefits...Common man and distressed farmers will continue to suffer...

                            It's very early to do aftermath as curfew is still imposed in few cities. Instead of blaming each other why not form a highest level of unbiased committee to bring out the truth. Jats will say they are innocent and so does rest of the community. Truth shall prevail.

                            This violence by Jat is totally anti-national and WITHOUT ANY GOOD REASON.  They do not deserve reservation and should not be give any.  India should boycott Jat community for at least for a week as a protest because they are collectively responsible for this criminal act.  We blame Muslims then why not Jats just because Jats are our sons of Bs.  This is not right we have treat all Indians equally.

                            Reservations in 2016 and beyond are trouble for India.  We are becoming a more divided nation because of reservations.  Time has come when India should scrap all reservations and support one and all poor families.  This way the communal divisions will disappear over time.   Foreign countries know our weak points and can exploit them.

                            Govt failed to handle the crowd..if they haven't opned the fire..nothing would have happened...BJP MP Saini devided the communities in Jat vs Non jat..otherwise in past we have seen many protests for reservation by various communities but never saw if any other community trying to oppose the demand of protesters.....first time in haryana that happened.

                            Jats are the most racist community in Haryana. These guys don't even have respect for their women, how can we expect them to respect somebody elses' property.

                            Reservations has to be based on wealth and not religion. The poorer should get priority.

                            This is not the end of the story. The congress might have ignited flames, but the truth is, there would be more agitations from the upper castes, demanding for a quota. They get 35, still become a teacher, a doctor or an engineer and the other side gets 95, n still is jobless. Where quality?
