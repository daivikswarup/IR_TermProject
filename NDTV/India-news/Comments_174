                            Why don't Government ban such survey, because this too brings dishonor to India. Who ever talks such things in media, which denigrates medieval India's  cultural superiority over rest rest of world should be banned. The benchmark is Indian culture of medieval times.

                            This is good news because it will eventually help reduce population and may even eradicate jats from this planet. Think about it, it's the woman who gives birth, without woman their community will be extinct. Good!

                            its high time India unites all the states into one and divides it based on mindset. People with such pathetic views of women can belong to one part of the country and the others into another part. I am certain that only one of these two states will survive.
