You are actions are justifying the extreme approach taken by the right wing..... Honestly if you raise slogans in front of me which is against India, I will not care you are Muslim or a Hindu.... Be sensible , do not fuel the needs of your political party and create chaos within our country!!

                            Have seen the protests in one of the news Channel. Its we who are at fault by giving reservations and importing Bangladeshis for Vote Bank. Most of the anti India slogans and supporters of the terrorist were Bangladeshi students of the SO CALLED prestigious Jadavpur University. <br/><br/>
We Indians are hypocrites. We keep blaming our neighbour Country for harboring terrorists in their backyard who has stabbed them every now and then. What are we doing? Importing the same Bangladeshis and enabling them to enter this SO CALLED Prestigious Institutions so that they could one day support and shout slogans in favor of a Terrorist and create ruckus in our educational institutions.<br/><br/>
The Political Parties are responsible for all these disturbances for they are the one whose lawmakers make sure they have their Vote Bank ready in the form of imported refugees and some from within by offering them reservations based on castes. <br/><br/>
This is sheer non sense going on the educational institutions. We need to have it curbed once and for all be it the number of casualties. These mayhem cannot go on in the name of education. Have heard enough in the last few days from the SO CALLED students. They enter through back door (all sorts of stupid reservations) and disturb the atmosphere of learning.<br/><br/>
Also pay the price of acquitting a terrorist so called professor. The law has from time immemorial been guilty of releasing the Criminals who go on in creating a mayhem later on. We have seen it during the last J &amp; K floods wherein the Army man had rescue a separatist leader from the clutches of floods and the very next day he was blocking the rescue operations. Same with that terrorist - Massod Azhar, for 6 long years, we had fed him in the name of obtaining information and one day....we paid the price recently and cant say for how long.<br/><br/>
Start punishing the criminals then and there. Still we aren't doing it. I thought the New Govt at the Center would deal with such criminals and criminal activity with iron hand but alas! Why fear? Take all those trouble makers into custody and deal with them for an experience of their life time. Set an example so that no one dares to get into such disturbances in the future.

                            According to NDTV's count, protests against Kanhaiya Kumar's arrest have been held across 18 campuses! Goes to show the tentacles spread in the country by those supporting anti-national elements. Including the media that does not shy away from highlighting these protests as voices of dissent and freedom of speech. How to deal with the anti-national elements and their sympathizers in the intelligentsia and media? Of course, India does not want to be Pakistan but can, certainly, learn a thing or two in this respect from that country, that swiftly arrested and jailed one of its citizens for being a fan of India's Virat Kohli, without the media or intelligentsia or politicians raising any stink. "Secular" Indian politicians are digging their own grave by coming out in support of the anti-national elements.

                            The way the judiciary works is that in case there is a disagreement with the Supreme court's verdict, the same may be appealed to the President of India and as a mercy petition. If this was rejected in Afzal guru case, using this as a pretext to fume anger and protest on streets is either too idiotic or very anti - national and even opposes the constitution.<br/>
If the court and the President pronounced a person as anti - national and ordered the hanging, supporting and fuming slogans in support of that individual is nothing but anti - national as well.<br/>
Supporting PDP may have also been seen as either a mutually exclusive and independent event or BJP's attempt of not stereotyping.

                            If taking pro afsal guru stand is anti national and a crime , then arrest pdp leaders of kashmir first ..also arrest Amit Sha and Modi as they support the pdp who is doing anti national activities ( supporting afsal guru ) .. supporting some one who is doing anti national activity is also anti national and punishable <br/>
.so arrest sha and Modi as well  ..

                            someone commented about Subhash Chandra Bose, for your info he created an army to fight the British; whereas RSS founders supported the British occupation and killed Gandhi. BJP in alliance with PDP, which declared Afzal martyr, which means BJP also considers Afzal a martyr !!! Now decide who is anti-national.

                            The state which gave India patriots like Netaji Subhas, Rabindranath Tagore, Bankim Chandra, Vivekananda....is becoming a hub of anti-nationals. No wonder the state has gone down the drain.

BJP is an ally of PDP who believe Afzal Guru as martyr and also Hindu Mahasabha who believe Godse of being a hero and then accuses others for being anti-national..

                            Well done by these Kolkata students. bjp, rss and their moronic followers are calling people anti-nationals and traitors for simply sloganeering or having viewpoints. How else can a citizen raise his or her protest or complaints against the nation? Indians calling such protests as anti-national are immature idiots. Even if such protests are distasteful, they are just words and not actions, hence they cannot be termed anti-national by anyone who is sensible.

                            So what are those anti-national slogans? Are these students all muslims? Who here decides what is anti-national? Similar tactics were followed in one country which is in ruins now - Pak. Now Feku is leading us in that direction.

The people have a right to protest against injustice and atrocities. If the state is shaken by mere slogans it needs introspection. <br/><br/>
Nothing moves among the agencies when these goons carry out massacres and lynching. Does these agencies go on vacation at that time. All these Arnabs think no one is sacrificing at the time on borders?
