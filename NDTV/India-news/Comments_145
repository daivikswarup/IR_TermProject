                            Im constantly amazed by the innovative ways in which NDTV undermines the goodwill generated by the Modi Government. Right now I'm very annoyed by the fact that the broadcast about the Railway budget affecting the whole of the country is interrupted to show us a very badly shot video clip of Sanjay Dutt being released from jail.well done on setting priorities right. Also the badly shot clip showed only the posteriors of people. Was that a hint aboit what you guys think of rhe railway budget

                            Seems that prison life is better then that of the beggars and downtrodden people. You get to exercise, eat well, pray and even work. They probably have the internet and a TV too!

                            dont understand, how 8 months before? now he completed 42 months, earlier 18 months, total 60 months, means 5 years as he got the term, then how it is 8 months before? yes, his parole of about 3 months shud have been completed, it has been a wrong precedence!
