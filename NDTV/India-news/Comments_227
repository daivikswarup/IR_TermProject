                            Some in the liberal media are advocating for debate and discussion, even with matters related to raising anti national slogans and supporting terrorists. <br/>
Let me ask them one question, isn't it the same freedom Afzal Guru also enjoyed? and he used the freedom to conspire against the nation ( ref. SC verdict) and eventually attack the parliament ,killing our brave soldiers, who were guarding many of these politicians who are supporting him today.<br/>
What will happen, If we allow the students to raise slogans against the Nation, hail Afzal Guru as a Hero and then allow a free run? They will be the primary recruitment target for anti national elements and eventually lure them into violence. And the days will not be far when these freedom of expression translate into actual events like a terrorist attack. <br/>
And then we will see many more soldiers become martyrs. But the liberal media dont care. For them, the Soldier has no right to free speech, he has no right to live and die peacefully, for, he is just paid to protect the freedom of all of us, including the so called liberals. For them, only Afzal Guru, Umar Khalid, and Kanhaiya Kumar's freedom and right to free speech is important. ...

                            Captain Pawan Kumar - first of all, my tribute to you for unlike Media and progressive people in the country, I believe in the sacrifices made by you and your fellow officers in Jawans in keeping us safe from "Jehadies from across the border". However, your sacrifice couldn't have come at a more "awkward" time. You see, media these days is occupied in showing the true patriots Kanhaya Kumar, Khalid and others, about their family backgrounds and how they have contributed towards making India a strong and democratic nation. These patriots, have shown how progressive it is to mock our armed forces, cool it is to burn our flag and how disrespecting nation and its soldiers promotes freedom of expression and other great democratic values. So while people like me mourn your supreme sacrifice, you may not find any mention in media, nor anyone visit your home to connect with your family members...I am afraid, you may be labelled a "RSS Supporter" for you didn't allow terrorists to express themselves by the barrel of their guns....Rest in peace my dear friend....Jai Hind

Really thankful to NDTV at least spent little time and a para to bring about the snippets of last sharing by our pride Army Offer Pawan ji.  Hope his parents could bear the loss of such brave soldier.

The real for kashmiri are those who  killed him, who told the civilians trapped there that they meant no harm to them , but to India n Indian army who are illegally occupying our land...

                            A 23yrs old ex-JNU student, a soldier who gave his life in Kashmir to keep the country united. On the other hand a 28yrs old &amp; his friends living on taxpayers money, dancing around at JNU to break up India and to liberate 'the same' Kashmir for which Captain Pawan Kumar made the ultimate sacrifice. Now, can you say both are right? If those 'dreaming to break India' at JNU are right then captain Kumar is wrong, is he? You can't say those jnu students and the ex-jnu captain both are right, in the same breath. Now its right time for ppl of India to decide who are with &amp; for the country and who are against it.
