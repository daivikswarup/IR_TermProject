                            I guess if Modi was allowed to rule some positive things would have happened, but it's RSS and Amit Shah ruling the country now, so don't expect more development

                            An extremely sad event that will eventually prove to be a loss for the rural population. As the years go by, the opposition's foolishness will become apparent as agricultural income will fail to keep pace with rural aspirations, increasingly rural infrastructure will become inadequate and job creation will not meet job demand as agriculture to industry migration will grow. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out. Instead of rejecting the bill outright, the opposition could have built in enough safeguards to ensure that farmers are not short changed in terms of compensation and just alternative livelihood. Arguments about all kind of socialist rural schemes have never really taken off. People should realise that changing social dynamics, fragmentation of land holdings, climate changes and depleting water resources have made a paradigm shift in the socio-economic approach to agriculture imperative. Employment guarantee schemes are short term measures. What is required is empowerment of the rural population through education and adequate employment oppportunities in agro-related enterprises and otherwise in new semi-urban industrial/business spaces that will counter land fragmentation and ensure economic independence.
