                            I was watching the proceedings, Mayawati knew she does not have a point. She wanted a Dalit judge in the 3 judge committee. Minister simply asked what Mayawati is signaling, based on cast we should appoint judges now? <br/><br/>
Mayawati's argument is, we will not have discussion today but can have discussion tomorrow... <br/><br/>
Funny part is, all other opposition started supporting Mayawati now... ridiculous...I am sure they do not have guts to debate with Ms Irani today....

                            BJP has made it a prestige issue. This not only concerns a few 30-40 student but 50 THOUSAND students studying there. So u can punish all for a few. Act wisely. <br/>
Example there are so many spies in Army and even corruption charges so does that mean complete army corrupt and not worthy.

                            The only take away from  the whole incident, lesser known politicians like Smriti Irani &amp; Bandaru Dattatreya are going to get publicity in the end which will only aid their political career considering any publicity is good publicity in politics. If the matter is not raised with shrill decibels in the house, it can lead to meaningful discussion. Unfortunately no politician will understand this.

These are politicians only trying to score on suicide of Rohit Vemula who left a sucidal note clearly mentioning that no body in university is responsible or no student is responsible yet congress and left comrades along with dirty politicians of BSP,JDU,SP,CPI,TMC CPIm  and Congress  they are all hypocrite pseudo seculars and vote bank political parties. Did congress ever raised demand of probe when 9 incidents happened  in Hydrabad Uni during last 10 years of their rule in centre when all 9 were Dalit students who suicided  and  now want to want to held HMO responsible although no clear evidence ???? This is double standard of Rahul Gandhi and congress .  In fact Rahul Gandhi is indicative because Smruti Irani had contested against him in Raibareli constituency .
