                            Just shouting bharat mata ki jai doesn't make him patriotic and other traitors. I love my India more than that bugger. Who is he to decide who is patriotic and who is not.<br/><br/>
He is the traitor who is not respecting even supreme court of India which is the Apex body in India and represents India to the world. I say, that he is the traitor. Pls arrest him on sedition. He is giving chance to Pakistan and other ebonies to show us in poor light to the world by fighting in supreme court and nobody is even taking any action.

It appears that the economic prosperity bus has been missed, inspite of the rock bottom oil prices and lesser subsidy burden. So now we are headed for chaos and eventual split. Not that it is a bad option, though.

                            Few anti national elements tried to disturb peaceful society and they get natural justice. I condone both. Law should have taken its own course. Unfortunately it did not happen that way. Is it because those who believes including lawyers that out law is not capable of giving Justice? Perhaps yes. I feel the student though committed an offense deserve a chance in mainstream society. But he certainly needs to undergo some kind of patriotism lessen. Also law required where people like him who believe in freedom of speech knows what they can speak and what not. Any one hurting others sentiment should be a punishable offense, including tarnishing image which is popular in India without evidence. We can't have a peaceful society where neighbors absurd  each other. There need to be a law to punish those who disturb

                            Media and its allies and political parties should be now happy that their efforts for the last 2-3 months to protect freedom of speech has been almost achieved.<br/><br/>
There should be no out of bounds for police in a "riot stricken"  Delhi, as it has become another breeding ground for budding terrorists, Rapists, and anarchist politicians helping all anti national propaganda under the name of Freedom of Speech!<br/><br/>
If police should not interfere, the State government should not interfere,the central authority<br/>
should not intefere in the capmpus whatever happens, then why the POLITICIANS should be permitted?<br/><br/>
Same states prohibit politicians from other states or parties visitng any state when ever such incidents take place (DADRI-MALDA  etc).<br/><br/>
Even if hundreds are fighting and getting killed inside campus, hostels inside the Boundries<br/>
of NO INTERFERENCE area,police should not interfere.The ruling govt should accept this offer from the opposition always using this as a stick with high selectivity.Some times they will say Police was just observers and did nothing to bring down the fight, If interfered immediately<br/>
they will say Demoarcy was slaughtered and Freedom of Tongue cut off!<br/><br/>
Whether Political parties have freedom of speech within their organisation, really?<br/>
Whether People working in Media have freedom of expressing thier believes, or they are expected to tell what their bosses dictate?<br/>
Whether the media even prints mere Comments which criticise the media or some political activity<br/>
showing the reason "Incitement,Personal,questionable facts without evidence etc ?<br/><br/>
But when incidents when they are minor in nature, they have been Puffed up and given undue imporatnce to political baits and when issue becomes uncontrollable, the media blames the GOVERNMENT (iof course irrespective of any party) and media shows their innocence?
