                            If the accession of J&amp;K was conditional, it was indeed a big mistake and it could neither serve the state interests nor the centre. Relationships can never be nurtured with conditions. A good son is a son if he accepts his mother unconditionally. If he puts conditions for accepting her as mother, the mother child bond would never exist. Beside, the question whether the child is fit enough to survive on his own, shall keep haunting the mother.<br/><br/>
Civilisations need to evolve with the passage of time. Introspection and reviews are the backbone of evolution. Decisions taken by our ancestors need not be perfect for the day and a periodical reviews and reforms are needed to ensure complete welfare of all the three regions of J&amp;K.  Full integration of J&amp;K with India is also in the interest of all the three regions, so that the regions benefit uniformly and the fruits of development reach every nook and corner of the state.<br/><br/>
Ever since the accession, Jammu and Ladakh region have been systematically neglected by successive state governments. The state tops among the most corrupt and have highest unemployment rate. Hence, a complete review and reforms of the region is a need for the hour.
