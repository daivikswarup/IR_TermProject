                            Congress now having taken a stance that praising of terrorists by students is acceptable, BJP govt. should immedietly announce that  celebration of the birthdays of  LTTE chief V. Prabakaran and all the Sikh bodyguards  who pumped bullets on Indira G. , by the people  will not attract  penal provisions of law  here after. People of Tamil Nadu and Punjab were being deprived of this freedom of expression for long.

                            can india afford a 'lotus' revolution, for the sake of saving india. no. but this india under mr. modi and his saffron cohorts, doesn't consist of kashmir, the north-east and the south, and also the dalits. enough precedence since his coming to the respected office. besides,the unconditional support to the sanghis have already created a wide enough fissure -- on whatever ground -- to make our beloved motherland a fascist country. lets invoke our nationalism,and if possible rationalism to save and ask the right questions. clue is everywhere -- from godhra to so-called-beef lynching to afsa to saffronisation to rohith vemula to kanhaiya kumar... <br/><br/>
we are better than this. we all know that!<br/><br/>

Only aim, blame BJP for all the nation's ills while conveniently ignoring the mess created by congress in the last 60 years. Don't ever question who (muslim mob) burned the 60 karsevaks alive in the sabarmati express, but keep showing videos of the after effects that followed. Blame everything on Modi!! You keep mentioning about 2002 riots every other day, but never talk about the emergency period, shah bano case, 1984 sikh killings, bhopal gas tragedy, escape of Anderson, Salman Rushdie, Taslima Nasreen, mega scams/corruptions by congress, students suicides by 100s for Telangana during UPA rule, etc.
