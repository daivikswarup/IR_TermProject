Just ensure that the FDI which comes through has a long term goal i.e. in the long term, it starts changing the lives of the common man in a good way. Also, ensure it doesn't go to your minsters pockets in the short term. If good plans, their timely executions and communal harmony is maintained, BJP will rule the country for a long time.

                            For the first time after a long period in India we have a PM who is determined to develop a strategy so that a clear plan for the progress of the Nation emerges. Unfortunately Indians are a skeptical lot wanting their needs to be fulfilled magically overnight without a collective commitment for hard work. Most of us are also corrupt to the core at every level and will hinder any progress unless we benefit directly from the transection. We will use the most foul language against anyone who stops the money flow to their pockets. Much of the earlier year scams benefitted not only the people at the top but also all the babus and others at various levels. Many of these scams are in courts but the culprits are still enjoying their fruits because the path to justice is very very slow. Collectively we were happy because we got money for no work but by obstruction tactics. So I don't have any doubt we will keep using untruth, foul language even when changes do take place. It is the Indian psychic and it will take a million years in India for the individual to change. The same Indian outside India is brilliant and successful because the environment forces him to change.

We need more job vacancy for our youth, many are not getting jobs becoz our country lacks the institutions which can offer them job. If India need to keep the growth momentum then we need a lot of reforms and easing of rules. Modi gov is going in right direction and only such steps can take us to a future were our country will be a world power.  I mostly have a positive outlook about modi gov becoz this gov is performing one. We should also bring more private players into space related field. Many companies in west are planning for minning from outer space in future. We should not lack behind in such technology.

FDI is to increase investment but on the other side FDI in retail means foreign companies building stores and crushing small shops which modi and bjp opposed since existence.

                            Anti-humiliation and distraction measures to recover from the BiharVerdict. PM has become a magician, always attempting to surprise people with gimmicks.

                            BJP opposed and blocked FDI during UPA government and they are complaining about a GST which is still only in a draft form and behaving as if it is a bill ready to be passed if only the congress party does not block it! How double-faced. But welcome the reform nonetheless.

                            It is a humiliating defeat in Bihar indeed. So, what we expect? PM should step down. Or offer PM ship to Nitish or Kejriwal. What will better for nation?

                            Dear Mr Modiji, Please don't sell India to foreign companies  which will ruin our country. Develop the infrastructure with a vision to develop our own strengths. With Globalisation poor won't come out of poverty and American, Chinese and other millionaires will be ruling is.

                            FDI in other sectors is okay but why FDI in mining? India already has high level of pollution and deforestation, why mess with the natural resources of the country further by allowing FDI in mining?

                            World leaders welcome Modi not becasue of his 56" chest - but because of his contracts!! Before all these leaders used to come and beg contracts from India. African leaders came to India - and went back with lots of money form India. Secondly, Modi visits overseas to meet NRI's (mostly form Gujarat) - I would like to know how much BJP / RSS receive money from overseas in last 2 years!!

                            Vast majority of  population including  all called intellectuals are ignorant,  stupid and have been intolerant all their lives. They may have travelled <br/>
many foreign countries but have learnt nothing whatsoever. How many of graduates , including their training spells abroad has lived up to decent<br/>
and cheritable lives? Howmany of privilege individuals ever have done any cheritable deed other than returning their stupid awards. There are millions<br/>
of helpless, homeless, hungry crying out . Majority have been selfish, power hungry,corrupt and certainly intolerant monkeys.
