Patna:Â                             Union Minister Ramvilas Paswan today said he has apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the "deteriorating" law and order situation in Bihar, and demanded for an imposition of President's rule in the state.
Mr Paswan has also sought for a CBI probe into the recent political murders in Bihar since the Grand Alliance government came to power three months ago.
"In my capacity as LJP president, I met the PM two days ago and apprised him about deteriorating law and order situation in Bihar... I also submitted a letter demanding a CBI probe in the recent political murders and sought imposition of President's Rule in the state," he said.Mr Paswan said that the recent murders of BJP state unit vice president Visheshwar Ojha in Bhojpur district and LJP leader Brijnathi Singh in Vaishali district pointed to the "collapse" of law and order situation in Bihar.
The spate of political murders has not even left the RJD with its leader Vijendra Yadav and his kin shot dead in Samastipur district two days ago, the LJP supremo said, adding the criminals have got so emboldened by the "lack of teeth in the ruling government" that they have even started targeting leaders of the ruling alliance.
Mr Paswan targeted the RJD in particular, saying his worst fears that Bihar will be gripped by "Jungle Raj-2" if Lalu Prasad's party returned to power, has come true. The LJP supremo said the victory of RLSP candidate Sudhanshu Sekhar in Harlakhi Assembly bypoll in Madhubani district showed that the people have started raising their voice against the lawlessness under the Nitish Kumar government.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
