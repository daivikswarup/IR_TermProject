                            Nothing new and their hand is there in all terroist incidents in India but how do we tame it? India has to up its ante and support the freedom efforts of GilgitBaltistan, Sind and Balochisthan very proactively and engage in assymetric warfare by spreading its forces thin and making it pay heavily. Until you do this they will continue doing what they know best!!!
