Patna:Â                             Mangal Pandey, the president of the BJP's Bihar unit, on Wednesday asked actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha to resign from parliament as well as from the party for supporting arrested JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar.
"If Shatrughan Sinha thinks Kanhaiya Kumar is innocent and his stand is right, he should resign from the primary membership of the BJP and also resign as MP," Mr Pandey told the media in Patna.
Mr Pandey said Mr Sinha's stand on Kanhaiya Kumar was opposite to the party line.
Shatrughan Sinha, the Lok Sabha member from Patna Saheb, earlier said Kanhaiya Kumar was "wrongly arrested" and he had not raised anti-national slogans.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
