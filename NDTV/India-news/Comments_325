                            All 3 major political parties in Punjab i.e. Akalis, BJP amd Congress are condescending yet wary of AAP. It is gong to sweep them away. AAP, however, must reunite with its breakaway group under the banner of Swaraj Abhiyan to prevent split in its vote bank. AAP shall then have bright prospects in the state
