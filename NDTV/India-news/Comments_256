                            It is high time the Party takes action on this loose cannon. He makes a comment on any subject which he feels will embarrass the party. How long is the Party going to keep quiet? Even if the Party is accused of intolerance, does not matter. It should act and act immediately.

                            Shatrughan Sinha has repeatedly defied BJP's stance on various issues.. He's consistently sided with the Lefties....he doesn't deserves to be a BJP leader. He should join Khangress which would suit his temperament better.

                            Sinha ji you have become BJP's Shatru!!You have embarrassed your own party time n again due to frustration of not becoming a minister. BJP should have given you some portfolio in order to keep your big mouth shut.You have become a joker and lost all your self respect which little bit you earned in acting.Jokers are used to win the game but then thrown away.You should learn from your Bollywood colleague Amitji otherwise its very sad to see your status....really pathetic!!!

                            It's so sad that people with power acts as if there is no law in the country. It's a fact and always been a fact in India. Who so ever is in power acts the same and exploit ones position. Politicians, Beaurocrats, Rich brats or local goons, all act and behave the same. It's such a shame that their is no freedom of speech in India. Modiji, please make SYSTEM for the nation than running after businesses. We all know that BJP needs more money and back support of the rich for the next election, but this is right opportunity for you to be a common man because your background is just common and you know common man and there problems much better than any other stupid politicians. PLEASE MAKE A BETTER SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY THAN WASTING YOUR TENURE. Mr Sinha is not the issue, real issue is BJP's false pride and intolerance towards accepting right.
