                            Glib speech and emoting on stage or Parliament is the only qualification needed to be minister.Experience, education, domain knowledge, academic excellence, academic research, working experience - all these are irrelevant.If you can talk and emote for an audience, be it rallies or parliament, your career is made.<br/><br/>
Will any of us send our child to school headed by a person with little education?No. But we will entrust our whole education system and universities to a minister with not even 15 yrs of full education! And then we want results!

We have been respected on the world stage for decades. India till today produces some of the worlds best doctors, engineers, scientists and accountants. BJP has done nothing but ride on the coat tails of where Congress put India on the map. India has never been more divided as a nation than today. What has Smriti Irani done in terms of the curriculum? What she has focused on to date will not help our students in terms of securing jobs or for that matter even become well rounded human beings. Her speech in parliament was nothing but theatrical.

                            Stop distorting the truth. What Smriti Irani said was that in incidents of hanging there is a chance that people don't die immediately in spite of a pulse rate that can touch around 30 as per previous clinical experience. Two, she made it clear that her information source about this event is the State police. Instead of this blame game in which the media's nuetrality is becoming highly debatable, let the various cogs in the wheel and recorded statements be investigated. How can NDTV be sure if parties involved are speaking the truth, including the doctor.

You said you pronounced time of death at 7:34 pm <br/>
his body was cold and stiff i.e he was already dead for a few hours before you arrived,<br/>
therefore time you certified death is not equal to actual time of death. Which is wot Smriti Irani said - ie no attempts were made to revive him as soon as he may have been detected. Instead people were planning political strategies!!!So the doctors call came as an after thought!

                            Another false news by NDTV. Really I look at NDTV to have some enjoyment and see how low our news and media has gone down to. The doctor is saying right motive had set in when she was called - which means he had been brought down, laid in the table and since rigid notice has set in it would be 4-5 hours he was dead.  If the doctor was there then why local police in their report quoted that no doctor was allowed for hours? What was the issue with them - they are not under BJP?

50% of tainted ministers from all parties have Masters Degree.<br/><br/>
Dont go by the news publishes in NDTV or IBN. Use yoru common sense. Listen to her speech properly and make your own conclusions, rather than allow cheap new channels to bombard you with their conclusions.<br/><br/>
She clearly says that she is quoting from what Telengana Police told everyone. Also, what is the Doctor saying? The question is not about when Doctor came. The question is about a guy who was allowed to do this and went unnoticed for more than 2 hours during evening. We are not talking about early morning or late night.<br/><br/>
Common people dont have any evidence to make any conclusion on who was correct or wrong. Until we have that information, it is not wise or even sensical to make any kind of comments. Better take the good things in life.

                            It still doesn't make everything invalid what she said. The truth is that there is petty politics played by Congress and opposition parties on this issue. if there is mismatch of information state police is responsible for providing wrong information to the minister. and it is not in her control anyway... and how does central government  become responsible for merely sending letters that asks administration to look into the matter and investigate allegations.. its ultimately the responsibility of the administration and not the government.. Government just did its job very well.. that's the point..

                            @all HATERS; am no Bakth or align with a party but i dont understand where the doctor contradicted   Smriti's speech. As per Smriti, she quoted what mentioned in the FIR that police could not get to the body till 6:30 and the doctor said she had the call 7:30 and she reached with in 4 mins. Anyone one with a tiny brain would know that until unless the doctor lives on campus and even then it would take 15 mins to get to the body after so many people gathered there. Still she declared the boy is been dead for 2 hrs, so it is true that no one got there for 2hrs. Why no one called the doctor till 7:30 and what is she contradicting. On the other hand Vemula's mother would like a job for her younger son, can you please tell on what basis he should be given Gvt position when there are crores of qualified youth waiting in queues for a job. First of being a dalith (As the media portray him as a dalith leader) am very sure there is a reservation in place for him.

And then she was saying if medical was given to him probably there could be some chances. Stats police does not work under central Gov. I think we are again making out of something else which she did not say. Its sad and its sad from NDTV part also that they make out issue from a non-issue.
