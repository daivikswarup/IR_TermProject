New Delhi:Â                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi today asked IAS officers to keep in mind the welfare of the poorest of the poor people while taking decisions as they are in "service" and not "jobs".
He made the comment while interacting with 181 IAS probationers of the 2015 batch.
He exhorted them to recall Mahatma Gandhi's talisman of keeping in mind the welfare of the poorest of the poor, while taking decisions, a PMO statement said.
Noting that several of these probationers had worked in the private sector before joining the IAS, he said that while their earlier assignments were "jobs", they are now going to undertake "service".
During the interaction, he talked about the North East and stressed the importance of progress and connectivity there, saying if the region develops, the entire country would march forward, the statement said.
In response to a question, PM Modi said his extensive travels across India for over four decades, and his experience as Chief Minister of a state, had helped him in his work as prime minister.
