                            Rohit's soul RIP, but the truth is that Rohit was neither a dalit nor a scholar. Thousands of Folks stay in Hyderabad hostels for subsidized food and rent and indulge in all kinds of activities except studies. They are puppets of political parties and rowdyism. Rohit was no different as he fell prey to political vultures.

                            Kejriwal should promise government jobs to the families of all those farmers who commit suicide throughout India. What is his interest in the family of Vemula who died in Hyderabad and whose family has no connection to Delhi? Usual cheap and dirty politics of the AAP? And the less said about Vemula's family the better. They are using Rohith's suicide for material benefits. What a shame.
