                            These are the real Indians. Media, politicians, fake NGOs and so called students and their masters should take a moment to pause and think what is the purpose of their life, if any. Or will they all just continue to burn India, the very country that they live off while these young bravehearts make supreme sacrifice for such useless people.

                            Young men ...who too are someone's child is laying down his life for rest of Indians to breath free and to sleep peacefully...people whom he doesnt even know...protecting the other young men like him who are someone's children from being harmed by these extremist...yet there is a growing thought of anti-national feeling in the minds and lips of many young Indians who talk about freedom...intolerance...send them to the borders to protect the nation in difficult terrains...i m sure at the very first instance they will scoot away...dont need your bravery on the streets to speak against the very country where you have lived free and helped give you wings to your dreams...if you have so much anger and attitude...join the forces ...live their life ...and then lets talk about intolerance....

                            Salute our soldiers. It's a shame that we live in a world where our soldiers are martyred while our politicians capitalise on anti national controversies. No wonder the youth is leaving the country and big MNC are capitalizing on the state of the nation. No one cares about Anything - peace, environment, economy. Everyone just cares about making a quick buck.

                            Everytime they strike on India , it is an open WAR on the nation ! <br/><br/>
It is a proxy war being waged by Pakistan to subjugate and destroy India on the name of religion.<br/><br/>
Are the Sickulars paying attention?

                            Shame- Shame , World's 4th millitary power could not neutralize a handful of terrorists. I think I can do far more better job as a defence minister then Manohar Paarikar. WE have to understand that we are at war, The forces in Kashmir and punjab need highest sophisticated weapons, not bloody INSAS. Even forces in Siachin are carrying INSAS. Just buy the best Assault rifle in the world for forces in Kashmir and Punjab. Rafale fighter jets worth 8 billion dollars are not going to help us in this warfare we need basic stuff not fifth gen fighter jets.<br/>
We are very slow in taking decisions, slow in implementing new ideas, slow in buying or developing defence systems. We do not improvise with the ever-changing situations.<br/>
Why are we having 2 Aircraft carriers? when we could have neutralized the entire airport of Kandhar after IC814 had taken off from Kandhar. By doing this we would have eliminated all the terrorists we released, also it would have given a strong message to any terrorist organizations and Pakistan-Taliban, ISI, etc.
