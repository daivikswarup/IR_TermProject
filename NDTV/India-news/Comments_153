                            Fantastic comment by Jaitley. West Bengal is politically in Deep---t. Nothing constructive happens there. Feel bad for people of West Bengal. They cannot get their mindset to focus on a bigger picture.

                            The Left, TMC &amp; congress have ruined states like West bengal &amp; Kerala. The Dalit politics have ruined the states like UP &amp; Bihar. As long as these parties are there India can never become even like Malaysia.

                            Congress and the leftists are really in a fix. now they must be thinking as to why they brought these issues in parliament. When election are in the corner in 4 states, such matters will affect them in a bad way. Now we know the quality of our institutions and the reason for the Indian institutions not appearing among the top 500 global universal  ranking. Just by saying that many parliamentarians and party leaders are from a particular university will not be enough to get good ranking. Quality of the institution is most important.

                            That is not tragedy of bengal - rather that is the strength of bengal politics. It is represented by most educated, least money-making and least corrupt lawmakers across the party lines.

                            Smart Doe W.Bengal has traditionally been victim of neglect by its own ruling class - commies first shut down every functioning industry they cud lay their hands on in 30 years to keep a hungry and active labour union movement alive and keep millions of unemployed workers seek shelter under the party flag. While they were part of the ruling coalition upa-1, they did absolutely NOTHING - just walked outof upa-2 on a flimsy nuclear deal.
