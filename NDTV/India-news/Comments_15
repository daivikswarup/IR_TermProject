                            That Rohit and JNU are being used to save and forward the expired political careers of the old and dead horses in Congress and Left is a foregone conclusion. What is to be seen, how low can people like Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Left stoop and want to see if people can be fooled with such tactics even now. If yes, then we, the citizens, will continue to be manipulated by the herd of these illiterate self serving dogs. If no, then a turnaround in the future of our country and future of us, the citizens, should be round the corner in a decade.

                            What the Government wants to do with our higher education system is very clear from the kind of minister assigned to its ministry. Our greatest resource is our human resource. Campuses should not be used for petty politics. It is high time for this country to have a visionary as the HRD minister, like the manner former PM Narasimha Rao chose Manmohan Singh for Finance. Otherwise, these kinds of issues are bound to happen again. A lot of productive time can be wasted like this in the Parliament and outside.

Congress ruled India for more than 50 years in the last 65 years and they claim that casteism on campuses is because of BJP, RSS and the Government. Laugh out loud. Don't target people because of their past work - at least she did some work and earned her bread honestly unlike Rahul and the other communists who never did any work whatsoever in their entire life and have lived off the income from dubious and corrupt sources.

Stop being intolerant to progress. All over the world people take pride in their culture and past whereas India is unfortunate to have people who criticise the culture and past and it's ancient learnings. The glorious past for such people is just the nehruvian era

                            Sedition Law was put in place in 1870s. Well there were more people prosecuted under Sedition Law during Congress rule than any other rule in India. Nehru could have repelled this draconian law, he did not as he wanted to use it on people who are against him. Nehru Gandhi Family wanted to have a totalitarian regime. That is why Indira Gandhi Illegally created Emergency in 1970s when she lost support to rule the country. what is difference between her and Saddam ? Sonia and Rahul and Saddam, when Dr. M was rulling the country for 10 years he could not do anything boldly without the blessings of Sonia, it is a disgrace he was not respected and was just a dummy. Anti-National forces cannot digest the fact that there can be a non-congress govt as they are not able to continue their activities. Shame on these people who are hell bent on destabilizing the country but not interested in helping it progress.

                            It does not matter whether he was a Dalit or high caste - but a minister sending an official letter in student matters is so demeaning and shaming to the student in front of the whole country. Student groups argue and have rivalries on every campus - this is normally handled by the university. As far as the ABVP goon who got surgery was for appendicitis not for injury caused by the rival groups. It's amazing how this government uses fake videos and stories to suppress dissent. This is Gujarat model where fake video was used against Joshi to finish him off!

                            Histrionics and little else . She is trying to cover up her crime by an emotional speech. No body believes that she or Dattareya was not in the wrong. A sensitive person would have put in her papers.

                            Lets not forget that Smriti was first a TV star actor and then a politician. She has spent decades acting. Today's debate was nothing else but her acting skills at display with anger, emotions, crying and slamming papers on the desk. Her script was by hearted and it was a cake walk for her to jump from one topic to the other because an actor' profession is all about learning their scripts and displaying emotions in front of the camera no matter how many people are in front. Scindia and other leaders even Rajnath were all naturally speaking because they do not come from the film fraternity!! We should not fall for the saas bahu actress who thinks she was a natural. It was her former profession that helped her perform so fiercely. No matter what she said no one can forget the fact that she is the biggest mockery to the Ministry of education by being uneducated herself!!

                            Awesome speech. I already had a great awareness of crooks in Indian society, but the speech has added to what I knew. SC ST student union of JNU deserves a thanks for letting me know for sure that if our ancestors have described them as low caste then it is fully justified.

                            SUCIDE is a self defeating behavior. whether a farmer commits suicide for crop failure, whether a jilted lover commits suicide or a saradah scam caused 200 suicidesall self-defeating.<br/>
large percentage of these suicide are also drug related. end is the same but to blame HRD minister and "bharat barbadi tak jung rahegi , jung rahegi" slogans links are simply irrational.<br/>
DALIT problem has not been created by smriti rani nor she can counsel them to cure.<br/>
MS. MAYAWATI'S  HATI HAVE NOT GIVEN ANY BOOST TO SELF ESTEEM OF DALITS RATHER STUPENDOUS WASTE FOR 90 ELEPHANTS STATUES COULD HELP MANY THEIR DRINKIKNG WATER AND TOILETS.<br/>
INDIA NEED TO EXPELL THESE IRRATIONAL MINDS OUT OF ANY EXCUTIVE POSITION. THESE ARE SICK MINDS AND NEEDS PSCHIATRIC TREATMENT AND ARE NOT FIT FOR PUBLIC REPRESENTATIONS.MENTAL APTITUDE AND STATUS NEED TO BE DETERMINED EVERY 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY CAN CARRY OUT THEIR DUTY AS CM.<br/>
MAMATA BANERJEE DECIDES THE RAPES AS "SAJANO GHATONA " TO COVER UP THE RAPIST AS MOSTLY IT BELONGS TO MUSLIM COMMUNITY, DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR LEADS BENGAL TO DANGEROUS STATE AS BOMB BLASTS ARE GIVEN AS CRACKERS WHERAS HAPPENS TO BE 2000LBS OF DETONATIONS.THE SECURITY OF INDIA IS COMPROMISED AT THE WHIM OF THESE SICK MINDS.

                            There is no doubt that Smiriti Irani is the weakest link in the entire cabinet. She doesn't have adequate credentials to hold such portfolio, she is just getting favour because of her loyalty to NaMo. If she had taken measures then incident like Hyderabad, Jamia, AMU, Jadavpur and JNU would not have happened, she actually couldn't assimilate between reel and real life, she still has not came up from that Sas bahu serial episode. I am not praising Rahul and Farjiwal but Irani must resign because she abysmally failed in her duty.
