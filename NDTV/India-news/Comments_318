                            Ms. Lekhi described Left beautifully. Left surely was a stumblic block in India's development. Congress conveniently allied with them and not bothered  to improve living standards. Poor are poorer, rich are richer. No serious attempt was made to empower poor other than giving them half hearted Doles that too for their votes. Left is degenerated pre historic party and should be put in a museum.

                            I love the way she describes left with accuracy. Same is true for Congress and other fake secular parties. They will never help India to rise above petty politics and get the recognition it deserves.

                            CPM marxists killed teacher jayakumar an RSS worker who left marxist party before he joined with Rss/BJP in kannar kerla. He was killed in a brutal attack by his own ex friends comrades of CPM in the presence of 40 young students in the class room . This happened before three years and last month an young Rss worker was killed by CPM goons in the presence of his parents and brother in the same town. CPM is very dangerous to the society and it must be banned. Modi government is right in containing them at budding level in JNU before they do anti national activities.

                            Her utterances are always witch like. She never talks logic and is always abrasive. She is crying from the rooftop so that she is made a minister. If one goes by her antecedents, she has never been a RSS sympathiser, a qualification needed for becoming a minister. We wish her good luck.
