                            Thats the problem in this country. No one has denied to accept &amp; acknowledge, Kanhiya's ancestor's contribution to Independence struggle of India.  Already people are playing havoc in this country for last 67 yrs, claiming cover as real &amp; acquired descendants of Mahatma Gandhi.  Good quality &amp; Contribution is NOT a hereditary property that can be transferred and it has to be earned !!.
