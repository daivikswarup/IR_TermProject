                            The government needs to get its act together and act against the hooligans, be they lawyers or BJP members or others. The acts by such hooligans is definitely going to cost the BJP dearly in the elections.

KUMAR HAS SAID IF HE IS FOUND GUILTY, HE IS READY TO GO BEHIND BARS.  WAIT FOR THE COURT'S DECISION ON HIM, UNTIL THEN IT IS NOT FAIR TO CALL SOMEONE ANTI-NATIONALIST OR DESH DROHI.  WHAT EVIDENCE DO YOU HAVE...  IF HE IS FOUND TO BE INNOCENT, DON'T YOU ALL BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES...THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK...I KNOW MANY WILL REPLY AGAINST ME, BUT I DON'T CARE.....
