                            And you think we are buying your defence.  We are very much aware of the lawlessness prevailing in the State. you can't woodwink the people in the name of opposition.  Time to change the situation there or forget coming to power ever again.

                            Only people of Bihar can vouch for the prevalent situation but Nitish Kumar must book the culprits. Opposition may be blowing the things out of proportion yet his government should not allow such opportunities to them
