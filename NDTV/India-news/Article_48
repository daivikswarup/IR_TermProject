New Delhi:Â                             Four Indians were arrested in Syria recently not because they had gone there to join and fight alongside the ISIS but for entering the country without valid visa, the government today clarified.
Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Walid Al Maoulem, during his visit here last month, had said the four Indians had "crossed over from Jordan to Syria to join the ISIS" and that they were under custody in Damascus. Replying to a question in Lok Sabha, Minister of State for External Affairs VK Singh said the Indians had entered Syria illegally from Jordan on their way to Lebanon where they were heading for employment.
"Arun Kumar Saini, Sarvjeet Singh, Kuldeep Singh and Joga/Jagga Singh entered into Syria from Jordan on their way to Lebanon for employment without valid visa. They were caught by the Syrian authorities as illegal immigrants," he said.
He said Syrian authorities, after making "necessary inquiries", conveyed to New Delhi that they can be brought back to India.
The minister said officials from Indian Embassy in Damascus have met the four persons and modalities are being worked out to bring them back.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)
