                            If all of them are saying that they participated in the event and confirm that they did not raise the slogan, then who raised the anti-Indian slogan??? Was it player from the air by Afzal's soul??? Your pappu may believe, but we know the truth.. Do not run or hide.. face the trial you traitors of this nation

                            It is definitely no freedom of expression but a racket operating against nation's interests. These students are being used as pawns. I think the parents need to be socially distanced so that sense prevail over them

                            These people are a thread to Indian national security and everyone who was involved in their sheltering should be dealt with iron blow. Scrutinizing anti India rhetoric can really go a long way in setting a benchmark for what is a threshold for accommodating free speech in India...

                            what is contradictory. one says no anti national slogan were raised , the other says slogans were raised but cannot say if they were anti-national. So students raise slogans. Question is who are the real culprits. Can one hold organizers responsible for a participants views.
