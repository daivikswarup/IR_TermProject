                            yesterday, Pappu and Kejri supported and gave a lenghthy speach for the march by JNU students and said they are with the students. Today, did they support when ABVP students were chanding Pro-Nation slogans? Rahul and Kejri arent supporting the people who called to cut Bharath mata into pieces? Shame on Rahul and Kejri for their Dirty politics. They have become blind and supporting anti nationals just for the sake of opposting modi. Are they also thinking we are blind and fools like them?

                            All the universities, colleges, across the nation should not reschedule the exams to be held. <br/>
let all the agitating students be held responsible for their actions.

                            Why you are not mentioning ABVP students, but calling them ABVP members. They are also students
