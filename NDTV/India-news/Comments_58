Now this is nothing new we see it very often in this country. Now the question I want to ask here is if this happened because cops didn't want to act or were they told not to ?

                            Mr. Bassi has been acting justly as we have been watching him since persecution meted out to him by Kejriwal and his highly irritable vocal colleagues. Bassist always maintained calm posture and avoided controversy. I pity him that being a police officer he has to be patient and take insults from politicians. Even in the case of JNU he is acting as required unmindful of useless opposition parties' barbs.
