The right thinking nationalists should also march with full strength. To avoid law and order situation the march of nationalists should be on next day and must be peaceful.<br/>
There are every chances that RAGA and AK march will be violent and if stopped by police, all the hue and cry will start in media and ultimately wash out the budget session of parliament which is the main agenda of opposition. Modi government needs to be careful and not give opposition a handle to stop the important legislature.

                            Shame on RG and AK. I being 70 years old also, my blood boils when I hear nasty shouts of Bharat ki Barbadi. RG and AK as Indian Leaders, why not yours? So called Student Leaders, who gave or listened to such destructive, derogatory slogans, either they are hand in gloves with the those who gave these slogans or they are so incapable leaders(I refrain from using "impotent leaders") that they did not react or stop Bharat ki Barbadi slogans. And to those Leftist, do they remember what their Mai Baap China did to students at Tiananmen Square in1989 ? 1000s of students were massacred and more than 10000 students were arrested.They just asked for democracy in China and not Barbadi ( India is so tolerant that even after 10 days, police are not able to arrest 5 students also, who gave anti national slogans ). Politicians and Journalist should have united and asked Govt  why no action against Bharbat ki Barbadi slogans. Journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai and Rahul Kanwal stand exposed to who their masters are. So RG, AK (though I like u) show that you are Indian first and you don't tolerate Bharat Ki Barbadi slogans, also as leaders, tell and educate students to oppose such miscreants and also ensure that because of you and likes of you, these miscreants don't go Scot Free.

To direct the attention of the public from their error in JNU, they have again taken up Rohith vemulla case in their hand. How many of these Communists/kejriwal's took out a procession in support of Farmers who committed suicide in Vidharbha when NCP and congress was in power.

Rahul was wrong in "combining" student Vemula's death with the anti-National JNU "Students" arrest.......Dalits of this country are forever towards the integration and growth of India........Dalits of India are never anti-Nationals........So, combining the death of Vemula with those anti-national "students" of JNU is not acceptable to Indians and particularly Dalits......<br/><br/>
