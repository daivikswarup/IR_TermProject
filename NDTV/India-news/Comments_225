                            I am from south and I don't want all this issues to be part of my tension !! Why should south suffer because of an every day new controversy!! Chi !! We gave IT to our nation and the north people just gave nothing but tension ! First the partition second the BApu killing third the massacres and now everyday jat protest which has already cost 37000 crores in losses !! We are not generating Gdp to be spent on some irresponsible people!! And this pm, may be the best pm but he and his roots are defined by the cult that this bjp leader is whose filthy tongue is making baseless allegations on innocent students, the way he defines jnu sounds like a brothel !! What is this  ?? Where is law ministry where is education ministry where is the police !! ?? I don't want to be ashamed Indian because of the actions of North Indians!! I don't want a divided India but what is this that south has to be a part in bearing expenses for destructions done in north India  which are avoidable !! Natural calamities is a different thing!  This has to change  and a lot has to change!

                            What freedom of speech some of the traitors are talking abou? Using tax money for food, books and fees. Subsidized housing and telling people of India every house will create a Afzul Guru, telling the nation Pakistan Zindabad . We will fight until India meets barbadi. These poisonous snakes have the gall to talk of freedom of speech. They should be happy they are living in India. If it were countries like their spiritual paradise Pakistan , they would have been brutalized and eliminated talking like this under the pretext of cultural event. Leftist English media instead of condemning their thankless behavior , singing duets with them. Shame on English media

JNU should be shut completely ad it's contribution to society is zilch apart some rare dissidence. More over, why is this channel stuck in a time warp and some worthless university. Please move on..There is life ahead.
