                            This not a tussle about "academic freedom" "student right to dissent" or "right to free speech". No thinking person can argue with this. This is rightly an emotive and very powerful among majority of Indians of all shades and hue. I humbly submit that what is happening across various campuses is more than that as media channel. As so-called fourth pillar of democracy, its incumbent on media channels like yours to investigate the real reason. I submit to you that the nature of protests at JNU and other Campuses like Hyderabad, Javadpur University campuses shows that highly emotive, just and important social issues, such as farmer suicide, Dalit discrimination, unemployment, female right etc,  are being used to win over support of idealist students and indeed of media and intellectuals. These issues however then being exploited to push the agenda of Pakistani backed Kashmiri separatists. So with this masterstroke ISI has fooled Indians an made Kashmiri separatist agneda into social issue on par with farmers suicide, dalit rights, female emaciation etc, thereby justfying the ISI-backed terrorism. Many Indian in media, campuses and political parties have take the bait.
