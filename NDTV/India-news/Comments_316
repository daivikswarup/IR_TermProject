If kids are making the mistakes of thinking that our nation is not the most benevolent, the most caring one, that it bullies people to be conformist, are they being proven wrong by our government by their action? They are keeping Kanhaiya in jail for "not stopping anti-national slogans', lest not forget what their revered boss did not stop: mass killing, riots, bigotry. Why is he not in jail?

Its even worse then anti national slogans because those cops and the people who gave them orders to watch silently are the biggest anti nationals. If being in power you can't maintain law and order inside a court then it shows your failure . And being a politician you very well know how to distract from the real issue .

All those who think the video is a fake , go watch the news Kanhaiya kumar accepted that there were Anti-India slogans by group of unknown people. Another thing is that if Rahul is with JNU and hes not anti-Indian they why he didnt supported retired army officials when marched against these anti-india elements. <br/>
  Think of a situation that you give your home at rent to someone and he come and say bad words to you in your home, will you tolerate or beat the heck out of him and throw him out of your house, just think of it.<br/>
Not only this yesterday in Lok Sabha one of the congress person asked BJP to arrest Afzal Guru if hes a terrorist.... I mean seriously (best example of dumbass congress)....<br/>
So please read facts before posting anything stupid dont be like congress.<br/><br/>
I would also say that do not fight amoung yourself this is what Pakistan and china wants because they fear us coz India is in top 5 military power of world. Our grand parents fought for freedom and many sacrifised their lives for the sake of this country.
