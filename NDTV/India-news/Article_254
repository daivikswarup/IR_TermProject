New Delhi:Â                             The United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Pakistan, today welcomed efforts of India and Pakistan to resume dialogue process and said it will try its "best" to ensure that they succeed.
UAE Ambassador Ahmed Al Banna said his country "supports" the latest initiatives by the two countries including Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lahore outreach and the meeting of the National Security Advisers of India and Pakistan in Bangkok.
The remarks by UAE envoy came days ahead of visit of Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of UAE armed forces Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayad Al Nahyan. Mr Al Nahyan will arrive in New Delhi on Wednesday on a three-day visit.
"I am sure that there have been positive signs between the two countries...the meeting that took place between India and Pakistan in Thailand, trying to open a new path of relationship. We support that and we will try our best to make sure that it succeeds," the envoy told reporters replying to a question.
Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar was scheduled to travel to Islamabad to hold talks with his Pakistani counterpart Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhary on January 15 but both the countries announced deferment of the talks with "mutual consent" in the wake of the Pathankot attack.
NSAs of India and Pakistan had met in Bangkok on December 6 last year and agreed to take forward the engagement.
