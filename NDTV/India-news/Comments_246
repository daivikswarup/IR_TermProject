                            Congress and the BJP both have been fooling the countrymen since INDEPENDENCE and the People have now come to know the GAME of both the Parties and their intention just to LOOT the country that affects the common and the POOR man's Pockets to lead miserable life like Poverty. Country has woken up now and the Public will never vote the corrupts but have chosen the AAP.

                            Why Mr. Singh takes it for granted that people are fool and he is the only intelligent person to educate people about who is fooling whom!!! Let people decide whether they want Kejriwal or Singh.
