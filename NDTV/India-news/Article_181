Shimla:Â                             Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh on Saturday said that the T-20 World Cup cricket match between India and Pakistan, which is to be played at Dharamsala on March 19, should be cancelled in view of Pathankot terror attack.
"I don't want to bring politics in cricket and was in favour of Indo-Pak cricket match but after the attack by terrorists at Pathankot airbase, the situation has changed and I feel that the match should not be held after killings of our jawans in the terrorist attack," he said.
Referring to the controversy over locating the main campus of Kangra Central University, the Chief Minister said he was in favour of setting up the main campus at Dharamsala, which was the central place, while departments can be opened in other places also.He said the state government had offered adequate land for the University near Dharamsala and also apprised the Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani regarding the same but no decision has been taken so far.
Mr Singh alleged the matter was being delayed as the BJP MP from Hamirpur Anurag Thakur wants the main campus at Dehra which falls in his Parliamentary constituency and is quite far away from Dharamsala and other places in Kangra district.
