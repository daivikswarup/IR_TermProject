                            Wish all round prosperity for the state which has been neglected for a long time. Pray that they get full support from the centre. Alienation phase from the main stream has come to an end.

                            Aleaf of lesson on democracy in play - for all elected politicians accross the country. These politicians should be complemented for agreeing to work band-in-hand for the welfare of state despite varying affiliations! Remember once you are elected, you are exp expected to forget your political animosity and act for a common goal - society.
