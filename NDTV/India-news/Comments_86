                            Mr FAROOQSHAB HOW DO YOU EXPECT HINDUS should view MOSLIMS OF KASHMIR WITH NO SUSPICION WHEN THEY HAVE KILLED HINDU PANDITS IN LAKHS AND MADE THEM TO FLEE FROM THEIR SOIL. Did you or your MUSLIM friends ever regretted for this heinous crime.

                            The average Hindu, at an individual level, is not anti-Muslim. If somebody questions therefore as to why through history there have been incidents of communal clashes, the cause could be attributed to temporary mob-multiplied passions instigated by fundamental religious and political elements on both sides and not to ordinary individuals. It is extremely worrying, this sudden vocal religious slant to the political discourse since the BJP came to power. Every right thinking Indian citizen must objectively assess his or her immediate social neighbourhood and ask, has anything suddenly changed at the ground level? Has the Hindu or Muslim next door suddenly started carrying a trishul or a sword? It is easy to understand the sense of insecurity among sections of Muslims. But please rationally question how much of this insecurity can be attributed to the Hindu next door? Fringe elements on both sides will play vote bank politics. Vote bank politics based on issues serve the nation. Vote bank politics based on religion will only serve politicians like Mr. Abdullah.

                            India can and will keep Kashmir but it just doesn't know whether it should allow the turncoats to remain in the nation or send them to the promised land for the pure. Good luck in Pakistan, Mian Abdullah!

                            Dear Mr. Farooq abdullah ji Indian masses don't see other communities with suspicion, its the craftsmanship of seasoned politicians and there are many others who try to create a divide between Indians on the basis of different things. Our nation is like a home and suspicion among family members is not taught in our home.

                            Mr. Abdullah has to answer why Kashmir alone deserves special status. Isn't it one more state of India. And why isn't him or the Separatists are not letting the Pandits back to their land. Shameful!!!

                            Mr. Abdullah enough of your arm twisting. Please start a movement in J&amp;K and take the Kashmiris to join Pakistan. We really want to see if Muslims in Kashmir consider themselves Muslims first and then Indians or Indians first and then Muslims. How much time will you need to get this accomplished and when will you give up if you fail to accomplish what you said. If you can give a plan for the same so that we all can agree that if your plan fails then we dont hear any such nonsense from you and your clan ever again.

                            Farooq Saab please note that majority of Hindu does not look at Muslim suspiciously .There are some Muslim who indulge in terrorist activity for which all Muslim are suspected by the general public.Also we have not heard any condemnation of Pandit massacre from your side which creat a doubt about your loyalty

                            why people like Farooq always talk the language of arrogance? they should be ashamed that why did the mughal emperors conquered and ruled India for 400 years and still their appetite is not over.  The Indian muslims are really human but these guys from north west or north are arrogant. They always try to trigger separatist attitude. if kashmiris does not want to be with India, let them go to pakistan or afganisthan where they belong to. Kashmir is India's pride.

                            Kashmir does not belong to Muslims. Kashmir belongs to Kashmiris and to Indians - all religions and cultures included. <br/><br/>
Stop bringing religion in to it.
