                            And Aamir, SRK and left thugs talk of "INTOLERANCE" and JNU students (thugs) talk of vitiated atmosphere etc etc. As the learned Rishis say "The character/nature of the father need not be passed on to the child... aidiot father may have a genius son(ashtavakra) and vice versa" That appears to be the case here. And NY times finds problems in India. Fcuk off amerigos. Aamir has still not moved out nor has srk. Both are shameless, spineless wonders. And NDTV will not give much exposure to this India.

                            @kpvidya1999: Aamir, make your stupid wife read this. And you too read this. This country in intolerant of thugs like you and that's why you are able to say all the non sense and are able to get away with this. You should be socially boycotted by everyone except for those few psuedo communals in Bollywood who are happy to get funds from underworld and but don't leave a chance to deride the country.
