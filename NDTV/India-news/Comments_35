                            ... and the Delhi police will pat him and give him some good food and then bail. While students are being kept in jail for some words which they might have not said!!! I love my India - where a nincompoop like Mr Bassi thrives!

                            All lawyers to be booked for assaulting the person who was under police custody. It is a clear case of taking law in their hands. Why these lawyer goons are not slapped with threat to life.

                            Wow if you are a brave heart by hitting and slapping a poor guy in police custody, charges of whom still to be proven in the court of law. Then who are those soldiers who are facing bullets on their chest at LOC so don't be opportunist if you want to prove yourself as Lion hearted then go to LOC and prove it.

                            No point blaming Delhi police on the whole for making a hero of this guy. The credit should go the commissioner only. He should better resign and join BJP. I don't think he will hesitate to go to any level for power. Not fit for civil service.

                            Look at his attire? It reminded me of a song from Bollywood Movie Krishan Kanaiah which went like ""suit boot mein aaya kanaiah band bajane ko "".And he literally came to do the Band Bajana of Delhi Police.

                            "Media channels are projecting me as a criminal but the allegations against me are yet to be proved" how ironic. He went ahead and beat somebody on charges which are still in court and not proven. On the other hand he wants media not to talk about him as charges are proven yet. Haha haha. This guy is buffoon and don't know the people who support him are equal or worse than him. Continue the fun guys. BJP has dished out entertainment . I guess it's Congress(budget session?) and AKs turn. Sorry mamtaji and left you guys need to wait for your turn. Who said our politics is boring. Grab popcorn and watch the fall of a great Country because of politically biased citizens of the once great civilization.
