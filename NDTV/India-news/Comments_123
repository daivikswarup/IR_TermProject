                            We should start reservation in cricket as well. For reservation people 4 will be considered as Six .Hitting over the ground will be 8 runs. Dont know whether it can be applied in International Cricket.

                            Time to End reservation for all. Treat everybody equal. Only economic backwardness should be the criteria for free education/food/clothes, even housing, yes even housing. No reservation in jobs or high tech institutions. Time to progress, time to move forward.

                            Lets hope good sense prevails. CM should ensure that no culprits, responsible for instigating violence and meaningless deaths are spared. Who can instigate the Jats, who are responsible for this mayhem other than Congress, which has always been playing this game of stoking fires since May 2014.

                            All those opposing JAT quota....either u oppose all quota or u look at the ground realities and not what media is projecting.......JATs as farmers are suffering and no one is paying heed to it.<br/>
Why are you after one community which has always stood against enemies through ages......<br/>
Sort out the grass root problem and they would never ask for a quota.........
