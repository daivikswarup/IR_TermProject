                            Clarification not required, we believe in our coast guards and our military, they sacrifice their life and they are above the pity politics. They deserve the award but bad media does not care, media only want TRP

                            Indian media and opposition party should learn from UK, USA and Germany they do not use matters of defence for TRP instead are together when it comes to protecting national interest. Anti national parties should learn from USA they were together on mission to capture Bin Laden. If it was done in India the media and the opposition will finish our country on this. Indian media is least matured in comparison to British or American media. In Britain neither BBC nor channel four will ever behave like our so called secular English media.

                            The English media should show some restraint while reporting any sensitive issues having mindless TV debates and trials just for TRP rating. Over enthusiasm leads to fodder for anti India establishments like Pakistan. Let the professional in the defence do their job in handling the affairs rather than foolish rhetoric by TV panelists. Look at BBC &amp; CNN reporting on national importance issues. Indian media creates sensestional news before the true facts are out and then drops it like a hot potato in few days.

                            Congress is not happy if India harms Pakistan as this will not make their vote bank happy. Congress will be happy if Pakistan hijacks Indian flights, attacks and beheads Indians as this will make their vote bank in India happy. This is true. in the batla encounter, congress leaders went and paid condolences so that they do not lose votes. Amazing seclarism.

                            Saddest day in the history of India. This is not a BJP vs Congress issue for heaven's sake. A suspecting vessel sinking itself is not a joke. Had it been USA or Germany or any other country in the world NOT even a single word would have been allowed on national security. Smugglers , robbers or terrorists anyone is a security threat on a border .  Congress is playing too dangerous politics. Not sure what it wants. Also BJP should NOT buckle under this pressure and should not reveal any information. Let congress shout.. they are anyways anti-Indians and have got their record verdict in every poll across the country. GOOD JOB Indian security!!

                            congress supports any one who is soft on terror from Pakistan. See teh Batla encounter. Congress leaders go and visit and pay their condolences. Congress is soft on terror and hence Indian defence has become weak. Thanks to the previous 10 years of congress rule, the defence forces and intellgence has become cripped and soft on terror.soft on terror means more votes for Indian secularism. This is true.

                            Minister is a liar. When BJP can't deliver on development they are creating nonsense. If I believe in the story I doubt on out preparedness to fight terrorism. BJP and their goons are the most patriotic then why don't they go and settle in NE states and Kashmir to prove their patriotism. Why only the Muslim do prove their loyalty to the nation.

                            No clarifricaiton is required. When the Nation's honour is at stake and no one wants anothdr 26/11, any suspicion or perceived suspicion is enough to nip the evil in the bud. The Congress has proved to be petty minded. I have seen in other parts of the world, the security and the police force have only one rule, first shoot and then ask questions. And this must be followed. Our Coast Guards have done a tremendous job and their loyalty is never at question despite having to work for different political masters at different times. Congress wake up.

                            Important points to be considered for not finding explosives in the boat.<br/>
1. Terrorists need not carry explosives. Explosives may be provided by local handlers<br/>
2. Explosives might have been thrown in to the sea.

                            The bigger question is what do you do? So they have tried to send terror boat and the plot was foiled. They have to sneak once. If you know terror boat was in touch with Paki military; this can not be business as usual. After an attack, they will deny again. I know India is not USA but USA would have some follow up action even if the plan was foiled and attack didn't take place. We are so weak, we just can't seem to know what to do.
