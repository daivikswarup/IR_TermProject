                            I don't understand this reservation thing at all. 69 yrs into independence and that is around 3 generations of Independent India who have had a taste of discrimination because of this nonsense which has been kept going on for sheer political gains by the governments. If the reservations idea was a great one, why have we not been able to elevate all those who enjoyed reservations. The criteria which establish an individual to be in need of a reservation must be reviewed and that is what Mr Bhagwat has said. Do Mulayam, Lalu, Azam Khan, Siddaramiah, Meira Kumar kind of families need reservation still? I guess not. A poor Brahmin kid in the hinterlands of India. Does he need reservation? I guess yes.  This is what Mr. Bhagwat is saying. Everyone else like this oaf Nitish is misinterpreting the statement to create fear in the minds of lesser informed ppl of India. Social media will bring social justice soon

                            Its that the 80% Indians want, but you are not bothered of that 80% Mr. Nitish Kumar. You will realize when they stop voting you and Congress. But the middle class and upper caste people have not learned any lesson in 65 years of caste politics and still voting you...shame on you!
