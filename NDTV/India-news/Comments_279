                            NDTV &amp; other LIBERALS should stand up for the freedom of expression of Mr. Chouhan. About his "alleged" involvement in physical violence act, law will address it. Is that not the standard protocol preached by all SECULAR LIBERALS whenever any SECULAR LIBERAL (Anti-BJP Anti-RSS) is involved in such act?

                            What I don't understand is that they being lawyers clearly know that everyone is considered innocent until proven guilty by the court of law, and everyone gets a fair trial and due process is followed, they also must be knowing that lawyrs never do slogan shoutin about any matter that is in court, they are being used as tools to destroy  our judicial system. Its pathetic that thy allowed themselves to be used like this in destroying the very institution they take oath to protect

                            India will begin to prosper only when Commies and Leftists are thrown out of the country.<br/>
All these Commies want is to distribute poverty and frustrations.They basically cry about everything.<br/>
They neither have the capacity to build industries or create wealth and jobs.<br/>
All countries have dumped their theories and moved on. We too must do so at least now.
