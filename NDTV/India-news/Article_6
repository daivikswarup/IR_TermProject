New Delhi:Â HighlightsWill respond to false charges against me in the house: Rahul Gandhi
Congress saw political opportunity in Rohit Vemula's death: Smriti Irani
Congress alleges Rohit Vemula was punished after pressure from Irani
                                A day after Union Minister Smriti Irani and others in the ruling BJP targeted him repeatedly, Rahul Gandhi has said he will give his reply in Parliament and the "entire country will know the truth."
Mr Gandhi told reporters: "The government has directed false allegations at me and my party. I will respond, soon, to every false charge."Yesterday, Smriti Irani launched a stinging counter-attack against the Opposition during the debate in the Lok Sabha on Rohit Vemula, the Hyderabad student who committed suicide last month, and the JNU students arrested and charged with sedition.She alleged that she had been targeted by the Congress because of her work in Amethi, Rahul Gandhi's constituency.
"Have you ever seen Rahul Gandhi go to one spot twice? Never. But in this, he saw political opportunity," said the minister.
Rohith Vemula, a 26-year-old research scholar, was found hanging at the Hyderabad Central University last month, days after he was banned from the hostel and other areas on campus for allegedly attacking an activist of the BJP-linked student group ABVP.
The Congress and other parties have alleged that Rohith was punished by the university because of pressure from Smriti Irani and another minister, Bandaru Dattatreya, who had asked for action against those who had attacked the ABVP activist.
A united opposition had also attacked the government over the arrest of JNU students on sedition charges over an event in support of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru earlier this month, when anti-India slogans were raised.
Smriti Irani targeted Rahul Gandhi for supporting the students and said: "Even Indira Gandhi lost power but her sons didn't support anti-India slogans."
