Patna:Â                             Refuting the opposition's allegation that Bihar was "returning to jungle raj", Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today said the state faced no problem that could be construed as an erosion of rule of law.
"There is a rule of law in Bihar and there is no problem of law and order," Mr Kumar told reporters in Patna.
The police have started to act against organised crime across the state and it is wrong to link "any crime" that is reported to the overall law and order situation, he said.
"We are committed to act against criminals involved in crimes and will not spare anyone."
His government is also committed to maintaining the rule of law at any cost, the chief minister said.
Crimes are being committed all around the country and the wider world, but what mattered is action against criminals, he said.
"I will not tolerate a police official who failed to take action against criminals after being informed about the crime. The government will take strict action against such police officials," Mr Kumar said.
He urged the public to inform and cooperate with the police if they are ever threatened by someone or received an illegal demand for money.
The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies have alleged that the state has been sliding into lawlessness ("jungle raj") since Nitish Kumar-led Grand Alliance of the Janata Dal-United, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress took office in November 2015.
