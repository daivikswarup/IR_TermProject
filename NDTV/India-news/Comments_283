                            It was an ABVP/ RSS Game.  Who Shouted -PAKISTAN ZINDABAD- in JNU? While some television channels, have portrayed JNU students as antinational, a video has surfaced that has gone viral over social media that shows identifiable ABVP students shouting PAKISTAN ZINDABAD slogans. Four students, who are seen in the video shouting -PAKISTAN ZINDABAD- slogans, have been identified as ABVP activists. One of them has been identified by name as Shruti Agnihotri, seen leading protests elsewhere in ABVP demonstrations. SO,  This is a purely RSS , ABVP ,  Hindutva obsession. ..//
