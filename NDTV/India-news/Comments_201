                            This doctored video's origin might be the brain from BJP party leadership. Before same type doctored video came in UP before the Lok Sabha Polls, and they politically gained. Here in JMU also same happened...  Didn't got much Political gain. i heard BJP spoke person telling in some channel debate its was fault of National TV Channel, they have to belive.. What an Idea...
