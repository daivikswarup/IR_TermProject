                            The Union Govt. will do well to cut the subsidies provided to JNU from Rs 240 Crore to Rs 120 Crore and use thus saved Rs. 120 Crore for the farmers in distress. Because these poor farmers are really the asset of India, because they can not speak English or have avenues like NDTV to voice their problems, because there is no vote bank, it is important to highlight this issue.
