                            Islamic terrorism has very wide and deep roots in pakistan. The military will protect its `benevolent' islamic terrorists from justice. Nawaz's utterance is probably due to his ear being pulled by the US ambassador.

                            NS is making right sound bites, it is difficult political situation in Pakistan, let's see what he does. We have strong Govt in India with huge mass support, this is the time for pakistan to come clean and be sincere and some progress in the bilateral relations could be made.

                            It is obvious to all that the Baccha Khan attack was engineered to deflect international attention from Pathankot. It is unbelievable that out of 3000 people who were apparently present then and with 'suicide bombers' all around, the casualty was only 21. Not that I wanted that the count should have been more, but the sudden appearance of the Army/Special Forces, raises suspicions<br/><br/>
The ploy gained transparency, when Air Marshal Javed, on that fateful day was at pains to explain that terrorism was not restricted to other countries alone, but Pakistan was a sufferer as well. It was a totally irrelevant remark to what the moderator on NDTV was asking him about

                            Your contradictory statements mean nothing will become of the matter. First get your story right before sending silly dossiers. You yourselves are uncertain over what happened in Pathankot yet expect Pak to take your nonsense with a straight face.

                            What does he mean by 'will'? Considering the cruel intentions of Papistan, the probe must have been completed even before the attack has happened.
