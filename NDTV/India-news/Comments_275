                            They are good at only taking digs and nothing else. No wonder either of the parties has no more than 10 seats in Lok Sabha! That's their standing in the country.

                            How many seats these parties won again in 2014?

                            Mayawati got zero and Yechury got 9 seats in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Yet both speak as though they were national entities! Go win some seats first and then talk. The CPM and BSP are third rate parties with fourth rate leaders. And specialise in talking nonsense.
