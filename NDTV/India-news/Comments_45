                            What anti terror operations ? <br/><br/>
Why do we lose so many soldiers ? <br/><br/>
Why can't they just use helicopter gunships to blast them off from a distance ? Ridiculous that so many elite soldiers die in these battles.<br/><br/>
We should be in a position where we outnumber , outgun and outmanoeuvre them.
