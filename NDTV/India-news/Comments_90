                            Shame on disgusting leftist media and congress who desperately tried to sway the perception of the people towards whole JNU episode and failed. Look at this hero and his father and the commitment they have towards the country!

                            Shame on all the sickuralists and presstitudes who were focussing on purpose on the lawyers actions instead of the anti-national sloganeering. India will never forgive you and forget you.

                            I am sorry to say, he died for nothing. No one will appreciate what your son has done or the cause he died for. People will support terrorists in the name of freedom of expression unfortunately.

                            We have many ultra nationalist Sanghi and Sathi in plenty in this Sangh Parivar ideology driven government rearing to go after the enemies to avenge the crime. Why we cannot do a terror to our enemy Pakistan.I think I.S.I. bribed the NAGPUR, the real rulers who hold the rein and prevented New Delhi to be proactive.
