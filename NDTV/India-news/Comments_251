                            Should this kind of information be Confidential? Why this information is disclosed to media and media is all over on adding how fragile our security is?

                            Why does NDTV need to publish this article?  Especially when it contains sensitive data on how the terrorists where detected. Common man does not need to know.

                            Brilliant men gave their lives for the security of all of us. My heart goes out to them and their families. May God give their loved ones strength to deal with this loss. India will look after them and stand by them, I hope and believe.

                            The fact is that Ajit Doval wanted to take credit using NSG which is not geared for securing a huge area. The NSG was being led by an IPS officer who has no clue. From its inception 31 years ago it has had 29 IPS officers as heads. What specialisation they have is anybody's guess. On the other hand 50,000 troops specialised in anti terror operations were available in the cantonment enemy's next to the base. The Army has been given the task of protecting the base in emergencies. Doval chose to sideline them so he could bask in the expected glory. It is time the Govt clearly delineates authority and responsibility for protection of Defence installations and leaves it to them. Keep the NSG for security of civilian targets. Disgraceful operation!

                            Read this, "The four terrorists referred to as Group 1 entered the air force base early on the morning of January 2 by scaling a 10-foot high wall topped with barbed wire. They were detected by thermal devices on surveillance aircraft only the next day, on January 3".<br/><br/>
Are we serious about national security.?

                            Can we ask our iaf commanders about the need to push in Garuds at night when NSG was present on site? The tactical decision of iaf commanders in counter terrorist ops must be looked into with seriousness. There are many show offs in such commanders.

                            "There were at least five air force officers were on the first floor; they had locked themselves into rooms and placed furniture against the doors as a bulwark. They were evacuated by commandos from the National Security Guard" five officers are air force officer but at least they get basic training while join air force should encounter 2 terrorists instead of hiding themselves. Don't want to degrade officers but it does sound embarrassing that they were hiding instead of fighting.

                            How can they say, "Air Men were Trapped". They are not civilians, Air men are well trained to handle the situation and I would say they were in the right place to fight the terrorists instead "TRAPPED"
