                            BK, this time we have assertive, nationalist Govt at the center, they will only take so much and then won't mind arm twisting. One couldn't trust Congressi govt, no one was in-charge and then we had Salman Khurshid as FM, he would have never done anything other than bhai-bhai, dialogue etc

                            All the evidence in the world is of no use if the will to use it is not there. Pakistan must wipe out all the terrorists and muslim extremists on its soil if it is to be considered a civilised nation. A tall order.
