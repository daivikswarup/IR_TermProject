                            As always the victim hood card is being played to garner sympathy. His father mentions that " his son is being singled out because he is a Muslim.". Now this itself is funny considering that the first person who was arrested is Kanhaiya Kumar who is a Hindu. So this argument of victimization falls apart. Secondly, there are clear videos available on Youtube which show him leading the anti-india slogans. Then where does the question of his religion come up.

                            The question arises whether this chap supported the anti-India slogans. If not, let him come out and name those who raised such slogans. If he does not know these people let him and Kanhaiya Kumar say that at that point they objected to such slogans. There are many witnesses who will give evidence if these two objected to anti- India slogans. Let all know the truth. More important, surrender before you are hunted down.

The tax payers are no fools to spend such a huge money on them and they abuse our country. If they feel that pakistan is better than us , they should be sent without any delay.<br/><br/>

                            One can understand the pain of a father particularly when the son has been sent to educate himself and not raise anti-India slogans, which has to be decided only by a court of law. Umar's father is right that he should surrender but his apprehensions about his son's security is not misplaced and the government should ensure that hooliganism should not replace rule of law just as anti-establishment should not be conflated with anti-national as some media channels are bent on doing. The JNU incident is among a series of incidence, starting with the Church attacks, to show the Modi government in poor light but there is also no doubt that the Modi dispensation's handling of certain incidents and events are questionable and inept. Thank god for the advent of social media that MSM is not having a free run on public opinion.

                            If you see/read the comments of the parents/relatives of any offender of law, may be in Nirbhaya case or this case, it has a remarkable similarity. First the offender is innocent and police has implicated him because of some grudge. After some proof comes to light then "We are shocked to hear this may be some friends have spoiled him". Once absconding then "we suggest that he should surrender to police". once goes to court they hire the best lawyers to defend him, and when convicted, the comment is "there is no justice in India ,this is a Banana republic"<br/>

                            Umar Khalid was the main organiser of the anti national event at JNU. He misled the administration on the pretext of organising a cultural programme. Now they claim that outsiders created the ruckus. How it is possible for outsiders to come without being informed/invited by the organisers. You cannot gather hundreds of outsiders at the appointed time without coordinating and networking. Umar's views at the time of event and subsequent discussions on TIMES NOW is a proof of his views and approach. Lets also note that he is not a student from Kashmir where people do have a different opinion on the issue of Afzal and Kashmir's status. He is an Indian Muslim from Maharashtra. It is disturbing that an M Phil student from Maharashtra has so much hatred against the country. He is not an innocent student but a M Phil Scholar. He is matured enough to understand the implications of his approach in which he is challenging the unity and integrity of the country. He is the one who started the fire. He cannot now scream the heat.

By the way look at the subject chosen by Kanhaiya lal-- PhD in social reform in South Africa? You are bloody cartoon, if you do not have ability to understand the social structure of place from where you come from i.e Bihar how is India or you going to benefit from studying affairs of South Africa? Just look at the present condition of Bihar in today's time. The poorest state despite producing so many civil servants. What have those Bihari Babu's done to develop your Bihar? Similarly, the study Kanhaiya lal-- is doing is share wastage of time, money &amp; no consequence to development Bihar or anybody or any country. By the way the crime rate has soared up in the poorer strata of society after end of apartheid in South Africa &amp; poor black kids do stunts on moving trains or commit crimes. They are trying hard to break barriers &amp; trying to integrate into mainstream public without help of any reservations in jobs or study. Indian Universities shall drop such bogus subjects for PhD, which are of no consequence yet provide opportunities to people like Kanhaiya lal to ensure his stay in university politics which shall graduate him to another lalu in making !

                            Mr.Qasim Ilyas, even Ishrat jahan was not terrorist as per few parties &amp; even few media channels &amp; as her family still not ready to accept this fact, and same card her family too played, the one you playing here, but fact is that your son "umar Khalid" is a a future terrorist in making. 100-150 calls traced were from J&amp;K in just 3 days before this anti national event. Intercepts deciphered point to same anti national events in 18 universities by your loving, innocent, thumb sucking kid "Umar Khalid". This is not just a sedition case, your terrorist son has to be thoroughly investigated by Intel agencies &amp; his handlers to be traced in pakistan. At least his reality to be unveiled &amp; true face to be shown to India.

                            Country in 1947 was divided on religious lines. From then on Muslim population in India increased and Hindu population in Pakistan and Bangladesh decreased. So who is the perpetrator. India should have taken a signed letter from the Muslims at that time or at least now that they will be peaceful and will not do any anti nation activities and will be punished if found so. Pakistan and Bangladesh can do the same with the Hindus living in those countries. Otherwise this will be a perennial problem for the country.
