New Delhi:Â                             A thorough investigation will be conducted into the violence during the Jat quota row in Haryana, Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu today said.
"Please don't indulge in unnecessary politics. There will be investigation on this (reason for a peaceful protest turning violent)," he said in the Lok Sabha during Zero Hour.
His response came after Congress and INLD members demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the Jat stir and its fallout.
Significantly, Naidu heads committee which is going into the issue of reservation for Jat community which was constituted soon after the stir last week.
Earlier Dushyant Chautala of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) said Haryana is burning as harmony in the state has been destroyed by some vested interests.
He alleged that a member of this house has been instigating the agitation and demanded a judicial inquiry into the entire affairs starting from the peaceful protest on February 19 to clamping of curfew in 11 districts and thereafter.
He also said that the government should give Rs. 25 lakh compensation to the family of the victims who died in violence and a government job to one of the family members.
Congress lawmaker Deepender Singh Hooda also demanded an independent and impartial investigation headed by a Supreme Court judge in a time bound manner.
The state government cannot wash its hands off this episode, he said.
