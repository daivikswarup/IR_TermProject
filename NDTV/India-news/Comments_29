                            It was one honest cop who made a strong case against him. In spite of all that he spend just few months in the jail. He 'just' took AK-47 from his 'terrorist' friends who carried out 13 bomb blasts and killed hundreds of innocent Indians. He sat in his home like a coward even when he knew about the conspiracy. These are the heroes for Indians, way to go India!

                            Sanju baba still does not understand his case. He is not a terrorist. If he was he would have got life or death penalty. He was jailed for abetting a terror attack and for allowing his house to be a godown for bombs and providing logistics to terrorists despite being full aware of who they were.

                            How to call a person who illegally acquires AK47 when he already had a weapon for self protection and that too cooperating with terrorists?  Even interpretation of law is different for different people; why would such a person not be encouraged to make all such utterances?  What is the great service he has rendered to the nation other than making money for himself by making movies like Munna bai which will only encourage others to adopt such means to achieve their ends.  It is surprising that the judiciary also is not showing the same interest in granting relief to similarly placed others!  God save this country!

                            Shame on the part of the government to release him in advance. In every state there are many convicts who gave completed their jail terms, bit not released till date, reason unknown. This person was released in advance by state govt, a case investigated under TADA act, saud to be the most henious  act. Rajiv Gandhi killer's - only involved, not a killer have completed their life terms, which is for a period of 14 years. Why the centre, judiciary is not allowing them to go free though completed their terms, even after the directly affected family has pardoned. Decisions on certain  person is purely based on the public support they can generate not based on law prevailing in the country , rules and regulations.
