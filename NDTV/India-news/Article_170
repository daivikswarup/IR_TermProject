Srinagar:                             Curfew has been imposed in several areas of Srinagar in the wake of a strike call by separatist groups in protest against the killing of two civilians in firing by security forces yesterday. Train service has also been suspended as the Railways fear trouble.
Shaista and Danish, both college students, were killed after security forces opened fire during clashes with protesters in Pulwama district of south Kashmir. 14 other civilians were also injured in the firing.
Officials say condition of one of the injured is stated to be critical.
The protests erupted on Sunday afternoon after a gun battle between security forces and terrorists at Kakpora village in which one terrorist was killed.
Police say a probe has been ordered to ascertain the circumstances that led to the killing. Doctors say both the victims had bullet wounds above their waist.
Police sources say the crowd was throwing stones at security forces when they opened fire. A senior police officer claimed that while Danish was killed during clashes, Shaista was killed in crossfire between holed up terrorists and security forces.
The locals however allege that security forces started firing indiscriminately after protests in the area.
