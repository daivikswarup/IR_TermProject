                            I think BJP has better chance to come in power to NE and southern India thn in Bihar.  Atleast ppl in these regions are educated and don't vote based on Yadav and Muslim lines,.

                            Everyone know this will happen. Sooner or later Lalu will side line Nitish and ally with congress. RJD + congress needs 15 more seats, not big deal for mastermind lalu. I feel bad for Nitish kumar, he is an honest man but lalu used him like toy and did grand comeback in politics. Now Bihar will know past 10 years development was not just coz of Nitish, it was Nitish + BJP.

                            why no one comments on this issue?. It Modi is not blamed for rasing the crime in Bihar? When someone was killed in UP for some meat issue, everyone cried and shouted. Why there is no noise now?. RJD - Lallu's two sons are Ministers in Bihar.. His Wife and Daughter will be RS MP soon... what a leader and what a support from Nitish?
