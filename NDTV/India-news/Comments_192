                            Shameful, JNU has become hiding place of conspirators and terrorists collaborators! It should change its name from JNU to Huriat University!

                            At JNU, We have provided a place for seditious Leftist and Islamic terrorists to train. Either the JNU should be disbanded or the Faculty and students should be thrown out lock stock and barrel. How will democracy survive if such anti national activities are allowed in the heart of national capital? Tolerant people should answer.

                            All these Anti-Nationals should be sacked from JNU and sent home, and an FIR should be lodged against them for sedition and anti-National activities.
