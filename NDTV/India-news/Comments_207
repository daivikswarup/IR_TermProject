                            Oh they have to follow the procedure, buy the lawyers/thugs who beat up journalists and students can go scot free and hold victory rally? The judges typically have a privileged upper caste background and a particular kind of political sensibility, sort of reactionary mindset. Dalits who have been killed in a massacre frequently don't get justice, even if there are convictions, they are set aside by the higher courts. But if upper caste people are massacred, then it is a different story, then it becomes about terrorism and national security - it is seen through a different prism. If you have a lot of  money like Salman Khan, then the justice system is like a piece of cake for you, if not you are at the mercy of the police.

Court order was very clear in where the fault lies.It is up to the accused students to co-operate with authorities and prove their innocence,instead of taking support of opportunistic politicians who have no standing in Indian political scene.Some of them have even never stood or won any elections in spite of describing themselves as leaders of the party.<br/>
What students did was clearly wrong.If you say you cant be held responsible for actions/slogans of fringe group of students who took part in your event,then Modi &amp; co cannot be held responsible for actions of fringe groups of lawyers.<br/>
If you cant take responsibility to control the crowd then don't organise such events in the first place!!!

If the police are unable to protect arrested individuals when they are in custody and brought to court - and when goondas turn our courts in our nation's capital into Kangaroo courts where they dispense mob justice and police and judges sit back and watch - then students are certainly right in asking that they be arrested in special conditions.<br/><br/>
Can the police give any assurance that if the students surrender, they will be protected from mob violence? If they cannot, they why are the courts pretending as if we are a nation with rule of law...
