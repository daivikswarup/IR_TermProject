                            Ms Smriti don't you understand even a blank letter from HR is serious and intimidating to VC or professor?? Owaisi is ABVP extension.<br/>
What about college student being abused by HR minister!! Don't feel only you have emotions and ego.

                            But WHO Made the Slogans ? Any Answers from anyone yet ? U heard the slogans but from whom ? <br/>
Rahul Gandhi went to JNU. But PM went to Pak and then got Pathankot !!!<br/>
MLAs have time only to count Condoms....What will now the Family planning dept do ? Does he not have anything better to do ?<br/>
Pak flag raised in J&amp;K while the Coalition of Govt and the central govt. looked on ?<br/>
Various ailing issues in Education....but why did u remember them only NOW. Why was it kept under the wraps for the last two years......shocking.<br/>
Can One evil be a justification for another evil ?<br/>
U and various ministers exhort Indian Citizens to go to Pakistan....Why ?<br/>
Ur police was an onlooker at the desecration of the Court, the temple of justice. Why ?<br/>
They took no action against those who broke the constitution, the supremecourt orders and against those who attacked the innocent citizens and media to stifle democratic voice. WHY ?

                            So much applause for speech !! Usual  brazen typical BJP style .No-one in the BJP ever admits to making  mistakes ....Even when they make mistakes, they are slimy enough to wriggle out of it. and they form a mutual admiration  society and congratulate each other ....A world of difference between the young victim of SmritiIrani and  herself. From his letter we see a noble soul  but a soul in torment because of his having been born  in India into a Dalit  family.You can see his nobility from his saying  no one is responsible for his death !!!! He could have blamed the govt , he could have blamed the cruel Hindu religion , he could have blamed the college authorities and the Minister....!!!Contrast his nature with that of Smriti and her BJP gang....Even in the trauma and tragedy of his death ,they want to hide under his SUICDE NOTE as though it proves their innocence ..Everyone knows she  drove him to take the extreme step.?..It is she  who is trying to politicise the issue trying to put the blame on others.....She believes that OFFENSIVE IS THE BEST FORM OF DEFENCE....just like her master....They will give fiery speeches......and divert the people from the current issue and talk about Rahul,Sonia,Dynasty rule etc...they want to destroy JNU  because it bears the name of Nehru.....What cheap games they play......
