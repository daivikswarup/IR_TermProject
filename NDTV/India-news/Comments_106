                            Rahul Ji should bring a law that will allow dalit and minority students to beat non dalit, upper cast students whenever they need to vent. The law should guarantee that no retaliate will be tolerated and any retaliation should be punished.

                            INDIA will ultimatey become just as it's in USA,most white americans have left Miami where Cuban thugs with BLACK PANTHER run havoc. cars will be hijacked, properties will be vandalized and daughters will be raped is the writ of the day.police donot want to come because few white cops are afraid they will be lynched.same as WASHINGTON dc , WHERE BALCKS openly can mug business, grope white girls in school and loot local shops.CHICAGO, name should be changed to black muslims who declare the sharia openly. There are 18 cities where safety and security are nonexistent. where will we go as BROWN ?

                            RaGa wants only divisions in India in the name of "Vividhta mein ekta". This man has only one mission and that is to break India. He cares for nothing but breaking India into multiple pieces and if possible become king of Amethi. I request students to not even listen forget about thinking about what he says. Also I fail to understand the system where there is "Special Reservation" for some and we are asked to say that we have a fair and equal system. Also when did suicide become a commendable deed. I wonder had the Bhagat Singh, Khuridarm Bose, Azad had chosen that path. Or may be RaGa and his likes consider them as terrorists. If Rohith Vemula is popularized in India for what he did it will send out a wrong message to our coming generations be the still divided as Dalits and Non Dalits. SUICIDE = Give Up without a fight. NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN FORCE ANYONE TO COMMIT SUICIDE and Glorification of this is the last thing that anyone should do. If such is done then you know what the person, party are after. It is equal to instigating social unrest and such people must be put behind bars and finally brought to justice

                            At least one wise statement by Raga for a change: the idea of India with multiple ideologies and voices!

                            Where were you Mr. Rahul Gandhi during the protest against Nirbhaya Kand? We missed you a lot then. And why are you and Kejriwal so up against the government? The Delhi police has made only arrest inside the university campus. Till now they have shown utmost restraint. They have not used any force to arrest the other students. Still you call it a government crackdown on students! Further why don't you tell the students that it was during your rule that Afzal was hanged. After the Supreme Court Order his mercy petition was rejected by the President of India. Which party the President belonged to?

                            This family has never ever thought an ounce about India; it is a party interested only and only in appeasing anyone and everyone for votes and corruption. Don't believe in a one party rule like China but definitely a system where Khangress is non-existent.

                            Why such incident not earlier? Because Congress didnt have time for such bullsheet as they are ruling. Now they have no other work left so just raising such issue.
