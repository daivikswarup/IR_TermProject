                            India should wriggle out of any commitments to talks. Isi and Pak Army are clearly not committed and it is foolish to follow your heart. It is best to up the ante as soon as possible,  presence of Nawaz Sharif notwithstanding.

                            Routine , inconclusive excersize going to last forever with gurantted no outcome.<br/><br/>
- Terrorist attack happens in India with support of. pakistan army and ISI<br/>
- Indian citizens and army persons get killed<br/>
- government give big statements and dialogue with Pakistan derails<br/>
- Indian government gives proof to Pakistan of its involvement<br/>
- other countries show sympathy and give advise to Pakistan<br/>
- Pakistan ask for more proofs <br/>
- nothing happens , dialogues starts again<br/>
- Another terrorist attack happens in India with help of Pakistan army and ISI<br/><br/>
Cycle repeats..<br/><br/>
Unless government takes military action inside Pakistan , nothing will change. India is so soft it has become immune to terrorist attacks

                            The pakistani military will not permit the `benevolent' islamic terrorists  - lashkar i tayaba, jamaat dawa etal - which it nurtures and sustains to be brought to justice. India must fully understand this and take measures. 1) pakistan must be put under international sanctions and 2) It must be destroyed as a state and balkanized.This is vital in the interests of peace in the region and beyond.

                            When Pakistan is unwilling to take action against terrorists there, no amount of evidence will be sufficient. When Pakistan was asked to provide voice samples of JeM terrorists, the Pakistan court said there was no law that required the providing of such samples! With such an attitude, the only option is strong arm tactics which is the only language they understand. Even the killing of hundreds of students in Pakistan does not open their eyes. Violence resulting in destruction of terrorist camps seems to be the answer. The Indian government would be very foolish indeed to pursue any type of talks or CBMs till some significant damage is inflicted upon Pakistan. In Pakistan all wings of the government, including the army and the judiciary are complicit in terrorism. Therefore there is no chance of them responding to any other stimulus except violence.

                            We will never learn from their previous responses. Will we? How many more defense personnel have to sacrifice their life for sloppy diplomacy and unresponsive government? Are we still supposed to believe those terrorists (Pakistan army and govt) and take their word?

                            They *need* evidence from Indian intelligence - so that the next time they plan their attacks better, and next time they won't leave any such "evidence" behind that ties the attack back the country where it was planned.

                            Pakistani officials had already indicated that phone numbers furnished by India that were called by the terrorists before they were killed in Pathankot are not registered in Pakistan. ???????????? Is Indian taking their word. Did in return India not ask for evidence of that?
