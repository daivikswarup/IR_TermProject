New Delhi:Â                             Members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) today staged a protest at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) demanding expulsion of students who went ahead with a protest march on the campus against hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, despite withdrawal of permission by university authorities.
"How can an event on Afzal Guru, who attacked the temple of democracy, be organised here. We are demanding expulsion of those who organised it," said JNU students' union (JNUSU) joint secretary Saurabh Kumar, who is the only ABVP member in the union. The university authorities had cancelled the protest march yesterday "fearing" that it might "disrupt" peace on the campus.
However, the organisers later claimed they went ahead with the programme despite the cancellation of the permission and held a cultural programme, art and photo exhibition on the issue rather than a protest.
Members of ABVP, BJP's students outfit, gathered outside the Vice Chancellor's office and shouted slogans terming yesterday's event by a group of students as "anti-national" and demanding their "expulsion" from the university.
