                            Mr. hyper-nationalist minister, heros are made when people who strive for freedom of speech and expression are attacked and jailed by the state. in that sense the AISF leader is truly a hero. But it is not the media who made him a hero, it is the state. Just like how the British made Gandhi a hero and how the Taliban made Malala a hero. On supporting Afzal Guru, your party talks of building a temple for the murderer of the father of our nation! Even he was found guilty by court and his mercy plea was rejected by the president. Still your party proudly supports him. Now, what right do you have to question people supporting Afzal Guru?

                            It is now becoming clear thE videos and photos are fake and morphed by some mischief mongers and a big goof up by the establishment. Truth prevails

                            Here comes another one...why can't the government accepts the mistake and apologies. It will set a great example rather than justifying one mistake after another

                            Moohn mein Ram Ram Bagal Mein Chhuri. The typical doublespeak. For them Baliyan, Mahesh Sharma are the heroes. OP Sharma and Vikram Chauhan are the new heroes. Wait and watch how they are rewarded

                            An expose of the genetic modification of unsuspecting JNU Students with imported ultra-leftist and leftist dreams.......<br/><br/>
India won 2014 against corruption.......In future India will always win against anti-nationals, thanks to the JNU exposure........<br/><br/>
Thank you youtube and free sources in Internet, though the majority of Indian bail-out media wanted to suppress the anti-national activities.......<br/><br/>
Other Indian Students in JNU - beware of your environment.......

                            Sir hero's are like diamonds. Their sparkles do not hide even if they are deep hidden in the coal.<br/><br/>
Same is with Kanhaiya Kumar. He is MY HERO. And yes i did not get influenced by Twitter, FB, QUora to decide what i believe. I have made Kanhaiya my Hero after 'Critical Analysis'..The same 'Critical analysi' which Kanhaiya wants every youth to bring in his life. The same 'Critical Analysis' your bhakts and paid trolls lack.<br/><br/>
Kanhaiya is HERO because he represents the 90% population of POOR, Labourers, Dalits, Womens, Muslims who are oppressed on daily basis because of who they are. Kanhaiya has shown to the WORLD how cruel RIGHT wing can become if we talk about our rights..Kanhaiya rightly said "inki Polpatti khul jaayegi dosto agar buniyaadi sawal par baat karna shuru kardenge toh"..<br/><br/>
BJP+RSS ki POLPAATI khul gayi hai sir. Hum dekh rahe hai ki aap GARIB ka kaise DAMAN karte ho.
