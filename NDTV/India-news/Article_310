New Delhi:Â                             The family of Dalit student Rohith Vemula, who committed suicide in Hyderabad, on Wednesday urged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to provide a government job to his younger brother.
"Rohith's mother requested the chief minister to provide a government job to the brother as the family does not have any source of income," a Delhi government official said.
"Kejriwal assured the family their demand will be sympathetically considered," the official told IANS. The Delhi cabinet is likely to take a decision on the issue later Wednesday.
Rohith Vemula committed suicide on January 17 after he and four other Dalit students were suspended in Hyderabad University following an alleged clash with a leader of BJP's student wing ABVP.
The suicide triggered nationwide protests. Vemula's family refused to accept compensation offered by the government.
