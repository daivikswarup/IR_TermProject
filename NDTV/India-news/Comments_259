                            Rather than claiming victimhood and shooting in the dark, Modiji should comeout with concrete evidence and name those NGOs and groups in public.

                            There is definitely an amount of truth in this and the fact that people will get discomforted if their mal-practices are questioned. What Modi mentioned is a very natural behavior and is true.<br/>
We have not seen any rallies against the report card presented by Government for its 1 year of functioning. If these people have to,  challenge the work done and highlight the gaps that can be fulfilled in cooperative way rather than unproductive  morchas and leg pulling.

He doesn't practice what he preaches. He is playing his chai-wala card again. Seeking details of NGO is good as NGOs should be transparent but why this differential treatment? What happened to his promise of 15Lac for each house in 6monthd of him becoming PM? Shouldn't BJP disclose all the details of their donations and fund raising too? Why not disclose the names of all crooks who saved looted money in Swiss banks? Why demanding transparency only from NGOs or select few? That just shows there is no determination or will power to go beyond a talk-fest.

Your party has been building up controversy after controversy like beef issues, distorting history, saffronizing every possible area - let it be education, arts, literature &amp; etc., dividing in the name of religion &amp; what not!!!<br/><br/>
It is clear that 'violence', 'suppression' is the BJP mantra for POWER. May be there a very few good men left in BJP, who will also surely quit BJP in the coming days because of embarrassment. <br/><br/>
It is really good that BJP's Divide &amp; Rule policy has finally brought UNITY among 90% of the Indians and this party's days are truly numbered!!!<br/><br/>
There has been literally nothing for the common man until now from this government. They have taken away the peace of mind of one and all!!!<br/><br/>

                            No wonder why India is backward. No where in the world left ideology is alive except China. Remember all left lovers what happened to student movement of civil leberty in China. No communist country in world has civil liberty. And JNU promoting left ideology. Is this good use of tax payers money to promote dead ideology?

                            Sir,You are right , it is human   natural behavior that looters will go against you  if you ask accounting of money comes from foreign but will take at least 10 years to clean the corruption and control the NGO`s.<br/><br/>
even i also tried to resign my job and start the NGO in AP as i was offered my foreign friend but my ethics did1t allow me to loot easy money.<br/>
In India most of NGO`s are cheating and looting the good people of the world.<br/>
we will support you and i feel as long as opposition is disturbing yu are going get more vote<br/>
But why GST to help corrupted states like Bihar,west bangal, UP to get more money from central government and really hard working states like Maharashtra,tamil nadu ,Gujarat,Karnatak to loose their money so I wont support GST

                            This is not unexpected after the dynasty's heir going on sabbatical. God knows how many anti-chaiwallah have been planted. Chaiwallah has to understand that good amount of Government servants had worked when dynasty was in place and he has lot many dynasty's friends inside his party itself.Though there are disappointments on chaiwallah, still he has great and sincere ambition for the country unlike dynasty who eye only their dynasty.(Exception Rajiv Gandhi.Heart still cries for him.) Expected AK to be substitute for chaiwallah but utter disappointment which shows he is also a ex-dynasty government servant.
