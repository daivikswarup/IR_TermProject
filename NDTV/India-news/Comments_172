                            Why dont the JNU students go and ask the terrorists to join in their protests? If the BJP lawyers come to attack them, they can straight away blow them up.

                            I am sure DUSU will support this strike against the CRPF and the media channels will play cheer-leaders along the sidelines.

                            Could you please also mention terror attack by who - the secular force of India? You always mention when any attack happen by other segment of the society - even when the attack happen to protect their nation.

                            What if a soldier says I go by the definition of jnu and paid media and gives a green channel to these terrorists? Point is, there can't be two definitions for anti-nationalism; one for India Army and other for Kanhaiyya Kumar.

                            The other day I saw the Discovery Documentary LINE OF CONTROL about the highly demanding and challenging job of Indian Army against Pakistan and infiltration.  Thank God, ppl don't ask the Politicians/these so called JNU brigades to protect the border. Sure the whole country would be destroyed. <br/>
The commanding Job done by the Army despite sacrificing their family, life needs to be well appreciated. <br/>
Jai Jawan and Jai Kisan is well written Phrase for India. Both are 2 eyes of the nation.

                            The CRPF were ambushed while travelling in their bus making them very easy targets.This happens with sad regularity. It is sad that after all these years,why we cannot provide the forces with buses and transport outfitted with basic protective armour and bullet -resistant glasses.When we can spend billions on big weapon systems, it should not be an issue  to procure them in large numbers.

                            I am surprised JNU students have not come out in support of the terrorists yet. I am surprised how the likes of some prominent Writers have not yet written articles justifying the death of our soldiers
