                                In a major embarrassment for the ruling Grand Alliance in Bihar, the police have booked an RJD legislator for allegedly raping a minor. After initial investigations, the police say they will now move to arrest Nawada MLA Raj Ballabh Yadav.
A minor girl reported to the Nalanda district police on February 6 that a woman named Sulekha Devi took her an undisclosed place about 15 km away from the district headquarters, Bihar Sharif. The woman forced her to have liquor after which she was allegedly raped by a man, later identified as legislator Yadav, the girl said. All this while Devi was present there, the minor alleged in her complaint to the police.
Devi then gave the girl Rs. 30,000 but she went home and informed her parents about the incident who approached the police. Initially, a case was registered against Devi. During police investigations, when the minor girl was taken to the site of the crime, it was found to be the RJD's legislator's house. She also identified Yadav as the man who allegedly raped her.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Shaleen, who supervised the investigation, said he has ordered Yadav's arrest.  This is not the first time the MLA has been charged in a criminal case, sources said.
The RJD is the majority partner in the Nitish Kumar-led Grand Alliance government in the state. The RJD regime in the state from 1990 to 2005 is often called 'the years of lawlessness' by the opposition in Bihar. Of late, the BJP-led opposition has alleged that the days of lawlessness have returned under Mr Kumar.
