                            Poor police man paying price for CM and BJP incompetency? Even army struggled, then what can a few police do?

                            I dread to think how everyone (especially our great bhakts) would have reacted had this been done by a mob of muslims. "where's the malda report" - whatever happened to those questioners?

                            I spoke to one of the police officials  on panipat delhi highway on saturday. They had no arms, no lathis nothing. He said they were asked to deposit all the arms lathis and they did not have orders to do any thing. And all these goons loaded on bikes were patrolling the highway armed with laths. The Police was being a mere spectator while whole state was being ransacked.

                            Saini is the main culprit behind this violence. Both Punjabis and Jats are the hardest working communities in Haryana. Punjabis have always been target of conspiracy, always - just because of people like this 'Saini'. Khattar who is a Punjabi CM is a very honest man and people even from Jat community like him for all thehonest work he is doing. But Saini projected issue of least importance and for last 2 years he was spewing hatred against Jats. Just because of Jat community , Haryana always remained a protected State. Moreover, the border is protected by Armymen mostly from JAt community. All the Asian Games medal glory- credit goes to Jat athletes. But people like Saini survive by creating such conspiracies...after all he knows for whom he is working for.

                            I wonder if Jats are oppressed and need reservation. Rather they rule the state. It is that Non-Jats need reservation and protection both.It is extremely saddening to see how even schools were completely ransacked not to undermine everything else that was destroyed. The destruction in the name of agitation can never be forgotten.

                            Its unfortunate that the reported dehumanizing rapes on the highway have been hushed up. No body, it seems, is investigating the matter. This shocking happening of vandalism, rioting and arson is being pushed under the carpet both by the state as well as the center
