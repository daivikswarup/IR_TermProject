In court, Mr Kanaiya Kumar said: "On the 9th February 2016, there was an unfortunate incident which occurred at my prestigious university and I condemn it. After watching videos obtained from different sources, I have found out that in JNU, some JNU people and some others were raising anti-national slogans. <br/>
I do not support those anti-national slogans and I would like to appeal to you that in matters like these, the country, our society and universities should not disturb the peace."<br/><br/>
Thanks a lot.

                            Mr. Kejriwal,<br/>
I do have few questions for you. I humbly request you to answer these. These questions are asked as a Common man.<br/><br/>
1. Students have right to speak but do they have right to go abusing honorable PM of India also?<br/><br/>
2. Is abusing in public a freedom of speech? Shouldn't there be any limitation?<br/><br/>
3. Isn't it moral responsibility of students to study and not do politics?<br/><br/>
4. Why you always keep highlighting keywords like Dalit, Poor? Arn't all students are just student rather than from any caste or religion?<br/><br/>
5. Shouldn't reservation should be based on economic status rather than caste and religion? If a person from reserved caste/religion is well to do now, should they still be availing reservation? If a person from unreserved category is starving/poor, shouldn't they get reservation to move forward?<br/><br/>
6. How many times you had met Rohith before his death? Why did not you tried supporting him earlier, rather than just raising voice after his death?<br/><br/>
7. Why did you not choose to visit Malda? Do you support, what happened in Malda or you just visit to only people from specific caste/religion?<br/><br/>
8. Leave educational institutions to educationalists. - Then what are schools? Why are you interfering in their matter?<br/><br/>
9. Do you think anything (bad) happens in country is because of PM? Do you really think our PM has so much spare time to do these things, despite being so hectic schedule every day?<br/><br/>
10. If students get together, they will shake your chair in such a manner that you will not forget - Why are you talking in a threatening language in democratic country. Let people decide during general elections. Shouldn't you be respecting Indian people mandate and let govt function for 5 years without disruption?<br/><br/>
11. Government seems to be at war with students - Oh is it? Is it the perception of few students or all students of country? Can you please prove this with some tangible statistical trustworthy data?<br/><br/>
12. Everyone is unhappy with this government - If you say everyone, I assume each and every Indian citizen. Being Indian citizen I am not unhappy, then why talking on behalf of all Indians? Is Arvind Kejriwal voice of country?<br/><br/>
13. Today they (government) are distributing certificates of patriotism - I don't think so. Normal people like me are not certified by Govt for patriotism, but still I am and no one can deny that. Can you assure all you AAP members are honest and no one has done anything wrong before in their life? Or joining AAP is certificate of being honest?<br/><br/>
14. They will beat up anyone and say he was raising anti-India slogans - How many people are beaten up? Taking one or two incidents and making it generic, is this not bad? What happened in Khirki extn, where your minister branded few women making derogative comments? Should this be taken as your practice?<br/><br/>
15. Quote me a statement from Govt saying Nathuram Godse is patriotic, Mahatma Gandhi, is anti-national, <br/>
All goons are patriotic. If you can't you should apologize. You have no rights to spread lies.

                            Once gain ndtv gives great prominence to the ravings of a hate filled pathological liar who can even support anti-national activities for political gain. Being a dalit dont confer unlimited freedoms to the people of India to question the judgement of the supreme court duly delivered after a long recourse to appeals in all lower courts. Are we saying that dalit students have the right to question the supreme court? what next? the constitution? If this dalit scholar was so concerned that being suspended would hurt his family then why did he not confine himself to his studies??<br/>
The current misrepresentation by certain sections of the media and the public for political gain is seriously hurting the country and now is the time to come together putting personal ambitions and egos aside to resolve differences for the betterment of the country. Simply rabble rousing is counter productive.
