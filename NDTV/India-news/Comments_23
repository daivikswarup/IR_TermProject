To introduce Sharia laws in Mallapuram in Kerala is democracy. To abuse India openly and ask for disintegrating the country is democracy. To feel proud of Jihadi Afzal, Jihadi Yakub &amp; Jihadi Ishrat is democracy.

                            @Chamanjheenga: Modi is Feku and Rahul, kejriwal is very honest. Look, these people arranged an event together. All of them have different stories which means each has cooked up his own story. Only Modi could corner these people. The afzal event in question, has been organized since 2013. The congress government in power at that time could not control it because they feared the backlash the BJP is receiving now. In short they were spineless towards such events. Modi will have none of this, no nation bashing under the garb of freedom of speech. You criticise Modi on issues but not on these issues. Afzal Guru was hanged under law, so no one can question it. Questioning supreme court order on terrorists is disrespecting democracy,law and order and the armed forces. Afzal guru case was ON for nearly 8 years. For 8 years of detailed investigation and based on the circumstantial evidence he was hanged. How can students question it? Universities should be a place for free speech and conscience awareness where matters of social and economic relevance should be debated upon not such terrorists. By the way, their is a video on youtube in which by his own words Afzal has accepted his crime. Is this evidence not sufficient for the organisers of the event? Meanwhile we have textbooks in bengal schools which profess pro=afzal sentiments. These textbooks were released during the UPA rule with Kapil sibal's signature as minister. FYI, Afzal was hanged during congress rule and students are protesting against a decision of congress government but the same students have accepted the support of congress leader Rahul and Rahul is agreeing to the sentiments of the students. So in a way, Rahul and congress is contradicting in their own stand. Shouting FEKU, PAPPU will not help the country. Shutting down such anti-national activities and obliterating the people who profess such ideas will help the country. And stop calling these people has students and children, with this act these people have marched far ahead of being a student.

In fact that loser Umar Khalid was even seen debating on a TV channel where he said, "one or two judges of Supreme Court can't decide the fate of Afzal Guru". That is the kind of respect he has for the constitution. At least now he will have a good taste of Indian judiciary.
