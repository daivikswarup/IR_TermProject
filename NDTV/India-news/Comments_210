                            BJP / RSS workers and MPs committing suicide is a fashion the country wants to see happen. Enough of hate mongering. It is time we go back to living in peace like we were until 2 years back!

                            I wont be surprised if BJP says this: "Farmers are anti-national because they are committing suicide to malign modi government". I also wont be surprised if bjp supporters concur with it and fight with others on social media as to why they are supporting anti-nationals like farmers who r committing suicide for fashion...
