                            At least some one dared to speak against them.My request to haryana/centre government, form a high power commite like they have formed for jat reservation for assessment of loss of personal property by these agitators which should have daily meeting and briefing to the public like the they are doing for jat reservation.Recovery should be made from these jats only.

                            I fully agree with him. There is no justification for quotas for communities like Jats, Meenas, Patels, Kapus and other communities since they are economically and politicallly strong. The whole issue of reservationd for all sundry is because of foolish poll promises made by the poltical parties of all hues. The compensations and other doles for destruction properties are to be recovered from all the parties starting from the one who first promised them.

                            This is worse than 1984 riots. Thousands of people have lost their rozi roti due to violence by Jats. I am staunch BJP supporter from Haryana but still I believe that Haryana CM has completely failed.  I urge media to show what destruction , loot was done by these Jats. Non-Jats have been targeted throughout the state.

                            Mr. Saini could be described as rarest of rare politician. I am not against reservation, but reservation to Jats and Patels are unfathomable. Hats off Mr. Saini for your courage to call a spade spade.

                            What he has said is right. Most important please make JATS pay for 35000 Crores estimated loss to industry and also to railways, roads, transport damaged by these goondas and also the severe problem Delhi people are facing because of water issues before any meeting is initiated by govt. Let someone file a PIL on this in SC. Just once if SC supports then no one will dare to destroy property next time in any kind of protest. Make a rule: Compensate for damages done and then discussion or implementation starts.

                            Saini is mad castiest and selfish person, and BJP will be better without him. Most Jats are very poor and not even able to pay school fees for their children or pay for medical treatments. They are running losses in crops due to natural calamities and man-made manipulation of prices.Corruption is making them further poorer. Jats in all states have reservation, why one state should discriminate against them. Good nature and not asking upto now should not be punished. Haryana has been most peaceful hust because Jats are undemanding people.

                            Jats are in OBC in all the neighbouring states. Were in Haryana too but bcose of internal congress politics cost them in court.<br/><br/>
As far this rajkumar saini is concern , to more he will speak the more damage he will do to his followers. Ppl should ask where were he and his OBC brigade for last 10 days.<br/><br/>
Jats have decided to take back this quote come what may. This time it will not restrict to Haryana alone.

                            He is absolutely right. If anyone uses violence to meet any political purpose, it is defined as terrorism. The jat agitation was no different. For using violence their demand should not even be considered. For ever.
