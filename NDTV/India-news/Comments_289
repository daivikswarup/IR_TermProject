RSS has always been against democracy, and wanted Manusmriti to be the constitution of India, so that the upper castes could forever rule the "lower castes".

BJP Home minister claims protest is handiwork of Hafeez Syed (without knowing its a fake tweet), Bassi claims it a minor event and everyone studying at JNU is termed anti-national. and anyone critixising upon the attack inside court premises is termed Anti-National. To helll with this kind of politics. Why did Jaitley visit the court premises and left before the attacks started? he is finance minister and not law minister. Our law minister was busy in his home state.

Debate about this for the next couple of days so that people can forget the anti-India sloganeering. Talk about this only so that people can forget the political parties like Left and the Left out party Congress which jumped their guns to claim the students were innocent. Say everything you can to create a perception that the BJP and RSS were even behind the Students who were protesting. Say all that you can to divert from the core issue. Good luck NDTV.

Indian- only a particular type of 'hindu', primarily decided by ones  dietry choices.<br/><br/>
True indian- only if you breed contempt against non-hindus and also corrupt Hindus that dare support secularism <br/><br/>
Nationalism- the urge to act like a hooligan, beat up random folks, act like a rouge school bully, break laws and justify it all as a 'natural reaction', often followed by "bharat mata ki jai"<br/><br/>
Patriotism- the feeling that would ensure that you call everyone with a different opinion- a pakistani or a terrorist sympathiser or both. <br/><br/>
Democracy- when an elected government can tell you what to eat and wear and in case you don't agree, would abuse the sedition law carved by your colonial masters. <br/><br/>
Protest- an automatic qualifier to being a pakistani or a terrorist sympathiser or both. Don't confuse with freedom of speech, which now is regarded as a 'western' phenomenon aimed at destroying our indian-ness

                            Corporate India should never employ any student who graduate from JNU if there has been any association with JNUSU. An advertisement to this effect would do well for a patriotic nation. The media, including NDTV should refrain from harping on the freedom of expression to that of the national security issue that is paramount for the nations future. But like many selfish organisations including the left parties, the congress and the media, their own bread and butter issues cannot for compromised for the larger threat to national security.

                            Anyone commenting on the issue in favour of so called students who have raised anti national slogans are equally anti nationals. They are equally responsible for the state of the country now. These people can never undrstand the sacrifice of Officers like Vikram Batra or Manish Pandey. If these people have raised slogans against India then they should be in Jail for their entire life time, along with people here who are the sympathisers.

                            The day AP was divided by switching off live telecast from Loksabha and kicking out 14 MPs representing the region, I stopped feeling as part of India. There are few more people like me. Unless the political parties stop segmenting people across religions and regions, these feelings will keep growing. You can't stop asking people to leave India. I cant be stateless because I have to travel, do my business. I however feel that as a person belonging to AP, we were cheated by union of India.

                            Rahul Gandhi 'principal misleader' of Indian politics: BJP's MJ Akbar<br/>
By PTI | 16 Feb, 2016, 03:33 PM IST.<br/><br/><br/>
NEW DELHI: Attacking Rahul Gandhi who accused the ruling party of muzzling<br/>
the youth, BJP today called him a "principal misleader" of Indian<br/>
politics and said it showed his "willingness" to "twist" the truth.<br/><br/>
Amidst the raging JNU row, BJP also dismissed as "baseless and wrong"<br/>
Gandhi's accusations that the party was muzzling the youth by branding<br/>
them as "anti-nationals" and said the issue is not between the<br/>
government and any institution but between the country and traitors.<br/><br/>
"On the JNU incident, Rahul Gandhi had leveled some accusations against our<br/>
party. They are baseless, wrong and ineffective. Rahul Gandhi instead<br/>
of trying to be a leader has become a principal misleader of Indian<br/>
politics.<br/><br/>
"His remarks in Assam over arrest of (JNU students'<br/>
union leader) Kanhaiya Kumar is a proof of his willingness to twist the<br/>
truth. Kanhaiya was arrested because of remarks and slogans which he<br/>
raised which were anti-national," BJP national spokesperson MJ Akbar<br/>
said .<br/><br/>
Rahul who was in Assam yesterday had attacked RSS and BJP over the JNU issue<br/>
accusing it of muzzling the youth by branding them as "anti-nationals"<br/>
and asserted that they will "stand up" and "challenge" them.<br/><br/>
Akbar said Rahul should read the Constitution where it is clearly<br/>
written that the freedom of speech does not mean you will support<br/>
secession.<br/><br/>
"You (Rahul) are saying the issue is of freedom of<br/>
speech. I request him to read the Constitution. It has been clearly<br/>
written that freedom of speech does not mean you will support secession. And there<br/>
cannot be a greater secessionist slogan than this," he said.<br/><br/>
Akbar also said that Kanhaiya had given another "small alibi" speech and Gandhi was trying to confuse it.<br/><br/>
"This issue here is not between the government and students or<br/>
government or any institution. This is an issue between the country and<br/>
traitors," he asserted.

Over 400 academicians from international varsities, including Columbia, Yale, Harvard and Cambridge, have come out in support of JNU students agitating against a row over an event on the campus.<br/><br/>
A joint statement signed by 455 academicians from global universities, said, "JNU stands for a vital imagination of the space of the university – an imagination that embraces critical thinking, democratic dissent, student activism, and the plurality of political beliefs. It is this critical imagination that the current establishment seeks to destroy. And we know that this is not a problem for India alone".<br/><br/>
"Similar attacks on critical dissent and university spaces are being attempted and resisted across the world. An open, tolerant, and democratic society is inextricably linked to critical thought and expression cultivated by universities in India and abroad.<br/><br/>
"As teachers, students, and scholars across the world, we are watching with extreme concern the situation unfolding at JNU and refuse to remain silent as our colleagues (students, staff, and faculty) resist the illegal detention and autocratic suspension of students," said the academicians, some of which are JNU alumni.<br/><br/>
JNU students union president Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested last week in connection with a case of sedition and criminal conspiracy registered over holding of the event against hanging of Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru at the varsity during which anti-India slogans were alleged to have been raised.<br/><br/>
His arrest has triggered widespread outrage among students and teachers and drawn severe criticism from non-BJP political parties.<br/><br/>
The university teachers have also rallied behind its protesting students and questioned the administration's decision to allow the police crackdown on the campus even as they appealed to the public not to "brand" the institution as "anti-national".<br/><br/>
Yesterday, violence broke out in the Patiala House court complex when groups of lawyers thrashed journalists and students and teachers of JNU while the political slugfest over the arrest of Kanhaiya snowballed with BJP chief Amit Shah targeting Rahul and Sonia Gandhi on the issue.<br/>
