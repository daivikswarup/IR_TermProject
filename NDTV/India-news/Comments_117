                            Congress has a habit of always saying "No" to anything good that leaders like Mr. Bhagwat says.

                            mr mohan bagawate is right there should be a apolitical committee to amend the constitution and increase the reservation from 50% to 75%. <br/>
he is the messiah of obc masses who boldly declared obc mr narender modi for prime miister of india. it never happened in modern history of india. pre declaring obc candidate as PM. <br/>
after nanda dynasty only mr narender modi is a repeesentative of backward castes. it happened only because of mr mohan bagawate.<br/>
mr mohan bagawate knows this is an era of obc comunities so he wants revival of reservation  to give the justified share to obc's who are almost 70% of indian population and having only 27% reservation. <br/>
we should stop giving communal colour for each every word of mr mohan bagawate.

                            What is wrong in Mr Bhagabat's saying. Whenever there is demand for inclusion in to reserved category, is it not a review demand? The political forces in India is not interested to pass the baton and stick to it through their offsprings. When all political parties reap benefit of the provision and lacunae of the reservation policy, they do not want it to be reviewed by apolitical persons. Why?

                            The single biggest hurdle in India, becoming a superpower is the Reservation on caste basis and political corruption. Call whatever foreign investment you want, every body will leave with a big 'Tauba' when they experienced the colourful impact of reservation policy's true aspects.
