                            May God Help these poor people! I really don't understand their stand. Is INDIA a worst country than Pakistan, or they think Independent Kashmir as a Nation would be more effective for them economically and socially? <br/><br/>
They are just being bullied by fundamentalists and politicians and have no idea what they are doing. I am feeling bad for these people throwing stones at POLICE. Very Sad incidence!

                            The security forces are doing an excellent job, there are a few elements who play the role of inciting the mobs against our security agencies to hamper their task of hunting down the terrorists. As an Indian I have absolutely no sympathy with any individual(be it a hindu or a muslim), who shouts pro-terrorist slogans. To me as an Indian if Mr XYZ Abdullah, who works for our security agencies shoots down a stone pelting protestor(some Mr XYX Kumar), I would not drop a single tear for that Mr Kumar and ditto if it was vice-versa, that is my attitude as an Indian. This is my message to all the stone-pelters in Kashmir and all those shouting pro-terrorist slogans elsewhere in India. Long live our soldiers and security forces, we Indians are so deeply obliged to you and your families.

                            You were socializing with the militants if you were out and about when there was an active encounter. Choose which side of border you want to live - its a choice. But, creating unrest is not your right.
