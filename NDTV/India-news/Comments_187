                            The whole drama was scripted and enacted with precision with the evil intent to divide the nation and polarise voters by painting the Left parties in anti national colours before Kerala and WB election. This is Gujarat brand of politics supported by anti social elements of a national party.

                            Most common men of India are not associated with any NGOs or Unions, but only cherish the Democracy and Freedom of India.......But there are many many NGOs and Registered Unions that have flourished under the patronage of Indian Democracy but has truly very scant respect for Democracy.....The irony is that these NGOs have added the word "Democracy" to their name, for example the "Revolutionary DEMOCRATIC Student" Union and "Democractic Students Union".....Both these were identified as the front organizations of radical ultra-leftists and already banned during the congress UPA regime.  But these had an All India meeting in Hyderabad for which none other than Geelani was a great invite......The question is what is the connection between the ultra-leftists and Kashmir separatists.....The link is "anti-Indianism"........<br/><br/>
The difference between maoists and leftists is that maoists are instant killers, and leftists are slow killers.......Maoists live in jungles, while leftists live as politicians........And both live in Democracies.......What an irony that Democracy extends the freedom of speech to both these groups where freedom is a premium......<br/><br/>

                            First no comments on the NHRC or its report, which is part of the legal system, and people who want to give credecne can always welcome! Something does not appear to be matching the law.<br/><br/>
QUOTE from the article "The statement which was issued ...... was not written by him VOLUNTARILY. The content, Construction and FRAMEWORK of the statements were dictated by the police" the panel has said"  UNQUOTE:<br/><br/>
Usually in such cases, the complainant says that the letter purported to have been given by him is not genuine and FAKE, could not be used possibly due to the fact that the signature is genuine and the letter must have been typed and not written by hand by anybody else!<br/>
Whether that the signature is genuine etc is the look out of the court/Forensic labs, and here th<br/>
ere appears to be no contention.<br/>
If a panel comes to the conclusion that the Construction,Framework of the contents of such letter signed by him can be a conclusive evidence of    getting his sign Forcibly will lead to asking many legal questions!<br/><br/>
Most of the legal documents are prepared  not by the signatories but by others like Lawyers or<br/>
their own subordinates who are not signatories to such documents. Many docts are actually<br/>
printed by one party or by an intermediary like solicitors firm! If the similar argument is<br/>
treated as valid in a court of law every signatory can claim that  the statements  printed are beyond the legal knowledge of the signatory and hence not made Voluntarily!<br/><br/>
In India the legality of  the names of any person whose names appears in the Docum,ent as the person Drafted, Typed etc is not defined especially about his involvement legally.<br/>
In many countries, this aspect is made very clear, and the signatory certifies the name of the<br/>
person who  even ASSISTED him in preparing any legal statement/affidavits to Govt. The third person puts his signature like a witness and says that he has explained the contents-Framework,legal implications etc to the Signatory of the agreement, in a language which the signatory understands, in a simple manner even if the langauge used in the agreement is known to the signatory!<br/><br/>
To put it simply, whether there was force(PHYSICAL OR MENTAL) used while getting the signature,<br/>
it is the duty of the signatory to PROVE and not the Govt, department to prove that the signature was obtained in the ordinary course of Business, with no compulsion/pressure!<br/><br/>
The statement of the panel appears to be not legally right.<br/>
The facts  may be different, but the proof can not be created by Opinion!

So what did triggered this support from JNU students? We need to look at deep roots in this institution. I feel the whole issue was initiated by students questioning law of the country and supporting evil forces inside an education zone.

No one whether in Government or opposition seem to realize how badly the current situation will affect the morale of our armed forces and it is time that the President of India has a frank discussion with all political parties on where exactly the country is heading.

                            NHR Panel says Kanhaiya was mentally pressured Interrogation means digging out facts which the accused is not voluntarily revealing if the accused feels uncomfortable in interrogation bcz he is not willing to reveal facts, how can the panel say he was mentally pressurized If at all it is, it is self-invited.

                            Just like the anti national activity by Kanhaiya and his associate Umar was pre-planned, its possible that attack on Kanhaiya was pre planned. but what else do you expect a garland.<br/>
Maybe Rahul gandhi gan garland these people. rest of nation will give them garland of chappals.
