New Delhi:                             Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal came out in support of students who took out a march in Delhi to demand justice for Rohith Vemula, the Hyderabad research scholar who committed suicide last month, and Kanhaiya Kumar, the JNU student arrested for sedition. Here are the highlights from his address:
 
Students have the right to speak.We have the right to raise our voice against anything which is wrong.I have always said reservation is a necessity.Those who have been exploited for centuries, if we want to give them equal rights, then it is needed.If there is any dissent, it should not be stopped.Everyone has the right to ask questions and answers should be given.In Rohith's case, two Union ministers interfered in the case regularly. He was suspended after that.Rohith kept saying that I come from a poor family, Dalit family, if I am suspended, everything will be over for my family. My career will be over.He was very bright. He was from a Dalit family from the villageCountry should be proud of such a student.A student who should have been appreciated and praise by our countryHe was forced to commit suicide.Case registered, but no minister has been questioned.On one hand a Dalit boy who was forced to commit suicide.The other side ministers are roaming around free, no action taken.I demand those ministers should be arrested. At least question them.This means your investigation is prejudiced.Leave educational institutions to educationalists.PM Modi should not mess with the students.If students get together, they will shake your chair in such a manner that you will not forget.Same youth that made him the PM, today all of them are standing against him.Government seems to be at war with students.Everyone is unhappy with this government.Today they (government) are distributing certificates of patriotism.They will beat up anyone and say he was raising anti-India slogans.For them, Nathuram Godse is patriotic, Kanhaiya is anti-national.Adityanath is patriotic, Mahatma Gandhi, is anti-national.Sadhvi Ritambhara is patriotic, Amit Shah is patriotic.All goons are patriots according to them.
