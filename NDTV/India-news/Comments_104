                            Everybody taken law should be put in jail once proven by court. Be it JNU students or or outsiders or lawyers. Court should also take action on police as they did not control law and order situation.

                            He surrenders and immediately goes free on bail. What a drama! Soon he will be declared innocent. Even if he is not then also he will roam free like those two convicted criminals Babu Bajarangi and Maya Kodnani in Gujarat. They were convicted by Gujarat High court but Modi use all legal loop holes to reward them for designing mass killings in Gujarat in 2002.

                            Its nothing to do with any Govt.... BJP or UPA or AAP<br/>
Police are always aligned to the  ruling party ... they have no choice ..  as eventually report to them<br/>
Besides JNU incident had just shown how outdated and arrogant the Police are in their ways ... arrest first investigate later or never- - worse case beat the person to agree to crimes not  done and plant proofs to back it up.<br/><br/>
Glaring failure of police systems and <br/>
obviously outdated , regressive and incompetent.
