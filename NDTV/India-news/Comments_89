                            Big salute Heroes.... But there are so many deaths every week, many attacks.....What happened to our Intelligence team, How these terrorists have entered? What happened to our Border security force...something need to be done.....No more deaths, we cannot be happy....only "terrorists killed" news is sweet.

                            this is getting repetitive. jawans are getting killed and seniors are silent. Is there a Intelligence agency in this country? and if yes, what are they doing? we need to know this now before it's too late.

                            Border Security Force who cannot stop these terrorists from entering are paid more than our soldiers who have to pay with their lives to eliminate them! Travesty of justice!

                            From this article one cannot make out if India has paid homage to the soldier or not but it is evident that the Indian military continues to honour their dead much as they have always done. On very rare occasions when media coverage and public opinion is high, one certainly sees politicians also playing their part but those are very few and far between moments when the soldier gets recognised.

                            NDTV - I think we should say the Soldiers were Martyred rather than saying Soldiers were Killed<br/><br/>
This is respectful towards the Soldiers who have made the supreme sacrifice.
