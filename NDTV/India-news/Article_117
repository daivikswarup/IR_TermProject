New Delhi:Â                             Hours after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat batted for forming an apolitical committee to decide on eligibility for reservation, Congress said he has a habit of saying controversial things and people affiliated to him should "reform" him or masses will do so.
"He (Bhagwat) always says controversial things. He had earlier said reservation should be reviewed and that it should end. This has been his habit. His people should take care of him or masses will reform him," Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge said after an all-party meeting called by the Speaker.In the wake of the Jat agitation in Harayana over quota, Mr Bhagwat in Delhi suggested that a non-political committee be formed to decide on eligibility for reservation.
"Many people are demanding reservation. I feel a committee should be formed to decide who are eligible for reservation. The committee should be apolitical so that there are no vested interests," Mr Bhagwat had said in Kolkata.
The JD(U) also condemned the "repeated efforts" of Mr Bhagwat to abolish the ongoing reservation policy.
"This is not for the first time that such a statement to review the reservation policy has been made by the BJP or the RSS leader...such statements made by BJP and RSS leaders are against the spirit of Constitution," JD(U) leader KC Tyagi said in a statement.
