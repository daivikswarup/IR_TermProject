                            So he wants students to be given absolute freedom to talk against country and shout for its destruction. Wonder why countries like US instill sense of patriotism in their kids in schools. If Indian students are given absolute freedom to say what ever bad about the country, what kind of citizens India will have, No sense of love and respect towards the country. Will that country survive and stay united and strong.? These commies want nothing but destruction of India, they are talking about freedom and democracy in India which were never given to people in any communist countries like USSR and China. These hypocrites hate and criticize western countries but talk about freedom and democracy which are only prevailing in those countries while their ideological commie countries and their favorite islamic countries are completely deny those.

He now talks of tolerance - for what tolerance for the destruction of the nation, for the vivisection of the nation? He says children should be allowed to make mistakes - yes they should be allowed but now allowed to make blunders - can you allow a child to play with fire and learn - you may end up with a dead child. Making eloquent speeches is good but saying what is right is a different thing altogether.

First thing is to decide - do you support the 'students' who were shouting anti-national slogans. If not, then action must taken against them. Now coming to the sedition charges - why are you worried about this? Let the court decide if charges are applicable or not.

Would you also want to remove criminal laws in the country? Why not let people learn from their mistakes of raping, murdering, stealing, etc.? Just because you want to oppose the government please don't make up some idiotic arguments.

                            I was listening to this man. He learnt his nationalism from whom he mentioned. What about other nationalists. Are Sardar Patel, Netaji, BIpinchandra, Tilak, Savarkar, Lalaji, Kamraj, Radhakrishnan, Shastriji, Indiraji, Atalji, Shyamaprasad Mukerjee, Bhagat Sigh, Azad and others not nationalists. As times change so does nationalism. Was Chanakya not a nationalist? What about Shivaji, Rana Pratap, Chandragupta, Vikramaditya, Cholas or was it so that there was no nationalis  born before and after those 2 names this man mentioned. Your nationalism sir is different from the nationalism that has been explained and practiced by many of the names above. And in the interest of the nation it is time to let all kinds of nationalisms flourish, prosper and work together as if we all are Indians and work for India first then what we are debating is parallel to debating which religion is better to enlighten the soul. There is one God and there are different means to get access to him similarly there is one India and multiple flavors of nationalism to serve its interests. Work together instead of debating who is better.

There are certain situations where the law has to be applied..in the present situation they are killing the country by raising anti India slogans and enabling other students to divide the country.. Do you think the country men had paid taxes which is funded for these students education to divide this country.  Let them debate on the subjects, let them debate on the technology, let them debate on the economy..but what this students debating, killing their own mother and say that they have freedom.  Its not correct on your part professor.. wake up..we need to bring up our next generation with the values of respecting their own mother land..they should feel proud of it..not to kill it.

                            The citation in the article clearly shows biased attitude of media today. It might have been great if all the lines of Smrith Irani on Sugato Bose's speech were quoted in this article. NDTV simply quoted what Ms.Irani said about the speech. It conveniently ignored the last part of that speech on Sugato Bose's  sister Sharmila Bose, where she mentioned the excerpts of the book 'Dead Reckoning'. That might have shed light on what sort of people we are appreciating. What sort of ideology we are supporting.

                            My dear young students, <br/><br/>
you are sent to colleges and universities to acquire knowledge and skills and funded by private indivduals like me through our contribution by way of tax. I do not want you to develop free speech skills or anti-India thinking skills with my money. You are free to express yourselves after you get out of the university and when you are mature enough to know what life is all about. Dear students, the real world is not baout sloganeering or fighting every thing that you percieve is wrong. You need to serve yourself, your family, your nation. Keep your thoughts for the period after education and if you feel you will better serve the country by being a politician, so be it, but with your own resources and not with the hard-earned maoney of we tax payers. If I were the government, I would have banned political and anti-national activity throughout all educational universities. Why are Indian uniersities not able to churn out citizens who can make a difference to the country; its only because these students are too busy in every other sphere of activity other than acquisition of academic knowledge and skills. Would you do such actiities in US universities, not at all, because there you focus on yourself and your future.<br/><br/>
Shun the hypocrisy, go back to your classes and contribute to the welfare of the nation instead of wating your time and efforts on other issues which you are not involved in at all.

                            This man claims to be a professor from Harvard University. Let this idiot who seems to have garnered support for his anti-national support speech in the parliament from the opportunistic and anti-national congress led by a foreign lady who cares least for our citizens and a minority student community who have leftist or pakistani leanings, inform this nation how much political activty is allowed in his university or for that matter any university in US. Such hypocritical fellows who practice something outside the country is wagging his tail for his political survival and for pleasing his political masters by making statements which he is otherwise completely opposed to in his university in US. If he has the bloody guts let him go to Harvard and ensure that his students are instigated and allowed to make anti-US statements. He dare not.

                            Atrociously arrogant minister MHRD ever had. They slap sedation cases whoever opposes them and then ask for compromise. Look at Hardik Patel. Now their MP is visiting jail with a business deal to withdraw cases of sedition on him. I was proud when this govt came. Now I am sad to see the oppression.

                            yes speech was indeed a good one.  But where did he run when the minister was replying. If he had other 'assignments', a very questionable planner of even his own schedule. that too being a teacher himself. what example he set?  that talk beautifully citing bengali literature and run away when it is time to be heard. people other than those from West Bengal are also watching.

                            What is the difference between an educated and literate man. Well while Mr. Saugato Basu is educated, our HRD Minister is just literate.

                            Dr Basu gave an excellent speech as a leader. Very happy to see a person with such great ideas and thoughts. His speech should be given space on front page. He made point that how an idea of ultra- nationalism destroyed Germany and India should not follow that path.
