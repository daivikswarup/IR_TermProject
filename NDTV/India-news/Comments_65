                            BJP is clearly now getting back the momentum in rural India.BJP is all set to win ASSAM ยง a big gain in vote share ยง opening account for the first time in KERALA is certain. <br/>
It will be a big task for secular parties to block BJP.<br/>
A Popular face may lead them to a UP Sweep too! <br/>
Hope all secular parties will unite before UP Polls.
