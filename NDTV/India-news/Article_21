'For 23 years I waited for this day. Today is the day of azaadi (freedom) that I waited for'I walked out of jail as a free man but it is still not sinking inOn this day I remember my dad; he would have been the happiest manThe tricolor is my life. So when I came out after completing my jail term, I kissed the ground and saluted the flagI gave the money I earned in jail to my wife like a good husband.My biggest relief was when court said 'you are not a terrorist'. Miss my father who wanted to hear this all his lifeSalman Khan is like my younger brother and will always be.
