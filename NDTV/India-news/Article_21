New Delhi:                             As the ongoing Budget Session in Parliament witnessed repeated disruptions and war of words, BJP leader Anurag Thakur accused the Congress of "standing with those who call Afzal Guru a martyr", during the JNU controversy.
"Is Afzal Guru a martyr or a terrorist," the BJP leader today raised the question in the Lok Sabha while participating in a discussion on the Jawaharlal Nehru University row."You (Congress) will have to decide whether you are with those who attack our parliament or those who protect it?" Mr Thakur said.
He began by invoking the sacrifices of Pampore martyr Captain Pawan Kumar and Siachen 'miracle' soldier Lance Naik Hanumanthappa, adding that the BJP stood with the soldiers and implemented the long-pending 'One Rank One Pension' (OROP) scheme.
Targeting the Congress and its vice president Rahul Gandhi, Mr Thakur said: "Your leader goes and sympathises with those who were celebrating Afzal Guru as a martyr."
"For them, it is family first, nation last. For us, it is nation first," he said.
