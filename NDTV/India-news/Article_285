Mumbai:                             NCP leader Tariq Anwar has accused the BJP-led government of pursuing double standards in categorising violent incidents, which he says is a dangerous trend.
"Jihad and terrorism are two different things, like the two banks of a river that could never meet," Mr Anwar said.
"The Home Department, instead of doing its duty to establish and maintain peace, is falsely implicating educated youth and branding them terrorists," Mr Anwar alleged.
He also said that the media should bring forth the true meaning of 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' slogan.
On the occasion, All India Marathi Literary Conference president Sripal Sabnis said "those causing misunderstanding among people for political gains and spreading hatred should desist from this".
"Jihad as discussed in Islam is all about self restraint to control one's senses and purify the heart and it has nothing to do with terrorism," he said.
"The true enemies of India are bigots causing breach in the integrity, unity and peace of the nation," Mr Sabnis said.
