Srinagar:Â                             At a non-descriptive burial ground, along the Baramulla-Muzaffarabad road in Jammu and Kashmir, the graves of the three Pampore attackers have been kept unmarked. There are no more epitaphs for Pakistani terrorists killed in Kashmir; they are buried nameless near the Line of Control.
"Bringing bodies here if it prevents a situation somewhere, particularly civilian population getting entangled with security forces over the disposal of bodies, I think It is a better proposition," Garib Das, Deputy Inspector General, north Kashmir, said.
So far, Pakistani terrorists used to get a hero's funeral by the local population, but in the last few months police have disallowed such burials in local graveyards."As per rules when a terrorist dies and there is no legal claimant, police has to take a decision where bodies are to be buried," said Mr Das.
Officials say over 12000 foreign terrorists, most of them unidentified, have been killed in the last 25 years. And they have been buried in over 500 graveyards in Kashmir.
Rights groups allege that over 8000 civilians who disappeared while in the custody security forces may well be buried in the unmarked graves.
