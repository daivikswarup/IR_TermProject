Patna:Â                             The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) today demanded imposition of President's Rule in Bihar alleging a continuous slide in law and order situation in the state under the Nitish Kumar-led government.
LJP Parliamentary Board chief Chirag Paswan told reporters his party had decided to "keep mum" for at least six months since the coming to power of the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) government but he was "forced" to speak. "...the way law and order is deteriorating within two-and-a-half months of the new government my party is forced to hit the streets," he said.
"There is nothing called law and order in the state so there is no other option but to impose President Rule in Bihar," he maintained.
Chirag, son of Union Minister and party chief Ram Vilas Paswan, was accompanied by state LJP chief Pashupati Kumar Paras.
The LJP lawmaker representing Jamui said Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had reined in criminals during his earlier tenure but after entering into "alliance with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), he cannot check crime even if he wants to".
Junior Paswan announced his party would organise dharna in all the districts tomorrow to protest against "rapid deterioration" in law and order situation in the state.
Two days back, LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan had also made a scathing attack at the Nitish Kumar-led government in the wake of killing of party leader Brijnathi Singh in Patna.
The law and order situation in Bihar has become even worse than "jungle raj" of 90s, he had said.
