                            Yes we all agree this JNU incident is not academic freedom - outright subversion

                            After seeing this episode at the JNU one gets the feeling that the students there are really not students baring some. Many of them are aged 25 and above and most likely potential marxist leninst comrades and politicians. These are students who otherwise would not qualify for any professional career based courses. They are not brilliant engineers,doctors, scientists or enterpreneurs, but unemployable youth who would indulge in disruptive politics. Perhaps there are some kashmiri separatist elements also.
