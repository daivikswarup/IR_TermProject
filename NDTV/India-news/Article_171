Srinagar:                             Two people, including a young woman, were killed after security forces opened fire during clashes with protesters in Pulwama district of south Kashmir on Sunday. Four other civilians were also injured in the firing.
The woman who was killed has been identified as Shaista, a student, while the other is a 19-year-old boy named Danish - both residents of Pulwama district. Doctors say they had bullet wounds above their waists.
Officials said clashes broke out following an encounter between terrorists and security forces at Kakpora area. One terrorist was killed in the encounter.
 
A strike has been called in the valley on Monday by separatists.Police sources say the crowd was throwing stones at security forces when they opened fire. A senior police officer claimed that while Danish was killed during clashes, Shaista was killed in crossfire between holed up terrorists and security forces.
The locals however allege that security forces started firing indiscriminately after protests in the area.
"They targeted civilians deliberately. They didn't even spare women. Shaista and Danish were killed in forces firing," said Shakeel Ahmad, a villager from Kakpora.
President of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mehbooba Mufti, termed this incident as "unfortunate and uncalled for".
 
The protests broke out after an encounter between security forces and terrorists.
Police say all the four injured have been shifted to hospital where condition of one is stated to be critical.
Massive protests and clashes are still going on in some parts of Pulwama.
Surging crowds at funerals of terrorists in Kashmir have added to the challenge for security forces in recent months.
