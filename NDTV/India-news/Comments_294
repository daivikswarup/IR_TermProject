                            Accidents happen. No india to blame unless inquiry commission comes to a conclusion. Good point was that it was handled carefully by the Fire fighters , security led by CM. Tomorrow the event will be back to it's work alive &amp; kicking. Lion walks, dogs barks.

You should have been in Dubai or outside India wherever your wife asks you to take her.. After all, it's valentine's day, you know.. You should have been with her today.. But, I fully understand your situation.. you are bound by your profession.. You will play, jump and dance wherever there is money and even if it is from intolerant people. It's not your fault. After all, it is all destined by him.. Please do well and God bless.

                            Such serious mishaps that too bearing the theme *Make in India* as everyone knows must be perhaps due to lack of proper planning and execution and incomplete safety measures.<br/>
.It also indirectly shows the lack of security checks from the state government to check if everything is in order before such a major event. <br/>
unfortunately it is seriously  very shameful..Inernationlly people might even mock when they read this  <br/>
 such mishaps in front of everyone would most probably  Do More damage than any good for *make in India* concept <br/>
 Thank god the performers and others  are safe .<br/>
Hope and pray that the next time it is all in order.

                            After some chemical which ignite after touching open circuit can get fire easily. Insulation on wire can be tampered and chemical soaked cloth to ignite. It depends upon wires quality and load factor and transformers, etc.
