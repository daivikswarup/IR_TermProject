Bhubaneswar:                             Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today accused Odisha and Tamil Nadu governments of "misleading" people over the cheap rice scheme.
"The Central government contributes most for the programme ... They (Odisha and Tamil Nadu) are misleading the people by claiming that the state governments provide rice to poor at the cheap price. This is not a fact," Mr Paswan said."One kg of rice costs Rs. 30 of which the Centre provides Rs. 27, while Naveen (Patnaik) Babu contributes only Rs. 2 per kg. The beneficiary gets rice at the rate of Rs. 1 a kg in Odisha. Therefore, the state government should not make the claim that it provides rice at cheap price," Mr Paswan said.
Beneficiaries get rice free of cost in Tamil Nadu because the government of that state contributes Rs. 3 per kg compared to Rs. 2 per kg by Odisha government.
"It is unfair to make claims of providing cheap rice to poor in the state ... The Centre never makes such claim despite giving Rs. 27 per kg of rice being distributed among the poor people," he said.
Asked about the alleged irregularities in the selection of beneficiaries of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in Odisha, Mr Paswan said he had received complaints and his department would inform the state government on the matter for action.
Mr Paswan said he has received complaints that people from well-to-do backgrounds have been given ration cards under NFSA. Under the federal system the state government has to take a call on the matter.
"The Centre cannot take action in this regard," he added.
