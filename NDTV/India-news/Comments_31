                            Rahul Gandhi is a shame to this nation. I remember his Kalavati drama that he did few years back and then was ousted from govt in 2014. While he talks big, he never commented on the corruption under his rule in 10 years from 2004-2014. Double standards. And his stupidity was at height when he supported those raising anti India slogans. We are fed up the stories of Chotta Bheem, dear Rahul. Grow up and do some work. Otherwise, get lost. We don't need dynasties any longer.

                            Left parties always branded as a party with different ideology and mind set , they will not shy away from adopting anti national position based on their ideology . Its because of their ideology many manufacturing unit in Bengal have closed or shifted to other places . No organizatioin in India wants to have people from Bengal as major workforce. West Bengal once dubbed as manufacturing hub of India with product like Bata , ambassodor Car etc . All these are either closed or shifted operation somewhere else, but all communist are not worried for the current state of the state . Even TMC is not bother about state as TMC has failed to attract any investment in state.<br/>
they are induge in drugs and terriorist money and become mini pakistan . If you keep on  comparing two you may find lots of similarity.<br/>
their people also doesnt want any growth or develpment and are happy with current state <br/>

                            Raga or should i say Rag. You have nothing to respond to. The facts stated by the minister are what they are. You and your Comi friends are trying to target a tolerant Hindu diaspora who live with a dream of India. An India where everyone is equal, an India where the law is equal, an India where life presents same opportunities and challenges for everyone, an India where there is freedom to move, freedom to speak, freedom to do business, freedom to buy and sell property. An India where freedom comes with consequences as does everything in life. An India whee NOONE, NONE can say India is bad to live and still continue to enjoy for whatever quality of life the state and the system provides. Now it is your time to face the music. You want to fragment the Hindus into Dalits, Pichhda, Rajput, Brahmin, Bania and sing of atrocities that have been committed on Dalits by their own Hindu brethren. You on one side say change is the only constant. Yes may be 3 centuries back there were some rules and ways of life which are now not existing. The current lot of non-Dalits have lived in India for 69 years without complaining why they have been given a deal which restricts opportunities for their kins. 69 years is 3 generations on non-Dalits who have lived in an unfair world. Your governments which have been ruling the country for 60 out of these 69 years have been incapable and inefficient to bridge the social gap and instead of bridging the gap you have further widened the gap for your own political gains. The non-Dalit in India still wants Dalit reservations to continue but would also like to see reservations for their economically, physically, mentally challenged kins. What is wrong in their ask? Why is a suicide by a Dalit scholar a bigger issue than a suicide by a non Dalit scholar? Why is "Bharat ki barbadi" not an anti-national statement as per you? Why should that be let go as "childish behaviour"? Why is it that no Non-Dalit comes out on the street and says such slogans? Why are you on support of students at JNU who raised these slogans? What is the need to celebrate Mahishasur Martyrdom Day? What is wrong if I do not like a cow being killed? What is wrong if I thrash someone who hurts my national and religious feelings? Why did the law not do it for me?

Internet is expected to get a  big hit so people of Delhi since they are currently saving their water, they may also make back up internet arrangements too!

                            really fed up of seeing all these.. the big question is whether the parliamentarians are going to do something for the country . as a citizen of this country, the demand is dont waste hard earned tax payers money by indulging in petty school fight type of things. the result will be citizens will discard you. already lot of parliament time has been washed away. the demand is GST,DTC and key reforms have to happen. then the respected MP's may stage dharna or shout as the case may be. Dear Members of Parliament, Please dont disrupt the proceedings and waste hard earned taxpayers money.....

                            If they let some intelligent people like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora and Sachin Pilot come forward, Congress could make a strong comeback. Sadly blind maternal faith and ambition are not allowing this to happen. Rahul Gandhi may have his heart in the right place but his heart is not in politics.
