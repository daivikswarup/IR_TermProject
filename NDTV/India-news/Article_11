New Delhi:                             Home Minister Rajnath Singh today condemned the violence in the Patiala House Court and promised action if Delhi Police was found doing "injustice" in the case.
Many journalists, including an Indo-Asian News Service reporter, were beaten up by a group of lawyers in the court.BJP legislator OP Sharma, who assaulted a CPI activist outside the court, was arrested and released on bail.
"The Patiala House Court incident is unfortunate. I strongly condemn it. The MLA was arrested (for) assault and an FIR was lodged against him. The investigations are going on. Let it happen," said Mr Singh.
The minister said he spoke to Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi immediately after the violence on February 15 when the case concerning JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, charged with sedition, was taken up.
A second round of violent attacks took place in the court two days later.
"I said strict action must be taken. If Delhi Police is found to be doing any kind of injustice in the case, the court will take appropriate steps against them. Delhi Police makes all possible efforts to maintain law and order in the capital," added Mr Singh.
