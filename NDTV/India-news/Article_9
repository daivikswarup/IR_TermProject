New Delhi:Â                             An angry Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien on Thursday snubbed Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar during a short duration debate asking him to behave responsibly as a minister in the House.
This happened when Mr Javadekar took objection to Mr Kurien asking Shiv Sena member Sanjay Raut to restrict to time limit while speaking on the discussion on the row in JNU and Hyderabad University.
"Please give some more time to this member. You have given time to members on other side," Mr Javadekar said.Mr Kurien got angry over his interference and said, "As a minister, you should be responsible. I am ready to give more time but I am restricted as the government is asking one bill to be taken after the debate."
"You should help the chair. You are doing exactly the opposite. That is my complain," he said.
As tempers rose on this issue, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukthar Abbas Naqvi interfered to control the situation. He said the minister's feeling was of cooperation.
Meanwhile, Congress leader Pramod Tiwari raised objection to the minister's behaviour and asked the chair, "Can a minister accuse the chair? Insult to the chair is insult of the House. Action should be taken."
To this, Mr Kurien said, "I will go through the records and take appropriate action."
Later the discussion continued.
