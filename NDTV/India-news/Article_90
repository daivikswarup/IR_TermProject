Srinagar:                             The father of Captain Pawan Kumar, who was killed today fighting terrorists holed up inside a government building in Jammu and Kashmir's Pampore, is proud of the sacrifice made by his only son.
"I had only one child and I gave him to the Army, to the nation. No father can be prouder," Rajbir Singh, Captain Pawan's father, was quoted as saying by an Army spokesman.The 22-year-old officer, hailing from Jind area in Haryana, had  joined the Army only three years ago and had recently taken part in two successful operations where three terrorists were killed, the spokesman said.
"He was a very brave and intrepid officer with barely three years of service but maturity beyond his years," he said.
The captain laid down his life as security forces tried to storm the Entrepreneurship Development Institute (JK-EDI) building at Pampore in Pulwama district of south Kashmir where the terrorists are holed up since last evening.
"Captain Pawan of 10 Para attained martyrdom leading his men from the front in a tricky deliberate operation against the terrorists hiding in a government building," the spokesman added.
