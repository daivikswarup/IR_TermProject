                            Delhites are amazed how can a CM be so accessible to all and work so much in 12 months. All AAP MLAs are ready to meet people and resolve issues. GOvt hospitals have free medicines and all tests are free. 20 new poly-clicnis opened. 1000 aam aadmi clinics ordered to be opened in next 12 months. Corrupt officers getting arrested. Paper-less online governance. Govt schools/hospitals being improved.

                            To my knowledge, Univ of Hyderabad is in Hyderabad / Telangana; why is AAP government in Delhi been approached by this lady???? What is the intent???? Rather than approaching the Telangana government; why is this lady going to Delhi all the way??????
