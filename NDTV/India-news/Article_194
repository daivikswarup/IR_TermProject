New Delhi:                             As the Jat quota agitation raged on in Haryana with fresh incidents of violence, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that he would go on a fast at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi from today to drive home the message of peace.
Talking to news agency PTI, Mr Hooda said he wanted to go on a fast in Rohtak but in view of the gravity of the situation, he decided to shift the venue to Delhi.
"My appeal is to restore peace and amity. I have also asked all our party MLAs and former MLAs to hold peace meetings in their respective constituencies," he said.
Asked whom he holds responsible for such a situation, Mr Hooda said he did not want to get into any kind of politics.
"Right now, my priority is to bring back peace and I am going on fast for this limited purpose," he said.
Violence and arson in the Jat quota agitation in the state spread to more areas on Saturday even as the Army staged flag marches in affected pockets.
