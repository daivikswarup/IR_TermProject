                            what media, congress/UPA, now wants to stay, Because  we are all not united in saving our country, and  we split ourself  by religions, caste and state , such intruders  activity will continue, This is  a good lesson that we all indians  unite together for the common development programmes for India , irrespective of politcial parties they belong to

                            A sea passage of smuggling in narcotics into India from Pakistan. Smugglers from that country who had been mostly using Rajasthan and Punjab borders for their clandestine activities have now taken to oceanic routes.

                            Surprise to see all blind Modi Bakts comments ! Indian army is not the private army if Modi and they are doing their duty !! If someone things praising Indian army for every routine work is amount to show only patriotism please get lost with this sycophancy ! It's like appreciating every policemen for an fir / or a clerk for moving a file ! It's the job of the army to check infiltration and it is a routine work ! The worst fact is that Modi bakt didn't want to see the true picture that the boat which claimed to be blasted off last time was similar to this one and it was blasted off by our navy as claimed by an innocent navy commander without knowing the patriotic psychi / hype feku's design to brand himself as the saviour of Indian empire !

                            Is it real for this time, and by the US drugs department had in 2005 blamed the Indians for very poor record in this regard. <br/>
How come such a large, juicy shipment is being shared with th  media?  And if it's true why is it the only one being mentioned?  Because the route is very busy for these guys and how much has passed,  somebody is milking the gold laying Goose here.
