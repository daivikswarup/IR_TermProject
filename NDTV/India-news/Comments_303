                            "I tell the national media also, if you don't show my speeches, it is ok but you should tell the nation about people like Ma Kunwar Bai," This is our PM!! I am sure Modi himself will be hearing this name (like most of us), till the speech was handed over to him by his script writer. During Loksabha Election he claimed the legacy of Sardar Patel, when in Bihar he taught the state the lessons on Ram Manohar Lohia and JP Movement, then he moved forward for Neta Ji Subhas Chandra Bose before West Bengal Election. The best part of him is he moves on, without taking much headache about what he said earlier. Like his promises of Good governance, House to every Poor, Drinking Water to all, 24/7 electricity, no to pink revolution, Befitting reply to Pakistan, Increase the value of Indian Rupees....and last but not the least 'Bring back every single penny of black money from Swiss account to India'!!.....But Modi Moves ON!

                            Mr. Pm you are only launching new missions and schemes. But in reality the common man can't even afford basic eatables like rice dal vegetables and fruits! When will you look at that??? Life has become impossible to live after you took over. Expenses are only mounting regularly
