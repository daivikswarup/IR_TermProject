                            Unless you can solve the Kashmir tangle, all these talks etc. are going to be useless. Nehru cost the nation a lot by his very stupid decision for a referendum on Kashmir. He died 50 years ago, but Indians are still dying there. It has been a massive drain on the country. Whether anyone likes it or not, the only way out is to repeal Article 370 and integrate Kashmir fully into India, with each Indian law applicable to it. There is no need to pay too much attention to the sensitivities of Kashmiris, separatists or not. Get it over and done with. Then only can relations with Pakistan normalise. Otherwise they will keep dreaming of annexing Kashmir with the consequent cost to both sides.

                            Mosharraf needs to bear in mind there are malevolent islamic terrorists and benevolent islamic terrorists , the latter operate under the patronage of the deep state of pakistan as part of pakistan's policy in achieving its foreign policy objectives particularly in relation to India and Afghanistan. The jury is very much out on pakistan's intentions in respect of the `benevolent' terrorists. It would be appropriate to point out too that the fundamental threat to pakistan's existence is the fact that pakistan - an historic blunder - is an ideological failure.

                            While, the peace is the only answer to all conflicts, but this will never happen between the two countries. Had that been the case, some action could have been taken against Mumbai attackers in Pakistan. Is there any progress ? No. Why do we live in a fools paradise. No action will be taken this time around as this is just a time buying exercise. What happens if there are multiple attacks in India, say in next 3-4 months; which is quite possible give the factory of militants in Pakistan. <br/>
The only practical solution is that both countries should forget that they are neighbours. Keep low profile and take action in their respective countries to root out militancy. In the next 10 years, India will become an economic superpower and Pakistan too, hopefully should improve its economic situation, if militancy is controlled. The time to engage with Pakistan would be right then.

                            The working peace on the basis of mutual interest between two neighbors is possible, but it will go against the basic purpose of partition itself. The purpose of partition was to preserve the perks and power of Kings and Jamindars. Therefore, King of Kashmir and Nepal refuse to merge with India and powerful Hindu, Muslim ask their respective area to earn their share uninhibitedly. However, democracy in India and Military in Pakistan keep some restriction over them and therefore we have seen some serious political conflicts since partition. Because, conflicts generate poverty and poverty can easily generate militancy. Thus, it become very cheap to use this militancy when and where requires earning money and maintaining power. Basically, this is a very profitable business as on one hand poor blame God for poverty and on other hand rich encourage poverty to maintain money and power. This game of cat and mouse will going on until common people refuse to become victim and control their greed that appears very difficult, but achievable.

Just because Feku Modi wanted some TV prime-time PR by hugging Sharif doesn't mean RSS/BJP Chaddis should forget that Sharif actually supports terrorists.

Sir,just a quick question...............what exactly is a non state actor??? just asking, you know.I think people in India are unaware of this term.Can you please throw some light???<br/>
Also note your PM Nawaz Sharif, maybe or positively is,since you say so "a mamas boy". Our PM is no mamas boy.Just keep it in mind. During his Lahore trip,in one masterly stroke he got rid of your entire army,foreign office,NSA and your so called sate and non state actors.Not a single person was present.How????? Give it some thought.

Civil government of Pakistan can not make real progress on peace unless military and ISI are part of it at the same time if these org are part of the peace process , deal can not be made either.

                            Well written. Both countries should continue talks, try to rope in the army chief of Pak to expose his real stand. The JED wants to destabilise good relations, or else they will become redundant. The citizens of Pakistan should be interacted with, on a regular basis that the future of their kids and the overall welfare of the country depends on decent education and values, and not in religious fanaticism. Indians seem to have learnt that and the fanatics in here are in much smaller numbers. They are not as violent as the Pakistani counterparts. The political leadership of all parties in Pakistan should look at long term welfare of its people than trying to get power for personal benefits.

                            Critics of bilateral talks at this background have fallen prey to the terrorists design for abandonment of bilateral talks. How long and what for such talks be avoided and cross border terrorism  be tolerated without decisive actions? For any decisive action towards lasting peace, talks is a must. if afterwards why not now? If peace is to come first, then there won't be any need for talks for peace there after.

                            In my view other than the terrorists there is a big section of the arms industry and the defence/political establishment of both countries that gains from not having a dialogue. With India spending billions of dollars importing arms to keep its borders 'safe' and Pakistan using Zarb e Azb as its excuse for getting arms its the arms industry and their political sponsors in the west that are laughing all the way to the bank while we continue to argue about the symbolisms of reconciliation<br/>
Why would all these interested parties not be keen to see a continuation of the conflict between the two countries. The region virtually keeps the arms industry running

Instead Pakistani behaviour is opposite, at least in the past. There is no role for non state actors or third parties between India and Pakistan. Control non state actors on your side of the border, co-operate with India to eliminate non-state actors , India should eliminate non state actors who come across the border.
