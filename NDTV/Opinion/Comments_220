                            He is asking the question about why was he spied on. I think he should ask the question to himself - Why was no Hindu targeted? Why was no Sikh targeted?  Why was no Jew targeted? Why was no Buddhist targeted? Why was no Christian targeted? Why was no Atheist targeted? Why were only muslims under surveillance??? What have the muslims done that others have not done ?  Why is that Muslims are a source of trouble in every single country they live in ? If you are feeling that victimized then imagine how victimized the families of 09/11, London bombings, Madrid bombings, Mumbai Attack, Paris attack would be feeling.

                            Because 99% terrorists are Muslims. Because majority of Muslims who are not terrorists actually do not condemn terrorism. What should bother you more is brutalities that Islamists carry out and still you remain quiet and worse, find ways to make excuses for those brutalities. It is time to genuinely review and revise the book that is largely not suitable for 21st century.

                            That is the reason US did not had any major attack after 9/11. They have kept check on terrorists and did not allow them to carry out any activity of killing innocents, making children father or mother less.. Congress did not do that and we saw multiple children becoming parentless. Now, last 2-years because of aggressive policing of the incumbent government, we have not seen any major attack on common man.

                            Agree with u. We can understand the trauma u must hv gone through. Because of wrongdoings of a few people, whole community is suffering. Sad thing. But this is what is to be told to those Islamist terrorists. Because of their actions, the whole community of Muslims s suffering. Yes we understand that we cannot blindly call them terrorists. We don't know the actual reality. Something wrong might hv happened with them in the past and they might just be taking revenge. But even then, violence cannot be the manner in which revenge should be taken. In fact revenge itself is a wrong thing. Violence can never give positive results. This is something people hv to understand.

                            It is indeed an invasion of one's privacy, but thinking of it from a security angle, what else is there to do. You have a couple in San Bernadino who was a normal looking couple who shot and tried to kill many for their religion. So who can be included under usual suspects? Who is to say who is or might become the next lone wolf or a bomber. Has the religious community identified and handed over at least a single person who might bring the religion to disrepute due to such acts? Points to ponder, sometimes what you say is not as important as what you do.

When people like you do not believe in supremacy of the religion you follow is when the problem starts.

Terrorists dont carry or display the description" I am a Terrorist".<br/>
You need to think and introspect whether or not you fall in any of above categories.There was a time, because of activities of some German leaders and Germans, many Germans have faced the suspicion of being Nazi. Same is the case here. That is the advantage or disadvantage of reputation. One has to accept it with a pinch of salt. That is the human and societal norm.

Terrorist do not come with a label on their heads,they're so normal when you look at them &amp; that's why they mix up with us to maintain their cover. I'm sure he never asked this question when several americans were killed or several indians were killed,if their mosques are being scanned why does he have a problems,the agencies have enough evidence to show that mosques have been used as kitchens to prepare the plans of massacre,even in india..but it's unfortunate that we can't do it in india..If i would have been there i would have given the muslims exactly the amount of resources to live and survive &amp; thats it,not an inch above it &amp; would have banned all the ill practices and seperate laws for these people.

                            Crimes happen and terrorism happens. Nobody knows for sure whether someone is a wolf in lams's skin or someone is a lamb in wolf's skin. The idea is to protect innocent citizens. Anyone who is a good citizen must take surveillance or any such act with equanimity and not personally. Keep in mind the higher purpose of protecting innocents. instead of complaining you should feel that you have been a good citizen and have been transparent and that has been proven. When things go wrong we blame the government for what they could have done, when things go right we blame the government for overdoing. The best way to be a good citizen is to allow government to do things (without an hindsight) that they must do for then common good. Rest Inshallah! And if everything is Inshallah why must you complain? As per your faith nothing happens without the permission of Allah. You must be the first to respect that.

                            No one is born terrorist.  They are just normal, sane people like you are now.  But unfortunately, some get brain washed and take up terrorist activities.  Authorities have no idea who will change, and WHEN.  When the safety of so many innocent individuals are at stake, authorities try to get info on whats happening, which also means some people may get spied upon.  If you are not doing anything wrong, why worry?  Do not blame the authorities, it is their responsibility to protect innocent people, and they may end up keeping lot of people, with certain profiles, under observation.

                            Although with its own defects, it goes on to show why US is still a great country. The police accepted their serious lapses and offered to settle the matters with future safeguards. They are continuously learning and relearning to keep their society democratic and equitable. Hopefully, their foreign policy too becomes more balanced and just. We can learn a lot from developed democratic societies in America and Europe, even as our region was a beacon of hope for humanity for thousands of years.

                            Is not Elshinawy's conviction "that Islam is the divine truth revealed from Almighty God, and that all Muslims should follow the timeless guidance of the Quran" a part of the problem? This is so because the unstated corollary of this "conviction" is all other belief systems are lesser in the divine reckoning. Verily, to him and others of his ilk, the world owes them a living. What are his views on the actions of Osama and other Mahdis, including our own El Bahgdadi?

                            muslims are feeling the heat these days and they are blaming west for all their problems. Honestly, the root cause of problem lies in their religious practices which doesnt allow them to gel with other communities and their women are kept away from world with restrictions thus lacking proper education and other social needs which in turn has direct impact on children who later grow as lunatics. the way islam preaches muslims to lead their lives is excruciating and claustrophobic. and i am saying this from whatever experience i have interacting with muslims or reading about them. there's no hope for them, no matter how hard anyone tries. i dont know whether to feel sorry for them or pray for them. their world revolves around allah...which any sane person will know does not exist. only solution is getting rid of religion from human race. that is the only hope.

                            Whether you like this statement or not, it is true that 'Bin Laden and his associates' killed people in the name of a religion. Therefore, one of the steps would be to prevent religious fundamentalism. It is difficult to know who is right and who is wrong in the first place. Therefore, surveillance would be in order. It is through surveillance and intelligence that the real culprits are captured. However, if the administration takes any steps which would prevent you exercising your rights as a citizen, it is objectionable.

                            Dear writer I believe you committed a mistake by posting your thoughts on an Indian news channel.  The people here are the first ones to hate Muslims for which they don't even need a reason.  You may not have harmed them personally but they would still breed hate against you because you are a Muslim.  This country needs to evolve big time. Where are the constitutional principles of secularism lost in this country.  And no I am not a muslim.  I am a handu who worships Idols and is a supporter of Modi but above all I am an Indian who believes in the spirit of the Preamble of this country.
