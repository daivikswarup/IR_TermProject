He was restigated based on rules n high court upheld his restigation? I feel these associations student unions shld be banned. Universities are for education not to make politics fightings n making antinational rants like sloganeering for Yakub etc

                            Hello Madam,<br/><br/>
It is you who don't know the complete story. If Mr.Modi don't say a word you will write he is quite and if says you will say "Wonder if Modiji indeed felt the pain of Rohith's grieveing mother ......". Do you understand what you are writing?<br/><br/>
Regarding facts,<br/><br/>
1. Rohit is proved to be a Non-Dalit, confirmed by his father (video is on youtube)<br/>
2. Yesterday, the police went to his village and confirmed the same, now how they got a fake caste certificate is a matter to be investigated, which is the reason the student union now not in favour of inquiry.<br/>
3. Which also means the case booked under SC/ST Act is void.<br/><br/>
Please check facts and write before jumping guns, good luck next time :-)

BTW i m not BJP supporter, i m AAP supporter which soon is going to change looking at their behavior and activities.

I can bet that you cannot agree with anything PM Modi has said in his lifetime nor can you be appreciative of anything that Modi has ever done in his lifetime. When you know that he cannot do anything right why the expectation. Stop writing mindless blogs and make yourself useful if you can. You never supported BJP nor PM Modi. Even during 2019 elections please do not support the BJP or PM Modi. Politicizing everything, bringing caste, minority and religion angle into everything, dividing the nation on caste or religion lines is all you can do. Shame on you!!!!

                            A PM has to be discrete and sure of his facts, especially on sensitive issues, when he speaks. It is better that he takes his time, rather than shoot from the hip. Opposition politicians and media people can talk any nonsense and get away with it. Not the PM.

                            First of all, committing suicide itself is a sign of cowardness. Why we intend to showcase it as a heroic act and indirectly endorse it?<br/>
Why cant we see and keep our focus on the root issue which is bothering us? Why cant we question on how our beauraucracy or police department work? How can we assume only because of some politician acted erratic, he was compelled to commit suicide? There may be other factors also  and this is my observation that such incidents are being entertained as a block buster movie show on media channels since modi government took the power!! If there is so much agitation, then mediaworkers should try to find the solution also!!

                            I believe it would be too judgemental to hv said that a PM has responded too late about a sensitive issue because the least its people can do is to trust in the dignity &amp; believe in the ability to take the right calls at the right time in their own chosen representative. If they don't, why in the first place did they even vote for him and bring him on the throne. I personally believe PM Modi is a very able &amp; a determined leader who has what it takes to lift the nation to a brand new high.. I think both, his words &amp; his acts are well measured &amp; are in perfect sync with one another.

No doubt the Hyd event is regretful but its fight bet two students. Irresponsible Media hyped it and made it a national issue. It is just a local police case. let police and vc of uni  handle it. Media made it an issue bet dalit and non-dalit and gave political twist. Campus violence is quite common. ppl like kejari,pappu and other oppostion are always ready get ignited and media watching fun. So dont add fuel to the fire. Today 3 girls commited suicide in Chennai blaming the admin. You can drag Modi also there. so stop Modi bashing.

                            the problem with Narendra Modi is not lack of efficiency but his back-up the RSS and their undue influence on the goings 0n. He goes around the whole world selling India like a salesman with effects flowing in in a trickle so far.  But the people who are at home are doing their best to ensure that he is reined in  and he is hindered at every step. It is a Cross he has to bear since he belongs to the BJP.  But please do not put him on a par with that pampered mongrel from the congress who actually does not  know what he talks or does. I am no political animal but certain things have to be spoken out vehemently. Our only hope is that the impending rejig of the cabinet will bring out some true and honest workers instead of party hangers on.

                            It is always easy to see one side of the coin. Perhaps it is considered to be rather myopic. Ms. Rana, if you were the VC tell us what would have been your steps of action against the errant students creating nuisance in the campus whatever reason may be. It is not a question of enjoying liberty to express your voice, it is a responsibility of the students to understand that liberty carries responsibility and we must behave in a way as approved by the rules of institute. This is administrative step that before proceeding for any action against rulebreaker scholarship must be stopped. That is not salary, that is an assistance given for good academic performance and you have to sign some kind of declaration of good conduct. You can not do both, enjoy scholarship from the state and abuse at the same time. Yes, going against the verdict of SC, that too after an unprecedented hearing and President of India is absuse to a nation and a student can not do it. No one should take his life himself. This is unfortunate and unethical too. But it is equally unethical to make such death a political issue. Further, if you can do politics be bold to face any adversaries. Or remain goody goody and do the primary duty as student. Ideology of people may be different and it should be but within acadenia you are not allowed to ceate a bad atmosphere. The political parties want to say that whatever a dalit does you donot dare to touch him. Had university taken any disciplinary action against any non-dalit it would have fine with you all. Right? So people like you are just become partisan. Pathetic really.

But let's not allow emotions and logic to get mixed up. A group of students were suspended due to assault on another student from a different party. Such intolerant politics is a reality in universities across India. Not one commentator seems to be able to deal with this fact!

No where was Rahul Gandhi or his government directly involved in the crisis. In Vemula's case, The HRD ministry wrote 4-5 letters to the University to take action against the students involved in the tiff with the ABVP.  <br/>
Efforts were made by Ms. Sheila Dikshit and Rahul Gandhi to talk after public came to street but they were booed away. Has any effort been made by Modi government to do the same except a one liner thrown by the Prime Minister when there was sloganeering against him in Lucknow. Ms. Ayub may be right to an extent but her comparison this time is wrong. One is taken by surprise to see this comparison when Congress is not even in State. Hope Ms. Ayub does not have a grudge to grind.

But just ask any Congressman if he agrees. For the Congress, blissful ignorance, induced by arrogant smugness, is the key word when it comes to learning lessons. But this is as it should be. Otherwise, we may have another concoction called UPA, led by Rahul Baba this time, to contend with, God forbid !

                            the poor fellow committed suicide- actually the easy way out. Having said that , let us admit that there may be a million reasons for it including the fact that he is himself a weak guy unable to face the world boldly or perhaps disillusioned.whatever may be the reason, the matter has taken a political color and all politicians  have taken advantage and are running it for "their own selfish ends".In the case of the student at IIT Chennai, it has been brought out that he did have a love affair in which he was the loser.His death had nothing to do with his Dalit status nor discrimination. So the moral is that what is required is a total mental makeover and not accusations on either side. It seems this Dalit problem is worse than the White-Black problem in the USA. but the difference is that the leaders of both communities there  are sane enough and trying hard to smooth out the lines while in India they are trying their best to emphasize the differences and create more  bitterness. And the criminal part is that these 'dalits' in their anxiety  are 'converting to other religions who are waiting in the wings in their numbers' game for action. the best part of all this hullabloo is that it is not the "high castes'  but the alphabet castes who create all problems against the Dalits because they are fighting for their 'quota' for the small windows of opportunity in our country and hence it is an "economic"  fight and not  caste as such.  and worse the leaders do not realize it. or pretend not to.
