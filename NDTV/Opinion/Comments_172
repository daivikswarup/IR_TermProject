the problem with hypocrisy is that it makes people guilty over a period of time - those who are practising it. What you have written is not entirely correct. Media is no saint. They are also like political parties and you are also party to it. In all these events..perception is the biggest player and perception is against you otherwise you wouldn't have written a letter like this. <br/>
JNU is known to all this for decades. I personally have seen this in 2000 when i was there. Kanhai is no exception. A section of media is trying to make him a hero but eventually truth will come out. LEt courts decide his fate, why you guys are getting so emotional... LEt the dirt settle on its own.<br/>
And you guys keep on reporting unbiased....

Will appreciate if you can do some research &amp; pen an article on origin of 2002 Gujrat riots.    Also I never saw you writing a open letter to MMS during his 10 years of corrupt rule.

A very good emotional article but lacking intelligence. Did your Afzal Guru/Yakub think of the innocent public who were killed? Why this one sided emotional story? India is a democracy which can tolerate hoisting of the flag of Pakistan but is not a stupid country if they deface Indian flag and hoist Pakistani flag.Modi is not ultimate. We have president, the honorable courts and the chief election commissioner to preserve Democracy but your emotional article can only strengthen anti-national elements.Did the students who uttered pro-Afzal slogan read the judgement from the court and think?You cannot blame a surgeon(the court) who does his job fairly to save the public.

                            Like all those who are supporting/ justifying what happened in JNU, you too have highlighted the happenings in Patiala Court. This is not the first instance of Goondagiri in court by lawyers. I really wish you had written open letter at that time too. One wrong cannot justify another one. Such arguments are childish. Brandishing image as anti national is even more childish. Reporting should be without any bias. The channel you have mentioned in your article is vociferous about everything, in favor of the Government or against it, as against your stand and some of the so called media fraternity who are perpetually against right wing. There was sloganeering in JNU. Whether Kanhaiya Kumar was involved or not will be decided by the court. Our courts are strong enough to comment sternly against the incumbent government too. So leave that job to the courts. But please don't try to put the happenings in JNU under the carpet on the pretex that lawyers have behaved badly and voice was doctored. It is time media starts behaving impartially. I know that BJP may loose the next election when the messiahs of the downtrodden and Muslims will join hands just to ensure that they can continue to remain in power. Add to that the foolish behavior of the Government functionaries and the future is clear. But do think where such posturing and reporting will lead our country. Just r fans are wishing that the PM reads your article, I wish you too read all the comments and ponder over them instead of continuing to be self righteous.

                            The letter is Rant which tries to show the prime minister in poor light. At a time when all of us should be speaking in one voice for this concerns the unity and integrity of the country we find these fissiparous voices rising amongst us. The author never touches the other contentious issues, she remains silent on them, but finds her voice to lament on the other issues. Perhaps as journalist she has forgotten that  neutrality is the core ethical value which cannot be compromised, but I guess that had been lost several decades ago, in the enthusiasm to please the congress. We have all known the proximity of the channel and the author to congress party for several decades, and the article once again clearly shows those leanings.Not surprised by this piece at all. Never did she write to the ex prime minster when the country was being plundered by his cronies, when soldiers were being butchered on the LOC, or when prime ministers files were being sent out of the office  and the list is as long as laundry list. Criticising your own colleagues out sheer malice is the worse one can do to his fraternity, and a person who throws vitriol at her own colleagues and hates them, one can imagine how much integrity she has to her nation.

But I am still trying to comprehend ur line 'the people who do not stand for the national anthem should be spared'. And interestingly u cited "age" for being unable to stand. R u listening to urselves?? U really think people would mind if someone's disability doesn't allow them to stand?? And the recent incident in Maharashtra was due to the disability???? Stop embarrassing urselves. I agree with u about apologizing to Kanhiya in case of his acquittal (which is very likely) and also, the case should be heard at a quick pace to make sure his studies (assuming he cares) r not impacted. The ones who shouted anti-India slogans MUST be tried and so the goons in black coats who attached Kanhiya. But u please stop being over sympathetic with those who sympathize with people like Afzal and Maqbool. Ty.

Its not a mere coincidence that same day Raveesh Kumar and Barkha, both of NDTV are releasing near about same kind of articles against Modi and Arnab. What right you have to talk about Arnab. If he is against anti national activities of JNU students, he wad equally vocal against violence in court, unlike you who have only focused on Court and Government action against anti nationals. You can only criticize Modi. Its your personal agenda to spread and create anti Modi mood in the country.<br/><br/>

                            Ok Barkha fine. In many places you are correct. That government could have handled this issue much better way &amp; the hooliganism is never allowed. They should be punished. Now question for you.. take it...<br/><br/>
1) You are playing Victim now. what you did to Modi for years. Congress used all power &amp; this guy has come clean. Will you, Nidhi, Rajdeep, Sagarika, (all leading news paper journalists) would write a similar letter &amp; ask for apology.<br/><br/>
2) Did you see the way debates are conducted. Just see how your colleague Nidhi conduts it. There are 2 issues; (a) Anti India slogan &amp; (b) hooliganism. Nidhi spends 1 min for point (a) &amp; wants to spend 59 mmins for point (b). Do you agree. Sambit gives her tough time. Barkha People will ask now; monopoly on intellects are over.<br/><br/>
3) You bring people like Mridula (professor) as neutral panelist. Do you really think so. <br/><br/>
4) you have a big heart. Show me one video, where Nidhi, Rajdeep, Sagarika challenged desperately to Kashimiri leaders for the genocide. You talk about Riot. I hope you know what is genocide.<br/><br/>
5) You ask does the government have only this issue. We all know what Modi government is doing. We are aware of make in India initiative. But you do not want to have many debates on that. should people not ask question.<br/><br/>
6) You are not showing what's going on on in Kerala, Bengal. Do you think people do not know. What are those whole bunch of Award wapsi gang doing now. Why are they hiding. Do you think people should still not ask question. Demography is changing &amp; Malda is just one of the incident. No award Wapsi for Malda.<br/><br/>
I can keep on going. One thing I want to tell you; today's youth want job, better life, want to see India becoming global super power. they have many sources to get info. If you, Nidhi, Rajdeep &amp; sagarika e.t.c. think, we see world through you; may be you are leaving in 2002. Jai hind.

Did u write the open letters to PM 's who were there during the bofors ghotala, the 2G scam, the coal scam, the chara ghotala, the irrigation scam, the urea scam, the adarsh scam and many more. being a middle class person what i think is why i have to shell this much tax and i think of all those scams. its better today i dont have to worry about the scams, so why are u so always eager to mailgn this govt. Pls put some positive energy in your writting so that people like me live out of hope and not of hopelessness. I urge you to write open letters to widows of soliders saying i am more worried for those JNU students than the people whom they supported are the reason for you being widows. And pls do write open letters.

It will never be read by the person whom it is addressed nor it is going to make any difference to him if he has the capacity to comprehend the contents or the spirit of this message. That is why I stopped writing after I finished writing my doctoral thesis. But to expect someone like "Modiji" to change or at the least to be influenced by another person's thoughts or writings is ironic and too far-fetched given his individual persona and his own history.

                            Well reasoned Barkha!<br/><br/>
Modi is no doubt on a mission to bring economic development in India. He has carried out very good global campaign to drive investment in India. It was very good to see many investors excited about India when Modi came to Hannover conference (Germany) and similarly, I suppose so in many other countries. We have also seen him preaching about saving the planet (COP21) and the need for humanity and tolerance (House of Commons). What surprises me is that despite having such a global outlook why can't the ruling government rise above sectarian politics. India is on a rise to become one of the World's super power. Along the transformation process we will certainly encounter differing opinions on how we should move forward as a Nation. The only civilize way to address such differing viewpoints is through  dialogue and reasoning and not through intimidation and mob justice. What has happened in JNU has very important precedence for how we move forward and the Nation is debating on it. <br/><br/>
I am sure as head of a country Modiji must be very busy. BUT if he can tweet "happy birthdays" he surely can send a message on how our Nation should move forward, unless of course he endorses what is going on.

Stop thinking with your heart, please apply your mind. Why is it that you did not have a similar letter written when Baba Ramdev was not allowed to enter the university or Mr.ashok Singhal not allowed or when the Israeli delegate  not allowed to address students??? Why were you not covering the same?<br/><br/>
In democracy if everybody has a right to speak then the other person should also be allowed to share his point of view. Please agree with my point of view if you want us to share your point of view.<br/><br/>
Even Mr.Narendra Modi faced protest from students before the Lok Sabha elections. Have you forgotten Aunty. Yon did not feel the need to cover that and explain it to the students? Why Barkha aunty? Why?<br/><br/>
If you do not respond, then please stop writing letters to the PM. Next time you may want to write to me before you write to the PM.

                            As usual sensationalizing stuff from Barkha, too much bollywood like. I think what happened in JNU is anti-national. "Bharat ki barbadi tak" slogan is not certainly from a patriot. I wish i could rebut every para like we do in MSWord. Do not minify the issue by just saying what happened in JNU is "undesirable". Infact what happened in patiala house is undesirable and condemnable. But NDTV wants to project the lawyers incident as the core issue and JNU as "admittedly undesirable". You say government is supressing. But what about supressing from your news channel the Malda violence. What about supressing BJP speakers in your talk shows by cutting them short.I started liking times now for good hormones.

Why must only our soldiers be drugged with the opium of patriotism and rest others be let free to play with the nation's honour? Is it so that soldiers inabriated like ISIS men, are on a constant high to fight terrorists and pak army and rest of us roam free and shout slogans to break India?<br/>

                            Barkha Dutt was happy during UPA rule because she could go wherever Manmohan Singh went. All her expenses were paid by government. This was a reward for her constant criticism of Modi from 2002 to 2014 every evening in some form or other. UPA also gave her an opportunity to act as a broker between congress and DMK in allocation of portfolios. Now she is feeling like fish out of water without such patronage from government.

                            Dear Barkha, <br/>
A very good and honest article. All intellectuals cutting across ideological divide need to think, which path to embrace and whether India will also become an ultra nationalist nation like Germany under third Reich in coming days. In a multi diverse nation like India, the rightist, centrist so as left ideology will have their own space. There can be 1.3 billion ideas of India and nationalism can be viewed through different angles and prism. One can be proud of our countless men in uniform who gave their lives to keep our border safe and at the same time can also salute the mothers of Imphal (we are all mothers of Manorama) whose iconic protest march against AFSPA shook our conscience deeply. We can be proud of all these people and cherish all these diverse ideas, beliefs and thoughts without being toxic at each other. Imposition of a unidirectional concept of nationalism is neither desirable nor suitable in a diverse country like India. Kanhaiya and JNU represent these diverse culture of thoughts and beliefs. By crushing all these students, state is only demeaning itself and the healthy debate of nationalism is now dictated by thugs in black robes, unruly mobs in the streets. <br/>
Dear Barkha your open letter has raised all these fundamental questions. Hope we all get enough strength and courage to stand up and air our views without any fear of intimidation.

                            An open letter to Barkha Dutt<br/><br/>
Hi Dear Barkha Dutt, <br/><br/>
I normally don't comment or write on any issue but I feel I should write something on this article and before I start writing something let me clarify that I am big fan of Narendra Modi and whatever I am saying here is my personal views and nothing to do with anyone. <br/>
Let me start by saying that I was watching one of your colleague Ravish Kumar's program "Taki hum sune ki hum kya bolte hai" and I was so touched by that program that I have started following him on my twitter. I think all media personnel should watch that program because it's more for you than for us. And I think all of you including Rajdeep, Sagrika, Arnab and Nidhi and many more should at least take 1 hour of class on weekly basis on how to conduct your shows from Ravish Kumar. I know you guys are very senior to him but I seriously feel the way he debates and rest of you debate especially on sensitive issues, are very different. I am not saying you guys are wrong but when we are discussing about glass half full, we also have to look at the other half which is empty and here what I mean is that when you are forcing your views on somebody you should at least listen to other side's point of view which I feel missing most of the time on your debate or it ends up with arguments. <br/><br/>
Now coming to your article, you started by using some absurd words about you and that way you are trying to portrayed that Indians are feeling like that about you and trust me 99.9% Indians are not feeling like that about you but by making that statement about you, you yourself is giving importance to that 0.01% population and what they think about you. You said you are angry and anguished by whatever is happened in last one week especially on court campuses but trust me there are thousands of Indians like me also feel the same pain when someone is calling to destroy my country and saying that they will fight till bharat ki barbadi. <br/><br/>
I don't want to go on what is going on between you and prime minister Modi after 2002 because that's your personal battle and I have nothing to comment about it and I also want to commend you for your Kargil coverage because I feel that was one of the best coverage I have ever seen and trust me I was your biggest fan at that time and I have started watching your program "we the people" regularly. I also like to thank you for an interview with Vikram Batra on the war zone just few days before he sacrifice his life and I cannot believe that you conduct such an interview in the middle of war so definitely hats off to you for doing that. <br/><br/>
Now coming to JNU controversy I would like to make few points and I may be completely wrong since I am here in US and not have enough knowledge about what is happening over there but I feel like giving my views. I know when I was in school we took "pratigna" every day in school and I think it was on first page of our all books about people of India and how we have to respect and uphold our constitution. It was mandatory during those days. Now here in JNU few students are saying "Bharat ki barbadi tak Jung jari rahegi jari Rahegi" and we are discussing about freedom of speech and we are also saying that our country is not that weak that few slogans can destroy it and I completely agree with you on that point that it's not that weak that few slogans can make it weak. But I don't want that slogans on the soil of my country because it's hurting my sentiments. I don't want to feed these snakes in my backyard because they are not poisonous now but you never know when they become poisonous and start biting us. I want those who do not believe in India or want to destroy India, behind bars just like we put snake in zoo and won't allow them roaming around free. I don't consider it as a freedom of speech but its venom which they are building inside them to get ready to bite someday. I am not saying that all of them will become terrorist but those kind of statements will help few others to follow them and you need only few crazy guys out of all those to become terrorist and eventually it will become a big issue for the country. I don't want that venom to spread in my country.<br/><br/>
Now coming to Kanhaiya and I am still confuse about him although I don't feel he has said something wrong on the campus and I think he was definitely talking about Azadi from garibi and some other social issue and I don't have any objection to it. But as a president of the JNU students union, it is his duty to stop all those who are making those statements against India and if possible inform police to arrest them. Just like you have mentioned in your article that its duty of PM to take responsibility in whatever is happening in country, its Kanhaiya's duty to manage whatever happened inside the campus and I think he is failed in performing his duty. Now let's talk about the  police action on JNU campus.  I think it was all on the base of a complain against him made by BJP MP. I feel police did the right thing by arresting the leader because of the complained against him. He may be innocent and let's leave it to the court and investigation agency whether he is innocent or guilty rather than passing judgment on him. Neither I nor you are judge so let's leave on the wisdom of our Judiciary and I think you will agree with me on this. So my humble request to you is don't make him innocent or guilty before the final judgment came out.<br/><br/>
Now coming to Patiala court and whatever happened over there and I pretty much agree with you that whatever happened over there was outrageous and not acceptable but as long as I know there is nothing much you can do inside the court premises in India. Bar council of India is so powerful that Indian police is also not feeling safe inside the court premise and we need to change that system and I am not sure who is going to do that but that's a separate issue here. I was very disappointed when you are comparing Patiala court issue with slogans about breaking India at JNU. How can we compare both issues?? One in the court is pure law and order and hooliganism and one at JNU is a question of challenging Indian State and divide it. I saw your show as well as Nidhi's and some others also and I feel whenever someone in your discussion panel try to talk about JNU you latterly or forcefully try to shut them down and divert discussion on Court house incident only. I don't like when you just want to push your views on everything. I think as a journalist you should be independent and not forceful and definitely not taking any side. Here in JNU and Patiala court incident all you guys only want to talk about Patiala court incident and even on JNU only want to talk about Kanhaiya which is not fair as a journalist. You should be impartial and ready to discuss anything and everything and even if its not comfortable to you and that's where I feel Ravish Kumar is way different then rest of you guys. I am sorry but I have to say that he is by far the best. <br/><br/>
One more thing I have noticed in your article about selection of incidents in one paragraph where you ask our prime minister to break his silence. You have mentioned about Dadri, Rohit and Patiala house but you conveniently forget about killing about RSS worker Sujit in front of his parents in Kerala few days back. This is where I have an issue when you are talking about murder and killing how can you conveniently forget about Sujit and that's where your double standard came in to picture and that's where Ravish kumar is different than all of you guys because when he started debate on JNU and patriotism issue he did mention about Sujit and his killing. Now I am no RSS supporter but when I watch debate about any sensitive issues I would expect you to give importance to all killing. How come Dadri killing become a national issue and Sujit killing is not even worth mentioning on your news channel just because he is from RSS and you guys don't like RSS views. If Dadri is bad and worst I think Sujit killing is equally bad and worst and it should also become a national news and all you guys should give equal importance to his killing. Just because communist goons killed him it will not become any smaller than those BJP goons who killed a Muslim (Sorry I don't remember his name) in Dadri. Just FYI when that Dadri incident happened I had group discussion with my fellow pro BJP friends and I told them that our prime minister should condemned it immediately so I was not in favor of that killing but I am also not in favor killing of Sujit. I think if you are true journalist you should shame communist the same way you shame BJP during the Dadri incident but I have to say you guys are failed to do that and people like me who are neither right or left are feeling very disappointed by that.<br/><br/>
I like to finish this from where I have started, instead of shouting or crying for anything just look at your reporting and debate and see whether you are fair to everything you are reporting. I think you are smart enough understand what I am trying to point out here. In the end I am again saying that all you guys should take some classes from your colleague Ravish Kumar on how to conduct a debate. <br/><br/>

                            This is an article by an activist rather than a reporter. The article also shows the personal bias of the author against the right wing parties and gives a go by to all standards of journalistic mores. If the author was writing in her capacity as an individual, this would have been acceptable. But since her fame is by her association with this channel, this amounts to misuse and taking advantage of the situation to push her agenda.<br/><br/>
NDTV's bias against the right wing parties was apparent from the time preparations for the general elections of 2014. Ms. Dutt's hatred for this Government was always apparent in every discussions and forums in many of their expressions and actions. I have always wondered why they would always gloss over the points made by the Government and right wing parties while pouncing upon and highlighting even minor points made by other panelists. Well this article clarifies that. It also shows the single minded devotion of the Channel in general and Ms. Dutt in particular. <br/><br/>
The malaise of anti-nationalism is raising its hydra headed manifestations across the country. The students and so called infiltrators screaming for the breaking up of the country is just one of the multiple heads of this monster. If they are not crushed now, the country will regret it later. Ms. Dutt, if, as a journalist, you have knowledge of the breakup of Pakistan in 1971, you should know that the students in the universities in erstwhile East Pakistan played an active role shaping the opinion of the public in the breakup of that country. And here the protesters are talking about breaking up the country. See any similarities?<br/><br/>
Even if the country ends up partitioned, I doubt if the contributions made by you and NDTV by supporting such elements would be acknowledged by anybody. And neither will India pardon you by accepting that you had included a line against breaking up of the country.<br/><br/>
Well, if this is journalism, god save our country.

                            Barkha Dutt is not my most respected TV anchor/reporter, and that might explain why for me her ramblings here totally miss the point. Regardless what Kanhaiya said or not said the government has better things to do than apologize. They should rather focus on cleaning out by taking care of anti-nationals like Shatrughan Sinha. If our society - of which the government is but only a small part - had planned and succeeded in providing a basic education to the masses, and a half-way decent platform for engagement/employment of the youth, we would be in a different set of conditions where these hostage takers of "Bharat Mata" and "Vande Martaram" would not be calling the shots. Modi may or may not be particularly bright, but that he is helpless has to be accepted with a grain of salt.

British left India but Indians haven't forgotten colonialism. It reminds of me of growing up in Kolkata when Jyoti Basu was chief minister... nobody dared to speak anything against him or party in public or else they could be killed. <br/>
Internet brought independence of mind and thoughts (as GuruDeb hoped ....a land where the mind was without fear) but unfortunately now ..his not only Sonar Bangla is scared to speak up against dadas but whole of his national anthem is losing its real meaning ... one is unable to hold head high due to shame of the state of affairs !

Journalist specially in the English media specially Raj deep and yourself amongst others have always taken perverse pleasure in writing half truths to suit your agenda.  if your agenda is in line with the rest of the nation you should like the rest of us protest against the anti national elements whether in Kashmir or in JNU. if your agenda is that of a true journalist than please bring our all the facts without bias in the godhra riots,  on the 1984 anti Sikh riots or the Gandhi families hidden assets.  if your agenda is just to be anti Modi then be brave enough to to say so and do not hide under the garb of a journalist.  The nation knows what you are and what you stand for.

                            hope you had same apathy for kanaur, kerela and pune as you had for dadri, you would defend free speech of JNU students as for Kamlesh tiwari, had you not been presstitutes.

                            Too much rant Barkha. Why should govt drop charges and apologize while the investigation is still on? Why you judge as media based on just a few videos? There was actually an event held and sloganeering done. Is it not right to investigate it with right procedure? Why are other students hiding? They know they have committed crime right? Why would you defend them and take this so so personally to PM of the country? Do you wish to promote such sloganeering in our campuses with political motivation? Have you thought of timing of this incident in JNU and people behind it?

                            The total no of reactive comments this post has attracted should tell ndtv something about how an image of an editor impacts the brand as well. Perhaps 'Consulting' ought to be stressed.

                            Dear Ms. Dutt<br/><br/>
I have followed your reporting on and off for many years. As a son of an ex soldier and a grandson of a freedom fighter, I have never quite understood where you and many similar minded folks from the media draw their inspiration. With respect to your love for the faujis all I see is extreme opportunism at Kargil which launched your career in the first place.  If your love for these soldiers was genuine you would ponder and question what motivates youngsters to celebrate the death of 70 plus CRPF jawans and army casualties every day.<br/><br/>
You and many in the media have grotesquely turned the conversation away from a sinister and lethal cancer which haunts modern India - Mao inspired Left movement and divisive forces which would bleed India through a thousand cuts towards the temerity of a few lawyers chanting Vande Matram in Patiala House. How entirely uncivilized of these goons to challenge the concept of "free speech" which spews hatred towards the land in which they were born. This is a false equivalency. So please don't equate venerating enemies of the Indian state to acts of hooliganism. Even Manmohan Singh acknowledged the greatest threat to India emanates form the numerous districts where the Naxal movement has taken deep roots. <br/><br/>
There are no absolute freedoms, except those that some sections of media have bestowed upon themselves, to tarnish any Nation loving person as jingoistic, chaddi clad RSS card holder, communal, divisive and intolerant.  Please understand that the faujis you so blithely used to launch your career meet all the above qualifications. It is because of millions of Nation loving people that you enjoy peaceful existence in nice parts of the capital. The truth is that these faujis are probably no different than the lawyers in Patiala House who are outraged at the venom being spewed by some at JNU in the garb of free speech.<br/><br/>
These freedoms exist because someone is willing to sacrifice their all for their Motherland. Next time you see a soldier, look him in the eye and ask him why is he willing to put his life on the line to defend your right to free speech or of someone who wishes his death.
