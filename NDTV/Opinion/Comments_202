                            Simply brilliant. The BJP government, may be in its bid to please industry and business to enterch its position in power,has been diluting the provisions of environment and forest act at the cost of not only tribals but alos that of environment, that  a big environmental crisis will befall India and its immediate environs

                            Great, just put words like Brahmin and Dalit wherever you find nothing else to write and stoke up passions. The question here from 1947 to 2014 - more than 50 years of rule displaced almost 100 times the number of  tribals that are there now. Now in 1 year you started complaining the new govt instead of looking back what your successive govts did. Shame

                            In a finite world the modern economy-as propounded by the first world- is chasing the chimera of infinite and eternal growth(GDP) to the detriment of not only human beings but the entire spectrum of living creatures and life on the earth as evidenced by frequent occurrences of natural calamities all over the planet. The ancient wisdom of India always struck a fine balance and harmony between human activities and environment. Successive governments from the time of Nehru have abandoned the ancient wisdom of India , which expounded moderation rather than wanton consumption and hoarding . Gandhi was for following the ancient wisdom of India, but his disciples in the name of modernity jettisoned all his ideas. The BJP with their support drawn essentially from business and commercial interests , while mouthing platitudes about the greatness of Indian culture, seems to be hell bent on mangling environment beyond immediate redemption through their dilution of various environmental laws promulgated and acts passed in the recent past. One hopes better sense will prevail in the interest of not only Indians but also that of humanity. Environment and nature know no boundaries that human drawn for themselves

In the name of tribals and displacement how long will you blackmail?? Narmada dam and the kauveri yojana are most current examples. Tribals are paid above and beyond and multiples times the values of their lost lands. So Mr. Shankar provide a solution.

                            I read the whole article. Mr Mani argues that such laws has brought maximum displacement of tribals in Gujarat. Well, then, he must visit the forest areas of Gujarat and see for himself that ALL these areas are connected with road and electricity. Probably because of road connectivity, the tribals have chosen to move to city or other areas - which he calls displacement. As per Congress, maintaining status quo for poor people should be the only objective of the government. No attempt to uplift their life should be made under the pretext of 'dirty modernization'. No wonder poor remains forever poor in their rule.

                            Devendra Fadnavis, like Modi, was elected to that post. Development requires certain sacrifices, usually not by the ultimate beneficiaries. Every one of Nehru's dams and massive steel works displaced thousands of tribals and destroyed huge forest tracts. If 76% of tribals are displaced today, the blame rests with successive Congress governments. So you can say that Fadnavis is following Nehru not Modi. It is for the elected government to decide what is best for the citizens. Instead of throwing stones, it may be better for Aiyer to make useful suggestions that will balance both development and the needs of the tribals for whom his urban heart bleeds. Or is the article just an exercise in his usual hypocrisy?

                            Dear MSA, What prevented your party from amending the Indian Forests Act, 1927, after all your party was in power for over 95% of India's Independent existence.   Also Remember there was this one Environment Minister in your last Govt, who stopped all Road and Industrial projects till an under the table charge was paid.    And during the long time in power what stopped your party governments from improving the condition of Dalits and Tribals? Oh I remember Dalits and Tribals are not people, they are vote banks &amp; If you had improved their condition, you would have lost their votes. Your party is the true enemy of Dalits, Tribals and Development.    And remember how your party let "Warren Anderson" Escape India, after Bhopal Gas Leak, the largest Industrial and Environmental Disaster.

                            I don't understand how is he allowed to insult our Prime Minister. He always use extreme filthy language which surely is his brand. Congress may be taking him as additional attack line like they use Dig Vijay Singh but this shouldn't be allowed in India to insult our PM. It doesn't matter which party the PM is from, even if it was Manmohan Singh or Rajiv Gandhi, I would have said the same thing, but this man is simply puking venom against Indian Prime Minister. Why is he even allowed to write? Freedom of expression is allright but his comments should be taken as sedation as they are purely anti national. What he and his colleague Khurshid vomited in their extreme close friendly nation Pakistan is still echoing in our ears. Why no action against him? We all value freedom of expression but when it becomes anti national they shouldn't be tolerated... let them scream intolerance but this is how it should be. Mr Ayiar please you are an educated person please respect the country where you live and don't keep projecting only negatives about your motherland. If you cant respect govt in rule thn please respect people of this country and restrain yourself from speaking against our PM.
