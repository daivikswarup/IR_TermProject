I see the Indian elephant (representing nature) heroically and with little regard to it's own well being, bringing the evil, polluting locomotive (that is paying lip service to the cause with a sign on the front) to a grinding halt, and thus saving the day!

                            Very sensible argument finally. When one looks at absolute numbers India may be one of the most polluting country, but when looked from 'Per capita' point of view, it might be one of the least polluter. While West wants to portray former view, reality is in later (per capita) view. We need to do lot more, no doubt. However at this stage of development any drastic or radical steps is impossible for India, at least without harming herself. And with enormous population, it will be most dangerous to poor people.

                            Somehow I feel India will benefit out of this in the long term. US blocked cryogenic technology to India so India developed it's own. US blocked Indian efforts for Nuclear inclusion, now the situation has changed on that front too. While a good climate deal is in India's interest, I am sure this ganging up of the developed world against India will push it even in this dimension and will make word take notice of it in not too far in future.

Please don't make comparisons with USA only. There are many other developed countries(Ex: European ones) who use clean energy and promote their use(tax subsidy etc.).<br/><br/>
If you just let Adani group and Coal India to do cheap coal mining's and use that energy for development, I am not sure our future generation would be very happy about that.<br/><br/>

                            The issue is not whether India is blocking, but whether the blocking is justified. India thinks so. The current mess was created by the developed countries whose extravagant standard of living polluted the entire world. They have to clean the mess and pay more for that. The USA does not want to lower its living standards, but wants countries like India to lower carbon emissions which will directly impact its development. This is a no brainer. So yes, India is entitled to block the conference till a more equitable formula is found. With the US and Europe footing the bill. The USA uses its veto power freely in the UN security council where its interests are concerned. Now welcome to the other side and lump it.

Let's face it that our country is heavily populated and the pollution levels are quite high as compared to the rest of the world....and with our corrupt political system, it makes it even more worse! There's no check on the trees getting cut, mountains getting eroded and plundered for natural resources leading to land slides and floods...the list can go on!        <br/><br/>
I am even skeptical of government's move about having odd and even cars on the roads starting from next year. Delhi is so populated that it will be hard to monitor the odd and even number plates....and what will happen if the wrongdoers are caught? They need to have severe punishment for such people, else people will keep breaking the law. Indians will figure out ways to bypass this rule. I can already see the 'jugaad' that some Indians might do - get false number plates made, bribe the traffic police, etc.

                            This per capita argument is the most specious one I have ever heard. The planet and its atmosphere does not care whether greenhouse gases are emitted by a nation of 10 million, 100 million, or 1 billion. It is the absolute volume that matters. We take refuge in our large population because it is convenient as a denominator. <br/>
Yes, the US is culpable for its huge contribution to climate change, but at least sane minds there realize the irrevocable damage being wrought on nature. There are a few insane people there who deny this, for sure. But that is different from a whole nation wanting to burrow its head under the sand like ostriches, like we are, at this moment.

Like U.S. by consuming a large portion of things produced in China has made China become one of the worst polluters. If US and other developed nations want emission to be reduced by developing nations by their reducing consumption (which will create intolerable problems to their people's development and set them back by decades), they should also be willing to move down perceptibly in their luxurious way of life consuming all they can.

                            It's always the same old. Posturing against the US, beating our chests like apes, makes us feel better about ourselves. David against Goliath. <br/><br/>
Why do we forget that we can't even breathe in Delhi ? I work in California and we are in our way to achieve our emissions targets for 2020 and we are thinking 2030 now. We are on target to achieve 33% of energy from renewables in 2020 and we are planning for 50% in 2050. <br/><br/>
I don't understand the mistrust against renewables. As if being told to go easy on coal, is a blatant injustice. Solar prices have dropped dramatically over the years and storage technology is following. It's time to embrace clean energy instead of asserting out right to pollute.

                            The author is using the oft repeated argument that the US has become rich at the cost of causing climate change as justification for the intransigence of India and other developing countries. It is not long since scientists have reached consensus that burning fossil fuel is directly responsible for global warming and blaming the US for what it did before that is futile. It is as silly as arguing that one should continue to smoke cigarettes today because lots of Americans used to smoke heavily in the past! Duh!!<br/>
Also, it is quite evident that India is trying to exploit the Paris summit to get a financial bonanza to solve its much neglected power generation needs. What is the point of the entire Indian government being convinced that Climate Change is a major issue if you cannot lead on this issue and instead prove to be an obstacle to the global initiative.

                            Both sides fighting. I dont see this insulting each other is gonna help either. To be frank its not that big of deal to solve this problem. Developed countries can pay the difference between renewable power and coal power to developing world minus china until the actual grid parity is achieved. Special funds can be allocated to RnD with the sole focus to bring down the cost and increase efficiency.<br/>
1) India has problem of its own which only they can solve. For instance india needs to implement its environmental laws seriously. Penalize and industry which violate them. Dont forget BHOPAL.<br/>
2) India has to stop giving subsidy for Kerosene and instead give people solar alternative.<br/>
3) India needs to forcefully put an end to the use of cowdung and burning of agricultural waste.<br/>
4) Burning of solid waste in cities and towns should be made a criminal act.<br/>
5) Water and solide waste treatment capacity of indian cities is almost negligible as compared to the cities.<br/>
6) India needs to seriously support 300 smart city project. Go above politics. The cities of the size of 100000 should be expanded to million and efforts should be made to reduce population in major metropolitan cities like Delhi and mumbai by providing opportunities in these newly expanded cities.<br/>
7) India also needs to promote clean public transport especially BRTS which uses electric buses. TATA and ALL now produce electric buses.<br/><br/>
People talk about pollution in delhi and mumbai. The biggest problem is too many people. Delhi NCR has 47 million people which is more than population of Kenya, Spain, Argentina, even Canada.<br/>
These people will migrate back to Bihar, UP, Jharkhand, UP if u convert 10 cities of the size of 100k to 1 million population city, in these states.

                            I see this as a golden opportunity for India to realise its potential to come up with indigenous green technology. Manufacturing comes with its 'carbon' price which has been demonstrated as recently in China and as we all see, in the big cities in India. Do we have to have the 1960's tempo's, old auto rickshaws and old Tata trucks plying on our roads spewing SPM's across the length and breath of our country? It has never been beyond the Indian brain to be scientific and Indians have been some of the leading brains in global research in overseas laboratories which have an existing 'system' of excellence in research. What we need is a concerted national push to establish excellent research facilities in India which will enable new 'patented' green solutions to this problem. I am sure that the best Indian brains will return to India if we are able to establish a system where excellence in green research will flourish. We must denounce the tempo jugaad just because it works and come up with a systematic solution to look into a greener future.

Secondly, if we are not going to get any help from Developed nations, no need to waste time at the summit, better come out of it and focus on our nation alone and let the Developed nations do whatever they want. We are independent as a nation and for our own good, we need to focus on population control, green energy etc.

                            There is another part of the picture which has been missing in NDTV debates. In the last 1.5 decades, US has moved to a greater gas economy driven by the shale gas drilling developments. It is now targetting India on coal because US has less need for coal today.

                            If Government is the answer, the question is stupid. The Governments of conspicuously consuming nations have a vested interest in perpetuating themselves. ergo, the status quo. The developing Nations have no choice but to make up for lost time in meeting the aspirations of their people deprived of the good life for centuries.

                            The US is three times bigger in area than India and has a third if of the population. They have more forest area as well. The low low per capita consumption of India does not hold water. Yes India needs to forge ahead and the best approach is to ask for help and it will come.

                            These are quite simple calculations one could make. It doesn't matter whether the US is less energy efficient on capita basis or per gross domestic product (GDP) basis, or what China is doing today and the US + Europeans have done in the past. What India need is to develop (innovate) their own ideas on what's good for the country. For example, can Delhi bear the load of air pollution from the cars on the road, will the odd-even cars on the road is a good enough policy? The citizens of India need to put some unbiased (from the regional politics and industries) assessments various scenarios for urban and non-urban development plans. Of course the policy for different cities will be different depending on their location, regional weather and climate, and available resources. Otherwise we will keep wondering whether someone took us for a ride!

                            When is this 'later'?  I remember reading about the impacts of pollution at least 30 years back.  It is easy to advice others once you've done what you want.  Us still doesn't have considerable public transportation system in many places and people are always using Cars and high cc bikes for commute.

                            I do not know from where the hell this lady gets her statistics. The size of the USA in sq.miles is 3,794,083 while India is sq.miles 1,269,210. Definitely she does not know her arithmetic when she claims that US is 8 times the size of India. As for the other things,The antagonism of the Press notwithstanding, President Obama was smart enough to appreciate India's thrust at the Paris Summit and we are on a good wicket there. No point in crying on the West's present carbon emission  which is really a fallout of the Industrial Revolution which started there over 100 years ago. No apologies intended.

                            Hey!! seriously US is considered to be better because of these reasons... if we also start consuming these many resources then we would be at the top. So keeping this in mind we are definitely better than US. St least we improve ourselves eco friendly.

Look carefully, an elephant is stopping a highly polluting, inefficient, coal-powered steam engine. Symbolic representation of India's positive contribution to cut CO2 emission. Message is pretty clear, well done NYT.

                            The solution to the USA is simple, if they concentrate on how to control their waste economy, they can easily achieve the target. Just control the staggering wastage on supply and demand side of the economy.

                            We must stop complaining and crying. Trying to hold the industrialized world for what they did in the past is stupid. Are we going to sue England for holding us as a colony too? Forget the past and do what you can now. Compete with what we have on a level playing field. <br/><br/>
There is enty of fat in corrupt and incompetent sarkari programs to ditch coal. If the state cannot think of how to give us clean air, water and soil it should just shrivel and wither away.<br/><br/>
