                            now they have put an American in Indian clothes to sing paens about facebook. We have learnt from China that we do not need facebook and improve its balance sheet. Please GO HOME. Tata

                            Why does this smell like a desperate damage control effort by a hired hand? This man's arguments are flying in the face of facts and all he can fall back on his magic reading of the inner intentions of the offenders in question. Consider this plea: I did not intend to cross the red light, but I did it anyway; please do not book me because my intentions are so good.  If I have ever read a brown noser, Vivek Wadhwa is it.

                            I guess it's high time we all Indians need to boycott Facebook as it is mere waste of time and it was an hidden agenda from the West to engage our youngsters in social media and loose their concentration in constructive work. You will never find a western guy spending so much time on FB like how the Indians does. Even most of them use  a simple Nokia 3310 unlike Indians using smartphones.

                            Facebook's intentions were good not to help poor, just a marketing strategy. If govt grands free basic, where Indians startup and new entrepreneur should go, already they are facing some much of challenges, free basic will add up to existing ones.

                            I agree to a lot of arguments expressed in this article - people in valley are ignorant, Indians living in the valley don't really represent India in an holistic sense, Facebook is not a charitable foundation. The problem is not that Marc Andreessen is ignorant of the suffering India endured in the 200 years of its colonial history, but the fact that he choose to be a (sort of) sore loser (typical of valley). Yes, post-independent India could have done a lot more to alleviate the poverty and improve the infrastructure that the Brit left behind, yes we are still a nation of have and havenots, and yes if given a chance we would like to rewrite the last 60 years of our history. <br/>
Technology is not the solution for all the problem, especially if not in the hands of the right people. The poor in India need internet (which can be argued against as well) not Facebook. They need education and means of livelihood, so why don't you promote "Free basic education"? I can go on here... but point here is - don't make a mockery of poor and their sufferings. Facebook, you are for-profit corporation, so stop trying to wear a good intention veil. We appreciate what you has done so far to help the poor Indians working in the valley. Please stick with it.
