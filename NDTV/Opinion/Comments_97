                            "Mother Teresa was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women and the emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction." - Christopher Hitchens

                            Derek did you know there was equally a great saint in South Shankaracharya of Kanchi Paramacharya His Holiness (HH) Chandrashekara Saraswathi a living God.  He was alive for over a century. Let me share His greatness in one instance "A devotee brought a Whole of bunch of Bananas as respect to HH from his farm.  HH asked his Devotees to pluck from the bunch, bananas and lay them on the table before him. The devotees who had gathered in front of him were surprised why is HH removing the bananas from the bunch in such large numbers.  After the pooja on that day, he was distributing prasadam to all his devotees.  Suddenly from no where a bus full of children came to take the blessings of the HH, and who were these children from the Missionary and he distributed the Bananas to each of the children".  You are aware Derek that Missionary do not use the kumkum or the sacred ashes which are the normal prasadam distributed to the devotees.  HH was a great person and without any fuss distributed the Bananas to the children and did not embarrass".  First he knew that he is getting visitor from a Missionary. He was a leaving God and continues to be so. Mind you HH did study in a Missionary school during his early days and further Had great respect to all the religions. His Followers were Pan Global and knew all the languages and used converse with all, mind you he did not step out.  His statement to all the people was "for a few rupees please do not change your religion".  Whatever religion you follow please follow it in full faith. Jaya Jaya Shankara Hara Hara Shankara. Yes I do respect the Mother and Respect the faith I follow. Derek Can Not Mother Be Called A Saint Even If the Pope Does Not Say So! I feel she is great Saint.  It is quite similar to some European Country awarding Nobel Prize and We thereafter recognise.

                            With due respect to Mother's Social work, the fact remains, that Mother, is being given SAINTHOOD, for the MIRACLES that she is supposed to have performed &amp; not for her Social Service.<br/>
Had any Hindu Sadhu or Saadhvi claimed miracles, all the "Leftist, Liberal, Secular, Progressive, Scientific-minded, Pragmatic Rationalist" Intellectuals would have taken out protest marches on Streets of India, calling it Superstition, Blind Faith &amp; regressive practice. But since Mother was Not a Hindu religious figure, all are either quiet or singing her praise for social work &amp; concealing the Miracle part.

                            What exactly does sainthood imply? While Mother Teresa's work among the poor of Kolkota is well documented, that is basically humanitarian for which she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize among other worldly recognitions. Sainthood on the other hand implies a connection with holiness or godliness. Does her temporal work also qualify towards the sainthood or was she rewarded for her religious work towards conversions etc.?

When Mother died, I was in the US and several people contacted me to know whether I know her personally and would like to say something. I felt miserable because I knew so little about so great a person.<br/><br/>
She told us that there is a God for the poor. And that was nothing short of a miracle.

Bangalore archbishop and other priests are still not doing what the Pope has asked them to do... that is service.  The lay christians and local padres still want conversion and use saints... why even Christ for their unholy conversions. The fact is many conversions were done by 'Mahatma Gandhi' on the rupee notes.

                            Service of humans and elimination of suffering of people is the bedrock of every religion.  What has happened here is you link your service to conversion.  You help people and care for them and in rerun you tell them to accept the faith of those who cares for you.  Look at organization such as Doctors Without Borders.  They care for the sick and downtrodden, but doe they convert those to the religion of the Doctor who cared for them.  This is all frivolous and making her Saint is nothing more than teaching all their missions to work under the pretense of servitude to increase Catholic conversion.

                            Interesting article. This anecdote shows how the Mother was focussed on getting what she needed. Canonisation of the mother actually restricts her universal appeal and makes her just a religious leader. So, to me, and crores of Hindus across the world, who appreciate the fact that a foreign born nun of a religious order, worked for the betterment of the underprivileged of my county (which she also most unreservedly made her own); she will always be just "Mother". To those familiar with the Hindu Sanyasa System... The whole world reveres and falls at feet of a saint; but the mother is not supposed to and the Saint even so can continue to prostrate before his mother..... so please don't demote the mother to a saint.
