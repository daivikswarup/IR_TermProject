                            There is a M before N madam. Are you trying to erase the M belonging to the great Mahatma like the Rashtriya Shaitan Sangh?

                            NREGA was a stupid idea. It was nothing but disguised state charity. It robbed the country of scarce resources to pay selected communities for unnecessary work. It was an open invitation to corruption. Everything that the UPA did was either stupid or corrupt. NREGA combined both.

                            NREGA is a success in Tamil Nadu. However, this has resulted in failure of getting Farm labourers. Nobody wants to do farm work anymore.

                            I have never been very fond of the govt creating jobs for the people. But when it comes to dealing with extreme poverty there are very few alternative options. Question to ask is why states like Maharashtra that are up there in terms of farmer suicides arent able to emulate the success of TN

                            This is quite amazing. One would have thought states with the highest farmer suicide rates would have been the most desperate to make it work. Instead its a state which is already quite well off that has done well. Tamil Nadu is indeed emerging as a poor friendly state. The disaster management team of the state got an NDTV award this year as well. Besides I have read quite a bit about other pro-poor schemes of the present TN govt. A scheme to give away goats to the poor as a farming initiative has apparently been quite a success too. <br/>
Instead of one off articles wouldnt it be better of scholars like Miss Khera are allowed to perform social audits and summarize what works well and what doesnt and why so other states have the opportunity to emulate the successes and the union govt too can strike the right balance in monitoring these schemes

                            Good Article.. NREGA should also consider expanding into Private public partnership to provide unskilled labour to the agriculture industry / farms. Currently due to NREGA the agricultural farms are short of labours and the farmers are unable to match the money paid by the government.

                            So, you comfortably forgot the Left who pushed UPA-1 to bring NREGA?<br/><br/>
Anyway, your criticism about "alleged" benefits of aadhaar is short sighted. In India, corruption loopholes are found over time. Once someone figures out, everyone follow, hack the system and exploit the benefits (see subsidies, reservations). Then it becomes a political quagmire to fix and becomes yet another unfair system that everyone cribs and does nothing about.<br/><br/>
Aadhaar was built proactively to stop it. NREGA is the first use case for Aadhaar (tough one too, because it was a test to see if technology could connect government to the lowest end of the social class). If successful, it could have given India the power to connect with every citizen by cutting through middlemen i.e. bureaucratic government machinery. Tamilnadu is successful precisely because of that - it has efficient government machinery. That's not a replicable model (atleast not in short term). That's why you need Aadhaar. I am upset that Supreme court and Parliament standing committee (headed by Yashwant Sinha) rejected it and you are toeing their line. This short sightedness is why we will never "get" technology!

                            How has TN avoided corruption ? The article is completely unclear on this aspect. Without going into the merrits of the technology, it is clear that the simple solution would have to delink the claim processing from the actua payment. This is a common occurance at many commercial organisations where supplier's bills are processed but payment made only on due date. Why can this not be done ? <br/><br/>
The whole problem with NREGA is that it encourgaes corruption by misrepresentation of the number of workers. Insistence of Aadhar came from the assumption that Aadhar could help track payments based on the Aadhar Card number. Alternate solutions are not being provided either in this article or by those who advocate NREGA. It is important to understand that tax collections are being lost due to this type of corruption and it has to be plugged.

                            My first ever comment in NDTV.  <br/><br/>
MNREGA is a disaster at least in TN.  In my village and in almost all part of TN, people work for 15 minutes and sleep for rest of the day and earn Rs. 170 per day.  Hard working people are getting spoiled with this useless scheme.  NDA should spend MNREGA money in rural infrastructure like building lakes, check dams, linking rivers via contractors and people getting jobs indirectly.  <br/><br/>
People did not vote for Modi to remind the bad things of UPA.  Had we wanted that, we would have voted for UPA directly.  Hope the current central government make swift changes to schemes that drains the coffin with no real improvement.

                            Well whats the point... Congress government ensured they wont allocate funds to TN... Whats with that side of the story?<br/><br/>
Neither Congress nor BJP is going to Resolve Cauvery Dispute...instead they are doubling up effort to build more DAM's in Karnataka to destroy 5000 Year old Farming lands.<br/><br/>
Who is bothered about Slow Murder of a civilization in cauvery belt, while farmers give up on farming. <br/>
What good will MNREGA will do.

                            MNREGA is structurally flawed.<br/><br/>
1) It is one way traffic of money being put into a pit without any feedback or need for feedback.<br/><br/>
2) It just robs taxpayers of money and disributes it to the politicians in the respective villages claiming panchayats to be gods.<br/><br/>
3) It creates what is referred to an "Asset Liability" mismatch and therefore can never be a self sustaining model. The assets that are created do not end up creating income??<br/><br/>
4) It is an open invitation for the corrupt, powerful and connected. Who gets the jobs, who get the money, how much money is the beneficiary paid? All these are breeding grounds for corruption. <br/><br/>
5) It destroys agricultural economy by creating artificial shortage of labour, not because it gives better income, but it just stops people from working productively and instead have 100 days of day out for a packet of biryani and a drink. All it ends up giving is just hangover. Effectively it ends up wasting 1 work day + one hangover day of productive agricultural work, thereby hurting agriculture.<br/><br/>
6)The BJP is unable to dump MNREGA not because they want to promote congress, but because they fear that if the corruption is stopped the corrupt, the powerful and the connected will manage to take votes away from them.<br/><br/>
7) MNREGA has increased the inflation and black economy by pumping cash mindlessly into the economy and created artificial liquidity.<br/><br/>
8) The only thing that i appreciate is the intent of NREGA to alleviate poverty. Unfortunately it is so structurally flawed that it has to be dumped for good. It is just feeding corrupt monsters

                            is it so difficult for the government to understand that to improve the condition of the poorest in India, the govt. has to provide the tools. the manual digging tools, the basket, naked torso and dirty dhoti --- is so "Mother India" that was 50 years ago. The government has to do better. Provide some clothes good for working outdoors, provide a Tata or Mahindra made "Digger" so the result is ten times better so you can increase the pay by 2 times. Tata and Mahindra will provide employment to 100,000 employees if you order 100,000 of those diggers . This way all the irrigation works can be finished - that were started 20 years ago ... and the farmers will have the water they need so much. Did i just say something miraculously genius which the Govt. cannot think about?
