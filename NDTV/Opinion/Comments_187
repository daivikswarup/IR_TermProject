                            I am glad I do  not live in the west. Back from where I come (India), our responsibilities are well defined though unwritten. The Man does all the tough jobs while the Lady manages the Home. No Male Chauvanism, but even after the metamorphosis that occurred gradually when the Indian woman became emancipated and started wearing the pants in the house, the husband continues to be the Mr. Fix-It while the lady is the Ms. Manage-it.
