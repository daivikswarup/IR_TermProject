                            Lol.....This article really cracked me up. Was this Derek's attempt at humor or the outcome of his boundless megalomania? Here's an idea....TMC should organize an award ceremony at WB's tax payer's expense and award all the categories to itself.

                            @Mayank R: they should make you the darvan to the award ceremony, because people like you who only criticize just for the heck of it only deserve that. If you don't like the man don't read his blogs. I'm guessing you have nothing to do in life in which case the darvan job should help. Cheers!

                            @baduwa: Derec, a long list! Add best R.T.I., best P.I.L., best sou moto, and a list of R.T.I.'s who is unanswered, and government's under whom cases transferred to other states.

                            Agree with you every bit Derek. If ever the awards you have suggested become official I think you should get the 'Party Spokesperson of the Year' award.

                            @Piyush Khandelwal: yes, in fact the awards should be only for movie stars and politicians who do something to serve the nation

                            I think it would be a great initiative to have awards of this nature as it would give MP's something additional to aspire for. As suggested by you sir, I would love to see an award given to an MP for most interaction with the general public.

                            Hi! Derek, I like what you are proposing. However, parties need to accept the need to collaborate with the govt on issues important to the country rather than continuously opposing it because of other considerations or different political ideologies - I would like to see an award for a party in opposition which best collaborated with the ruling party in getting a bill passed, an amendment executed or a pressing National issue resolved.

                            I think the Elections are like an Award ceremony in themselves, the best parties with the best candidates doing the better job win. Its more like a People's Choice Awards ceremony.

                            The idea is great. The awards put forward by you would really highlight and give the credit where it's due.Politicians are always frowned upon but eventually are the ones who make the state or country run the way it is. So why not award them for their excellence just like actors and cricketers.People like you sir are also considered major Youth Icons.

                            I follow your blog very closely Sir and it's very interesting to see the topics on which your articles are based. Addressing issues that most people think about but don't want to talk about out loud. It's nice that you shed light on these topics and you always have a very unique and charismatic writing style. Another great piece. Looking forward to the next.

                            These awards are a magnificent idea. They would give people from various parts of the country an idea about the positive achievements of the MP's that are running our country. Most MP's in our country do a lot of good for the public and for India. That is something they should be awarded for.
