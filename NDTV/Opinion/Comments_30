                            What is it to glorify a terrorist...what is it to remember on his death anniversary and call him a martyr. you are not going to understand,because you all are habituated of cheap petty politics irrespective of their concern to our national interests. Shame on your dirty politics.

                            Anti-nationals get support from COMMUNIST party of India. COMMUNIST PARTY is known for supporting enimes. Earlier it was Chaina got support and now PAK spys and PAK sponsored piousness snakes get support from COMMUNIST PARTY of India. All this drama by COMMUNIST PARTY is to get Muslim votes in West Bengal election. NDTV should write about this.

Still our system is very liberal with these people... There is no comparison between gandhi n nationa.  He was a great person but nation is above all... This is our mother land.  Correct ur self no other colleges or institution is supporting this only a few through political money.

                            One and only one answer, yes, it is sedition and it is an anti national protest, no matter how much you try to white wash it. We have been students too, Madam, so do not try to lecture us on what happened and the justification given by the students group tells it all. A party that used to take its orders from another country may fail to understand this.
