                            Different point of view is good for debate but don't interfere with something which is implemented already. why not concentrate and try to minimize illegal activities and catch law breakers. <br/><br/>
Frankly I don't see any substantive arguments in your article please do better research and added value to the discourse rather then simply floating some ideas/concepts.

                            Dear Nitin, <br/><br/>
One, We have a law that allows abortion in this country, until and unless in exceptional circumstances. So PCPNDT is not controlling a woman's reproductive rights. <br/><br/>
Two, Lets look at a scenario. A couple, who goes for sex-selection in today's circumstances, are highly likely doing it to detect if the child is a girl, with an intent to eliminate it if so. I am referring to the belts of Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab here particularly. When you create a situation where a couple can legally do this, it does two things; (1) put the woman's life at risk (2) promote unsafe abortion in a massive way <br/><br/>
Three, if at all such an idea comes into being, who will track? the anganwaadi worker is already working on an "honorarium" (not a salary, mind you) doing 21 tasks, each of it like a full time job. You will now add one more responsibility to a person neck deep in "responsibilities"<br/><br/>
Four, the current conviction rate in PCPNDT violations are next to pathetic. In cities like Delhji, almost nought. Now when you legalise it, and we will hear a spate of "accidents", "falls" that unintendedly lead to abortion. How will you prove the case against a man, or a family for aborting the child? With the current levels, do you think anyone will ever get convicted? <br/><br/>
It is unfortunate to go back to square one, at a point when we have made substantive progress in attacking a mindset that tends to eliminate a girl. I hope you change your mind.

                            I think more then a ban or lifting a ban it is the education and awareness that can change the scenario. The south Indian states did well because of the awareness programs ran by the state Govt and even in Haryana, though results are not very fruitful, state is now running financial and awareness programs.<br/><br/>
Remember, it is not just the education but both education and awareness that can get people rid of the Male child mentality. In a survey, educated people living in the cities were favoring a male child as their first child.

                            I feel more needs to be done to understand the different reasons behind the aversion to a girl child and work on them. The reasons are both social and economic and based on patriarchy.Traditions like wedding expenses being borne by the girl's father ( why can't the bride and groom's families share the expenses),the husband's family having all rights over the wife ( why shouldn't the wife be allowed to take care of her parents in the same manner as the husband does of his parents),beti is paraayi dhan etc.When these kinds of things are addressed,through discussions, media messages etc,some progress could be made.

                            Weak arguments. However I think Maneka Gandhi is right, but not applicable for Indian society. The point is sex determination takes place around 20-22 weeks after which abortion is illegal, so people 'could have been' informed about the gender of foetus after 22 weeks. But the problem is whether the pregnant woman will remain safe at home after declaring that she is having a girl child! Our expertise and finesse in executing domestic violence against women might ensure that she does not deliver the child, which is risky even for the mother. Often such choices are not made by the woman herself. Sometimes even modern women in India wear the hats of patriarchy! Strict prohibition of dowry, along side the other good works already done by the govt may work better in this situation.

                            A very radical way of looking at this social issue and the way our laws are created around it.  In any given situation, we see that a constructive control always works better than a negative enforcement.  I feel this way of announcing, protecting and appreciating a female baby would work better.<br/><br/>

                            Compulsory determination of foetal sex in my view,this could make the situation worse because the mindset of people in rural India is still v.backward, crime against woman is at all time high,news of dowry deaths,harassment, domestic etc,its hard to believe that regressive people would welcome a woman bearing girl child, they may try to PURPOSEFULLY HARM PREGNANT WOMEN,which not only can lead to accidental abortion but a threat to woman's life too. A doctor on some news channel was doubting on the practical viability of the process in the light of lack of infrastructure but, I strongly oppose the whole idea on the ground of WOMAN SECURITY.

                            It is a good idea in theory, but difficult to implement in a country where access to health care, especially mother and child care, is very uneven. Also chances of misuse, are that much the greater once prenatal sex determinations are made fully legal.

                            More often authors argue for allowing people to have their own choices such as eating whatever people want to eat. But they immediately contradict themselves by not allowing people to eat human child or terminate pregnancies that have female child. The ground reality is that people can't enjoy absolute freedom of choices. They can act freely only within the laws of the land.

                            I disagree with Makeka gandhi's approach completely. Why should an individual have to "register" each pregnancy with the state? That is an absurd interference in personal liberties. <br/><br/>
What if the pregnancy was un-intended - can the great Indian state really be trusted with this information? If a lady needs to go in for an abortion even as currently permitted - and the registered foetus is female - i can well imagine the harassment she will face from police and others to "prove" she was not going through the abortion just because the foetus is female. <br/><br/>
Doctors will again be responsible for ensuring such "registration". So the burden on doctors will not be any less. <br/><br/>
Maneka Gandhi should kindly think through such things before opening her mouth with grand new ideas....

                            In US, we are debating choice vs pro-life. which means that should a baby has right to get birth or its upto couple and thus there is certain restriction on abortion. But in India, there are other problems too due to which a girl child is not appreciated by everyone. Find out those reasons, and then give solution to each instead of forcing a girl child to born. What's the guarantee that even after birth, girl child would live a happy life? If govt could give aid in raising a girl child, could give them social security, equal rights, equal opportunities, and finally a complete ban on dowry by changing people's mindset. Then only this problem can be solved.After that we just need to think about whether it should be pro-life or choice? even if its choice, it won't be based on gender but on other factors.

As regards to your prediction of women becoming more valuable due to short supply in future doesn't qualify as one. Because, it has already become a fact right from a decade ago. People find it difficult to find brides both in our country as well as in our neighbor China.

Don't forget it's the same health professionals/workers as the ones doing underground business in current system who will be involved in keeping track and record of pregnancies.

                            Allowing sex determinations will allow for more female babies to die. The only way to stop it is through criminal punishments and creating social awareness on the ethics of this barbarous practice. Unfortunately, the law can be bribed and social issues like poverty, dowry, caste marriages, family honor are not being resolved and these social evils continue to work against the survival of the female child.

Even better solution is just to register every pregnancy, and monitor every aspect of women's health - incentivize low income families  with a payment per visit every alternate week. Important let  this be handled in private sector.
