                            Politicians go by the popular mood. They need votes. The fact that Republicans and Democrats are evenly poised most of the time shows that Republican perceptions are shared by a good percentage of Americans. Even in Republicans behave inappropriately, there are many who side with them. Like on gun control. Democracy is untidy, but it forces you to accept all types of views, even if those views disgust you.

                            Politics in the courts is as bad in the US, as it is in India! Only, they are not corrupt, unlike Indian judges, at all levels. For every honest justice, there are three corrupt justices! It's considered ok in India! Even acceptable! Unless you are caught, which is rare!
