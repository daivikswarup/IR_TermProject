                            There is no value for human life here. Why expect sympathy for a sea-living creature? It is a stuggle for majority of Indians to think beyond their homes, politics and movies. Iam happy atleast someone took notice to write about this. I personally felt like losing a friend. And not many would understand what I mean.<br/><br/>
Thanks NDTV for publishing this article. This is responsible journalism.

                            As the author said, other nations too are novice in handling such instances with no protocol and training in place. But as each crisis throws up new learning / opportunity; new laws and governance model should be framed. RIP blue whale.

                            We Indians have no empathy for animals. I daresay half of those thugs would even be vegetarian. God, if we can't even treat utterly defenceless animals proper (like this Hidutva government permitting catching snakes for nag panchami), how are we even going to be considerate to fellow humans?!

You can get such crowd only in India. Half trying to help the whale to swim back in sea and other half making its life distressful!

                            I thought most of the comments would be on how bad they felt at our helplessness, and how all the nations must come together and solve the problem.<br/><br/>
But, No, even this needs a political and religious discussion. Wow! If we can't even the Blue Whale out of it, then you know we have gone too far.<br/><br/>
I ask all of us to climb out of our deep holes, and take some action.

                            Nobody can avoid death and that is the real beauty of this world, even God has to die when time comes. Whale has come to shore to die and it is cruelty not allow whale to die peacefully and put under medical torture in the name of saving life. Animal do not scare to die like humans and they also do not exploit or kill innocent to secure sit in haven.

                            As per the author, If the creature is very big, then that must be protected.  Why can't the author show same kind of concern for cows/pigs which are killed every day in India. She tries too hard to come across as different thinker. Nothing will change and the author will continue with her normal day to day work life thinking she has scored some,brownie points by writing first about unique incident.

                            I totally recognize the fact that we had no protocol to safeguard this poor whale over the beach and probably all the efforts that could have made were futile. But another side of it that appalled me to the core is the insensitivity and indifference towards ones sufferings and making a show out of it. <br/>
While we as pople stand road side, make videos, take selfies and see another human die in dire need of help, what can we expect in this case is anyone's guess.<br/>
Not even humans who take birth in this land of utter indifference and discord with fellow human being sufferings, even the animals who are washed to its shore are also doomed to suffer same fate. Quite an Indian trait.!

                            Similar incident happened here in Gothenburg, Sweden many years ago... A dead whale was found on the shores and the Swedish government made it a point to have this dead whale in a nature historic museum... Eventuality has happened... Fate of the whale is decided... But can't we do the same in India and store it in museum?????
