                            Recently, I dropped my iPhone 6 and cracked the screen. I checked up with the local phone repairer and he quoted me AUD 190 for a third-party screen and AUD 220 for a genuine apple screen. Apple store itself which was about 50 mins away quoted me AUD 170. It was a no-brainer and I had the Apple store fix the screen for me. However, if I ever have to encounter that error 53 for any reason that bricks my phone, that will be it for me. As much as I have avoided switching to Android, I will definitely then make the switch.
