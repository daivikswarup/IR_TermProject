                            Kolkata had all the infra it needed to be a mega city post independence, but the lazy commies and their downright stupid policies screwed it rotten. To top it off the people elected them over and over again. Now it is just a namesake metro with the political leadership unwilling to do the right thing but instead pander to the votebanks. And there's no hope of change anytime soon..Dream on Derek..

                            Derek O'Brien, who played the lead in disrupting parliament is now trying to establishment the credibility of his state!  If this wasn't so sad it would be laughable.  The luminaries present at the summit were there by way of duty rather that freewill.  Priti Patel also welcomed Modi at the House of Commons in the UK.  O'Brien is perhaps too stupid to realise that Priti is a Gujarati and it was O'Brien who publicly called Modi the 'Butcher of Gujarat'.  Why no mention of the terrible Muslim riots in Malda which his boss tried to pass off as a dispute between the BSF and locals.  She insulted the BSF whose personnel lay their lives on the line to protect India.  It is only a question of time before the public ask for heads to roll in the Sarada scam.  All in all, a poor attempt to whitewash the perils the state faces under an incompetent Mamata aided by goons like Derek who do India tremendous harm by their activities in the National parliament!

                            It takes decades to build credibility. Derek, individually well educated, lost all his credibility in Parliament, by Kejriwal chhap (brand) comments. And with this blog, his intellectuals also in doubt. No depth in writing, its just like secondary school's essay... My visit to trade fair !!!

                            Neither has Bengal come a long way, nor will it ever go a long way forward. It is true that the left, especially CPM ruined Bengal's industries during its 33 long years in power. Mamata and TMC are no better. She showed her true colors when she made it impossible for the Tata's to function in Singur. The true state of Bengal was exposed by the Calcutta High Court when it wondered who would come and open industries in God forsaken Bengal. Only fools will expect the BGBS 2016 to yield anything. O'Brien is as usual living in a fools paradise. Even if Mamata wins the Assembly polls, Bengal's backward slide will not stop. And with Kejriwal as Mamata's BFF, the future can be easily predicted.

                            it is intreting that kejriwal used to abuse mukesh ambani  and  mamatadi always against any investment suddenly find virtue in investment and mr brien sees merit. industrialists are more experienced in dealing with all type of politicians and they will invest only if they are comfortable and feel safe abt new investments.

                            Really like the optimism of Derek. Heartbreaking to see and intelligent person like him defying logic while represent TMC and presenting such thoughts - while knowing the ground reality of West Bengal. A certain waste of talent - but again power corrupts and makes people have crazy points of view.

                            In a state which borrows from the market and organises functions, where street food is called an industry only hard times lie ahead. So much money is spent on populist policies that is gnawing this debt heavy state.

                            It is true when Derek says that,"We have miles to go but we have come a long way". Bengal is still recovering from the ills that were caused by the Left govt. and the pre-election riot strategy used by the BJP. Amidst all the problems, major developments are underway, but still the "BJP Paid Trolls" are hellbound on stopping these developments in Bengal. We must get rid of these outsiders who don't care about us and more about their party coming to power an taking over Bengal. What development has Modiji done? Ache din kab aaye aur gaye? Yeh toh pata hi nahi chala. People of Bengal unite and chase these BJP &amp; Left government goons away from our state before its too late.

Anyway it is going sign at least Bengal at last understands the importance of business.  This even didn't get much publicity, When Modi did it in Gujarat, everybody talked about this.

Bengal Business Summit has shown that there are people who want to do business in Bengal, so economical growth and business booming in Bengal is great news, being a business person myself its good to see the upward growth of West Bengal.

                            We have miles to go, but we have come a long way. Very honest view of West Bengal. Over the last 2-3 years there has been a marked improvement in both Kolkata and West Bengal, as far as quality of living. This will naturally lead to an improved business environment. In fact New Town/Rajarhat area is very similar to IT hubs such as Gurgaon. Bengal seems to be on the right track - good luck Derek and your team.

                            I hear a lot of talk on business class seats that will not be occupied, thus direct flights to EU and US not provided to Kolkata. I want to understand if more than 20% seats of these flights ex Delhi / Mumbai are business !.. thus 80% seats are economy only. <br/>
Corporate sector employees mostly travel in economy seats, only top level corporate officials along with business / entrepreneurs travel business. Kolkata has surely less of that since companies have HQ in Delhi / Mumbai, but lot of seats for US / EU ex our Delhi &amp; Mumbai are filled up by traffic from east (surely Kolkata). <br/>
Thus govt. must make more attempts to change perceptions of airlines and introduce direct flights ... which will boost the image of the state and improve arrival of foreign tourists to this region.
