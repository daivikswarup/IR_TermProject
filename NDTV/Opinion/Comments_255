Unfortunately you do not even understand the pain points of your country folks. Not every Indian is as rich as you and not every indian is as poor as the communist want to believe. There are other folks and they have emotions too.

                            Congress cannot talk about intolerance. They support anti nationals under the excuse of supporting free speech. A few years ago when Katrina Kaif compared herself to Rahul Gandhi saying that she too is of mixed Indian and non-Indian parentage like Rahul Gandhi, entire congress party created trouble for Katrina by their intolerance.

However, studying in an university that is funded almost entirely by the tax payers (given the students at JNU pay Rs. 500 a year as tuition fees), I'd expect the students to be a little thankful, to say the least, to the tax payers (read: people of the country and hence the country itself). Also, asking for the destruction of the country doesn't count as dissent and is the very definition of sedition.

First you talk about revision of Sedition law, which indicates that under current law whatever happened in JNU is valid to be tried in court. Secondly you talked about universities meant to be hotbeds of argument, debate and dissent rather than centers of conformity.<br/><br/>
Agreed, but, you cleverly didn't expanded what level of dissent is ok? Is dissent against one's own nation is also ok for you?<br/><br/>
As i see it, all the anti-modi brigade is trying to hang on to each and every remote thing happening in the country and trying to attribute it against Mr.Modi.<br/><br/>
while conveniently quoting Rohit, You happily ignored to talk about the last paragraph of Rohit Vemula's letter that's been struck off. Why? Because it doesn't suit you and your party?<br/><br/>
I wish you also wrote a few lines in your column about Emergency and Delhi Riots which are symbols of intolerance of congress's regime to see things in perspective.

                            It's quite worrying how this whole episode has quickly been spun into an 'anti-dissent' debate. About dissent being labelled 'anti-national'. About freedom of speech being labelled 'anti-national'. All of course, by the BJP and therefore, by extension, the great unwashed un-intellectual.<br/><br/>
I might be limited in what I know and understand thanks to some heavy leg-spin. But what I understand is that a call for 'bharat ki barbadi', is anti-national, not dissent. A call for 'bharat ke tukde-tukde kar denge' is anti-national, not dissent. A call for 'Afzal Gurus in every home', is anti-national, not dissent.<br/><br/>
According to you, the government should "take a few 'allegedly' anti-national slogans in stride". Doesn't that strike even you, as a little casual? The Congress and Abhishek Singhvi went red in the face about Javier Moro's Red Sari and Sonia Gandhi's privacy. Why couldn't you 'take that in stride'? So malice about Sonia Gandhi, serious issue; malice about India, not so serious. Doesn't that sound too selective?<br/><br/>
Have done by SFI stint as well, Mr. Tharoor. And in a reasonably 'free' University of Kerala. But let me tell you this, if I had raised slogans like these on my campuses, neither the SFI nor the faculties, would have tolerated it. Maybe they were not intellectual enough. Or, maybe they knew where 'freedom of speech' ended and where the next guy's nose began.

A democracy needs all kinds of ideas from every sphere of class/region/section of the country, but if one of the sections is a staunch supporter of an Orwellian system of governance which aims to overthrow democracy, it is certainly not needed/wanted at the table.<br/><br/>
There is not a single genuine Communist state in the world today. Not a single one. Because the philosophy of Mao/Communism, as awesome as it might be to read and understand, can never ever be practically implemented without it devolving into an authoritarian, oppressive regime. <br/><br/>
Any leftist party which does not even want democracy, let alone work within it's framework, should not be allowed to function.

A person as eloquent as you should know the difference between secessionism and dissent. What the students resorted to is the former. Do not play around with words. The logic that the Indian state is too big to be impacted by a few anti-national slogans is ridiculous and downright dangerous coming from someone like you. I ask you, why dont u then extend the same logic to Hafeez Saeed?? After all he is also "only talking about Indias breaking up" - that too from across the border. Similarly why do we object to Pakistan's raising of Kashmir issue in international fora?? That is also "only talk" right? The second ridiculous argument in the way you try to paint these morons as "political opponents". You know better than that Mr Tharoor. Don't think that you are the only intelligent person who can play with words and everyone else is a yokel. Absolutely worst article of political one upmanship and I have lost whatever little respect I had for you.

                            Everyone is entitled to their opinion including Tharoor. However when a law stands in the statute books it is incumbent upon the government to enforce it. Amend it by all means, but until then you have to abide by it. If raising slogans against India and for Afzal Guru, not to speak of independence for Kashmir, is not anti-national, it is better left to Tharoor to define that term. The right to freedom of expression, as well as the right to dissent, have certain limitations. One of those limitations is defined by the sedition law. So all Indians, including JNU students and Tharoor, have to observe those limits.

                            You were expected to be a bit better than in reasoning that the others from the 'Secularism &amp; Intellectual' brigade. But reading through the article, you seem to come out with the same set of arguments and same rhetoric with much of substance. Lately, through debates on news channels, there is an deliberate attempt to show the govt 'anti-dalit' or 'anti-student' which really is an attempt to disrupt peace in the country by the Left and Congress and nothing else. <br/>
I am amused by the way some so called 'intellect' students from JNU come to debates and talk as if the the whole lot of intelligent and upright students are only found in JNU and students from other universities are dumb. JNU is just another university like many other universities spread across the country and which are way too good in the quality of education as well as the level of political debates. A small group of JNU students have started thinking themselves to be torch bearers of 'free speech'.  Its this very leftist group which is at forefront of opposing any other idea than what they feel is correct.<br/>
The basic problem in the 'intolerance' debate that is going on since last 6-8 months is Modi's  popularity. The opposition is desperately trying to create a atmosphere of friction and discontent. In this case they have gone a bit too far by trying to protect students giving anti-india slogans. I believe the govt will come out stronger through this and work towards development instead of falling in oppositions trap to derail development.<br/>
BTW, I have seen many 'intellects' including Mr. Tharoor making comparison with 'Hitler' and 'Nazizm'. But they forget that the very fact that they are able to talk this proves that they are not correct. Otherwise they would already have been put in gas chambers forget debating and blogging.<br/>
So chill and let the elected govt function. The more you do all these tactics the more people like me get reassured that we have elected the right people.

You are accepting that the students who were chanting anti-national slogans were misguided and did not know what they were doing. currently, there is an immense danger of ISIS invasion/expansion looming over India and by turning a blind eye to any anti-national activity may be translated as promoting the act. Congress and its leaders like you have done a great job of playing a caste based and divisive politics at the interest of Indian security. <br/>
ISIS, LeT and other terrorist organizations were not not so potent decades ago when your JNU colleagues shared anti-national sentiments with you. It must have dawned upon them that it was not proper and they must have reformed their ways. Why it pains you to see them as true nationalists. <br/>
It is high time that all the Indian unite to fight terrorism and students like Umar should be  punished for their brazen act of insulting India and its loyal citizens.  <br/>
I am a proud Indian and have seen enough to ascertain how much freedom can be practiced in other countries. <br/>

                            The facts here are being twisted to spread confusion and gloss over the main point of argument. I don't think the government is stifling dissent. It is only objecting to the slogans demanding for breakup of the country, glorifying the actions of a person who was associated with the attack on the Parliament of our democratic country which also upholds various freedoms given to the citizens. The person, Afzal Guru, was given all the options to defend his actions and when he could not convince the Supreme Court and the Hon'ble President of India, only then was he hanged. Since this hanging has constitutional sanctity, calling it a murder by the Government is wrong. <br/><br/>
Second point is that if curtailing freedom of speech spanks of emergency like conditions, I would say that talking about breaking and destroying the country is emergency like situation.<br/><br/>
Here, I would like to point out that JNU is a crucible for bureaucrats of the country on account of the number of students who go on to clear the Civil Services Exam and occupy high posts, are involved in policy and decision making, etc. If the anti national feeling is allowed to assimilate in the students, I feel that such persons who go on to occupy senior posts in the Union and State Governments cannot work for the unity of the country.<br/><br/>
So the sooner such feelings are nipped in the bud, the better it will be for the country. One other option is that anybody who has been associated with JNU in any way should be, as an ample precaution, not be allowed to join Government service at any level for you don't know to what extent that person's character has been moulded by these anti-India elements.

Where knowledge is free<br/>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br/>
By narrow domestic walls<br/>
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br/>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br/>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br/>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br/>
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br/>
Into ever-widening thought and action<br/>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.<br/><br/>

                            At the out let me say I am all for free speech even without the reasonable restriction clause only then a society will mature debating every facet of human life and endeavor.  Tow people can have diametrically opposite views on a subject but remain good friends. That what I believe in. But Mr Sashi Tharoor what is playing out is a on JNU campus is rooted in what happened over the years since independence. We have famously got into the business of banning and not tolerating difference of opinion. <br/><br/>
Lets for Instant take that the police and Government kept quite and ignore what happened on the JNU camps of celebrating Azsal Guru the same Congress or some other party will create a scene saying such things are happening in the Country's Capital. <br/><br/>
Free Speech does not screaming and shouting and celebrating a convict. It means that a mature debate can be had in a forum to discuss and say whether the Death sentence handout to Aszal Guru was right or wrong and may be even writing article saying that there has been an error in judgement. <br/><br/>
Ancient India had this free speech and that is depicted in the scriptures and writing.

                            Sir this line of argument is as bad as what Congress did all these years and what we are suffering now. Be it reservation policy, Banking. You are setting a wrong president in asking to release. DO NOT object to rule of law. There are thousands of cases police file on a day to day basis in India and ultimately the court decide which is to be taken up or not. You are aware of the success rate of the police which is abysmally low. So let court decide, you never know the material and evidence police has. If police has erred and court decides to group charges so be it. We are NOT a banana republic and please do not make it one by joining hands with Maoist and Far Left ideologue, their agenda is far too worse than may be ISIS

                            To be frank I agree with shashi on many policies and stuff but not on this. He says the campus is for dissent which I agree but not to the extent of shouting Anti India slogans. There is a difference between challenging the govt and challenging the nation. Freedom of speech and stuff works when you go against the ruling party or when you don't agree with them and are critical of them.  But shouting slogans against your own country is not dissent.. It's more than that.. <br/>
The student leaders too agree that there were slogans raised against India.. If they dint do it then they need to help the police in tracking down the culprits. There is no need for this much hype around the issue.

                            Dr. Tharoor if the ideology of these students were the majority [of students] view then leftists would have been in power in many states &amp; centre. More over there is a pattern in these institutes. Since 'the great Nurul Hassan' the left ideology has taken control of the institutes like JNU, IHRC etc and as a whole the intellectual space of India.Since then in JNU the faculties has created an ecosystem which helps teachers/students of the left ideology and they get absorbed within the ecosystem and thus the ideology keep its hold on the institute. Same can be said about Kanhaiya, with MA from a dubious 'Nalanda open univ' with no track record of brilliance gets a chance to do PhD in JNU because of his &amp; his family's ideological track record. Btw, what is the rank of JNU as a univ in India &amp; world? By chest thumping 'its a world class univ' does not make it one.

This is nothing but toeing the party line which is heel bent on converting a debate on whether students have a right to raise slogans propagating break up of the country to dissent. This most unfortunate that the last sane voice in Congress is also getting manipulated or coerced by the dynastic mother son duo.

However, one very important thing that you often forget shows your duplicity on the issue of Freedom of Speech and Expression. I am sure you understand with Great Freedom comes Great Responsibility. This is the cornerstone of Freedom and independence. In the zeal to prove Modi wrong, you and your party have towed a very dangerous line and on a really slippery slope now. If discussion was the real outcome of a gathering, it would not go into sloganeering and most importantly cries for the nations doom. So get your head out of whatever the place it is buried in and take corrective action. Keeping the nation together is everybody's responsibility even those who sit in the opposition have a duty to the nation.

His ability to write and speak in eloquent english.That is impressing all these media intellectuals to give him this space. In reality How cruelly intellectual  these intellectuals are?

                            Few facts which are generally misrepresented by Media for some reason :<br/>
1. No one is charged yet including Kanhaiya; only FIRs have been booked. No one told he is a terrorist. In fact, police had even told they will not contest his bail plea.<br/>
2. No one responsible is telling that JNU is terrorist hub...media might be quoting chotu leader<br/>
3. Kanhaiya is arrested because he was the president and leading the event. Also his family came out and told that he is feeling safe and police protected him. So others cannot justify reason of not having security to surrender to police.<br/>
4. Delhi police went inside JNU on the request of Vice Chancellor and not barged in (though they can and should have).<br/>
5. For people who are disputing slogan shouting, we know that posters were put for a cultural festival to protest on Afzal Guru's death anniversary for his "judicial killing". This is despite permission for the program had been withdrawn. In such an event one can expect Anti-India slogans. Initially organizers said ABVP guys did that to corner them. Do they have any proof for that ??<br/>
6. Media is wrong in equating Bathla House scuffle with Anti-India slogan shouting in JNU. Hand on their heart, do they really believe that both are similar ?? There is major difference in gravity of crime for an AAM AADMI.<br/>
7. Why can't media and so called intellectuals allow police to do their job ?? It is quite obvious that they need to question certain leaders including Kanhaiya. So what is wrong if they are arrested....wait until they frame charges at least if at all. Also have faith in judiciary.

                            Mr. Tharoor,<br/>
If dissent is accepted in a democracy, anti national uttering are given the mask of dissent, think of those soldiers who die in the front line. What for they should sacrifice their life and defend the so called democrats?

                            We know that the biggest threat facing the world today is terrorism. It just so happens, that most of this terrorism emanates from pakistan. Therefore, slogans, such as 'Pakistan Zindabad', coupled with "India Murdabad', 'Bharat Ki Barbadi Tak Jung Rahegi, Jung Rahegi' and calls for the destruction, dismemberment and downfall of India, especially when these slogans are directed at university students by people in positions of authority, should set the alarm bells ringing throughout India, which has frequently been the target of terrorism, especially from pakistan.  Instead of condemning activities which in the prevailing atmosphere in the world today, certainly appear to have terrorist overtones and cannot be ruled out as mere 'dissent', and isolating them as incidents which must be a subject of further investigation to see if there is a link to other universities across the nation as well, the Indian media has chosen to mix two completely different issues, and not only completely marginalise the main issue, which is incitement to hatred and a call to war against India, but also thrown a very dangerous red herring amongst the entire student community!! The seeds of terrorism begin with mullahs in pakistan raising similar rousing slogans, aimed at people of university going age, leading to attacks such as the ones in Mumbai and on the Indian Parliament, which have resulted in the loss of many innocent lives.

                            So, Mr Tharoor, the people who shelter terrorists but do not kill by themselves can also claim they are merely "dissenting" can't they? These liberal pillars of freedom, the JNUs and the other universities that teem with Left and Congress- aligned, so-called "?liberals" who now cry out for "freedom of speech" and the right to dissent, had no qualms forcing a Baba Ramdev off the campus, heckling the people who arranged his visit until the authorities caved in.<br/><br/>
Is the Freedom of Speech and Right to Dissent, so narrowly defined that what you term right must be heard and other voices drowned in your cacaphony?

                            You showed your true colours. Politicising national issue is not acceptable, you are pathetic. He raised anti national slogans and most importantly and he was misguiding his peers for this thoughts. This is intolerable, we can discuss any topics but anti national stuff.

                            Shouting "Break India into 1000 pieces" is 'dissent'? If you think it is 'dissent', there's something seriously wrong with you. If it is not 'dissent', then your whole article is worthless.
