                            "Unable as yet to show anything concrete against Rajender Kumar, the CBI continues to grill him all day long, telling reporters that they will present all their "evidence'' in court."<br/><br/>
How does anyone know, other than those investigating, what evidence they have? And because we don't know it, would be unwise to jump to conclusions about whether they have anything concrete or not. To whom should the evidence be presented, if not to the courts? Surely not the media or public. <br/><br/>
"They also claim they were right in law when they didn't tell Kejriwal that they were raiding and booking his aide."<br/><br/>
Its not a claim, it is the law. There is a court order to back them, that they need not inform anyone. Where does the author get this information about informing bosses? It may have been there earlier but after the court ruling, has made it redundant. One would expect relatively experienced media people to know such basic facts.<br/><br/>
Its easy to bash investigative agencies and govt servants. They are not permitted to respond. Canon fodder for those who wish to criticise.

Why didn't he do background checks. He political capital is anti-corruption. Yet, AAP is the only government where within a year so many party people have been clearly indicted of frauds and misdemeanors !! Confrontational attitude and anarchic tendencies doesn't help in India for long. There was widespread anger against UPA-II and this was cashed in by both AAP in Delhi and BJP in India. Even PM Modi realizes it by now. Ordinary Indians want politicians to debate, discuss and dissent to build up public support for respective parties over 5 years, whether you are in opposition or if you are in government. <br/>
AAP has the bad habit of filing wild baseless allegations against anyone.

Whether CBI raid was conducted in a shoddy manner or not , it is only  a reflection of the lack of professionalism of the officers on duty on that day, Why is she not talking anything about Kejariwal's accusation that the raid is linked to the proposed DDCA enquiry? CBI did not take any files relating to that. Nothing stops  Kejariwal from continuing the enquiry after the raid ????? If Kejariwal chooses not to investigate it after the raid it only means that there was no such enquiry and he is just throwing some dirt at a person in power to cover his actions!!  Nothing about this from the author but she knows precise details of the bank balance of the IAS officer and the exact time  many years ago of the crime committed by him. If this is not a biased article, what is????

Calling Modi in personal terms with offensive words like Psychopath only indicates the kind of professionalism AK is demonstrating. He made allegations on everyone he doesnt like. Incidentally the number of Non-BJP people is quite less. Can we the people have a right to believe that AK has an agenda?  For him, Rahul,Sonia, Shiela Dixit, Chidambaram, Lalu, Mulayam are all honest while anyone under Modi and Modi himself are corrupt, power hungry and psychopaths.
