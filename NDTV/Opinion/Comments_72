                            Swati, <br/>
Very touching article...we can as if feel the pain reading thru this...Your attempt to decipher the reasons for soo many of them to beach together provides some solace as since y'day I am trying hard to search/understand why this happened..!!?<br/><br/>
I am humbled to know about the "Whale values" as you describe vividly in your article of staying-put together to reach out to a dying/sick one, even at the cost of death of the entire pod...!! This, for sure reminds us of similar Human Values we once used to have..!!<br/><br/>
Many thanks...you article has provided a small healing after witnessing this very difficult news y'day...!!<br/><br/><br/>

                            She cleverly hid the real reason. Koodankulam Nuclear Plant. And this is intention of the article too, To divert us to other petty reasons while the major culprit escapes under our noses.

                            Touching. These are highly intelligent, evolved and loving mammals. Saddened by their suicides. Happy to note the local fishermen stayed up all night trying to push them back into the sea.

                            There is definitely room for research to figure if any human activity is causing these events. I keep hearing we are going through a mass extinction phase of species some of which is indirectly related to human activity due the climate change. The Paris summit has given some hope of positive action on climate change but there may be other activities that we need to look at closely. For example recently the Obama administration banned the use of plastic micro beads that were becoming a major source of riverine and marine pollution

                            Swati, A major cause for mass beaching by dolphins and whales around the world is disorientation caused by rampant use of sonar during naval exercises. Perhaps, you or the press in general should pursue this to see if Indian/Chinese or some other navy conducting major drills in the area. <br/>

                            Just like Delhites suffering to smoke inhalation, probably these poor whales also suffered of water pollution. Like Car horns that kolkatans suffer, probably these whales also suffer Gulf of Mannar seafarers traffic, like Mubaikars suffering in kalyan-Kurla local train these fishes probably suffered fishing by India srilanka excessive fishing trawlers. They are like us silently suffering for no mistake of theirs.
