                            Why do you journalists opiniate on the topics of national security when you have little or no clue about it. In this article you undermined the Government of India, Supreme court and as well as the people of India. You feel(because you have space to write) that you know how to deal with terrorists better than the professional institutions of a country. I'll tell you a thing, go write about movies, leave national security with the right people with right mindset.

                            So according to author we should not punish terrorist fearing repercussions arising out of giving justice to innocent lives lost ?<br/><br/>
All terrorists should be meted out capital punishment because of the innocent people killed in their terrorist operation. They are testing our limits but the day will come when our army will go and kill them from their rat holes.

                            What a silly argument is this about hijack situations! You want law that doesn't allow negotiation with terrorists and when hijacking takes place you will be the first one to shout for the safety of the people hijacked and play politics over it. There is no point in keeping terrorists alive in jail as it will give opportunity to their groups to plan hijacking and try getting out their partners by putting pressure on government directly as well as through their sleeper cells - namely 5-star human right activists, left intellectuals, award wapsi authors, terrorist sympathizer journalists and media celebrities and finally the secular brigade of politicians.<br/>
Even if you don't punish terrorists with death penalty they will continue with their killings, so no need to be sympathetic to terrorists. Those who don't know the value of life don't deserve to be kept alive.

                            A stupid argument. Both Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab were terrorists who were tried under Indian law for crimes committed in India against Indians. They received the full benefit of the law that their victims did not. If some other terrorists come here to avenge their executions, they also needed to be killed which was duly done by the security forces. For foolish supporters of terrorists like this article's author, a quick referral to the psychiatric ward of a mental institution is an urgent necessity. NDTV should be very careful of the people it accepts opinion pieces from. This borders on treason.

                            Terrorists are not attacking our country &amp; killing our people because of capital punishment. And no, it's also not because we are hanging terrorists. It's because their holy book teaches them to kill kefir's. Kefir's are anyone who is not a muslim. <br/><br/>
ISIS flags in kashmir prove that kashmir stopped being about freedom from India long back. Today the Kashmir issue is about muslim majority neither wanting non-muslims in the state nor wanting to be under Hindu India. This is the fact. <br/><br/>
I am not sure if this post will get approved but this is the fact. We can fight terror only when we realise why ti's happening to us. We can do aman ki asha till eternity and it's not going to bring us peace. Let us understand that Islam is getting more violent and intolerant by the minute and that we will be attacked no matter what we do. Instead of trying to find peace with the muslim's of this world, lets fortify our defences.

                            Dear Mr. Shivam! In case the attack on Indian consulate in Kandhar and the Airforce base in Patuhankote was the result of Afzal Guru's hanging, can you kindly enlighten us what was the alibi for the terrorists to kill innocent civilians including a three month old child in Wandhma village in Kashmir some time back. How long can fool ourselves into believing that when they slap us, we should offer the other cheek to keep them in 'good homour' and be kind enough to spare us from the thousand cuts, which they believe should be inflicted on 'infidel' India. Common wake up and smell the coffee. According to Abraham Lincoln ' if there were no God, we would invent one'. On the same analogy if there was no Afzal guru hanging, the self appointed apostles of 'piety' and the proponents of medieval barbarian justice would have found some other excuse to get at our throats. Have no doubts about it.

Instead, I propose we should make ourselves stronger and should not permit these people to come uninvited and harm anytime they feel like.  Look at Israel, how they have prepared themselves.  We should give out an unambiguous message that such activities will not be tolerated and we should demonstrate our strength.  Politicians and journalists should control themselves from being extra-humane.  We are not the only saviors of humanity.

Having said that the his family was not able to meet him one final time is a heartening reality that should not have happened.<br/><br/>

Bloggers like Mr. Vij can gloss over in self-esteem by writing high flying prose, but i wish he had looked at the history and found out how this country has suffered over centuries at the hands of marauders for exhibiting the kind of meakness - the writer wants us to. Mr. Vij do you have the cheek to go and talk about your high morals to the family of Lt. Col Niranjan, who was killed a few days back. If not, please keep your great ideas to yourself and do not harm the resolve of this country to talk to terrorist in the only language they understand. Right?

                            Why are we accusing the writer, it is the view of the channel and it doesn't want its views told by its people, so they get somebody who is nobody and make him write this stuff.

                            Please note: by keeping terrorist locked up in prison, besides running the risk of hostage crisis there is also huge cost implication to maintain these guys in Prison, which the tax payer like you and me will have to bear. And this money spent is at the cost of government investments in our primary education sector, healthcare, infrastructure....lets us tax money for the development of our country and not to spend on terrorist who are mass murderers

                            If it were not Afzal guru's hanging , it would be the demolition of Babri Masjid, or The persecution of Muslims in Myanmar, or Partition , or the creation of Bangladesh or some Danish cartoon or the calumny of the West, or the the prophet being maligned.<br/>
It seems Muslims needs little or no reason to create chaos and conflict all the time often times for decades !!.<br/>
And with many other bozos like Shivam Vij around as apologists to create stories &amp; conspiracies...i suppose the Holy war can go on forever.

                            Shivam you have raised very important points but you will targeted compromising on national security and concious. But where this concious evaporates when nothing happens on the killing of thousands? This leads to alienation nit only in Kashmir but many parts of the country. <br/>
The ruling elite has made this game for 68 years. This is the reason no leader except AAP goes out without the Z Security but the people gets divided and vulnerable. The vicious cycle goes on.

                            While India pats itself on the back as secular and tolerant country. Lot of issues it faces are also because it chose not to be a Hindu State or a modern Hindu state as per the rules of partition. Pakistan continues to have a temptation to weaken India and pockets of India where Hindus are not safe. India comes across as a soft state and Hindus as a soft target. Unless we get out of this mind-set, we continue to be vulnerable. Unfortunately state-craft does not necessarily reward nice people and nice nations. They respect only strength and readiness to use power.

We need to learn from Israel from this context to save the Sovernighty of the Country.  If your arguement is taken we dont require  Army . We can just keep silent on who ever attack us because we are afraid if we retaliate they might again attack us. Strongly condemn this type of approach.

From where did SC gauged the COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE? From the number trolls on internet comments or twitter comments?<br/>
C'mon guys! If the SC uses the sentences such as 'COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE' and 'COLLECTIVE BELIEF' [Aasta ka Vishay] or something to that effect in Babri/RJB verdict shows how our judiciary works. <br/>

                            During the State of the Union address Obama further said: "If you doubt America's commitment - or mine - to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of Al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell.  When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit." This is what India needs to do .. not not hang the  terrorists.

                            It will be a great idea to let the  media and journalists take decisions on governance! This will reduce expenditure on elections, avoid having politicians ruling us and make sure nothing is criticised. Wait I forgot what if different media start fighting among themselves!!!

Seriously dude! You think you will shove your sickular agenda in the garb of your opposition to capital punishment and no one will notice? You are exposed. You are not only sickular, you are also a coward. It is our slow judicial system and crazy media that made Afzal Guru a martyr. He was proven a militant but it took so long and sold out media spinned it so well that made him an attractive figure for militants across the border. Let us say, his case has a strand of doubt but you have no shame in defending Ajmal Kasab as well! You are a pathetic spineless coward and shameless sickular.

                            I feel that the author has started his article in wrong way. But when I read the complete article, I understood what he wanted to convey. In simple language he is opposing the idea of hanging the people and try to deradicalize the terrorists captured by Indian agencies. This is the way we can give the perfect answer to Hafeez Sayeed and Co. I agree with him but its require long transformation in our judicial system which is quite unlikely.
