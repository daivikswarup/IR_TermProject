                            The only courageous and righteous voice in the present turmoil and insanity. <br/><br/>
The rabid goons and pseudo patriots do not know that almost all genocides are always carried out in the name of nationalism. <br/>
The modus operandi is same- spread rumours about sects/race, shame them and then systematically eliminate them in the guise of nationalism.<br/><br/>
The exact same thing has happened in Indonesia in 1965 and the so called killers after slaughtering 1 million people by first spreading rumours that communism will spoil Islam and that they are anti-nationals. The political party or army did not carry out the massacre but instead it only spread "pseudo nationalism" and false rumours. This led to brutal slaughtering by vigilantes (protected by army). The entire population of people with PKI party and relatives were exterminated.( Award winning documentary- The Act of Killing, read on massacres in Indonesia). <br/>
The same happened in Rwanda.<br/>
The same happened in Germany, Poland etc.<br/>
Gujarat riots (police did not act) and Babri masjid (police stood silent during the demolition), Lawyers Act at Patiala court (police stood silent).<br/>
If we dont learn and act then this will be the beginning of the end of country as we know it. It will become Saudi Arabia but instead of Wahhabis we will be having our own extreme right.This change happens very slowly till its too late.<br/>
There is a right to dissent for everyone-- for example Kashmir(our media has double standards on this) is witnessing terrible human rights violations (yes, what happened to Kashmiri  Pandits was also wrong), people in north east are tortured and killed, tribal people in many parts are dissenters.<br/>
The ideal way is to engage with them and sort out their problems and have empathy not hatred as long as the means are non violent. Remember one person's terrorist could be other patriot. All great personalities in freedom struggle for India were labelled terrorists or anti nationals.<br/>
Many of those are not as fortunate as us. <br/>
Patriotism comes when the nation gives all the rights to everyone including education, foe, healthcare, no discrimination etc.<br/>
Till the time this doesn't happen we have to engage in dialogue and as patriotic persons we should ensure that they also get all the rights as our people in Delhi and metro.

                            I think some of the anchors are having high sugar levels. That is why they keep shouting in anger. I doubt they even care to listen to the responses to their questions. Someone needs to show them how they look and sound when they host these shows. Its obvious which anchors I am hinting at. Some of them have got degrees from foreign institutes of repute. Not sure what they studied there. But, this too shall pass. The madness will end someday. Better sense will prevail.

Yes, JNU is a significant news but you guys made it as if the only issue happening in the country. There has to be a balance in news reporting, have you guys ever wondered what's happening in south or north east. If you disagree with me, just have a look at no. of your correspondents in these regions. Indian journalism have become pathetic, you guys all sang Modi nama before election and chosing to take opposite way after election. I am not saying you should not, but just be fair in your reporting without taking any stance on your own. Having said that, i agree with your stance on the tv debates which is increasingly becoming like fish market with everyone shouting on their own.

                            After so much writing and media from Ravishji, I think the people who comment doesn't get the point. If Kanhaiyaa or Umar has even said a single comment against India they should be punished severely in the court of law, there is no second opinion on that. But the issue is  Shouldn't we wait to confirm that they are 100% involved before labeling them as anti-national ? What if they weren't? What if these are doctored ? Even the chance may be 1%. With this minor chance we ought to protect the culprit before his public life is spoilt by being labeled as a pro-terrorist. Wouldn't we all be guilty of defaming and probably even getting him killed by some mob once he is acquitted from his charges? <br/><br/>
We are all patriotic but that does not give us the freedom to take the law in our hands. JNU incident is a shame to our nation and the culprits should be behind bars and a crack down should be done on all these anti national elements.  But no one is asking the public or the lawyers to take law into their hand. <br/><br/>
Once more I appeal to my fellow Indians, wake up before it's too late. May be your love for India has blind folded and the decisions you are taking emotionally  now will result in an India in future, that we wish we didn't create. <br/><br/>
Please.... Let's be wise on how we handle things, every action has two results, one affecting the present and the other shaping the future. If all Indians were our real brothers and sisters... What would we do ?

The person who abuse in twitter or any online platform you go on and block him instantly. Do you ever think of her/his 'freedom of speech'? S/He may not be so articulate like you or any other journalist/writers to express her/his point of view. No, you won't give that permission[none would] to abuse you or threaten you to physically harm you. If you feel the threat is serious you would file a police complain. If goons in Patiala court who threaten journalist to 'break phone &amp; then bone'[no evidence] is such a big issue then how come ppl who call for 'breaking India'[with clear evidence] and those students leader 'being not anti-national' allows this chanting going on for few hours under his nose? He not even for once objected to it. We all know how student leaders act when they don't like something, even more when they are holding the union. Come out of that misplaced ideology. Be fair while reporting. No, you don't need to demonise a community/ideology to prove yourself as 'liberal &amp; progressive'. BE FAIR when you Report, that's all.

                            Ravishji. Social media is what is making the media more accountable and also labeling the media house as news reporting house or news manufacturing house. Also the mirch masala and spin that is put on the facts as they happened are challenged by common men who post a simple message or photo on social media. Also the monopoly of only media houses to air their opinions and views and by that I also mean their sidings with political parties is challenged by common men airing their voices and views. Newspersons have to either face consequences for badmouthing elements or praising elements because of the very fact that newspersons are not supposed to do any of that. Newspersons should only report news and not make this nonsense of debate as in most of the debates, the anchor and the participants are in no capacity to state facts and go about making their political agenda and stand vocal. News channels should only report news. It is the business of media which is coming to hurt media. Sama achar is how the nation wants news. We have other channels that come with "All incidents in this are fictional and not related to anyone dead or alive"  what news channels are trying to do. Organize a Swachh Media Abhiyan and throw the rot in your trade out on the road. Look how social media will respond. Also let us not forget social media is true feedback. Most on social media do not draw a salary for writing a post or tweet. They write what their minds tell them and it can also be contrary to how you perceive  an incident. So be tolerant and the dust will settle as Satyamev Jayate.

As you are telling JNU rights are being taken away by thugs or so called extreme nationalist . But a question why JNU only. There no fear for me our country , I am leading a safe and great life due to liberties provided by this country. Also followed rules and regulations. But freedom of speech doesn't give me right to attack very fabrics of our proud nation .Protest are necessary in democracy but instigating and misguiding youth of our society in name freedom of speech , I don't support .It is totally correct on behalf of Government to take action. So please for your political masters don't dilute a proud ideology of Nationalism as without this we will be like any failed nation . This sense of pride has kept a culturally and religiously diverse nation like India united.

                            I always like your and Abhigyan Prakashji Shows. I have always liked the way you guys raise issues which always roams around in the society whether it is pro-government or anti-government. <br/>
But in this JNU case, almost every show of both of you were more judgmental rather than reporting. Even various blogs written by you or Ms Barkha Duttji were also like a judgment passed by you in favour of anti-India slogans raised in JNU. <br/>
My only views on this is that whatever happens in JNU had left a bad taste and no one should encourage those anti-India slogans. Also, your TV channel should not vindicate those who are yet to be investigated and yet to face the law of Land. You do not have any right to become a judge and cannot pass any verdict which suits your convenience and/or whatever right/wrong you had reported. <br/>
Will you ever come back on TV and apologies if Hon`ble court punish them for sedition? <br/>
It only hurts me because I always watch your channel for good news and right reporting but for the last couple of days your reporting specially yours Mr Ravish has surprised me.

                            Speechless (not mindless :)) Just superb!!! Salute to Ravish Kumar and NDTV India. After watching the show, I felt little calm after all the anxiety over past few days over this anti-national and other incidents. It was really hard to find such a balanced, thought provoking, inner conscious awakening program, that too on news channels. Which have become shouting centers in the name of debates now-a-days. <br/>
To answer to your question, why we liked the show, it was not because of the fear, but may be because, it was raising the same questions that were constantly trying to come out from within us.

The question raised for today's social media, people provoking and spreading things on social media, news and its debates, are really important. Once again THANK YOU for taking us to "To Total Darkness" as from now the only hope is a ray of light after this show.

                            This fellow is just using nice sounding words and ideas to deflect attention. The simple issue is - there was an anti-national act in a tax-payer funded  place of learning. Are you saying this should be ignored - maybe condoned or may be even encouraged ? If you think it should be encouraged, then just say so : don't hide in the darkness  and pretend to sound that you care for the society at large when all that you arê really  trying to do is peddle your biased leftist views on your readers. Enough of your pretenses, enough of pseudo intellectualism.

                            You are right with the word Afraid. Most trolled your View because most voices like me fear being labeled Anti Nationalist. I deleted many tweets I wanted to post, could not get into debate with my coleagues because all had some sence of ultra patriotism boiling. We saw in the darkness someone trying to show a mirror were the Real India is. We got courage, hidden voices spoke. But is it the start or the end. Will we again become slaves in our own country, wiĺl we start wispering silently in the darkness.

                            NDTV along with so called intellectuals, historians &amp; journalists had become the apologist of all anti national events and there organisers in JNU. They are trying there best to convert the patiala house lowers hoolignism/ goondagardi in to anti national event so that they can save the actual anti national of JNU. But afraid they can't make fool of nation.

                            I think there is a difference between a journalist and a critique. You can be a journalist and present the news as it is. Present the truth from several viewpoints - don't make judgements and don't present your views. Just assume that the public is intelligent enough to forms its views. On the other hand you can be a critique and bring creative criticism to the debate that can inform the public better than what they can see. The journalist has the burden to be unbiased and provide maximum exposure to an event. The critique can be biased, presenting his personal view. The reader is aware of the personal view factor. Both jobs are difficult and both have their place in media. Tell us what are you?

What I have found among people specially young people that they have forgotten our struggle of Independence for which our forefathers fought fervently and diligently. These days people get upset about literary anything and thanks to our politicians and electronic media and social media to make sure it happens. What I have observed in your prime time show that you ask questions. You don't take things for granted as some people do inside media and it's listeners. And news media really needs to knock it off it's idea of "Sensationalization". In these dark period I really find Dr Ambedkar views helpful. A country where 29.5% of the India population lives below the poverty line and we get upset about some dumb chanting. Once again I thank you for your honesty.

                            I am afraid of this hyper nationalism. And that too being hijacked by fringe groups. Being violent in the name of our country and culture is really worrying terrifying. We're on a path of becoming another pakistan or worse a taliban. I love my country and proud of it. Several of my family have been serving in armed forces. I have witnessed what its like to be a part of martyred soldiers family. Its devastating. And these groups and political parties hijacking their sacrifices  and carrying national flag and beating people openly outside court and a major political party backing rhat beating is scary at the least. Its ironic what the did was actually against all the priciples that our flag stands for. And worst of all if we do put out our voice we're tagged anti national who does not want to live here and should go to pakistan. Its really heartening to see my peaceful country go up in flames.

                            Ravishji,  the foundations of our democracy were being hacked at for a long time. We didn't notice or wilfully looked the other way. We have let our education system go to seed, building generations of citizens who are brought up on myths, are incapable of criticism, analysis and reasoning. Such people ultimately end up being the stormtroopers of the new order. Things have come to such a pass where you have to think multiple times before posting an innocent rejoinder on your classmate's Facebook page or post a correction on an obviously fake meme. You are apprehensive that you will be buried in abuse or bludgeoned into submission by organised online gangs with - and that is the most unkindest cut - your friend egging them on.<br/><br/>
We didn't lose our freedom in a day. We let it slip gradually without even realising it. We let it slip by undermining democratic institutions, by not voting, by voting for the wrong guys. But then we should have known better. This is how Fascism comes home. <br/>
I admire your courage in sticking your neck out but I think you are fighting a losing battle. As a nation we have primed ourselves to be taken over by hooligans. Irrespective of which party you vote for, this is how India is going to be in the foreseeable future.

                            In the court premesis, The first journalist got beaten up only when he started shouting slogan "Vemula zidabad".  Where was the need for him to do so.  He was a journalist and should have stuck to his job of covering the event.  Instead he got busy in creating the event.  Fomenting the trouble.  Does the freedom of speech mean you can shout anything anywhere.  If its decorum of court, then should it not be maintained by journalists too.  <br/><br/>
This was recorded footage where Raveesh himself is seen asking the journalist.<br/><br/>
The journalist wanted to get the trouble escalated and he provided the trigger.. and succeeded.  First you instigate the violence and then say we were beaten up.  But that is grand design of congress.. they can't give progress, all they want to give hard time those who genuinely want to take country forward.  <br/><br/>

After watching the show, I felt little calm after all the anxiety over past few days over this anti-national and other incidents. It was really hard to find such a balanced, thought provoking, inner conscious awakening program, that too on news channels. Which have become shouting centers in the name of debates now-a-days. <br/>
To answer to your question, why we liked the show, it was not because of the fear, but may be because, it was raising the same questions that were constantly trying to come out from within us. The ones we were not able to answer, or sometimes would only like to see, listen and believe we only want to be.<br/>

                            Congress claims they have fought for Independence but was this a outcome of Independence where corruption was manifolds communal fights,still education levels are low, no sanitization, barring some sectors everywhere corruption is not congress responsible for it and about intolerance can CPI or CPM say there is tolerance in Russia or China can ordinary congress worker criticise Gandhi,Nehru family and now they criticise NDA before critising other look at self then criticise others

                            I wish Ravish went to Malda to show the reality as he always go for anti-government cases. The man who got arrested also has a free right to say as JNU students. Although, I do not support any of hate speeches from any group.

                            Ravish Ji,<br/><br/>
I watched the black out episode and other clips where you are discussing with Madhu Trehan on NewsLaundry.<br/>
There you mentioned about a famous NewsAnchor and blasted him. That is fine. Further, your points suggested that media house should do some introspection and ensure that they are the voice of people.<br/>
I will be direct and precise here. If this is the issue then why didn't you speak against your own team, when one of the famous lady anchors(you know the name) colluded  with Politicians to ensure the benefit of a business. The evidences are clear to people and not sure whether they are clear to courts. Also, do you promise to take the issue in your next prime time discussion and clean your house before shout at others.<br/>
Where were you and your team-mates when farmers were getting committing suicide in Vidarbha and Andhra. Still it has not stopped. An eminent rural journalist Mr. Sainath rightly pointed that all the media houses were covering a stupid fashion week while people were dying few miles away from there.<br/>
Also, just to remind you media house planned the massacre of Mumbai Police when Taj attack happened;just to give a live coverage.<br/>
When you want to lecture, you may lecture, but have u done proper introspection or promise to take corrective against some of the filth which your media house has created.Talk to your Aatma and you will get the answer.

As Chetan , pls do not make Modi hate blind you .. I too was against 2002 riots , until I heard Kashmir story , one thing is there Muslim did not have to come out of Guj unlike pandit ..<br/><br/>
You accuse others of being selective, but you are no different. If you are going to connect Godhra to the Kashmiri Pundit massacre, then you also need to talk about the the way dalits have been treated for centuries by Hindus, especially 'upper class' Hindus. Unknowingly or knowingly, are being selective. Also what happened in Godhra cannot be accepted as a reply to what happened to the Pundits or vice versa. When you start connecting different issues, like Godhra and Kashmiri Pundits, you run the risk of missing out other similar issues. Either you treat a mistreatment issue in isolation or you connect all such mistreatments. What has happened and what is happening to the dalits is much worse than what any other community had or is going through right now. Why aren't you talking about that?<br/><br/>
Should all muslims in India be held accountable for what happened in Kashmir? Then all Hindus will be held accountable for what happened in Godhra and Dalits.<br/>
You can't have a different yardstick for measuring the same issue.<br/><br/>
How far back in time are you willing to go to talk about mistreatment. The adivasis of this country will have an issue with all our ancestors. Are we ready to tackle that issue? Are we even ready to talk about it? <br/><br/>
There is a creation of an artificial persecution complex and paranoia fueled by social media, the media,and some innate insecurities. We are being pushed to hate each other; we are being pushed to hate people with different opinions (including dissent). Are these our opinions or simply opinions we are blindly accepting from different political outfits?<br/><br/>
We must introspect.

                            Ravish Kumar you will always will be remembered a person who didn't fail himself when humanity was at stake. He stood fearlessly, compassionately and with enmity to none. ALWAYS STOOD BY THE VOICELESS PEOPLE.
