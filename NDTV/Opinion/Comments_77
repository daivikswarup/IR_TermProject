                            We speak about the good things of leaders when they are long gone and always, as a rule, speak bad of them, when they are alive. May be, that's the nature of politics where you can't speak good about anyone or else you are seen through the prism of belonging to a that political party. As a country, as a democracy, we must mature and see through this mud slinging that happens around us.

                            Mufti Mohammed Sayeed contributed nothing to either India or Kashmir. Sentiments are different from facts. His daughter is unlikely to be any different.

                            Interesting to learn that the Army has excellent contacts with people at the grassroots level. Pakistani politicians and media usually paints the Army as an occupying force. The Indian Govt and media need to bring out the close connection between the Army and Kashmiri people in the news.
