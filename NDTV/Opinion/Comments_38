                            @Shreyas: All of have been student for sometime in our life. In the college that we studied the college policy was very clear no politically affiliated student body will be permitted. So our student body elections was fun time with student president etc. was purely elected on the merit of the debate the candidates had to participate moderated by the out going council team. It was great fun. In our final year the SFI staged a back door entry and once the guy got elected and he was installed SFI flags entered the campus. There behavior was very bad. The very next year the student net work ensure they were booted out.  Now coming back to the matter at hand I think no political party should enter the JNU campus and let students sort out the matter with the police. If any student has said seditious stuff he should punished by due process of law. Leave students to themselves and the prof on the campus things will be fine. The Students Unions especially in JNU I am given to understand are supported/backed by political parties. This tends to vitiate the harmonious atmosphere on campus basic reason is our political parties are still to mature and become purely debated and ideology driven. They have a lumpen section that are violent. It looks like most JNU professors are all leftist ideologue and not neutral in there approach.

                            @Shreyas: There is a clear pattern being followed by the so called Secular parties. They are trying to show the NDA government as Anti Minority and Anti Dalit. The trouble is that many liberal Hindus have started falling for this. So Mr. Khera's boss goes and camps with the students at Hyderabad and then comes out in support of students at JNU but is completely silent when 3 girls commit suicide in Tamil Nadu. They were unimportant because they were not Dalits and also did not come from the minority community. There was no political capital to be made so he kept away. Congress is trying to create unrest in the country and will even compromise national integrity to meet their end goal.

                            @Shreyas: For your information in 1948 India invaded Kashmir. That's the truth. Afzal was a kashmiri and someone in a way was against this occupation. However what he did was wrong - What India did is also wrong. Let's accept it. To bring this to the discussion and debate is right to speech - If we do not discuss, how does the truth be known. How long can Indian government be fooling its people by suppressing the truth. I Love India like most of True Indians - But I equally appreciate discussion and debate - be it about Kashmir or Pakistan or India. Thats the true spirit of India. However I am against the idea of  anti-indian slogan - some videos prove that elements like ABVP and other organization - who does not want debate and free-speech induced slogans and the others merely went along with them like a herd - which is foolish and against true spirit of free-speech.

Therefore, these students are attracted towards communist ideology which reinforce the belief in their mind that one day India become communist country and TATA, AMBANI, BIRLA all industrial and rich people's wealth will be distributed among poor and communist comrades. These people are living in fool's paradise. Finally their career end up with joining Hafiz Saieed separatist, extremist or Maoist in the different parts of the country which facilitate them with free food, clothing and shelters and live-in-partner ladies comrades. This is what communist offer to these students as career. These comrade students are ignorant of the present world existing today. Because they live in Hafiz Saieed kind of imaginary world.

                            @Shreyas: Mr Pai does not have it wrong at all. You do. Only 12% of Indians make it to Universities, some on merit some on reservations, simply because after 70 years of independence, primary education has failed, miserably. Forget about higher education. Most Indians are school drop outs. Most courses studied at universities are soft subjects, not hard sciences. World class research at most Indian institutions is non existent, therefore we never make it to top 10 of the league, or 20 or 30 or 40. Some are in top 100. Then to use the poorest tax providers money to support terror is unacceptable, no debates necessary. India does not occupy any lands , India is not an aggressor, India does not export or support terrorism. Pakistan does occupy our lands, does use terrorism as part of State policy, has kiiled people in  Kashmir and beyond. And then to shout pro Pakisatni slogans, if not anti India, what is it? Or these people do not know and Understand India. If so, they are wasting their time at JNU or wherever. leave and allow more deserving students to step in. People of lesser age are as I write, are putting their lives at risk to Pkaistani terrorists. Why? For freedom, but that comes with responsibilities. These hard based leftists who support terror and thus killing of innocent people do not deserve any sympathy. Sack them from their places and let them deal with real life any which way they choose. Enough of brain storming at tax payers' expense. They can do it in their own time. iNDIA HAS 350 MILLION LIVING IN ABJECT POVERTY, PRIMARY HEALTH CARE does not exists, primary education is pathetic. Do not be so proud that arrogance blinds completely. As Swami Vivekand said We are all ignorant, but only a few realise it (paraphrasing).

Indian universities have failed miserably in the global arena. There is hardly a single Indian university among the top 250 universities in the global list. Only Africans and third world students want to study in Indian universities while Indians want to rush to USA and UK to study.  Now it is obvious that the Universities are a great breeding ground for snakes among the retards rather then intellectuals. This is a great tribute to Congress that has been the ruling elite of the country for a large part. Congress has to take responsibility for the mess the universities are in, for that matter the state of the country.

A few fundamental questions the political parties and intellectuals must answer - how can a student body be allowed to use the university campus for anti-India activities? Students who before claim rights to freedom of expressions should have observed their  duties towards the state before  claiming such remedy before the court of law and Indian public at large. This is not the first time JNU has seen left wing violence. Least they forget how Manmohan Singh witnessed the ugly scenes created by left student body way back in 2005. Today Congress leaders share stage with  the same groups. Sad!<br/><br/>
The death sentence was not announced  by a kangaroo court, it was done by the esteemed courts of India, where the terrorists had all the legal remedy at their disposal. Now you question the Indian courts? What message is the Congress trying to give out by supporting the JNU incident? <br/><br/>

Nowadays we see these frustrated Congress fellows including their duffer VP found sitting and commenting from the wrong side of the fence!These buggers don't understand that they should not play politics when it comes to the unity and integrity of the nation.For past many years JNU has become breading ground for Maoists, Nexalites and Jihadists.They and their sympathizer mentor professors celebrate when Maoists kill CRPF Jawans in Dantewada, Chattishgarh, organise protests for the conviction and execution of terrorist Afzal Guru,question Indian State for the occupation of Jammu &amp; Kashmir,raise anti India slogans for India's destruction, give moral support to Maoists and secessionists forces fighting Indian Union.We the citizens of India appeal to the Government to handle the case firmly and book all the culprits involved in anti India activities inside campuses.At the same time warn all educational institutions not to allow any activities which challenges Indian constitution,Judiciary or Parliament.India is not a Banana Republic and nobody should be allowed to take the state for a ride.Media organisations should also be responsible in broadcasting sensitive issues.They must understand Police or security forces can enter any premises within Indian Union if Unity and Integrity of the Nation is Challenged.

                            Yes Mr Khera, campus should have debate, but where is the debate? slogan and debate are not the same. The students got ample opportunity in visual media to present their logic.They couldnt they dont have one. A simple question, the supreme court judgement on Afjal guru is not based on slogans. It discusses each and every point and provide detailed justification for each observation. Please explain (since you are representing the students now) why it was unfair logically. I want to understand, and if you can convince us with logic we will consider the students as great thinkers may be.

Congress goon murdered innocent Sikhs when Indira was murdered by her own trusted people. Did you advise rajive or Indira.  Actually any body support Afzal gunda. And mammon are anti national and they should be put in condemned cell. Who ever question such action should also be put along with traitors as they are indulging in promotion of anti national act. Don't advise Mohandas but the traitors and supporters. Bad decisions of Nehru Kashmir has become hot bed . Vote bank politics of congresses in creating Assam,Bengal and Kerala in similar pattern.

                            It's completely wrong to equate what happens at IIT, Hyd University, IIFT with the JNU incidence. There could be fight between different classes, religion and opinions within our vibrant democracy. But to tolerate anti India clash within JNU is atrocious on the part of all politicians irrespective of any party. If the students and faculty stand against anti India slogans/ actions then why are they not pointing out persons involved in it. Elected student body and the faculty are responsible not to shield the culprit. And if they take a stand it's none of their problem then police and state administration will act with heavy hand. Perpetrators of anti India should not be allowed. Because the political parties tolerated such elements in Kashmir since 1949 the country has landed into this mess.

                            Whether the Police action has been appropriate or not, the students as a training ground for involving in politics is unacceptable by any standards. Just because RaGa has spoken some crap (I strongly disagree what RaGa has spoken), all the Congress politicians should not justify what he said is right. Come on, have some brain of yours too. He says that 'those who curtail freedom of speech in this University, they are only anti-national'. What type of stupid remark he can make ?<br/><br/>
Does this freedom of speech / expression would mean I can stand in Taj Mahal or in Parliament building and give abuses about the President or PM of India. In the same manner, here is a man who had waged a battle against the constitution of this country and he has been given a very fair trial. The highest courts of this country has found him to be guilty and he has been hanged after fair opportunity to justify his points. Now that the highest judiciary body has decided a final verdict, there is no question of providing martyrdom to Afzal Guru. He is a terrorist and period. No arguments thereafter. Shouting slogans supporting Afzal Guru is definitely anti-national.<br/><br/>
From this perspective, what Mohandas Pai said is right. Students are sent for studying and once studies are over, exit the College / University campuses and stand naked in the road and shout / yell / roar / bark. Who is going to stop you ? Take the case of Rohith Vemula. His mother is finding it difficult to meet both the ends. Here is one irresponsible boy (who does not realise the seriousness and / or commitment to bring up the family) and sitting in University as PhD student talking crap and making detrimental statements. Understand what amount of expectations his mother would have had on him. Why Rohith Vemula could not fulfil these expectations ? All because, you are in a bad company where these rogues join together and do unproductive things.<br/><br/>
As mentioned earlier, Pawan Khera - please do not justify what your political master said. Have some conscience and understand. Final question : Would you allow your son / daughter to do what Kanhaiya Kumar did ? What shall be your reaction then ? Please ponder over. If you are serious, send a reply to this post.

                            Here is an excerpt of an interview of an apolitical JNUite who is thick in the cultural and educational activities for a better democratic society. The name is withheld. The interview took place in 2007 and see what he says about his soulful interface with his alma mater:-<br/><br/>
"Bhoomika: How different would your work profile and perspective be, had you not been a JNUite?<br/>
Mr….: It would have been entirely different. I can not think of my existence without JNU. If I had not got admission in JNU, I would not have been anywhere. Despite being a very good student, I got only 52% marks in B.A in Patna University. I would never have made it to any place where marks decided one's fate. So JNU was a boon for me.<br/>
Bhoomika: Which characteristic of JNU do you think is most attractive?<br/>
Mr….: The high level of cultural and ideological awareness in JNU attracts me the most. This is not seen anywhere else in India. To think of oneself as a citizen of the world and to be able to ask questions are the most important thing one is taught in JNU. This is the strength of JNU.<br/>
Bhoomika: Do you still go back to JNU?<br/>
Mr….: Certainly. Just two days back I went there with an ex-JNUite friend of mine who simply wanted to have a bread roll at Ganga dhaba.<br/>
Bhoomika: What message would you like to give to the JNU students' community?<br/>
Mr….: JNU teaches you not how to answer questions but how to question answers. So long as you keep questioning, you keep up the spirit of JNU."<br/><br/>
All that Mr.... states here is the most authentic and true description of the university. NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS TO THE UNITY, INTEGRITY AND PROSPERITY OF THE COUNTRY THAN THROTTLING THE CHILD'S CURIOSITY AND HIS EFFORT TO ACQUIRE A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST INSTRUMENT OF EMPOWERMENT. <br/>
DO NOT KILL THE ETHOS OF TAKSHSHILA. DO NOT ACT LIKE NADIRSHAH. DO NOT PLAY WITH FIRE AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY.

What is wrong in the statement of Mohandas Pai, who was a successful IT man in Infosis, that 'the tax payer's money spent on universities is meant to fund not their politics but their studies'. Like a typical Congressman, the correspondent tries put words by stating 'Because a university is funded by the state, is it meant to obediently adhere to the ideology of the then head of state? Mohandas Pai was 100% correct that Universities are meant for STUDIES and NOT for politiking. He did not say anything about 'obediently adhering to ideology'. The Party which declared emergency and jailed hundreds of thousands of innocent citizens for protesting and the Party whose party men were responsible for killing thousands of Sikhs after Indira Gandhi's assassination lost its right to talk about freedom of expression, long back.

We have all been to universities I can not remember hearing anti national slogans and destruction of India being the activities undertaken by us. <br/>

Mr Mohan Das Pai is absolutely right that as taxpayer of this country we decide where our money is spent. It CAN NOT and Will not be spent on anti-nationals that is for sure, wether you like it or not. If you love them so much I suggest you should fund there education from your own pocket.

"Rebelling against authority comes naturally to youth. Campuses are sensitive to the entry of police. These are some simple facts that all of us who have either been young, or are parents, understand. Administrators are trained to understand this."<br/><br/>
Do you mean students should be allowed to do anything destructive because it is their nature to rebel?<br/><br/>
When you do not put a limit to freedom you open door to chaos? Can we say Kamlesh Tewari utterances as freedom of speech? One big problem that the nation faces today is the lack of responsible journalism. <br/><br/>
I think JNU has failed to utilize the youth energy in a constructive manner.

I'm not disputing the fact that there should not be any protest or debate, nobody stops them from having debates or even protesting against certain decisions by the establishment.

                            Mr. Pawan,<br/><br/>
What are you talking about. Please remember JNU is a centre for education. JNU, or any University for that matter is not a political office. Young students come here to learn science and arts not politics. If somebody wants to learn politics, certainly the universities are not the place. If politics, dharna, rallies, stone throwing, sedition etc are taught in JNU, then better name it as a Neta Training Centre. But funding should not be from the tax payers. I can understand, only a handful of currupted minds are involved in such activities with the backing of political parties. Need of the hour is that the unions and political affiliates groups should be banned from the centres of learning. Certainly, the Universities want only serous students, not netas on probation. It is high time to mercilessly weed these probating Netas.

                            Mohandas Pai is a sanghi who got lucky and rich by doing body-shopping business. He lacks intelligence, empathy, compassion and honesty to discern the nitty-gritty hiding behind the sanghi's 'patriotic' agenda. He is blinded by delusions about his superior caste and hence never developed wisdom even though he has made a ton of money.

                            It is clear that both BJP and CONGRESS are caught in a race to the bottom. While Congress over the last 60 years specialised in "caste" and "minorities" card for vote bank politics, the BJP is now lost in trying to pamper to the "Hindutva" crowd. Unfortunately, the balance lies in the middle, where a true Indian identity independent of caste and community has to be carved. But with the way politics is in India, that would be a distant dream.<br/><br/>
It is the most appropriate time now to recall what Tagoreji said...<br/><br/>
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br/>
Where knowledge is free<br/>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br/>
By narrow domestic walls<br/>
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br/>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br/>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br/>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br/>
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br/>
Into ever-widening thought and action<br/>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

                            Dear Pawan, I hope you remember our massive protest against Mandal Commission in 1989 where you also were very active. That was not only limited to few Universities but across India. That shows that if need arise, all students can be very vocal and active. They are capable of taking decisions on their own. Problem arises when politicians inject venom to the thought process of these students for their vested interest.  As far as practicing Ideology is concerned, there is no harm in practicing any of them till they are not anti-national. Now question is what is anti-national.  For me it is very clearly defined in "The constitution (Forty-second amendment) Act 1976",  and not limited to, as any act  which is intended, or which supports any claim, to bring about, on any ground whatsoever, the cession of a part of the territory of India or the secession of a part of the territory of India or which incities any  individual  or  association  to   bring  about   such  cession  or<br/>
secession; and any act which disclaims, questions, threatens, disrupts or is intended to threaten  or  disrupt  the sovereignty and integrity of India  or   the security of the State or the unity of the nation;  <br/>
For me, what is happened in JNU on 9th February is totally Anit-national and all of us who respect and are proud of our nation should condemn it.  <br/>
For me, if shouting slogans against the nation is "Freedom of Speech", amend the constitution."

                            For this tech generation everything is money 💰 only. As students their only knowledge is a few engineering subjects. So no surprise that they cannot appreciate social sciences because they never studied them. Once this so called tech money ceases to generate jobs in this dimension, people will go back to social sciences and will find out all about reason, logic, debate. <br/>
It is not surprising they cannot look beyond their nose. But atleast be proud of JNU which is one internationally renowned institution doing  research social sciences. The solutions offered by those sciences cannot be Quantified like tech solutions. But they will remain relevant so long as human beings live in societies. <br/>
Challenge it , if you can, by the so called  right wing approach which talks only of arbitrary privileges but no solutions to larger societal problems. The founding tenets of societies are based on reasons , not coins.

For god's sake, these are mid to late 20s young men and women, who know what they are talking about. There can be no excuse for their behavior as they are not some kids, and need to be dealt with firm hands. And anyone who has been to JNU knows very well what many of these so called students are upto. They along with political masters Left parties create intellectual terrorism, suppressing any voice that comes from others. All those sympathisizing with JNU students, should do well to google about JNU. In 2009, a major clash occurred between JNU students and the Delhi Police when Policemen were injured and thanks to UPA govt, not a single student was arrested. Since then, five incidents of alleged rape have been reported from the campus and this has all been in the news.

Student bodies like AISA and SFI have all legitimate right to debate issues on poliicial economy and society, why did they allow such sensational issue to be raised. <br/><br/>
I think Mohan is right, people will ask this question of not funding politics.<br/><br/>
Campuses are supposed to be calm and quite for study not for Politics. If politics of such extreme order will happen there will be lea gal action. JNU is not first university where police entered. Every now and then police enters campuses around the country, whenever students cross line.<br/><br/>

Because a university is funded by the state, is it meant to obediently adhere to the ideology of the then head of state?". So what should be universities doing? patronize anti-national ideology?<br/><br/>
Actually the main issue is, the social issues are coming to the forefront and academics are being totally neglected by the student community. That's the reason, we are producing several thousand tech and non-tech graduates in to the open world and hardly 10% are academically worth of any suitable job for their respective degrees. Mr. Pai is absolutely correct, we don't want to fund hooliganism in Universities.

If Universities and other govt institutions are funded from Public tax money then they must do their work. Regarding politics at these educational institutions, most of these institutions are leftist and were supported by the Congress, UPA. The leftist ideology knows how to raise questions and make people unstable. It never gives practical answers (forget implementing them) to the questions it raises and that's a BIG BIG problem.
