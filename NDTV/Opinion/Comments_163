                            Mr. Iyer,<br/><br/>
We the Modi bhakts are well aware of your visceral hatred for Modi and how desperately you and your masters (the Gandhis) want him to fail. So, expecting you to wish Modi a very happy new year is unthinkable and out of question. We know that it is too much to expect you show some good manners and extend courtesies like wishing your political opponents a happy new year, even for the sake of it. If you can go the extent of begging a Pakistani TV anchor to remove Modi and bring "you" to power in India so that your pet project of â€˜uninterruptible dialogue with Pakistan' can continue, how can any one, least of all  Modi, even expect you wish him  a happy new year? So, don't even bother to wish him well because if at all you wish him, it will sound like an expletive rather than a homily.

Yes, BJP lost the Bihar election. What was congress' status in the grand coalition?? It even went to a point that the your vice president been packed to US to attend a fake conference to stay away from Bihar.<br/>
The fact that you are boasting about panchayat election victory tells a lot about your difficulty in finding bright spots for congress last year!!<br/>
Coming on to the economic development, i dont think Congress has any moral right to complain as they have blocked the parliament from implementing key reforms for their masters' personal gain.<br/>
Remember when Congress was in power, a mere speech by US federal reserve of a rate rise sent rupee tumbling down. Now that the federal reserve has increased the interest rate and Rupee is the best performing currency of the emerging nations!!<br/>

                            Wishing someone, specially to Prime Minister is a courtesy. This fellow doesn't know this I hope. People of India has given Modi ji a chance to rule for 5 years. We just need to stop blaming and watch what is he doing in this 5 years.

                            Mani, can you tell us about 2g, coal scam , cwg , herald  and many more you know of . We're these achievements in your opinion ?  Rahul now says give me 20 years and I will change India. You had 60 years so what were the achievements during that period other then looting and scams by Congress.

                            What's wrong with your head man. At your age instead of thinking and providing advice in the nation's interest, you act like a total douche. No concern for the legacy you will leave behind. Congress had few leaders who were statesman, very sad that the Gandhi clan managed to get rid of them and substitute them with spineless leeches like you. Starting the new year with your bs filled with negativity doesn't help our populace. Change your tone, if you care a little bit of the legacy you want to leave behind. If you have something constructive to help our government perform better then please advice. Our PM and his cabinet are working hard in nations interest, and even if it doesn't satisfy our 1.25 billion populace, his intentions are nobel, his commitment strong and dedication unmatched. State or local issues are dealt at the those levels. Do not equate central and state leadership to electoral results in states, municipal or panchayat elections. This a diversionary tactic used constantly by people of your ilk and media to confuse people on how our government and constitution works. Look at Kejriwal, how he  breaks the constitutional laws applicable to a Union territory like New Delhi and blames it on the center. As you cannot always blame Gandhis for losing a local election, same goes for Modi or anyone else.<br/>
 You may not agree on party ideologies but for the nation you guys need to stop this incessant bickering and complaining. Let the government work. Please rise up and think for all Indians.
