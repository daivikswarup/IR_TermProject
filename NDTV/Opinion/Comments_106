                            The US strongly requires gun control. It follows 18th century ideas when all Americans required guns for personal protection. Those days are past. Today a man with a gun puts his community at risk. Guns should be with law enforcement and the security forces. Not with civilians unless there is a real danger. This wrong attitude has led to the US armed forces committing numerous atrocities abroad as well. Or else this tragedy will be repeated over and over again.
