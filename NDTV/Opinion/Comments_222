                            Is the objective of this article self promotion.  Who was the brave Captain who commanded the aircraft?  Not worth a mention?  You give the impression that a Flying Officer (which you probably were in 1989) was the hero of the moment.

                            Very well put Sundeep! Groupie Mehta has brought out the intricacies of a high altitude rescue. Unfortunately, considering the treacherous environment in Siachen, many such missions have been undertaken over the past three decades. Many have been successful, some have not borne fruit. But, as Groupie Mehta brings out, EVERY trick in the trade is put to effect a rescue. Our Army and the IAF are there with a mission -- and the unstinted support of our countrymen keeps them going. Jai Hind! AVM Manmohan Bahadur (retd)

                            Good to read this article. I had a chance to visit Pike Peas in Colorodo which is above 14,000 feet from sea level. It was in pick summer time. As soon as I reached there and get out of cog train I experienced extreme cold and immediately remember of Siachin which is highest military post in the world. <br/><br/>
Salute to you for protecting motherland day and night in unimaginable cold and tough weather condition. <br/><br/>
Thank you Indian Army

                            We are indebted to these brave soldiers who were facing the world's worst weather and also enemies only for the sake of our country !! Now they have laid their lives we should be more aware and supportive to their families and beloved. The family members of in service Military personnel should always  be given FIRST POSITION IN ANY QUEUE AT ANY PLACE.

                            If the politics of the subcontinent can mature to an extent tbat we dont need to lose lives on account of created conflicts then our political leadership will be deserving of the highest gallantry award. Till then we continue to waste blood, sweat and precious national reaources

                            @ Pradeep - This article by Capt. Sandeep is not about blowing own trumpet . The person who wrote looks in twilight of his career . He has simply written the hardships which our armed forces face on day to day basis . You got it totally wrong Sir !!
