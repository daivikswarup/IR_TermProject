                            She conveniently ignores Malda and Pathankot and decides to write about Deepika Padukone. If a group of RSS activists had committed something like Malda then she would have been shouting from the rooftop about INTOLERANCE!! INTOLERANCE!! Despicable double standards ...

                            What no comment on intolerance against teacher being beaten with iron rods by  clerics and their followers for daring to teach national anthem to madrasa students! Now come come Ms Ayyub and NDTV show at least degree of balance in treatment of the topic. One lives in hope.

                            Thanks for the fantastic write up on Deepika Padukone,darling of Millions.  Agree with Rana Ayub 100%. Deepika has shot to fame, name, dignity, respect and prosperity by dint of sheer hard work and excellent histrionic talents. She is at ease with all kinds of role. That's her beauty and talent. We wish her HAPPY HEALTHY BIRTHDAY AND NEW YEAR. Please keep on entertaining the audience.

                            Your articles are more of stories than facts. Your every week Friday movies gives you more stories than facts. You call yourself an investigative journalist. Start making movies instead of writing articles and encouraging communal problems in the society.

                            Deepika's father Prkash is a cousin of Shyam Benegal and also a close relative of Guru Dutt and Atma Ram and hence the contention of the author that Deepika "who does not boast of a film family pedigree" is a lot of baloney, if not a lot of balderdash
