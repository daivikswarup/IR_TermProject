                            Goa has still not got its true liberation. Which ever party comes to power in Goa, they will always remain slaves to Mining corporates, Real Estate, drug Mafia, Casino/gambling industry.

We Goans need to have more say and work more for Goa. Let's stand up and take control.

                            Every place has its strengths, and turning Goa into something else is poor economic and aesthetic sense. Goa should modernise and change with the times no doubt, but wish it will retain its idyllic charm and natural beauty.

                            Mr. Rodricks, fully support you on this issue. Coconut trees are an integral part of the Goan landscape. Goan politicians are being short sighted and foolish. It is time for all Goans to step up and demand that their politicians clean their act.

                            We voted for Mr. Parrikar not his dummy as Chief minister. Please sir come back we admire your role in implementing courts order of ban on mining. your state is important then the center politics. any way India's defense forces are only good at distributing sweets to their enemies and getting shot.

                            It seems like BJP government is in hurry to stake claim on economic development of Goa in particular and the entire country. without giving any thought to the cost of it. the consequences are grave, this passing of bill is a licence to destroy Goa. New Airport, Reality business is not for the betterment of Goa and Goans.

                            I may be wrong for I am not an economist but I believe overall development of the state takes priority. well its easy for us to say that trees not be cut but in the end if this can provide a job for a hungry stomach what right do we have to stop it? we can afford smartphones , unlimited het t
