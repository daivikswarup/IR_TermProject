                            @U V Kini: A fire that was started by Congress by not doing anything about anti India elements. This guy also like many others proclaim to be a socialist. Yet , he has lived in Lutyian Delhi all his life. Like all his Congress colleagues, all very wealthy people and yet pushing socialism down the throats of rest of Indians. The reason is very simple. the Congress party has failed miserably in creating wealth, therefore opportunities and thus jobs. "Garibi hatao" has been a dismal failure at every level. The constant interference since independence with the demand/supply network, ensured some got rich, very rich. that had to abandoned as India went bankrupt because of their unsustainable policies. India's gold was mortgaged to Bank of England. Thus the spread of socialism and communism and now has taken a very ugly shape. We cannot let sleeping dogs lie, for it is not the same as messing up the economy by Congress, again and again. This is allowing anti India hate to develop and engulf others. A tinder box set-up by Congress and now BJP having to clean up their dirty mess. It has to be cleaned. Economy could be brought back from the brink although it took years. Flames of hatred and divisiveness not so easy, if left alone. When will Congress learn? Power is not the most important thing, principles are. You have none.

                            I am aware that Congress is desperate to remain politically relevant. At the same time it cannot be seen as backing or supporting anyone publicly, who denounce India. But it also has to point out loopholes in BJP policies. Therefore it is left to people like Mani to try and put BJP on a spot. (And this is coming form a man who does not support BJP or Modi)<br/>
But, how can anyone compare the freedom movement of India, to this stupid slogan shouting of brainwashed guys, who were politically motivated to put it very mildly. There was another article today, which put things in a much better perspective. It was about how student unions have always been anti-establishment but never anti-national. There are certain lines you just don't cross. If the students had raised slogans against BJP or Modi, it would not have qualified as sedition. But to shout slogan against India, is simply unacceptable and has to be dealt with an iron hand. There is no need for any kind of diplomacy or politics around it. <br/>
However, one thing which Rajnath Singh (himself a student union leader at his age) must do is to identify people who instigated this group. They must be unmasked and punished far more severely than the students. For those are the elements who will continue to try and disturb the peace in our country through whatever means they feel necessary.

Mr. Aiyar like many other experts have written just 1 para on the event and 10 para's on the reaction of the govt. Nobody finds the actual event serious but everyone has objection to the action of govt. All parties-Rahul, Yechury, Kejri, Tyagi etc were silent when the event happened, nobody had objected that in India's capital, Indian students want to dismember India, none of them said a word to the students and when the govt acted, suddenly it became the govt's fault.

                            I Fully support Mani Shakar Aiyar for bringing in the past history to show how the past government has patiently dealt with situation such as the present government is facing. BJP known for its over Zealous nationalist whose propaganda is to make India 100% hindu (not realising the fact that there are millions of Indian  citizens in Christians countries like US, and European countries) is known for taking hasty steps only to regret later and cry over spilled milk. This new government has been in the news in India and abroad for all wrong reasons. India known for being a largest democratic country is being taken for a ride under the leadership of the RSS who dictate the government in every aspect be it political, education ...etc.<br/><br/>
We who are educated and have a common sense should raise our voices against any communalism played by BJP government to please the RSS, no doubt the congress too fail by allowing corruption to play a spoil sports.<br/><br/>
The high handedness of Delhi police in handling the JNU incident only shows the lack of statesmanship to bring the erring students to a dialogue and hear their grievances and bring to an amicable solutions. Hope there will be some responsible person who will take the middle path and bring everything on the negotiable table and not resort to punitive actions because its not flowing in line with their malicious propaganda.

I have been following this even and seen lots of debt over the news channel, When no action has been taken your party was saying Govt is no sufficient moral to take on anti-national activity, when govt did it's you guys are saying its wrong.<br/><br/>
This issue has been so politicize now that no one from opposition is trying to say what students did wrong but trying to take on Govt, Let me tell you I am not supporter or either BJP or Cong, I have also seen that when France attacked, all civilians and parties of that country said they are with Govt, no body questions the motive of Govt, But in India its completely opposite, No one has said or went to soldiers who died in Siachen but they find it attractive to go find some new opportunism in JNU anti national slogan instead of debating from were they learned it!!

Pls explain me your comments "It is, however, not a section to be invoked against students in a  university who are peacefully, if vociferously, giving vent to their political opinion".<br/><br/>
I advice you too to revisit the videos and the invitation pamphlet for this cultural (Non -cultural by any angle)and then try to web it to your comments, Your will get lost. It is so simple "Goons sloganeering anti national sentiments from a campus funded by our taxes. We don't pay them for politics but to study...period. <br/><br/>
Can you guarantee that these so called peaceful opinion raisers will not fall prey to LeT and create on more 26/11. <br/><br/>
Kashmir is congress's gift to India. Nehru (obnoxiously) took it to UN (Without cabinet nod)when Sardar has already got the treaty signed by the then Maharaja. Under the 1935 act (Under which all 500 states were unified)there is no need for a plebiscite. It is Nehru's spinelessness for which we are paying till date. So pls keep your mouth shut.<br/><br/>

                            Mr. Mani Shanker Iyer,<br/><br/>
No doubt your knowledge of international happenings is reflected in your writing, but sometimes in the name of forthrightness you have  transgressed decency in your utterances bordering on undiluted snobbery. Had it not been for your sardonic 'chaiwala' comment against Narendra Modi, things might not have been as bad for your party as they appear to be now. You are an experienced bureaucrat and politician and don't need to be reminded of the importance of remarks of a public figure. Such derogatory comments have been used to build public sentiments against your already scam-tainted party. Consequently, your party is now on the sidelines while those not fit to rule, occupy the political centre stage. Because of your party's high brow, disdainful attitude towards  lesser mortals, people are suffering under the rule of divisive monsters. There is little to choose between the two parties as has Mr. Arun Shourie rightly pointed out in his statement that BJP is 'scaled up Congress plus cow'. That is why 'low brow' commoners are gradually getting  alienated from your party as also are on the way to ousting this obnoxiously haughty ruling party. Bihar and Delhi have 'shone the ray', other states are now bent on showing them the way. Everyone can see through Modi's deliberate attempts at  marginalising Nehru-Gandhi clan but despite being well-read you scorned at Modi by slighting the stature of the common man. You are well aware of the importance of public sentiments. If your party nurtures any hope of a 'Congress Renaissance', it must learn from the greatness of the common man.Though small in status.at an appropriate time, he has the capacity to put all conmen in their right place. Robert Vadra made a similar indiscreet comment by terming 'Aam Admi' as'Mango Man' and another member of your elitist party describing a railway compartment or economy class as 'Cattle Class'. Was it PC or ST, both well-read yet insensitive. In this era of Aam Admi Party, genuine compassion and wisdom are more relevant than erudition. If Congress has to survive in this awakened democracy, here is a message for the elitists in the party,  please 'Be Warned, Be Vigilant and Be Prudent' in use of words as well as your deeds.<br/><br/>
Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>
A Low Brow Common Man
