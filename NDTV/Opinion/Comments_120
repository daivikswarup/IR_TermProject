                            Since the author highlighted some figures from Census, I throw thought I would share some more. Sex Ratio in Andhra Pradesh - 961 in 2001 vs 939 in 2011 (Ruled by Congress), Maharashtra - 913 in 2001 vs 894 in 2011 (Congress). I can go on and on but the author selectively decides to quotes statistics, the entire exercise becomes flawed. As far as Hardik Patel is concerned, we all know that he is nothing more than an opportunist and a sheer hypocrite who has done nothing worthwhile in his life.

                            Interesting analysis. India's skewed gender ratio will affect the politics in other states in the future too. Lots of angry frustrated young men, not able to get partners, roaming the streets will not end well for us. But how it will affect the politics is unknown.

                            Reservation for Patels is not possible legally,  Patels must understand this. Even if government agrees,  court will turn it down, like for Marathas for example.

                            You are missing few very valid points. Do you really know how much patidar community cares for study? If you go further, you will have more female patidars with good education than male. Do you know that last year there were some 9000 places open for the post of constable and the amount of patidar applied was less than 0.5%. Govt jobs are not only solution to their troubles. It's mentality which needs to be changed. It you want money, you need to put effort too. Hardik Patel himself is a commerce graduate with just 49%. Will anybody care to offer him placement? He is out there asking for reservation but has he taken pain to learn any vocational course? No, on the name of caste Congress is dividing people of Gujarat and patidars are becoming toys in their hand. I am not an avid BJP supporter but yes, we can see what is going on. Has anyone guts to ask patidars to pay for the loss of govt property which they caused. They never pay any taxes as being farmers they enjoy almost everything free, but it's our money which is ued to build those properties.

                            When will you talk about sex ratio in states like Pondichery? i.e. 1037 females for 1000 males. Are parents killing the male foetus? or this seems normal? Then why the other way around is always blamed on foeticide/infanticide?

                            I do not agree. Every leader must have followers. And the followers will only follow leaders who promise what they aspire for. When Gujaratis aspire for male children, somebody opposing that, even with good intentions, is hardly likely to create a stir. Plus what is Hardik's personal interest in this issue which cuts across caste and religion? He is interested only in reservation for Patels.

                            How apparent is it now that ndtv is running a major campaign again PM Modi,  is evident through such articles. Did it first reveal statistics about percentage population that has been brought above poverty line in the last decade compared to national average or other states? No. The writer conveniently ignores that the reason aspirations of such youth aren't met, is because the free entrepreneur environment of Gujarat and the culture of meritocracy has actually helped many youth emerge out of poverty,  have built their successful Enterprises and ate self reliant,  not demanding reservations or subsidies and not dependent on government help.

                            It seems she does not want to understand that with investment comes flurry of migrants as skilled or unskilled labours and this is mainly in form of man. For example at Surat, which has lowest Sex Ratio, no of migrant labours will be in the vicinity of 7-8 lacs, out of which hardly 1 to 1.5 lacs will be women. Similar is the case for Ahmadabad due to Sanand, Jamnagar due to Reliance &amp; Essar Petro plants and industrialized  districts of Vadodar, Rajkot.

He should have asked for reservation for children of inter-caste marriage.<br/>
In 40 years, Gujarat could have been the first caste-free state.<br/>
Female foeticide prevention could be a side effect.
