                            Mani Shankar is arguing that India should talk peace with Pakistan come what may. In other words "appeasement". He refers to the Indian Union Cabinet as " Modi and his cohort". This man confused MMS to do his appeasement act.

                            Mr. M.S.Aiyar, it is no secret that Pakistan is playing shock and awe game with India unmindful of loss and gain in the process as there are not many gain in friendship and no significant loss for Pakistan in animosity ever since Pakistan going nuclear.India was already a nuclear power way back in 1974 by doing Pokhran test by Mrs. Indira Gandhi led government just after defeating Pakistan and creation of Bangladesh. That is why Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee triggered neuclear testing in 1998 of Pokhran 2 is always BLAMED for providing Pakistan opportunity to get status of legible nuclear state by doing Chaigai Hill nuclear test .Now Pakistan is having hundreds of atom bombs. Courtesy-ATAL BEHARI BAJPAYEE. Otherwise Pakistan was about to sign nuclear non proliferation treaty and was almost agreed to become non -nuclear country for ever. Now Pakistan being a terrorist especialist state is nuclear state and Pakistan's atom bombs is more deterrent to India than India's to Pakistan despise flurry of terrorist attacks on India since then.

                            If Pakistan cannot control its own terrorists, how on earth did Mani the moron think Pakistan could dislodge an elected government in India?  Wasn't this what Mani the moron appeal for in Pakistani soil?  He sets out what the realities of terrorism are in Pakistan and India.  Would he therefore condemn Pappu for saying the he could eliminate terrorism in India within 15 minutes by 'empowering' the people?  Truth is that Mani the moron is a rubbishy analyst given to making grandiose statements without having either the expertise or anybody's mandate!

                            A sensible article by Mani....good to read. Not much Modi bashing and some honest suggestions on the way forward with Pak. Hope to read much more of these rather than the typical Mani articles which have become too boring to read. Whether we can trust Nawaz or not is a question only time will answer but it is in our own interest to do so at the moment. Pakistan is finally starting to feel the pain of having 'snakes in it's backyard' and seems like it wants to do something about it now

Unless India is not clear about who is the real attacker India will keep dithering  and snake oil salesman like MSA will keep  batting for the terrorists.
