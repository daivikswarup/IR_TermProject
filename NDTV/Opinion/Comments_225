                            Ever since Pakistan become nuclear power, ally of America in war against terror and growing patronage of China, this nation has become excessively brazen in it's outrageous anti-India practices. Come what proof they deny it whemently and it has started blaming India for self destruction. Given the tendency of Pakistan chances are they will invent some fictitious charechtor as a approver for terror crimes  hinting a handler in India and RAW as a source  for violence to undermine their misdeed . At that occasion, Pakistani Medea will put their act together to highlight this news  manufactured artificially. America failed to reform Pakistan , how we can bring out something positive from them as they are devoid of any positivity  and they are worst for even their own citizens.

                            Look out at our media . Press or electronic are happy undermining our own system by publishing all sensitive details publicly which help terrorist activity. Even any positive steps by Govt is criticized by the media to scuttle growth.

                            Pakistan is a failed state. Its elected government does not run the country, its army does. It has been repeatedly named as a supporter of terrorism by every democratic country in the world. Its government, army and the judiciary are all complicit in supporting terrorist activities. Since it does not have a free press, now the media is also actively trying to hide the truth about its status as a pariah country which follows medieval islamic laws and has repeatedly been called one of the most dangerous countries. It has itself suffered more than 25 major terror attacks in the last 2 years alone, notably the killing of schoolchildren, but still sees nothing wrong in supporting islamic jehadists. So what is surprising about its cowardly media not acknowledging the truth about David Headley's revelations?

                            Thanks Mr. Ali Salman for keeping an eye on other side. I appreciate that you are very much objective in your write-up and stay clear of giving 'expert' comment. Most of the time, we see 95% opinion (weird that too) and 5% facts / news, in media. But your column till now remains exception. Pls. keep it up.

                            While I disagree with Rehman Malik's 26/11 being RAW or Indian sponsor. I do agree questioned India's intelligence failure, pointing out that the terrorist entered India repeatedly without any problems and spent two years photographing and filming potential targets.<br/>
I am afraid indian intelligence agencies operates like typical Indian offices with babu's work from 10-5, and spent 1 hour on lunch and break after every hour for tea/pan, and spit on office wall..

                            Kejriwal should see to other important issues and not on odd-even. He thinks this is the easy way to gain some coverage news as in all other issues he can do nothing.

                            Kejriwal claims 81% vote in favour of odd-even. This is utter rubbish. WHo are the voters? Bikers? Yes, because they get more space. The IIT gave reports that cars not the ones for pollution. He can spend the money he puts for odd-even to pay MCD workers. Why did he and his govt not continue the odd-even after Jan 15?
