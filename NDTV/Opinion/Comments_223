                            Did the court not rule against you and in favor of Tata in singur?<br/><br/>
When did BJP have majority in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha ever before this govt.? Are you trying to say BJP was able to stop Bills even being a minority? When the middle wants to support... can't you ask people to vote and get it over with? Playing politics is more important?<br/><br/>
I never heard you saying this about intolerance.. you kept making us believe otherwise in all your debates? What changed? Do you want Brahmin vote now to win?

                            I completely agree with your views on the intolerant debate. We need to maintain our secularism in India because that is what we pride ourselves on. We are a country of various-religions and we must learn to live in harmony. Also your definition of development hits the nail right on the head. We shouldn't measure development with fancy sports cars and bungalows, We should measure it with basic necessities. <br/>
Always enjoy reading your blog. Looking forward to your next article.

                            Very well said Sir. We the people of West Bengal are very proud of you. Since 2011 we have gradually seen the state transforming and rising up. We are happy and very glad to see the developments happening in West Bengal. I think Bengal, as a state, is very secular and we don't really discriminate on the basis of religion and i am happy it is still like that. We stay together,eat together, celebrate festivals together irrespective of the religion.

                            Derek I agree Mamta stood by the people although they were 30% but the so called Agents of Development will not understand as they follow Narendra Damodardas Modi who didn't care even if 10 out of 10 were opposing. The unions were totally crushed, minorities taught a lesson and the policemen snared.

                            So when the congi morons resort to it, raise your voice against them and ask them to let parliament function. Otherwise there is always an opinion from you. Better still you could take that gun you always talk about

                            What about the violence in Singur instigated by Mamata and the TMC that finally made Ratan Tata abandon the project? That one incident has created so much ill will for the TMC that even today no major industrialist is willing to set up a factory in Bengal. With the CPM on one side and the TMC on the other, one will have to be insane to start an industry in Bengal. Bengal will be backward for a very long time.

                            GST - A to Z what ever you bring no change at least this worst mindset of Jattiwad is not change. The Higher Castes ruling since centuries. They are ruling class and want to be ruling class forever. They want to hijack power, resources and practice Jattiwad ( These Santan Dharmi Goons ruling India ) They do not want to share the privileges. India will not change unless these Trio-of-Holigans of Santan Dharma should be removed from the power and snatch resources from them.

                            West Bangal's loss was Gujarat's gain. One needs to look at a greater good than just the good of 30% of people. Instead of becoming aggressive and digging in the heels the WB government could have found a solution that would have kept Tata factory in WB. Jobs would have been created for people who did not have a land to live on. From this interview it seems clear that the WB government will only fight for land owners. Look at the bigger picture, man, look at the bigger picture...

                            Over simplified and shallow. For outsiders such frivolous analysis is fine. As a resident of Calcutta, and having travelled across the country/globe, I know it is one of the most liberal place. But it is the wrong politics of Jyoti Basu and his followers slow poisoned the state. Now the last few nails are done by this govt.

                            Mr.Derik, Your Government is the looser by driving away TATAS as you have lost Employment potential, Revenues to Exchequer, Growth of Ancilliary industries. Other states competed and Gujarat bagged opportunity.At best you should have asked them to leave early instead of causing hefty losses to shareholders all over the country, who invested in TATAS.No industrialist will venture starting industries in your State after this Episode.At best 4 times the land price should have been Negotiated for Farmers keeping in view the Future Development of State.
