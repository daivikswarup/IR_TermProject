                            and here we are to blame government again. It's is the people who need luxury apartments, Lavasa like artificial cities, Malls, Branded stores, Spa, 8-lanes roads to drive their luxury SUV -- This list goes on. And definitely it comes at the cost of Capitalism. So moral is first reduce your requirements. This will automatically demolish Capitalism.. Isn't it !!!

                            It is true that environmental degradation has taken place in Goa under the watch of elected governments. but that is true of such damage anywhere in the world including other parts of India. There is always friction between economic development and environmental damage. Each instance need not be the result of corruption. The classic case is of major dams crucial for agriculture, hydel power and drinking water but also leads to destruction of forests and indigenous communities. The solution is not to complain but find a balance. Such development also leads to some people growing rich leading to charges of corruption from those envious at not having so benefited. Mining in Goa is one such instance.

                            Excellent Job NDTV..... you are working overtime for an all out assault on the BJP government both at the state and national level. I wish to know what are your views on Konkan Railways which this particular gentleman opposed tooth and nail. Every project has pros and cons, one outweighs the other depending on the way you look at things. So please loose your political spectacle present rational articles.

                            It is time the centre bans all new human activities within a range of 50 KMs from the Western Ghats to save the states in which the Western Ghats are located . Primarily the onus is on the centre to save ghat states like Goa, Karnataka and Kerala from depredations in the name of development

                            The ill planned development of Goa is a policy of successive govts. Recently, Chennai city paid heavy price in terms of loss of lives and economy for ill planned development..If this state of affairs continues in Goa and other states for few more years then people have to pay heavy price for it.. Its time for common man to ask the Govt. to stop all environmental destructive projects..

                            Rangeelo Rajasthan...<br/>
Rajasthan is called Rangeelo (colorful) and its completely justified. The very feel of this beautiful state is full of colors.. The clothes, the monuments, the food, the sky and lakes, the people, everything is so full of colors that we never get bored of it.<br/>
And this is when we have seen only one of its colors- Pink. Yes, our last trip was to Jaipur, the pink city. It is so named because we can clearly feel the presence of this color everywhere in Jaipur. Even the air of Jaipur is pink, filled with the color of romance.<br/>
It had been in our travel list since long but we never made it. This time we planned the trip and that too in perfect season. Winter is the best time to visit Rajasthan. This is the only time when we can have those luxurious trips to forts and palaces without getting heat strokes. Even in peak winter, Jaipur afternoons were just bearable. But the nights were pretty cold.<br/>
We left for Jaipur on Saturday morning at 4 by car and reached at 10 driving comfortably, taking halts and not hurrying a bit. The road to Jaipur from Delhi is pretty awesome. (The trucks being only nuisance, although the witty, funny, philosophical and some weird quotes written on trucks were quiet a good time pass.).<br/>
We booked our stay at Hotel Amer View. It was not exactly as mentioned on its website and trip advisor. but was okay for a day. The staff was attentive and decent. Room service was great and food was good.We had our dinner at hotel and we got the best Chapatis and Rice.<br/>
After reaching hotel, we got ready, feasted on Alu Poori (My MIL prepared delicious Alu Poori at 3 am in the morning and we all loved every bit of them.) After sumptuous breakfast, we left for Jaipur (Amer is just 11 kms from Jaipur and holds more historical relevance. Moreover, we stayed in the vicinity of the city away from chaos. <br/><br/>
Day 1:<br/>
As we planned a real short trip, every minute was counting. We tried to hurry so that we could "cover" most of the places. But, trust me, whatever limited experience I have with travel, hurrying never results in good trips. Rather, it can spoil the entire plan. We just needed to step out of our hotel to lose our hurried attitude. The roads are wonderful to drive. However, we needed to be extra cautious as Jaipur Police is extremely strict with tourists. You forget putting up your seat belt for a fraction of a second and they will smell you from far. And they won't give you proper challan even if you insist. They start telling you the benefits of bribing and will settle for 100-200 bucks. So save yourself from some drama and put your and co passenger's seat belts before you put the ignition on.<br/><br/>
After leaving hotel, our first and nearest destination was Jal Mahal. As a kid, I always wanted to visit Jal Mahal but all my excitement blew off when I got to know that it is not open for public. We could only see it from across the lake. Even that was great. A flea market is there for all the shopaholics. And its a good one. You can easily bargain but I just feel guilty for bargaining from real artisans of India. We tend to spend huge in Malls but try to save 10-20 bucks from a poor vendor. That doesn't seem justified. (Oops! sorry for the gyan;-))<br/>
Everyone from the family was really enjoying the beauty of the place. It was like enjoying simple joys of life. Roaming around and doing nothing was fun.<br/>
And yes, Jaipur is a heaven for all photographers and selfie lovers.<br/><br/>
After Jal Mahal, we went to see Hawa Mahal. We thought it would be at some nice open place but there are so many forts in Jaipur that small fort like Hawa Mahal went unnoticed in the crowded market. There was some Metro construction going on. We saw something like Hawa Mahal (as seen in pictures) but thought that no... It can't be a Mahal. Its... Its on road. Yes, just like some shopping complex. When someone told us to return to reach Hawa Mahal, we were surprised. But, that is just outside story. From inside, its a real beauty. A fort made for ventilation. It is so well designed (courtesy ancient Indian architecture), that every part of this palace is properly ventilated. It has five floors, each having a specific purpose. <br/>
Here, we saw small woodn windows, intelligently built jharokhas(window), there was a specific design pattern in designing jharokhas. Each one had equally spaced slits which were inclined up or down as per the requirement of view. For upper floors, there was downward tilt and for jharohas at lower floors, there was an upward tilt to see the view at upper floors. There was so much to learn from the architecture, intelligent and stylish.<br/><br/>
We had a great time at one of the finest palaces in India and were quiet tired by now. We went towards the backside of Hawa Mahal and rested and snacked.<br/>
Everybody was in full mood to roam further, even though tired. We went on to nearest shopping arcade in the compound but found it too expensive. Most of the things be easily found in Delhi at much cheaper. Although, some handicrafts are a treasure to buy. We also coudn't resist and got few handicrafts for gifting.<br/>
In the compound, there are many temples and a mosque (It turned out to be a welcoming surprise to find a mosque in compounds of temples. A great example of Incredible, secular and tolerant India).<br/>
Darshan in Govind temple was a different experience, People in a group were singing joyous bhajans and locals, Indian and foreign devotees were dancing, totally engrossed in the atmosphere. Amazing experience. You should visit at least one temple in Jaipur to experience the euphoria of devotion. Better to go at Arti time.<br/><br/>
We also wanted to visit City palace but time didin't allow us. We had to reach Amer Fort before <br/>
6:30 to get tickets for open air Sound and light show at Amer. Its a great show. Timings may change so you need to keep a check. Most of the times, show is house full so prebook your seat. There are two shows- one in English and second one in Hindi. It narrates the story of Amer with sound and lights playing host with Amer Fort in the background.<br/>
When the show got over, it was chilly and even all the woolens were unable to save us from shivering. Better to take shawls, socks and caps.<br/><br/>
It was too late to dine out at 8:30 (Yes, you read it right. Jaipur sleeps too early) and we had to dine at our hotel. And we were grateful that we dined there. Just the kind of food we wanted for a good night's sleep.<br/>
Good Night Jaipur... Tomorrow can wait.<br/><br/>
Day 2:<br/>
After waking up late, eating late and being very late, we checked out from the hotel and left for Amer fort. I underestimated this fort. A whole day can be less for this fort and we had some 2 hours before leaving for Delhi. But as I said, hurrying is not good. So, we changed the plan and enjoyed our tour to Fort to the fullest. The fort can not be described in few words.<br/>
Just like my previous visits, this fort also has a filmy connect. (Jodha Akbar was filmed here)
