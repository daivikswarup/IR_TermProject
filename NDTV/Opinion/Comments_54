                            Derek, under Mamata, the situation has only worsened, whether you agree or not. No development in terms of industry or employment or in the field of education is visible. Infact it has gone from bad to worse. A two way flyover is being used for one way traffic, need i say more?

                            Written perfectly. Statistics don't lie. The 34 years ruined peoples lives and our economy. Abhishek it looks like the only person from a jungle is you.You seem to be clueless about facts or you're paid to much by CPIM to come and post your nonsense. Looking forward to more eye opening articles like this. Kudos NDTV.

                            But, isn't the state unit of the Congress and several Congress leaders in Delhi also salivating at the prospect of an alliance with the Reds, for the same reason: somehow grabbing power? Why do you not attack the Congress?

                            The CPM was awful. And Mamata no better. Even today Bengal is a mess, and will continue to be so if either of these parties come to power. O'Brien is a rootless wonder and he can say anything he likes. But the ground reality in Bengal has not changed after the coming of the TMC and nor will it change with the TMC in power.

                            Derek, agreed that CPM ruined Bengal but have you seen what you ( trinamool) has done in the last few years. You have even superseded and increased the pace of decay in Bengal. I feel sad and I hoped that you would have risen above politics to point this out to your dear "mamata di"

                            I think bengal has worsened under TMC. CPM party is outdated and lead by backdated people.<br/>
What bengal needed was a open minded govt with clear agenda of getting industry in bengal. <br/>
Unemployment is the main problem in bengal for ages now. Show us what TMC did to get business in bengal. I think singur is going to haunt TMC forever as no industrialist would risk his money. <br/>
But how difficult it is to mainatain law and order if clear instructions are given to police to arrest criminals irrespective of their party affliation. Even that has not happened.

Every political party shows height of desperation to come to power, to retain power, to come back to power.<br/>
TMC too has shown it , not too long ago, its called Singur!It is showing now, Its called Dadra. It will show in future, have wait for the name.

                            Derek you were hero for many of us and I used to follow you on Radio. Encyclopedia and after that you were my hero. When I heard you joined TMC then I was so happy that people like you will bring a positive change.<br/>
Unfortunately when I see you commenting now then I see you a hero who has failed and more than anger I feel pity that rather than transforming the goons of TMC, you have become one of them.<br/>
Have guts to talk about Malda, talk good and bad of Modi, support what Mamata is doing good for state but blast her off for misdeeds.<br/>
I still have hope in you and India has the best PM so far that it can get so help Modi and criticise him when he steps on wrong foot. DO you think Mulayam, Lalu, Rahul, Kejriwal or Mamata as a better PM than Modi?

                            Derek, I do not see more desparate politicians that you, your didi, Kejriwal and Communists. While you cannot handle Malda in your back yard, all of you jumped to Hyderabad to make ruckus out of Rohit's suicide. BJP or its one Minister might be at mistake, but can you imagine the damage you are doing to the social fabric of vertically dividing youth across the country. Please stop these nonsense politics. If you guys can fight on development and improved life standards, as citizens of this country we will be proud of you politicians. You do not support GST bill neither tell exactly what your demands are. Please feel ashamed to stop the development of the country. Stop dividing country on narrow lines of religion and castes. please unite people rather than spoil the fabric. Today more ashamed to look at the educated young politicians like you, Kejrival, Jagan Reddy and Rahul Gandhi. I am really worried that the new generation politicians are doing still low level politics than seasond politicians like Lalu, Mulayam, Mamatha and seasonsed communists. Please for heaven sake  save the contry not just being power hungry.

                            While I do agree that the Left Front rule was the darkest period, the present change on ground has been marginal. How much MoUs have been translated into actual business? Has the brain drain from Bengal stopped?<br/>
It's still a handful of Marwari businessmen (not industrialists) calling the shots in Bengal. It's still the dangerous vote bank politics been played out in Bengal. It's still a government that's anti-centre. <br/>
Finally, as the saying goes, 'people get the government they deserve'. If the people of Bengal decides to give TMC a second term, it's their call. However, that won't change the reality.

                            good post Derek. I would also congratulate the effort that has gone in transforming a state plagued by bandhs and non performing babu's to one where at the least, the government machinery is functioning. this is a phenomenal change. however, a lot needs to be done in media &amp; PR management which are important vehicles of public perception wherein the only things that surface are the crimes &amp; how bengal is a lost cause. it would be good to keep on posting such facts and figures which can put qualitative biased comments to rest. bengal is doing great, considering what it was 4 years back.

                            One will agree to most of what Derek O' Brien has expressed.34 years(1977-2011) of continuous Left Rule resulted in approx. Rs 2,70,000 Crores of debt to West Bengal. Again, Left Rule of about 34 years since Independence,(although not continuous) resulted in approx.Rs 1,35,000 Crores of debt to Kerala. The similarity between CPMs in Kerala and Bengal have been forced outward migration of Millions of Bengalis and Keralites for Employment Opportunities to Gulf Countries or other economically developed states and in many cases, work in inhuman conditions in Gulf Countries. Both are Revenue Deficit States, economically surviving on Remittances received from Gulf Countries(in case of Kerala) and other states like Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra ,TN etc.(in case of Bengal). Being anti-Capitalist, per CPM ideology, CAPITAL(MONEY) should be shunned. But, when in power in Kerala or Bengal, CPM in both states SHAMELESSLY took long term loans (CAPITAL/MONEY) from different sources, both India and abroad to fund their Social Sector Schemes. If they have aversion towards Capital/Money, they should not touch or take Long Term Loans from others. Instead, CPM should first generate wealth on its own by working hard and then use the self generated money for Social Sector Schemes. First WEALTH or REVENUE CREATION by its own efforts and then REDISTRIBUTION of wealth towards Social Sector Schemes. CPM, should first giveup their negative mindset and stop being JEALOUS of hard working Wealth Creating Entrepreneurs like Azim Premji, N R Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani, Tatas, Bansals  etc etc as they have contributed more to the Country by way of new Employment creation, Taxes, Technology, Charity etc. than 34 years  each of CPM rule in Kerala and Bengal. More employment and taxes are generated by PRIVATE Sector than Government or Public Sector.
