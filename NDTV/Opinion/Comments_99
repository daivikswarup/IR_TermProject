When was the last time article 356 was used and by whom?? When the centre was going hammer and tongs against democratically elected ( that too multiple times) Gujrat govt where was Ashutosh. Let him reproduce the pieces he had written back then saying federalism is in danger.... Otherwise just shut up. The right to free speech is in grave danger because of people like Ashutosh who speak only in falsehoods and stupidities

What kind of jokers have been elected to the Delhi ? And as usual, accusations from AAP and no proofs. While CBI has caught Arvind's favorite secretary with all proofs. Dear Ashutosh, it's time to grow out of diapers. And do you remember Sheila Dikshit ? Arvind was reading her file. It has been 3 years since he began reading his file.

With utmost and sincere respect, I just want to ask you a question through NDTV. Why everyday a new drama ? Press conference and allegations. Why don't you go to court and put your all findings before the court to have a look and decide. At media and conferences we the common people listen ur allegations and from govt a counter allegations. Whole country s fed up with this. At least if I don't say about country, but still people like me have fed up with this Tom and Jerry kind of fight. Please put all these to stop and go to court. Common people who listen these comments doesn't have the power to make judgement. Only we can make the judgement about a person. If u want us to make personal judgement then fine, but if u really want to put facts and observations then plz go to court. We still have a great faith over our judiciary. Once for a time we can't believe u politicians but our faith over our August courts are still intact.

                            I don't think this is an issue that should take so much focus from AAP. People facing winters without food and shelter is a larger issue. Please focus on the real stuff. Lots of times I get the feeling that your party has decided that they want 10 mins of each news bulletin and while that is perfectly legitimate goal of the party, it cannot be at the cost of governance. Please govern. Please focus and please save your energies for stuff that really matters to people

                            Hey Ashutosh,<br/>
I thought that your are man of commonsense, but my perception was wrong. Its easy to ask question but are you entitled to get answers. I am not defending Jetley but if you have something serious to claim then go to court, follow the procedures and make sure that nations knows the complete truth based on proven fact and explainable by Constitution of India and understood by Judiciary so that culprit should go behind bars.<br/><br/>
It's so easy, fashionable and political to raise finger against your political opponent, just by fancy thoughts. So talk something sensible and generate some faith of nation by your actions.

                            Dear Mr Ashutosh<br/>
I have the highest regards for you as an individual and appreciate your work as a Journalist.I am not any party supporter but an individual who has his own perceptions and thought process on various issues.Before i give my views, let me make one thing clear that i am not a Pro BJP or anti AAP.Whatever i write is my own personal opinion.I was a great fan of Arvind your CM of Delhi.Probably, i know him more than what you know of him as i was his Alma Matter during his IIT Days.His honest and simplistic approach during his engg days and during Anna Movement was exemplary and noteworthy.His tenure with IRS was too gud as i watched him from my Corporate office at Gurgaon.<br/>
However, what turned me off was when he decided to turn into a politician inspite of the fact that he issued statements in press that he will never ever enter politics.I will not go into his compulsions of going into politics but the fact remains that he realised that he can be a force to recon with in Indian Politics.I still regard him as one of those rare politician who his honest up right and willing to walk that extra mile to serve people.<br/>
However in the last few months, i have been seeing him and of course you getting into politics of criticising opponents and making issue out of it for personal gains.I am sure u will agree that u are into politics for serving your own purpose rather than serving the people.<br/>
Delhi Police and ACB not in your control has been there since ages and you must learn to live with it.Do you think that past govts have not performed with these constraints.Everybody has certain limitations and your party has also inherited the same.But that does not give you the right to tell people that u are not able to perform as u have certain system limitations.PEOPLE WHO PERFORM UNDER ADVERSARIES ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE APPRECIATED.<br/>
You are a honest trier.Please dont get swayed by people like Raghav Chaddha and Sanjay Singh or Kumar Vishwas.They are people who are running the show today and forcing Arvind to say what they require.Look at another great friend of yours namely Ashish Khitan.He is happy getting all the facilities of a minister and has become a rable rouser of AAP in media.<br/>
Please show some restraints but you are also eying Rajya Sabha seat in the next couple of years.<br/>
AAP is still clean of corruption but the way they are functioning is not acceptable.<br/>
Would appreciate a reply from you <br/>
Regards<br/>
Ashish Mehrotra

Otherwise one should be totally out of their senses, even then they could be locked up for disturbing public peace. You cannot justify for what one says, one should be sued and pay damages. If you want proper rule of government, learn about Singapore laws. It has done well and no nonsense.

Infact you have no moral authority to ask any questions when you have not answered any questions about your ministers, MLA's etc who have been arrested or charged with wrongdoings.
