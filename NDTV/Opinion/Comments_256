                            Yet again low level politics being played. Brinda could have raised these questions by herself instead of needlessly bringing in his mother. It is a typical attempt to play the emotional card with mother sentiment. Every criminal have a mother and every innocent have a mother, but all the mothers have the same affection and feeling for their sons. That is irrelevant while discussing the legalities of the case.

                            you should be ashamed of your intellect when you say " Smriti Irani's performance". All you alligations she did everything are wrong. There is pending investigation on this matter please wait for it to conclude. Neither you are capable of telling anything truth nor intellectually capable judging any body right or wrong. The only thing you may be capable of is to do politics.<br/><br/>
you para 4 is ridiculous, there is a pending investigation why are jumping to conclusions. Are you educated enough on this ?<br/><br/>
I am deeply moved by the by Radhika's survival. There are so many people in India who may be dalith or not and we all need to ashamed of i. But its just that we all do at different instances of life. But why are you opposing a fair investigation in all dimensions ? <br/><br/>
All the information you want to Rohits tragedy, will be brought out in fair investigation. Neither you nor any of us know the facts which must be out in public domain after investigation. With all your assumed intellect you should have known it.<br/><br/><br/>
Are you a fool, How will Radhika get justice with out investigation and going through judicial process. its not kagaroo courts that that are done by your alliance. Thorough due process needs to be conducted and guilt needs to be punished. There are lot of unanswered questions on how he was pronounced medically dead without any medical examination done till next day morning and how his body was hidden from everybody. Let the truth come out and guilty be punished.<br/><br/>
My piece of advice if you may want to take. don't play with the emotions of a grieving mother and play politics on philosopher/child death. its not good for your elite intellect. It demeans your position people have given you.

                            Ms Karat it is indeed sad that you call the passionate speech by Ms Irani as "performance". I say, what you write over in this column is performance and a very bad one at that.<br/>
Question the ministers as much as you want to and they should answer. And answer Ms Irani did. With nothing left in your armoury, you bring in this rhetoric. Did Radhikaji tell this to you in person? I am certain she didn't.<br/>
It is a figment of your imagination. Trust me, people now see through you and your policies. This divisive politics that you have been playing for so long is now going to be a thing of the past.<br/>
My personal advice, try doing something constructive in your life, if you have a life.<br/>
P.S. - Rohith in his note did not indict anyone. Period.<br/>
What about the charge that he was a Yakub sympathizer. Is that not a reason good enough for the University to take action.

                            Hello Mrs.Brinda<br/>
I read your post, passionately written, designed to stoke lot of sympathies. At the outset let me say, I have nothing against Rohith or Radhika or Raja, who are all like brothers and sisters, just like any other fellow Indian. But still I am compelled to ask some questions to them, through you, of course. If you can find answers please let me know,<br/>
1) Rohith, supported for his studies by a determined yet poor mother Radhika, went to Hyderabad university to pursue his doctoral research. Instead of focussing on his research and getting a degree, settling in a good job, earning money and putting a full stop for the sufferings of his entire family, who are dependent on him, why he chose to be part of the students union (right or left does not matter)and engage himself in activities that are not connected with his academic work?<br/>
2) Why he chose to be part of certain gathering, which was organising pro-afzal guru protests?<br/>
3) Why he engaged himself in a violent attack with a rival students union?<br/>
Unfortunately brother Rohith is not living today to answer my questions, it won't be fair on my part to post these questions to the grieving mother and brother. So let me put these questions to you. Why instead of focussing on their studies and fulfilling the hopes of their families, these young lads land up in dharnas, agitations, etc etc? Are they being brainwashed and misguided by some narrow minded organizations, who want to further their narrow ideologies and politics? No I am not accusing you Mrs.Brinda, I am seeking answers. Answer me if you can

                            The nub of the whole affair is why and how " a Bharat Mata's son" was declared an extremist and an anti-national by Bandaru Dattatreya and endorsed endlessly by Smriti in her ministry's repeated letters to the university authorities to expel "Bharat Mata's son" from the university and staunch his stipend.

Those who killed this teacher was his old friends and comrades of CPM .This happened before three years and incident took place in kannur kerla. Last month CPM goons killed an RSS worker in the presence of his old aged parents. CPM students would have forced this dalit students Rohith to commit suicide in order to get political mileage to corner the government. CPM is dangerous to our people and society. They are chinese coolies and funded by missionaries and congress.

                            Okay.<br/><br/>
So Late Mr.Vemula grew up under very difficult circumstances. This is very much possible. If that be the case, then shouldn't he have had his own life in focus before anything else and tried to secure himself a good job and make the life of his mother and siblings better? He was an intelligent student. Why couldn't he put his intelligence to good use, rather than get it involved in politics? He should have known his responsibility to his own family. People who struggled to get him to where he was.But no! He chose to shout slogans, pick up fights and then end his life. If this isn't selfishness, what is? Did he even think about what his family would go through because of this brazen act? And all the politicians come out of their burrows to play the blame game seeing this as a juicy opportunity. Have some shame!

There were many such suicides in UPA regime as well and they were never blown out of proportion as done in this case. Clearly Congress and other parties are caught off guard when Smriti gave point by point rebuttal. I guess Rahul has already packed his bag for his next asylum.

                            The hardship that Rohit's mother has gone through and the way Rohit took efforts in his education are worth highest of the praise. Yet this is not the only example and surely not only the 'Dalits' who go through this. There are hundreds of examples of similar mothers and their sons even though from upper cast who go through similar circumstances. One thing I fail to understand is that how did all this 30 years of agony of this mother happen in Congress rule. I bet there will be more similar stories in West Bengal which has been ruled by Left for decades. If they are so concerned about the plight of the dalits, why is it that after so many years of their rule things are so bad?  <br/>
You cant hold the current govt responsible for this.<br/>
What Vrinda fails to mention is that there were 8 similar cases of suicide in earlier years in this university. So it is more of a systemic and social problem than a problem of political pressure as it is being made out to be. <br/>
The problem with our politics is that they need cast identity to put emotional angle to any case. The basic problem is left aside and the cast/religion of the person takes primacy in the debates. Lot is said about the cast discrimination, need for more reservations, emotions are flared up in other students who may be going through similar hardships and they are dragged into the politics of the incident rather than they getting guidance and the much needed emotional support. Media who is expected to do objective reporting also gets lost in the policts concentrating only on cast and religion angle.

There was a medical student who hanged himself for ragging which happened in one of our prestigious institute - his mother too asked same questions to then education minister of congress. Did any answer came. If a Dhalit has beaten up some other caste, can that be consider lesser crime? Can law differentiate crimes based on the caste and religion. Communist is course on the country since they destroyed working culture, they destroyed economies, and they destroyed right to live dignified way.

Now, he is no more Rohit Vemula but " Dalit Rohit Vemula " what an irony!! <br/><br/>
Rohit has gifted his life to the political opportunist's like Rahul Gandhi &amp; Arvind Kejriwal, poor Rohit would not have imagined the dirty politics being played on his name by RG &amp; AK. <br/><br/>
Rohit should have lived and justified his actions rather than commit suicide like a coward. I'm sure he must be repenting now, RIP Rohit.

                            Dear Ms. Radhika, I quite agree with your contention that it takes a lot of hard work to reach the level of PhD. But believe me, it takes even more hard work to waste it and fritter it away on irrelevant issues (to a serious PhD student) like Yakub Memon and Afzal Guru. Let us leave them to the courts and other relevant agencies. One can surely feel about issues but it is another thing to be obsessed by them. Does getting obsessed by Yakub Memon and Afzal Guru indirectly indicate that PhD had become of secondary importance. After all how many would notice you as a successful PhD whereas a lot would notice you as a protestor against Yakub Memon and Afzal Guru's hanging.

                            Why are we always playing a divide India card. He was a Dalit, he was a Muslim, he was a Christian and hence he was cornered and targetted. When will the political parties rise beyond the votebank politics. How many times have we seen this "I am a deprived" card played. Even the privileged like Azharuddin, SRK, Amir Khan cant resist to play that card outside of politics. If you meet his mother again Mrs Karat, tell her exactly what the minister said in her response. She said that if this boy really hung himself and his so called friends who had nothing but politics on their mind really wanted his son to live then they would have taken him to a hospital or got a doctor to attend him asap. What was done instead, he was left there to die so that politics can be played in his name. Suicide is not murder. You killing yourself is an act of cowardice and I have seen anger in the eyes of a man whose son committed suicide and he is not complaining that the society is not fair. He was a non Dalit by the way and he could not handle the competition. May be Rohith also succumb to competition. I want to become Karl Sagan is a good dream but then his efforts to become him were not sufficient or he gave up. The university cannot do anything which would not let him do what he really wanted to do. Further he also was celebrating Yakub Memon about which I dont know how much he knows or knew. What is the connection between Yakub Memon and him being a Dalit which would make his hold such celebration. This is the teachings of your student organizations Mrs Karat which connect one type of injustice to another type which in this case is manufactured and that is that Yakub Memon is also a victim like you Rohith. And then the boy is lost. Your Mrs Karat and your student organizations which pry upon the under privileged of this country are the ones to blame for JNU and Hyderabad University incidents. So stop using Rohith's mother as a shield and say this is what I want and not what Rohith's mother wants.

                            I thought he was suspended because he attacked abvp people. Did they really care what his caste was? Also, why is it called institutional murder if he commited suicide? People commit suicide for many reasons including their own inability to cope with the world. This is not to support BJP or Irani. Just general questions for anyone who can answer...

                            Brinda Karat should debate and discuss this issue in parliament. Smrithi Irani  has answered all the questions raised by opposition in the floor of the parliament.<br/><br/>
Staging walkouts merely to save your faces after the speech of HRD Minister which of full of substance, nationalism and facts.<br/><br/>
Hope the Left parties,BSP,RJD,Kejriwals and  congress will grow up and come out of this caste politics which is dangerous for country.

                            Brinda Ji.... do you have facts about the allegations you make. If you do, debate it in parliament and not in media or editorial columns. If you are saying this based on here-say, gather facts and then approach. Otherwise spare the nation of your divisive and regressive venom.
