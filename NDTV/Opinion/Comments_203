                            As you said, it is a choice that you made and not necessary that it will be the right choice all the time and for everybody.

                            You mean to say you are successful because you murdered a kid. Man competition is tough....one can kill their own to be successful.

                            You are talking about your freedom. What about the freedom of the baby that was in your womb?

                            Janice is a shame to a country founded on the christian faith that grants the unborn child a status in the eyes of the law equal to the mother's. She should read the the Bible at least once to know the grotesque act that she is so brazenly proud of. Cruelty to an unborn helpless babe can never be justified, that too just because someone lacks temperance. Of course 95% of women would say they did a good act....they have been brainwashed by their shrinks to believe so. Historically there have been more women who were poorer than Janice who have had more peace and joy though they did not have her education or her financial stability.<br/><br/>
Ans she call herself successful? The fact that she wrote this shows she had been struggling in her thoughts about the aborted child. I wonder if she thought of the joy that child could have brought her....Or does her 17 year old daughter wonder what would have happened if her mom had a crisis 17 years ago?

                            I am pro-choice. It is a woman's right to decide whether she thinks she is ready to give birth or if she is mentally, physically or financially unprepared to take responsibility of a new life. In my opinion, it is very childish to think that by giving birth to a baby you have achieved greatness against those who decide otherwise.

                            Dear Ma'm, you denied the 'right to live' to your baby in order to build up your career. Your baby would have become the President of the United States. You denied him/her that right. You murdered your baby. This is such a gruesome act of selfishness. We Indians are yet to become selfish like you. We are a poor country with more than 1.2 billion people. But we still love our children. The poorest Indian mother will never kill her baby for a better life.

                            you are a lawyer not because you did abortion ( which is your personal choice) but because you wanted to be one. I have many examples in neighbourhood. The girl gets married and has her first child in her teenage. But she worked hard in spite of all responsibilities of her child. Today she is a successful teacher and one of her sons is in defence forces and other is lawyer. .........

                            I respect everyone view and opinion. Here I am not going to say right or wrong but If anyone who can't feel the value of new life within themselves..then forget about the humanity..<br/><br/>
Well..not sure how can we call them..those who did that acts without humanity..
