                            One hopes that even as the US troops are pulled out of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan are not made to secure Afghanistan using their security forces. It would simply transfer problems from the USA's shoulders to (economically) frail shoulders of India and Pakistan

From Columbus to East India company, and now the current super power or rather Super business houses; the driving force and the motivation has remain the same. Coincidentally, Modi represent the who's who of Indian business houses and Nawab Sharif himself is the business baron. the chemistry and the love between these two had to florish. but the the million dollar question will be, whether it has the blessing of Raheel Shareef?

                            The events unfolding is not in a novel or a story book that a person can finish reading it in a day or two and know how the plot ends. Give the events time to build up and reach some kind of logical end. It is also quite possible that the experiment may have to be jettisoned midway if the anticipated results are not to our liking or benefit. Mr. Omar Abdullah, since you have had a long innings in the political arena should be aware of this. But just because the results are not immediately visible does not mean that no action should be taken. I know that for your own personal and political reasons, you are against the present government at the center, but if you have a better alternative, why don't you spell it out.<br/><br/>
In the last 18 months, we have seen that politicians like you and your ilk have been criticizing anything that the center has been attempting. So much so, that the parliament is also not being allowed to function with the Congress saying that the Government is offering so many chances to protest. The opposition should realize that they have a responsibility to the country and have to act maturely. Even if the Government gives them a cafeteria of reasons to protest, they are not beholden to take advantage of the same.

                            Keep guessing. It's difficult to understand Chanakya neeti by morons. Next is the move for complete surrender of Kashmir to the sovereignty of Bharat as proposed by Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherji and revoke of article 370. Either Kashmir will be in India or be a new Pakistan and get attacked by your Messiahs, ISIS. And then Next is implementation of Uniform Civil Code in Bharat.

                            The way forward should be based on the following:<br/>
- In the short term there is no solution to Kashmir dispute other than maintaining status quo. <br/>
- Human issues such as rehabilitation of Pandits and promotion of peace through converting J&amp;K as a normal and yet another state should be continued.Human Rights issues should be handled on both sides.<br/>
- In the mid-term promote trade and tourism, convert India, Pakistan and Afghanistan as a seamless region.  Defocus on terrorism, focus on trade, gas pipelines and so on.<br/>
- Close out trial of 26/11.<br/>
- In the longer term work for an Indian Union in the lines of European Union.In larger scheme of things territorial disputes do not affect normal people.<br/>
- Promote Hinduism enough to not get swamped by other religions.

                            The tones in this op-ed suggest that Mr Abdullah, seasoned and matured politician as he is, is silently praying for Mr Modi's diplomacy towards Pakistan to fail so he can proudly say, "I told you so!" The only reason to ask these questions is to what to attack next. If the Pakistan policy is made completely public, they shred it apart finding non-existent holes in the policies. If it isn't, they come shouting from the rooftops saying they hope the Prime Minister knows what he's doing.<br/>
The simple fact of the matter is that a very public Pakistan policy hasn't worked for the easy to comprehend reason that, on both sides, the opposition doesn't want the establishment to succeed in progressing at all, even at cost of national interests. Back-channel negotiations along with unannounced public postures is the way to go!

                            You need to think about the Indo Pak process like a game of soccer / football, played in slow motion, with the press and others analyzing every pass of the ball. In soccer, the objective is to get the ball into the opponent's net, but sometimes you kick the ball towards your own goal when going simply forward doesn't make sense. Its all part of a strategy. Imagine if every ball kick towards your own goal was criticized. But that is what Congress and their allies are doing.

                            Perhaps, Modi first wanted to focus on visiting countries where there are business interests. He has more or less visited major countries that are relevant. Other issues/countries are essentially drain on time and resources; nothing concrete is expected? We know that; dont we?
