                            Disappointed with the quality of this article. The headline refers to GST which is what made me read the article but more than 80% of the content had nothing to do with GST. It was only a cursory (almost an afterthought I would say) that GST was referred. I think this is the crafty thinking of an accomplished politician that might have prompted the use of the most important acronym in recent times - GST - to increase number of readers. Sad that even someone as accomplished as Derek could not conjure up a decent article aligned to his chosen title.

                            Those are some strong list of questions Sir. You are absolutely right that its the job of the Parliament to discuss, debate, deliberate and legislate. Will be waiting for the answers and we will surely miss you during the session . Thank you for detailing each and every aspect and helping us understand everything. Things look very good for TMC in West Bengal and we are 100% sure that TMC will win hands down and will keep up the good work.

Will the 'lady luck' shone on me and will i get a reply sir ? (mind you sir, people like me are paying for your food and security, dont forget that)

The only activity that congress, communists, AAP, JDU, RJD, all your friends, are doing is various attempts to tarnish BJP and central govt. You may also join the fun and ensure that the coming session is a complete white wash. It will make you all very happy of being instrumental in blocking all people benefit activities. Best of luck in this venture.

Just Good old trick-politics..prioritising state election campaigning more than national duty at the cost of his employers, the people....traits of a selfish ignorant Indian or not Indian at all..GST is extremely beneficial for the country &amp; ruling party..so in their interest to pass it, the only people who loose out is Opposition parties or states who loose out some tax revenue in short-term &amp; hence the baseless &amp; senseless disruptions by congress, tmc &amp; others. As for us lot, we are all dumb as dodo's to not see this &amp; still go against the bjp in bihar, delhi &amp; wb....no wonder we've been over-ruled for 1270+yrs 1000-moughal, 200-british, 70-congress (of which 10-italian-rule)...as they say, u reap wat u sow...so wake up people..stop fighting for quotas on the streets, fight for real progress &amp; support the PM's initiatives🙏🏽
