                            Kejri started "No Regrets" club.This guy is the new member. All foul mouthed politicos can abuse others and say "No Regrets" once; they get the club membership.If you express apology or regrets anytime, membership gets cancelled forthwith. By the nature of membership criteria, most of the members will be from Didi party and Muffler Party.

                            Dear Mr. Brian, Liar Liar.  you wanted no good to come out of the debate.  Your leader nor has your party ever shown sensitivity towaards women issues.  If you are sincere, let see you coming up with a better draft instead of just shouting over roof tops about your noble intentions.  Action man.... do some good work for a change.

                            The backlash after Nirbhya case was more due to murder than rape. But then as we are used to suffer from mobs, we can understand the outcome as a means to justify the ends.Submitting to whims of mob will prove fatal as always mobs are devoid of  senses. We don't keep open our door  for thieves hoping that law agency will take care of eventuality and police will bring back lost belongings. The same applies here . "Prevention is better than cure".It is better to guard ,the same way politicians used to take help of commondos for safety . Otherwise stringent capital punishment law would have solved the problem of death due to violence.

Neither you or your leader or party have ever shown sensitivity towards women.  if you are so sincere, let us see some major steps towards better women security and better administration of juvenile homes in West Bengal - Actions speak louder than words Mr. Brien.

                            Problem is we give law to the enforcement agencies in this country and they tend to use its stringest provisions. Laws by themselves arent complete unless they match up to the capability and capacity of the enforcement agencies

                            I agree. In today's India everything goes.     People are vying with each other to be as uncivil, idiotic and outright cruel. Civility is elitism and frowned upon. Chappan inch chathism rules.

                            India is indeed becoming intolerant. No one can say anything against the BJP or RSS, even if they are factually correct. People get defensive, angry, critical and upset.  We will never grow as a nation if we are not open to criticism.
