                            Only abrogation of 370 will solve the Kashmir problems

                            Presidents rule in Kashmir, abrogate article 370 and resettle kashmir with people from overpopulated states. Kashmir problem is gone. This will take a 15-20 years but still is worthwhile trying to do. If we can accept Bangladeshis in India, surely we should be able to accept Indians settling within India.

                            The separatist PDP and the nationalist BJP balance each other out in Kashmir. This equilibrium is important to maintain stability in the region. PDP allying with Congress, a party willing to do anything to get in power, will only push kashmir away from the rest of India. Toghether ,even if PDP and Congress don't completely saw-off J&amp;K from India, they will make sure that it is hanging only by a thread.

                            Ms.Barkha Dutt gave all possibilities in her Article. I strongly predict that present Alliance will certainly continue for following reasons: As Barkhaji said Representation from Jammu Area is vital. Central funds flow comfortably if the colors are similar with center.Present Government at Center is making all head ways for talks with Pakistan so that some light can be seen through Tunnel for J&amp;K solution.Scam parties can never come back to power at center and that seals prosperity for the region.Just Wait and see my prediction and not mere based on wish of some people.

                            Its only a matter of time, the anti-BJP alliance will be formed and BJP will be wiped out. No partners seem to like the BJP. The BJP must learn to work with alliances. BJP seems to be a one man Modi army.

                            If Mahabooba Mufti breaks with BJP it will be betrayal of her father. If she collaborates with Congress it will be betrayal of the people of J &amp; K as congress has never given good governance to the people. She has to bring her party men together to continue present arrangement with BJP. She has to concentrate to provide good governance to the people o.f Kashmir. If she does so she will win the heart of people of J &amp; K.

                            In democracy why the family politics and father to son and daughter pass on off power? Is there no one else in the party?

                            One interesting angle which nobody is looking into is that the PDP + INC may not have enough numbers to form the Government. So, PDP tying up with INC is almost ruled out except if they want a break away faction of the NC to support their Govt. Also, since NC &amp; PDP don't see eye to eye, there can't really be any "Anti BJP" alliance. Interesting times ahead but we should hope the state does not slip into fresh polls. That would bring down the PDP numbers for sure &amp; give the BJP (and to an extent the NC) additional "default" seats

                            I think she will play by the sympathy wave and move for fresh elections. Remember 1984 when Indira was assassinated? I think getting all the seats from the valley is her thought

                            Whenever PDP came to power separatism got boost either by design or providence. BJP does not have key ministries in this Government. BJP is neither able to support aspirations of Jammu, Kashmiri Pandits or longstanding injustice to India through article 370 and residency laws, which PoK does not have. May be NC and BJP can regroup with a power sharing arrangement and let us have a Hindu PM for 3 years.

                            By breaking away from the alliance her father so thoughtfully forged would only amount to disrespect to the departed soul. Mufti was known to be far-sighted and his long experience is nothing compared to that Mehbooba holds although she was her part in colloboration. She must continue the arrangement and see for her and experience how it works given that she will now play a more pro-active role in the administration of the JKI. So far she might have played anb influential rule, even proxy but now she will be the dejure CM if she decides to be sowrn in.

                            She cannot break the alliance as she will then be forced to seek the support of Congress, which will be offered readily only to see the BJP humbled but will mean nothing in real terms. Her interests, which are coterminous with those of J&amp;K, will be best served only if she quietly maintains status quo and tries to get the maximum benefit for the state.
