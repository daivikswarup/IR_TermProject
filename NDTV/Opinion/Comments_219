                            What a load of bull crap. Looks like the author has major depression issues. There is  high probability that she would still be sad had she stayed put in Calcutta (although she would be more poor). Do the humanity a favour and trade your green card with a potential immigrant who would actually value and would celebrate his immigrant life in America. Totally ruined my mood first thing in the morning.

                            The article is really worth to read and exactly true..First article on NDTV which has sense... not biased.. this is exactly for those who immigrated because others might feel USA is model country but harassment is also in USA and other parts of world.

                            The classic immigrant story. But really, there is no place like home. An Indian in America, even if fourth generation immigrant, will always be an outsider. The chances of integrating into white America are rather dim, however hard you try. Finally you end up losing your identity and your dignity. See the classic case of Bobby Jindal. Converting to Christianity or changing your name will not help you amalgamate or lighten your skin tone.

                            I can sympathize with the author but her experience is not the norm for immigrants. It was perhaps a combination of the fact that she was only 12 and had no say in the move and also her personality which seems to see the glass as half empty. I moved to America in 1999 when I was 21 and approached it as an adventure and totally enjoy it here. There are definitely things you cannot find here but plane tickets are cheap(in economy) and I travel at least one or twice a year to India and enjoy the things there. Most of my friends are that way though they don't go to India as much. I can WhatsApp with my cousins in India, follow my undergrad friends on FB, Skype with my parents and grandma and it is not very different than if I lived in a far away Indian city. When we really miss India, my American girlfriend and I watch Makkal TV on the Internet or Tamil comedies on youtube and call my mother and make some poories to remind us of her cooking. Also most immigrants who came before the 1990s were not able to be connected via the Internet and don't go back as much so they don't realize how much things have changed. I badly wanted to live in Bangalore or another big city when I was young. These days when I am in India I cannot wait to get out of the big cities with their pollution and traffic and spend time in a small town or village. You can get wireless internet at 15Mbps at the village where my parents live and HD/4K satellite transmissions. So look on the bright side of life wherever you are and try to enjoy it!

                            To all the people criticizing her - remember she was recollecting her first experience -  she was a child when she landed in US. Children's perceptions are different, their needs different. And of course she does say it gets better, and in her case it definitely did.<br/><br/>
Anyway, The main point she is trying to convey is that America is not the ultimate immigrant destination forever - it is now (or at least perceived) but it will change, and Americans who grow up believing their land is the 'best' need to realize that eventually they will also be looking to migrate to some other country.

                            Very nicely written. I am immigrant to usa and came here at age 22. I dont share the sentiments though. Looks like author never assimilated in society or doesnt appreciate american culture. Which is quite rich by the way if you have open mind.

                            .Do the media  give so much importance to the personal accounts of so many educated Indians who are serving the society here facing lot of challenges ????<br/>
There are millions of Indian- Amercians who would give umpteen tales of their adaptability and challenges faced ..<br/>
Obviously their parents or themselves  took a cautious decision to migrate weighing pros over cons  and hence they should have known that there would be confusions and  identity problems for the next generations born there  ..<br/>
..but still they chose to  migrate looking for what they think as *greener pastures * and she is one among them ..<br/>
so there is no point in discussing their challenges because they their family themselves made the decisions . <br/>

There needs to be more screening of immigrants, unfortunately the world we live in today is not the same as early 80's!! -- I am an immigrant who came to this country from Kolkata by legal means!

                            Mayank: You have right to have your opinion. You can celebrate the having of green card when you come as an adult in USA because you think that immigration to US is pure GOLD. But when a girl or boy of 12-13 years come along with parents, they may be nostalgic about the previous tastes, belongings, friends, streets, cows on streets, crowds. It is necessary what means to you will mean to others.So problem is not with Sharmila Sen, problem is with mood of your who may be spoil his morning and so reactionary attitude. Dear please don't feel offended.

                            You don't have to travel to another part of the world to feel this way. My grand father had moved to a Metro city and since then we are 4 generations living in this city. Still, by and large i see people referring to each other based on the place of origin. The problem is the new generations are confused because they have either never been to their place of origin or they cant even relate to them but still they are made to feel it!!! ... Outside the country as well its the same story!!!

                            No generalisation please! I am first generation immigrant who moved 15 years back and my teenage kids have really done well in the UK and integrated well, and yet we are proud of our Indian roots and culture. Only people who do not integrate well make a bit too much noise about things like racism. If smell of bacon can be exaggerated to such extent so can be the smell of a lot of Indian food, this article is really stupid and dim witted tbh!
