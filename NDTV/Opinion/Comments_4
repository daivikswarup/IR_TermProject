                            Dear MS, For 90% of India's independence congress has been in power. Most Senior positions in Banks, PSUs and Govt depts are staffed by those who are appointed by Congress (ie Congress Supporters). Loans don't become Bad in just 2 years that BJP is in Power. Loans become bad when they are allocated to doubtful projects. In fact banks have almost stopped giving Loans in the last 2 years. Most loans that are NPA now were disbursed during the time Congress was in Power. Problem has to be fixed, but if they were allocated against week collateral, it is difficult to recover.  Have some sense and work with Govt to Recover the money from problem caused by bad policies of congress. Don't waste time writing biased articles.

This is one more massive scam which requires the complete investigation of the Congress Finance Ministers, Ministry of Finance officials, bank executives and big businessmen. Wherever major loans are shown as outstanding or sought to be written off, there should be a complete CBI investigation. Hefty penalties including life imprisonment should be awarded to the guilty as they have destroyed the PSU banking system and thousands of crores of public money has gone into the pockets of these criminals.

                            Being a banker, I can appreciate the technicalities mentioned and explained in the article. I am sure the ruling class will have some plausible explanation. The fact remains that bad debts of banks are built of huge amounts of a few large corporations. Only those with political clout with the rulers of the day, manage to get those huge debts written off. This exercise can be safely termed theft of Public money. I remember from UK, theft or robbery from a contracted out post office, is treated as theft of public money and is considered the most serious crime.  On the other hand in my Bharat Mahaan, stealing/robbing or embezzling public money is the easiest crime. And with contacts at right places, the police, politicians or the investigating agency officers, makes the matters so much easier. While robbery at the PNB in Ludhiana, in the nineties was a case which fell in the category of criminal act, the corporate route of robbing the banks does not even fall in any category inappropriate activity.

- Almost all of these loans were extended during UPA govt<br/>
- 'write offs' which are presented as some kind of conspiracy by Mr Aiyar are actually according to RBI guidelines which forces banks to write off starting from last quarter of 2015<br/><br/>

                            NPAs weren't built up over the last 2 years as MSA would have us believe. The gigantic NPA build up is largely the result of crony capitalism due to which the banks and the RBI,presumably under instructions from the political class,handled the defaulters with political connections,with kid gloves. I don't see any difference between the main political parties in their approach to rich capitalists. The solution to the problem does not lie in re-capilisation, an euphemism for using the tax payers' money for bailing out the banks,but a set of tough actions, including tougher laws, if required. As a first step, wilful defaulters should be identified and their properties and assets attached within 6 months at the most.I hope Mr. Jaitley will make a sincere attempt to recover at least a fourth of the NPA outstandings before end March, 2017.

I m not pro modi or anti national.....but i find small important ground work happening....

                            I think MSA has some points there. But the issue is that this is not just a industry-bank nexus that causes these defaults. It is more a case of Industry-Bank-Politician nexus that causes defaults. <br/><br/>
It is also important at this stage to say that some of these defaults are due to the stressed economic conditions which are taking time to sort out. What is needed is to ensure that the banking system does not become a conduit to get large financial write-offs for badly run organisations.

                            Bhakts as usual saying congress at fault. Well chaddis u think no loans have been disbursed since 2014? Actually the govt is now clearing of big corps so they can take even more loans.<br/>
And lastly even if they have to write off loans then why not lower and middle range loans?...why only the ultra tich gets off for free while bank confiscates everything poor and middle class people own?

Not one word on how your colleagues in the UPA used their political clout to arm twist public sector banks into making un-viable loans to dubious promoters who have now disappeared with the money ..You now want the strengthening of the public sector why ? so that there are more public sector banks to be looted when you get power again ? clever !

                            These corporate have been created not in one day. All major mess of Bank is related to UPA tenure this know fact to all. I dont think why he is always crtical to Modi Govt. He should have analysed the data more purely and understood it clearly. Bank are being cheated and all officer with nexus of Political mess have done what ever they could. It is not the system, but a weak govt structure always provide the structure to loot the money of public Exchequre. During UPA Govt Mr Chidambram was made Finance Minister, it is Known to every one how his relative were involved in Indian Bank Scam, <br/>
How his wife is involved in Shradha West Bengal Scam. <br/>
I would request the opinion should have independent view not biased. I agree Modi Govt initiative too is not working very effectively. Blaming every thing some thing look like you are a another Rahul Gandhi not an intellectual.

                            Banks have standard agreements with all the borrowers whereas these agreements work well with the small and mid size borrowers.  The recent Companies Act amendment took over 2 decades in which more protection shown to the FD accounts and filing of returns.  Now the banks that lent/lending to the corporates do ask for more protections like - (a) not allowing the defaulting companies to declare dividends; (b) suspension of trading in SEs. (c) Quarterly voluntary advertisement stating HOW MUCH THEY DEFAULTED by the defaulting companies along with their financial results; The bank's representation in boards of companies which is there for a long time has not worked to the advantage of the banks.  Name and shame are not useful to banks and this will make the small and mid size borrowers feel bad.

What MSA is projecting here is that all the issues have been caused by the current Govt, which is grossly incorrect. Cong has ruled this country the longest and should own up to the problems they have created. The corrupt practices followed by the banks happened under their tenure if not at their instigation. I may not be a big fan of the current Govt but can surely appreciate the effort to actually recognise the problem rather than hiding it deep in the books. Lastly this may offend you but in this  argument you are looking more of a BHAKT than @Analystatix, he just made a case against MSA and not praised NMO

                            Most current bad debts are because of careless lending which happened long before the current government came into power. Recent RBI data on Divergent NPA trends show that as of September 2015 the 'medium' and 'large' industries are most responsible for the mess that the banks are in today. Then there are the megalomaniacs who throw lavish parties even after being labeled a 'wilful defaulter'! Images of shackles and rigorous imprisonment come to mind. But, this has always been the situation in India, people with money twist, bend and break laws so that they and only they can sleep well at night. That said, we have in Raghuram Rajan a highly intelligent and capable RBI governor who is working to get the banks clean up their balance sheets. I only wonder if he had not pushed for this at what point would the banks have declared this on their own?! Ha! wishful thinking. Let us be very clear, CLEAR, that these NPAs did not appear in the last 2 years but have been in the making for quite some time with the explicit knowledge of the previous government. So, Mr Aiyar please do not take the high road and use attractive language to fool the people. With regards to the Karnataka panchayat elections, please do not fool us again, it's the sheer incompetency of the local BJP to gain any confidence of the people and the infighting and bickering has led to their downfall, I hope that they learn lessons from this debacle. So, this is a case of people choosing the worse from the worst of the lot! But, Mr Siddu is in a league of his own, there are hour-long TV slots showing him eating local chicken biryani while the Namma Metro project is indefinitely delayed, roads are in a mess and the city literally stinks! You are a well-read, well-traveled and well-connected man, why don't you provide constructive feedback? This Budget Session of the Parliament I dare your party to not walk-out of the Parliament and let it function and allow passage of critical bills. Remember that you only have 45 seats in the current Lok Sabha, do not give the impression that you are blocking progress, who knows, the 'poor countrymen' might just say 10 is enough in 2019.
