                            We should by now realize that  people are using Islam's name for destructive purpose is to gain control &amp; power. Control over economics, women, thought process etc etc. which in turn makes them feel powerful.  It is nothing to do with religion.  By simple logic which religion will tell you go and kill innocent human beings including helpless children, women, in order to go to heaven.  All religions have landed on earth for the betterment of human beings not for the destruction of mankind. "If you don't follow my religion you will go to hell" by this logic you are reducing God to your level.  You are saying God is so egoistic or as cruel as human beings. Unfortunately it is so easy to use religion for your own selfish motives.  Being Muslim myself, I am sick and tired of telling my fellow Muslims and non Muslims this is anything but Islam. Thank you

                            I think first of all senior Muslim leaders should take some responsibility to review their scripts which allegedly incite violence and hate against other religions and advise their community how the scripts should be interpreted and what they are NOT SUPPOSED TO MEAN. Until this happens, some group somewhere will continue to interpret things to their own advantage and cause problems for the stability and peace of the world.

                            first of all, its good to see someone from the muslim community itself doing self assesment. Secondly, why the so called liberals, who pounce within seconds of any news about RSS, Silent on this one. Its high time that we rise above any religious, state , class or creed identity and support sanity.

                            This is one of the best article that I have across in this website. Perhaps, there are people who understand the root cause of issues and potential solution. Why can we not respect diversity and understand each other's religion, and its practices? <br/><br/>
We need to move together as we progress and move further into 21st century instead of going back into medieval times. One of the greatest idea to solve these problems of Earth will be to teach young ones of all the religion and help them understand the best of all of the religions. <br/><br/>
Can any religion be above humanity? Was religion created for us or we were created for religion? If it was NOT the latter (which I am sure is the case), how can we not treat each human with respect? <br/><br/>
May the world live in peace and the humanity transcend into a higher level of conscience!!

                            In the aftermath of the attacks in paris and cali, there is a sense of urgency among Indian Muslims to condemn these attacks and to distance Islam from terrorism. This was not seen on such a level when terrorist attacks were commonplace in India and people were dying by the hundreds. The main reason behind this being that these attacks have led to a considerable backlash against Muslims in western countries leading Muslims in India to come out in support of Muslims in these countries. It can be inferred that Indian Muslims feel more solidarity with Muslims in other countries than they feel with people of other religions in India.

                            This is not a war of or for any religion, but it is a war of economical supremacy for few that is going on from centuries to centuries. Religion is being used to exploit poor and innocent people to sacrifice them to achieve or maintain power for few. Thus, there is a need to build a world society that can ensure due share and security to all without any discrimination. This will ensure everyone a justice without any prejudice and if any differences that may arise can be tackled without indulging in a war or killing/sacrificing any innocent. Certainly, this is achievable with the help of UN and modern technology. Just, there is a need of determination only that we will not allow anybody to exploit or allowed anybody to be exploit.

                            Muslims are used to being treated with kid gloves and molly coddled to an extent where they take no responsibility for the actions of their fellow muslims. They point out its a small minority but even this minority amongst over a billion are many and they should reclaim their religion back from these maniacs. They have spent far too much time navel gazing instead of condemning this over emphasis on their religion being sancrosanct.

                            It is the families and societies at large who need to rise.Appreciating that all humans have similar emotions, flaws and needs is the first basic thing that needs to be understood.Religions and Spirituality developed over centuries so as to allow us to come to grasp with this world.However, its our false ego and greed which probably blinds us and leads us into paths otherwise forbidden and hate is one of those.All the religions try to explain the concept of god and we might never understand it fully...However we can make an attempt to be more caring and forgiving !!

                            Professor Yasmine,<br/>
Thank you for discussing some of the causes of violence being caused by Islamists and Jihadists. The history of Islam (and how it was spread) is a good place to start. The non-believers (infidels) are to be converted and if they do not submit, off with their head. Al Quran also advocates the same line of thought. So when Maulvis in Mosques teach that Allah has decreed that all people should be the followers of Mohammad and those who do not follow should be destroyed, their properties taken over and their children and women should be enslaved, what do you expect. Islam is going to be the cause of World War 3. Just recently Sultanate of Brunei decreed that there shall be Christmas in Brunei and it is against the law to celebrate Christmas. You can see what the reaction to that stupid dictate will be in other places. Would you blame if non-Muslim countries banned all activities that are followed by Muslims like EID and Rojas. You know well that to every action their is an equal and opposite reaction (Law of Physics), so the world is slowly going down the slope of this tit for tat situation leading to a self-annihilation.

                            First of let put my key point in advance that there is huge change is taking in all over the world where in religion undeclared colonization will get replaced by more free society in same way state colonization was wiped up in starting of last century where in first Turkish colony  got free then British and French colonies got free in second world war and later Soviet colonies wiped out in  late nineteen century. This Violence is almost or maximum in Muslims because wrong interpretation and then firm belief of wrong interpretation is among the Muslims. However it will touch all religions.  China as maximum population of non believers has significant advantage than others.  Governments should take few actions: 1; All Madarsa education must include modern science education along with rebellions.2:  All religious books taught in Madrasas must have approval from Islamic scholars under  Government scheme.3:  Muslim need to understand they are maximum up to level 90 adversely effected to wrong radical teachings.

                            The main point of contention is the affirmation of the primacy of Islam and condemnation of all others, the affirmation that every word/ law of a book written 2000 years back is still true and needs to be implemented verbatim. Other ancient faiths including Hinduism and Christianity also might have medieval practices written in their ancient books but the big difference is that there are no armed religious groups in these faiths or entire states who swear by these books verbatim. such passages which have no place in the 21st century are ignored - simple. until the Islamic societies start doing the same there will be no peace for these societies and the other world and also no peace amongst the Muslim societies themselves. Also the practice of differentiating themselves with medieval clothing and beards is only going to alienate themselves from the rest of the communities. They can continue to insist that it is their freedom of choice but then so does a madman have for his obnoxious behaviour - which does not endear him to the rest of the civilized society.

                            Yasmine yours is a view more adaptable in  ideal setuation. This tradition of bloodshed has a historical context. All three religions, jew, chraistion and islam are born in Arab alongwith conflict between faiths and followers of faith . Over aperiod of time this local conflict of faiths evolved into a global conflict and took whole world in it's grip. Westners do things systomatically with very structured manner to justify means for end . A war is preceded by orgnised media report and this preceds lobbeing for support for disproportionately excessive and indiscriminate violence in the  name of world order. In this unipolar world govern by U.S.( is worst than cold war age in terms of violence) is trying for a new lewel of illegitemate athority by implementing idea of new world order for establishing it's grip on world affairs(the same way in which select few  countries devised and used office of united nations systomatically for exploitation of rest of the world without being noticed sofar) to take undue advantage the same way which was objective of British Empire in the past. It is a subject of investigation whether the benefetiory of these tactices are same who ruled the world in the past. This hidden Empire is ruling the world by proxy  by applying massive destruction to the proportion which directly ruling British Empire  can  ever imagine of . Do not forget every vested interest has his own desired form of world order to push it's hidden agenda to justify means for ends.

                            In Hinduism, there is no word equivalent to "kafir (non-believer). In fact, there are verses in Bhagavatgita which asks us not to look down upon people based on their way of prayer. Krishna tells Arjuna that every human being approaches the ultimate based on his/her level of understanding and intelligence. So, all the approaches or ways of prayer are acceptable and leads the human being to Moksha.

I don't see any of them different. Only number of people in each religion is different but the ratio within them that don't respect the others are still same in every part of the world. It is just media propaganda that highlights some and not every others based on majority So stop scrutinizing others and look into yourself first.

Lakhs of Faithful Muslim in India offer namaz five times a day in thousands of Mosques and dargahs. This is the only religion in the world which sees the highest footfall everyday in their place of religion in the world. This prayer be it in India or elsewhere is pious and without threat to others. The faithful are neither Aggressive, Terrorist or some kind of warriors. Except pious, peaceful and brotherly.<br/><br/>
There have been attacks on Civilians and armed forces within India and world. Be it Punjab, Chattisgarh, Jarkhand, Orissa, Telangana, Assam and North East etc. Then there have been Likes of Veerappan  etc, killing civilians and armed forces around the country, All know their religion. Do we blame this religion for killings. There was this Srilankan problem, did the world blame the religion.<br/><br/>
The world over killing of civilians and armed forces have taken place, be it Ireland, Spain, Yugoslavia, Italy, Mexico, Chile, Cambodia, Lebanon, Uganda, Somalia etc etc Did the world denounce the religion of the perpetrators?<br/><br/><br/>
