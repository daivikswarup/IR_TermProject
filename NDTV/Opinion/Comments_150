                            Ellen, I respect and empathise with your recognition of the assimilation afforded to your husband by your mom and family. I wait for the day, when the reverse gesture materialises from the people of your husband's faith. Like, it's forbidden for me to have Halal, and also beef. Will my daughter's future (just in case) Muslim mom in law or anyone else in the family, provide ?!! I wonder

                            Will Saudi Arabia (the follower of peaceful religion) do any adjustment to accommodate other religious people? Big no.

                            Allen's husband (whose first name she has studiously refused to reveal- his last name is of course Ebrahimian) is presumably a Shiite. She is lucky to have fallen for and wed a Muslim who is not a Sunni-Salafist. For otherwise, she could have had the same experience as Karima, a. k. a. Katherine Russell, who wed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon Bomber, and suffered grievously for it.

                            This is all very well but the truth is that Muslims at large do not condemn the terrorist acts and more importantly come together to wipe out the murderous fundalamentalists. Hindus and Christians do exactly that and will not allow such things to grow in their communities.

They want to be treated special and when that doesnt happen, they cry of bias and harassment. Now will their kids become non-musleem or athiest ? A big No, they will be musleems. She is f00lishhh.

                            America is melting pot, where people come and assimilate ...aka melt. Yes everyone comes and bring in their idiosyncrasies but they become a part of mosaic of America. America do not adjust to other cultures, and why should it. If Mother is making all the adjustments, that's hardly assimilation. Bigger question is what is the Husband doing? Hopefully writer shed some light on that, not hide behind Islamophobia and Minority blanket shield.<br/><br/>
As for Donald Trump, he is crass and blunt. Political pundits know he hardly stand chance against Hillary. All said and done, he has hit a chord with massive base. He has only grown strength to strength. If you want to counter Donald Trump, the best way is to show how immigrants can come and become American, not highlight how immigrants can come and Mother has to bear the brunt of accommodating diversity. That's not an antidote, that's called helping Trump.

                            There are two ways community based on religion can move. All rise above and be accommodative to each other and trust each other or they dont trust each other and try to protect their own community. In past history there is always a case each religion is developed in a region and try to spread them to remain relevant. Stepping on other religion regions. Religion is followed by hope and fear. So combination of both black and white. Now given global situation of different religion is dominant in different regions, it is a problem of hope minorities and fear of majority. So in that case it requires make religion as regionless to everyone move to hope from fear or make them strictly regional based on settlement of majority.No other solutions work. All these secularism and assuming everyone treat you like other do is a wishful thinking, when humans are ruled by fear and greed

But still he says what is in the minds of Americans. None of the Americans interviewed objected to what he said. On the contrary, they agreed with him profusely. He is "concerned about you", American citizens, in the long run. Get it ?
