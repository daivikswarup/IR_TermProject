                            The only courageous and righteous voice in the present turmoil and insanity. <br/><br/>
The rabid goons and pseudo patriots do not know that almost all genocides are always carried out in the name of nationalism. <br/>
The modus operandi is same- spread rumours about sects/race, shame them and then systematically eliminate them in the guise of nationalism.<br/><br/>
The exact same thing has happened in Indonesia in 1965 and the so called killers after slaughtering 1 million people by first spreading rumours that communism will spoil Islam and that they are anti-nationals. The political party or army did not carry out the massacre but instead it only spread "pseudo nationalism" and false rumours. This led to brutal slaughtering by vigilantes (protected by army). The entire population of people with PKI party and relatives were exterminated.( Award winning documentary- The Act of Killing, read on massacres in Indonesia). <br/>
The same happened in Rwanda.<br/>
The same happened in Germany, Poland etc.<br/>
Gujarat riots (police did not act) and Babri masjid (police stood silent during the demolition), Lawyers Act at Patiala court (police stood silent).<br/>
If we dont learn and act then this will be the beginning of the end of country as we know it. It will become Saudi Arabia but instead of Wahhabis we will be having our own extreme right.This change happens very slowly till its too late.<br/>
There is a right to dissent for everyone-- for example Kashmir(our media has double standards on this) is witnessing terrible human rights violations (yes, what happened to Kashmiri  Pandits was also wrong), people in north east are tortured and killed, tribal people in many parts are dissenters.<br/>
The ideal way is to engage with them and sort out their problems and have empathy not hatred as long as the means are non violent. Remember one person's terrorist could be other patriot. All great personalities in freedom struggle for India were labelled terrorists or anti nationals.<br/>
Many of those are not as fortunate as us. <br/>
Patriotism comes when the nation gives all the rights to everyone including education, foe, healthcare, no discrimination etc.<br/>
Till the time this doesn't happen we have to engage in dialogue and as patriotic persons we should ensure that they also get all the rights as our people in Delhi and metro.

Indian journalism have become pathetic, you guys all sang Modi nama before election and chosing to take opposite way after election.

                            After so much writing and media from Ravishji, I think the people who comment doesn't get the point. If Kanhaiyaa or Umar has even said a single comment against India they should be punished severely in the court of law, there is no second opinion on that. But the issue is  Shouldn't we wait to confirm that they are 100% involved before labeling them as anti-national ? What if they weren't? What if these are doctored ? Even the chance may be 1%. With this minor chance we ought to protect the culprit before his public life is spoilt by being labeled as a pro-terrorist. Wouldn't we all be guilty of defaming and probably even getting him killed by some mob once he is acquitted from his charges? <br/><br/>
We are all patriotic but that does not give us the freedom to take the law in our hands. JNU incident is a shame to our nation and the culprits should be behind bars and a crack down should be done on all these anti national elements.  But no one is asking the public or the lawyers to take law into their hand. <br/><br/>
Once more I appeal to my fellow Indians, wake up before it's too late. May be your love for India has blind folded and the decisions you are taking emotionally  now will result in an India in future, that we wish we didn't create. <br/><br/>
Please.... Let's be wise on how we handle things, every action has two results, one affecting the present and the other shaping the future. If all Indians were our real brothers and sisters... What would we do ?

                            Ravishji. Social media is what is making the media more accountable and also labeling the media house as news reporting house or news manufacturing house. Also the mirch masala and spin that is put on the facts as they happened are challenged by common men who post a simple message or photo on social media. Also the monopoly of only media houses to air their opinions and views and by that I also mean their sidings with political parties is challenged by common men airing their voices and views. Newspersons have to either face consequences for badmouthing elements or praising elements because of the very fact that newspersons are not supposed to do any of that. Newspersons should only report news and not make this nonsense of debate as in most of the debates, the anchor and the participants are in no capacity to state facts and go about making their political agenda and stand vocal. News channels should only report news. It is the business of media which is coming to hurt media. Sama achar is how the nation wants news. We have other channels that come with "All incidents in this are fictional and not related to anyone dead or alive"  what news channels are trying to do. Organize a Swachh Media Abhiyan and throw the rot in your trade out on the road. Look how social media will respond. Also let us not forget social media is true feedback. Most on social media do not draw a salary for writing a post or tweet. They write what their minds tell them and it can also be contrary to how you perceive  an incident. So be tolerant and the dust will settle as Satyamev Jayate.

No, you won't give that permission[none would] to abuse you or threaten you to physically harm you. If you feel the threat is serious you would file a police complain. If goons in Patiala court who threaten journalist to 'break phone &amp; then bone'[no evidence] is such a big issue then how come ppl who call for 'breaking India'[with clear evidence] and those students leader 'being not anti-national' allows this chanting going on for few hours under his nose? He not even for once objected to it. We all know how student leaders act when they don't like something, even more when they are holding the union. Come out of that misplaced ideology.

There no fear for me our country , I am leading a safe and great life due to liberties provided by this country. Also followed rules and regulations. But freedom of speech doesn't give me right to attack very fabrics of our proud nation .Protest are necessary in democracy but instigating and misguiding youth of our society in name freedom of speech , I don't support .It is totally correct on behalf of Government to take action. So please for your political masters don't dilute a proud ideology of Nationalism as without this we will be like any failed nation . This sense of pride has kept a culturally and religiously diverse nation like India united.

                            Ravish ji ur show was very good. You rightly pointed out the wrong doings in journalism. I really liked it but when I see that episode in terms of political agenda I feel it was against only one party. To explain all the wrong doing by parties you were only targeting one party which I dont liked. Aap journalist hain sir, aapka kaam reporting hai. Sahi galat ka chunav janta ko karna hota. Pravkakta aap bht ache hain par sath me journalist b hain. If I review it in terms of journalist introspection it was good but if I introspect it in terms of politics bashing it was not good.

                            Congratulations on your show man. I am no sage nor are you or for the matter of fact anyone but kudos that you are trying to make home sapiens more Human. You have asked a valid question so let me reply with a question- if it's not for Promotion in job, paycheck,laurels and praises from the Prime time show and the Opinion then why you don't get out of your News room and Channels platform of communication and start this Andolan(for basic rights and liberty and stopping people to be the Messiah of others cause), you are the man with face and logic,right? I won't shy away to be a part of it. One thing which I wanted to say to all- it's not necessary to always be right or wrong,its not maths, life is chemistry (and maths and many more), people can be Neutral as well. I think what has happened in today's time is that every opinion and conduct of individuals make the scanning brain of others filter them into a Political class and ideology as if everyone owe themselves to Political Party for judgement. Being from legal fraternity with naive understanding of Rule of Judgement, a Judge must be impartial , neutral to any emotions without reason and prudence, upholds right to innocence until proven guilty  and equal opportunity to every party to the incident,these are sine qua non for being a Judge. So, if anyone wants to be Judge atleast qualify the minimal criteiras.  I believe that none of them(political parties) are competent enough to sustain and administer the will and aspiration of almost 13 Billion people and especially of the humongous youth. I don't own my identity to any party nor do many of us. Debate and you must but with basic human intuition and courage to understand the counter party. Tolerance in thought shall yield Tolerance in Act.

While you cannot control responses or groups on social media ... The journalist at NDTV are in your reach. Pointing the blame is one part of it ... BUT How are you going to get to this so called "Model Journalism" state? Maybe NDTV should "Lead with Example" ....?

But, in electronic media, all and sundry are providing their nonsensical opinions and trying to thrust it on viewer's mind.

                            I always like your and Abhigyan Prakashji Shows. I have always liked the way you guys raise issues which always roams around in the society whether it is pro-government or anti-government. <br/>
But in this JNU case, almost every show of both of you were more judgmental rather than reporting. Even various blogs written by you or Ms Barkha Duttji were also like a judgment passed by you in favour of anti-India slogans raised in JNU. <br/>
My only views on this is that whatever happens in JNU had left a bad taste and no one should encourage those anti-India slogans. Also, your TV channel should not vindicate those who are yet to be investigated and yet to face the law of Land. You do not have any right to become a judge and cannot pass any verdict which suits your convenience and/or whatever right/wrong you had reported. <br/>
Will you ever come back on TV and apologies if Hon`ble court punish them for sedition? <br/>
It only hurts me because I always watch your channel for good news and right reporting but for the last couple of days your reporting specially yours Mr Ravish has surprised me.

                            Speechless (not mindless :)) Just superb!!! Salute to Ravish Kumar and NDTV India. After watching the show, I felt little calm after all the anxiety over past few days over this anti-national and other incidents. It was really hard to find such a balanced, thought provoking, inner conscious awakening program, that too on news channels. Which have become shouting centers in the name of debates now-a-days. <br/>
To answer to your question, why we liked the show, it was not because of the fear, but may be because, it was raising the same questions that were constantly trying to come out from within us. The ones we were not able to answer, or sometimes would only like to see, listen and believe we only want to be.<br/>
The question raised for today's social media, people provoking and spreading things on social media, news and its debates, are really important. Once again THANK YOU for taking us to "To Total Darkness" as from now the only hope is a ray of light after this show.

If you think it should be encouraged, then just say so : don't hide in the darkness  and pretend to sound that you care for the society at large when all that you arê really  trying to do is peddle your biased leftist views on your readers.

                            I think there is a difference between a journalist and a critique. You can be a journalist and present the news as it is. Present the truth from several viewpoints - don't make judgements and don't present your views. Just assume that the public is intelligent enough to forms its views. On the other hand you can be a critique and bring creative criticism to the debate that can inform the public better than what they can see. The journalist has the burden to be unbiased and provide maximum exposure to an event. The critique can be biased, presenting his personal view. The reader is aware of the personal view factor. Both jobs are difficult and both have their place in media. Tell us what are you?

                            It is really true the Indian people are polarised like anything since the BJP came into power. The people following the ideologies of RSS seem to think of themselves as real "nationalists" and in the name of nationalism, they're not hesitating to break rules. The current top BJP leadership (who really have power) thinks by using strong arm tactics against the weak, they can make a strong India. But I feel they don't understand that India is too diverse and big in size and population. Their concept of a "hindu rastra" with a specific leaning towards the "vedic, bramhinic" culture is according to them should be the only culture India. For them muslims, dalits, tribals, pub-going people, valentine-observing people, leftists, atheists, etc. have no place in India. To have their way, they're using undemocratic ways. But can they be successful?<br/><br/>
I think NO. It's only a passing low-power storm. India has withstood many stronger and violent storms. Today there are many open-minded guys in India than in any previous periods in history. The open-minded people are there in almost all ages, from all religions, from all castes with diverse economical backgrounds. However I feel many of such people have still not come into the open. For example the lawyers who tried to stop the kinds of Vikram Chouhan and gangs are the ones who are of this kind. They're the real heros. People like Vikram Chouhans could bully the others because they knew they'll get support from the police. So people like Vikram Chouhans are really cowards. Cowards attack only when they know for sure that the other party is weaker. Cowards have never lasted the time. So it's only a passing low-power storm. The open-minded guys just need to stay strong in the ground.

These days people get upset about literary anything and thanks to our politicians and electronic media and social media to make sure it happens. What I have observed in your prime time show that you ask questions. You don't take things for granted as some people do inside media and it's listeners.

                            Ravishji,  the foundations of our democracy were being hacked at for a long time. We didn't notice or wilfully looked the other way. We have let our education system go to seed, building generations of citizens who are brought up on myths, are incapable of criticism, analysis and reasoning. Such people ultimately end up being the stormtroopers of the new order. Things have come to such a pass where you have to think multiple times before posting an innocent rejoinder on your classmate's Facebook page or post a correction on an obviously fake meme. You are apprehensive that you will be buried in abuse or bludgeoned into submission by organised online gangs with - and that is the most unkindest cut - your friend egging them on.<br/><br/>
We didn't lose our freedom in a day. We let it slip gradually without even realising it. We let it slip by undermining democratic institutions, by not voting, by voting for the wrong guys. But then we should have known better. This is how Fascism comes home. <br/>
I admire your courage in sticking your neck out but I think you are fighting a losing battle. As a nation we have primed ourselves to be taken over by hooligans. Irrespective of which party you vote for, this is how India is going to be in the foreseeable future.

                            We badly needed this debate for taking the media back on track as the fourth estate. Thanks Ravish. We want more of your tribe to think like you. Balanced, truthful and fearless.

                            In the court premesis, The first journalist got beaten up only when he started shouting slogan "Vemula zidabad".  Where was the need for him to do so.  He was a journalist and should have stuck to his job of covering the event.  Instead he got busy in creating the event.  Fomenting the trouble.  Does the freedom of speech mean you can shout anything anywhere.  If its decorum of court, then should it not be maintained by journalists too.  <br/><br/>
This was recorded footage where Raveesh himself is seen asking the journalist.<br/><br/>
The journalist wanted to get the trouble escalated and he provided the trigger.. and succeeded.  First you instigate the violence and then say we were beaten up.  But that is grand design of congress.. they can't give progress, all they want to give hard time those who genuinely want to take country forward.  <br/><br/>
sad affairs in our country where intellectuals are using their sharp minds to bring chaos at every nook and corner of the country.

                            The Number 1 thugs in this country are parents that make their kids believe that grown-ups should not and cannot be questioned. Until we raise our kids in an atmosphere where they can freely and calmly question and debate everything, we will be a third world country and fourth grade society.

                            Just superb!!! Salute to Ravish Kumar and NDTV India. After watching the show, I felt little calm after all the anxiety over past few days over this anti-national and other incidents. It was really hard to find such a balanced, thought provoking, inner conscious awakening program, that too on news channels. Which have become shouting centers in the name of debates now-a-days. <br/>
To answer to your question, why we liked the show, it was not because of the fear, but may be because, it was raising the same questions that were constantly trying to come out from within us. The ones we were not able to answer, or sometimes would only like to see, listen and believe we only want to be.<br/>
The question raised for today's social media, people provoking and spreading things on social media, news and its debates, are really important. Once again THANK YOU for taking us to "To Total Darkness" as from now the only hope is a ray of light after this show.

They have pitted our own brothers and sisters against each other which is very sad. Our only hope is that people will take cognisance of the truth and vote with wisdom in the days to not allowing communal forces to rule our great nation. Will never ever vote for BJP.

                            Congress claims they have fought for Independence but was this a outcome of Independence where corruption was manifolds communal fights,still education levels are low, no sanitization, barring some sectors everywhere corruption is not congress responsible for it and about intolerance can CPI or CPM say there is tolerance in Russia or China can ordinary congress worker criticise Gandhi,Nehru family and now they criticise NDA before critising other look at self then criticise others

                            Ravish Ji,<br/><br/>
I watched the black out episode and other clips where you are discussing with Madhu Trehan on NewsLaundry.<br/>
There you mentioned about a famous NewsAnchor and blasted him. That is fine. Further, your points suggested that media house should do some introspection and ensure that they are the voice of people.<br/>
I will be direct and precise here. If this is the issue then why didn't you speak against your own team, when one of the famous lady anchors(you know the name) colluded  with Politicians to ensure the benefit of a business. The evidences are clear to people and not sure whether they are clear to courts. Also, do you promise to take the issue in your next prime time discussion and clean your house before shout at others.<br/>
Where were you and your team-mates when farmers were getting committing suicide in Vidarbha and Andhra. Still it has not stopped. An eminent rural journalist Mr. Sainath rightly pointed that all the media houses were covering a stupid fashion week while people were dying few miles away from there.<br/>
Also, just to remind you media house planned the massacre of Mumbai Police when Taj attack happened;just to give a live coverage.<br/>
When you want to lecture, you may lecture, but have u done proper introspection or promise to take corrective against some of the filth which your media house has created.Talk to your Aatma and you will get the answer.

As Chetan , pls do not make Modi hate blind you .. I too was against 2002 riots , until I heard Kashmir story , one thing is there Muslim did not have to come out of Guj unlike pandit ..<br/><br/>
You accuse others of being selective, but you are no different. If you are going to connect Godhra to the Kashmiri Pundit massacre, then you also need to talk about the the way dalits have been treated for centuries by Hindus, especially 'upper class' Hindus. Unknowingly or knowingly, are being selective. Also what happened in Godhra cannot be accepted as a reply to what happened to the Pundits or vice versa. When you start connecting different issues, like Godhra and Kashmiri Pundits, you run the risk of missing out other similar issues. Either you treat a mistreatment issue in isolation or you connect all such mistreatments. What has happened and what is happening to the dalits is much worse than what any other community had or is going through right now. Why aren't you talking about that?<br/><br/>
Should all muslims in India be held accountable for what happened in Kashmir? Then all Hindus will be held accountable for what happened in Godhra and Dalits.<br/>
You can't have a different yardstick for measuring the same issue.<br/><br/>
How far back in time are you willing to go to talk about mistreatment. The adivasis of this country will have an issue with all our ancestors. Are we ready to tackle that issue? Are we even ready to talk about it? <br/><br/>
There is a creation of an artificial persecution complex and paranoia fueled by social media, the media,and some innate insecurities. We are being pushed to hate each other; we are being pushed to hate people with different opinions (including dissent). Are these our opinions or simply opinions we are blindly accepting from different political outfits?<br/><br/>
We must introspect.
