                            The jingoistic hectoring that the BJP in general and Modi in particular carried out in the run up to 2014 lections must have hit Modi, the BJP and the RSS like a thunder clap. One hopes lessons have dawned that the foreign affairs cannot be handled the way elections are campaigned for. Political  parties can become hyper with campaigning but the ruling party must carry out foreign affairs with quiet dignity and great gravitas and not in an exuberant event management style. Although chemistry between leaders is important , it cannot subsume diplomacy for diplomacy is essentially a matter between two states and not two individuals. Mani Iyer as well as the Congress have maintained for decades that Pakistan must be engaged not through useless jingoism but through meaningful and uninterrupted and uninterruptible dialogue. Iyer's article while lacking in sharpness of language is full of fine articulation of the art of diplomacy and subtle message about the failure of the government on that score thus far

It is true that 'tamashas' and optics are important but they cannot substitute for a well thought out and executed strategy. <br/><br/>
It seems that Modi and his government are trying various options, blowing hot, blowing cold. <br/><br/>
It is also a fact that there has been a significant (probably sensible) climb-down from the earlier chest-thumping and fire-breathing.<br/><br/>
However, the present government still seems far from a coherent working strategy.

Fact is also, that Modi's NSA bungled badly, and Bhakts are hiding their faces and hanging their heads in Shame. Mani is absolutely right.

                            Irrespective of MSA's comment in Pakistan, he normally is in favor of (continuation of) talk with Pakistan, which broadly is sensible. But he seems to be in fix this time. He looks confused how to criticize this time? Talk is (likely to be) continued, and somewhat similarities between 2008 situation. Drawing parallel is premature but easier. After that he is unable to convince himself about what to criticize? Time will tell whether MSA's presumed assumption (Pak's investigation going nowhere) comes true or not. But I feel sorry for MSA, as he don't have anything concrete this time, even if aerial !!

NDTV and its group should immediately consider not to allow such a person who does not respect our National interest, its respect its platform to spread his personal venom. I do not know how a person like him was even in the diplomatic administration. He is irrelevant even to his political masters. I can only hope that NDTV and its group would stop allowing him to use its platform and do some National Service.

It is not possible for India to have just one strategy to deal with Pakistan. Pakistan is a trouble some country for India and for rest of world. UPA did not have any strategy. Modi is at least trying a few out of box things.

                            Usually Mani goes with anti Modi tom-tom but in this case his attacks has some merits. Modi's predicament is weather to pursue peace or continue tough posturing against Pakistan. He understands the reality and is trying to change the colors in sync with global realities but that has already costed him his image. Atleast now they should not fall trap to media theatrics but silently pursue the peace process. If NDA shows resilience and is able to stand the domestic pressure, I am sure we can have the process continued. Let the diplomacy do its job and let the military and intelligence counter the attacks through alternate strategy.

                            Dear Mr Mani Shankar. How can u predict about things which are not in your hand ? Pakistan &amp; India both should learn that the talks should NEVER be stopped. Talks between both countries should continuously take place without referring any &amp; all incidents of terror etc. etc. ONLY thing should be seen by both countries, that while talking - step-by-step, they both should agree and create relationship in areas (likes Diwali Celebrations, EID Celebrations) where both sides are EQUALLY benefitted. India should not give benefit to Pakistan only one-way &amp; vis-a-vis. BUT talking should be done at least every alternate month - if not every month. THEN by meeting several years such a way, there will be SOME WAY OUT. Cricket Matches or Hockey Matches do not bring both countries together. In fact, rivalry is created by MEDIA etc. by using very filthy words. Cricket &amp; Hockey or any Game will be healthy between two countries ONLY when they keep talking at least 10 years from now.
