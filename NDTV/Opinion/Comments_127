                            Yes. She is American. If we publish her blog, we will be treated on par with western media. That's the mentality of most of the North Indian English media houses. Why do we need to read about gun control in India where one of the biggest city in India is under water and needs lot of coverage to fast track relief work?

                            Within USA no gun control. Innocent civilians killed. Outside USA no gun control of US soldiers. Millions of innocent civilians in various countries killed. Poetic justice?

                            This article at this time is an effort to divert attention from the Jihadist terrorism growing in the USA.<br/>
Feels sorry for the emotional, non-rational thinking liberal people who are being mis-used by the middle east funded media.

                            What could you do about it, when the lawmakers and gun lobby doesn't  want any control whatsoever. The idea was meant to be in use for defence but when it is commercialized so much, it becomes a business-loss proposition for gun industry and hence the lobbying. Untill the lawmaker do anything about it, it won't  stop.

                            No offense but maybe you should blame your father and not the gun. People always trying to shift responsibility.

                            @Sammy:  So what do you want? all channels should switch 24/7 to cover Chennai's plight ? let me remind you that much of this plight was self induced--by people clogging drain with the garbage they so reckessly throw on the streets, by government letting IT companies and slum build/live on lake beds and along river beds.  There is plenty of coverage, just do a google search and you will see it is being covered.  But don't get so obsessed with Chennai that you forget there is a bigger world out there. And while it did not involve guns, AIADM workers did use violence to stop aid workers from Bangalore distributing food.  So the problem to some degree is relevant to India also. By acting like only you matter you showed your small mind.
