                            With AADHAR linked payment system the current can do much better than the UPA Govt on implementation of MNREGA. Hope better sense prevails in them and they don't miss out on this low hanging but very tasty fruit. MNREGA is a well thought out and awesome program which no one, but Modi, could criticize till now! Increase the implementation of MNREGA and get rural votes.. its as simple as that

                            Hello Manibhai,<br/><br/>
Sooo long no see. Where was you? How is your tea stall doing?<br/><br/>
By the way, if you are so intelligent, why don't you implemented the law with addressing those shortcomings? Or you were so busy in 2G, Coal?<br/><br/>
You have ruled for around 60 years. So they are just 2 years. Let them work. If we don't like their rule, will throw them out. So just chill and don't criticize everything. Have some constructive views sometimes at least.

He can not bang her, he can not bang Sonia, he can not bang any Congressmen, he can not bang Amar Singh, if he does he will get a slap from him, and he can not bang Yashwant Sinha, if he does Yashwant will pull his pyjama. Where else Mani will show his helplessness other than Shri Modi. Bechara Mani  is having problem everywhere. Let us feel sorry for him and ignore him.

                            Only a person like you who have no ground reality will believe.  MANREGA is a programme to maintain and build Congress. The booties are divided between village head and worker in ratio from 50:50 or less. All work is mechanised and shown manual on paper. There is no work but pay, creating a army of lazy workforce.

                            MNREGA was always a bad concept. There was never any planning as to how it was to be implemented and for what purpose. It was glorified state charity that was an open sesame to corruption, like all the UPA schemes. Congressmen made money in the name of the poor. Like many such schemes, it is difficult to wind it up once people became aware that it was the easy road to make money without working. It will take a long time and more waste of good money before it is finally closed. Can Aiyer highlight some of the concrete achievements of this scheme that he defends so stoutly, instead of talking vaguely about its noble objectives?

                            If Modi on becoming PM had dismissed the programme as a monument to the failure of 60 years of Congress governance, he did the correct thing. What were you doing? You write all these crap when you forget to take the pill. It seems you are infected with Zika virus and your head has shrunk.

Maybe set up a tea stall at the congress convention as you had advised someone.. After all this comment handed the BJP a good election plank and showed India, the congress as an elitist party.<br/>

                            Every time I read comments of bhakts on articles by Mani I'm amazed at the complete ignorance of these morons. Their steadfast refusal to get into the merits of anything that requires thought, analysis or educated reasoning just shows the kind of louts the BJP attracts. If this is the level of intellect of mainstream BJP supporters who are ready to sell their country for a political party I see very little hope for the future. A wasted generation of bombastic, ill-read and hubris filled sheep bred by one political party. Shame.
