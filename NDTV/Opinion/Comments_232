                            I am a supporter of AAP and Arvind Kejriwal .But sad to say  that you are taking wrong stand and supporting Anti National and Anti social element. You want to play minority vote bank .But you are losing votes of patriotic Indians . You may have sympathy for Anti BJP people and you are entitled for that, but they were shouting anti India slogan not anti BJP slogan. Nobody can tolerate such anti national. I think BJP government should take strict and swift action . I am s AAP supporter but completely against you on this issue. I am not a BJP troll you can check that I have donated more than 10 times . So for sack of AAP and country do not play in the hands of Anti National people

                            I think left ideology is full of hatred towards religion, rich people, system and basically anything which works as a system. They are basically anarchist,crybaby and always play the victim card. They have caused more violence than any other ideology. It is a failure and should be reformed to the core.

Don't you have shame. We don't have problems with JNU as an institution but this is also fact that there are some Anti National students there and they need to be weeded out. Don't mix the issues. Police went there to arrest students who they find figure on video clipping broadcast on major TV channels. where is the question of arms and ammunition ?

                            It's amazing to see race of articles to support this anti national students. Just for political gains, this political writers forgot that entire India is watching  and will decide whether "raising anti india slogans" is acceptable or "arresting a anti social activist"

                            This issue has caught many so called leaders with their "pants down"as to where their view point stands when it comes to nations cause ,yesterday it was yetchury ,raja,rawool,today its mani shankar and ashu with their blogs .All talking about rss/Bjp/abvp,when not even a single slogan was anti-BJP or rss , it was against india,even the so called secular poor students like lenin and khalid even came forward with justification for their behavior in many tv shows . may be ashu has a veiw point abt "judicial killing of afjal guru"

                            "It was this culture which gave confidence to a boy whose mother earns Rs. 3000 per month to contest elections and become the JNUSU president", but no mother can be proud that her son is involving/supporting anti-national movements. Yes, people have their own opinion between capital punishment and lifetime imprisonment, but it is not a right way to oppose capital punishment by supporting terrorists like Yakoob Menon, Afzal Guru and saying "Jitne Afzal maroge, har ghar se afzal niklega". This way one not only opposes capital punishment, but also supports terrorism, which India will never ever tolerate.

                            Speechless!! I had never thought that so many people across the board would stand with anti national elements. I have seen people are writing, this is freedom of speech we are with. Amazing!! freedom also has some limits. NO ONE stopped them from demonstrating but look at them whey they are demonstrating, IN SOLIDARITY with 'Afzal Guru'. On top of they are saying anti India slogans. Had it been any other country, these type of anti national activities would have been handled with might.

                            Mr Ashutosh, <br/><br/>
you may need to relook your timeline! If you joined JNU when Gorbachev came to power in the USSR, Mao would certainly have not been alive. He died nearly a decade prior to that.<br/><br/>
China's economic reforms also started a few years after he died.

                            The claim "the most intellectually-superior institute in India" is factually wrong. This maybe true from his personal point of view, need not be that of all.This is like " Frog in the Well" view of the world.There are many more Institutes in other states(Karnataka,Maharashtra,WB,TN,Kerala,Punjab,Odisha etc.etc) of India which are superior to JNU. Please shed the superiority complex.The point here is different.JNU students are indeed lucky to enjoy highly subsidised facilities(Room Rent only Rs11/- pm, Fee of only Rs219/- per year etc.). After enjoying all these out of hard working INDIAN Tax Payers' sweat and blood, indulging in Anti-India, Pro-Pakistan Slogans is highly condemnable. The nation should stand together, setting aside Political Ideologies in condemning these acts and support the Government of the day to take strictest actions. This should be a lesson to all those "Progressive Intellectuals", who enjoy all GOVT of INDIA's benefits, accommodations and subsides but create discord and disharmony in colleges and society. Also, many "Intellects" remain students for 20 to 25 years at a stretch, like they join at age of 20 years and remain on rolls as students and enjoy subsidised room, mess, infrastructure even when they are 45 years of age. Poor Tax Payers have to foot the bill by way of subsidises. What is their contribution to India, World after enjoying the subsidies and unquestioned freedom? How many Nobel Laureautes? A thorough review should be undertaken and all subsides to be stopped. JNU should take it up as a challenge, prove its mettle,start generating revenue on its own and prove the claim "the most intellectually-superior institute in India" by being self-sufficient in all respects and standing on its feet. Hardworking Indian Tax Payers generate revenue  to be squandered by "Political" institutes like JNU,Delhi.
