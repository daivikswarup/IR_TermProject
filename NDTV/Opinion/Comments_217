                            Oh please..spare us the nonsense..these refurbished phones do burn larger holes than newer more affordable android phones...It's just that the marketing gurus have been enlightened on the business advantages of selling out their old ware. <br/>
We are very grateful for your concern, but can we sell you some of our old cars..they can be refitted to meet western norms and will spare the environment for those gas guzzling monsters that are produced out there..<br/>
also we could give you all our politicians for free ..that would certainly save the environment, cost less and save India

                            I am amazed at the greed of Apple. Has it ever raised its eyes out of the profit books and looked at the environmental damage it has been doing since inception of the Iphone? Where is the leap of technology that can justify a new model of Iphone every six months? The US consumer is lapping up the new phones and discarding the old ones at a huge cost of carbon footprint and at a terrifying pace. We all love to use our phones but not at such high rate of disposal, even if we can afford to. Now, Apple wants to dump this e-waste into India and make money out of less fortunate souls in India's hinterland. Let it show philanthropy by giving them away for free so that they will not purchase a new phone, thus reducing carbon footprint.

                            OH, the hearts of you MNC's are really bleeding for the poor in India.  Stop treating India like a third world country where you can dump your used goods. India is third world no more in IT. Stop this facade of doing public good for the Indian poor when you are worried only about your bottom line (profit). India is making its own affordable phones which the poor man can buy new.

                            Very good new android phone comes at Rs. 5k which can do all stuff that an iPhone can do. We don't want your waste that would be sold at least double the price. <br/>
What a clever choice of words - 'Roughly 80 percent of India's population lacks access to the Internet. Apple, purveyor of some of the world's most expensive smartphones, has a solution'<br/><br/>
How is lack of internet access to do with buying your costly used e-waste???

                            Dear Facebook and Apple - I have great respect for your products but I don't like it when you mix philanthropy with business. If you are really interested in philanthropy (or environment etc.) then establish a foundation or a trust, it's simple. Learn something from Bill and Melinda Gates - your own country-mates.

Please don't look for a new dumpyard for your electronic waste in India. If you are seriously concerned about Indians getting onto internet - we are absolutely gradeful to you. The way you can bring them to India is - import old phones, make people use and at the end of 2 years please take them all back. You might still benefit out of so many consumer's data (which is what you would need badly as you move forward)

                            If Apple was selling these phones between Rs. 500 &amp; Rs. 1000 I would appreciate the spirit else it just plain profiteering from the branding. So spare us the evangelism and beat it. Those who want APPLE and can afford it are anyway buying it. Those who can't are going for the high end Androids for half the price. Leaving the ones looking for budget phones. And they're not brand conscious!

                            What if with this plan to import refurbished phones India could put a smart phone into the hands of every autoroskshaw driver, every mason, carpenter, every small time entrepreneur. It would change the way these guys run their business. If govts can provide cheap Wifi services cheap phones will then provide that last mile connectivity. Its worth thinking how these phones could help jumpstart Startup India as they facilitate internet inclusiveness who cant afford it right now. What would it mean for that remote school that cant as yet afford access to the internet based learning tools that are just mushrooming. We definitely need the upgrade to the latest OS for these phones to work with the latest apps. We also need the local repair shop to have the capacity to provide cheap repair services if we dont want cheap devices to be consigned to the e-waste bin so soon. I see a possible win win situation for all here

                            this guy just want to wash off his hands of the ewaste. Apple can say that they are buying old phones selling them India and claim that they are reducing Carbon footprint and care for earth. IN real terms they want to make sure that their wastage is dumped in India and make money from it as well. Good marketing gimmick.

                            Mr Adam. Your analysis is wrong on so many levels.. nothing else but corporate spiel is expected from Bloomberg<br/><br/>
"Roughly 80 percent of India's population lacks access to the Internet. Apple, purveyor of some of the world's most expensive smartphones, has a solution." How is supplying Iphones going to solve this? are you going to setup internet access in remote regions in India?<br/><br/>
Iphones are never cheap.. Apple are just going to charge a lot for these phones which is still going to be out of reach of the consumer whom they say are targeting. And to be fair the smart phone market in India is booming and you get some really slick brand new phones within 5-6k which is going to be cheaper than what apple are going to sell their used phones for.

                            Indians are very sensitive to buy 'second hand' stuff no matter what is the incentive.                                     Even a person who has not used any is offered such a phone free of cost would feel offended.  Will realise this very soon after importing first lot.
