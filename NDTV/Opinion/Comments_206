                            It is simply because Modi led govt has created so much chaos in economy. Nation is going through worst crisis in history and all credit goes to Modi but we are forced to believe that he is messiah. Its just not this job, people would queue up for any job and would travel any state for the job. People get to know through social media because again media have to print pictures of Modi taking selfie and hugging international leaders.

                            Bakwas, what skill sets are there in India. 20% of people don't come to office on time, 15% are non performers who can't code, 40% don't have communication skills, The entire Industry is running with the 20% good guys who put the hard work and have reasonable skills. The VPN of IT companies are always chasing billability, CRS and new proposals. There is no metrics, no productivity, high baggage, high attitude, too many holidays/leaves. And still Indians think they are the smartest.....Sudarshan Jao

                            Indian IT story started with "body shopping" and continues to be that way. To participate in this gold rush, we have more thousands of so called money-making "Engineering Colleges" churning out sub-standard unemployable graduates.... <br/><br/>
It's no surprise then that despite 30+ years of being the leader of outsourced IT work, not a single company has turned out a single global software product.

                            An IIT professor (I mean a full professor) makes about Rs 1L per month. In the IT industry, there is a potential to make a lot more money (with  even less educational qualifications). Plus, you have a shining glass and steel tower, food courts, well-maintained IT parks, and most importantly: The opportunity to be sent abroad, etc. The lure of the last item is still very strong and can't be underestimated!!!

                            People rush to Bengaluroo only because, even under today's circumstances, the city has the best quality of living in India. The locals are not all either parochial or fanatic and , infact, the most accommodative  ,unlike in most other places. If such an interview had been called in cities other than Bengalorro or Mysuru, the response may have been less than 50%.

                            Leave Bangalore alone!! Enough of the bubbling growth. Go away all u non bangaloreans. Also please take your jobs with you. There is a huge misconception that Bangalore is what it is today because of all the outsiders.  The foundation to this great city was laid by Bangaloreans. To tell the truth all these IT companies themselves don't know why they are creating so many jobs.

                            8 : 1 is not at all surprising. the video looks like more than 8000. looks like just hcl did not expect this number and  the event was poorly managed/organized.

                            It's because mindless automation that results in unemployment. It will intensify further, going forward.  Due to which, crime rates will increase. It's like taking the message "Place for food" in a jiffy to several thousands (and is considered as a big achievement)...and there is no food to all! Live on information. If this message is published, it will be there down under somewhere and go unnoticed...!

                            WalkIns to me is mostly a farce, how many candidates do really get a offer letter ? There is no way I'll accept that HCL cannot find graduates passing from top tier colleges to fill in 1200.
