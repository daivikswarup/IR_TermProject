                            @Shashank: What about the freedom of expression of Salman Rushdie and Taslima Nasreen who are political and media orphans here in India. Rajiv Gandhi ordered the ban on Satanic Verses even before any Islamic countries had banned it. Taslima Nasreen gets harassed by Islamists now and then. But the media never has thrown a fit over their lack of freedom of expression. They similarly never felt outrage when Sanal Edamaruku was harassed and driven out of India by a few Indian Bishops. They only feel any outrage when a M.F.Hussain is hounded by hardline Hindutvawadis. They become absolutely apoplectic over a M.M.Kalburgi only because the perpetrators were Hindu apologists.<br/><br/>
Rahul Gandhi, the mentally vacuous scion of The Dynasty, who was the de facto Prime Ministerial candidate during the 2014 LS elections, was never questioned or grilled by the media on how he could claim Women's rights as one of his chief poll planks. His father had wrought a legislation that initially robbed an old female divorcee, Shah Bano, of her rightful alimony and eventually robbed all Indian Muslim women of their civil rights. As long as the Uniform Civil Rights issue's shadow hangs over Rahul, he should ideally never be allowed to even state that he supports women's rights. Or at least, why wasn't he ever questioned by the media if he intended to repeal the legislation?<br/>
If Modi hadn't delivered results in terms of development in Gujarat, and if he had promised Development for India, do you think the apes would have spared him during the elections? How then did Rahul get a clean chit on his chief poll promise?<br/>
Of course, the media was busy going over Modi's past marital issues in 2014 and his supposed excesses in 2002 - he's just a dirty communal Hindoo. And Rahul is pristine because he is a minorityist. That's why they never questioned him, nor will they ever confront him on this topic.

However, studying in an university that is funded almost entirely by the tax payers (given the students at JNU pay Rs. 500 a year as tuition fees), I'd expect the students to be a little thankful, to say the least, to the tax payers (read: people of the country and hence the country itself).

Agreed, but, you cleverly didn't expanded what level of dissent is ok? Is dissent against one's own nation is also ok for you?<br/><br/>

                            It's quite worrying how this whole episode has quickly been spun into an 'anti-dissent' debate. About dissent being labelled 'anti-national'. About freedom of speech being labelled 'anti-national'. All of course, by the BJP and therefore, by extension, the great unwashed un-intellectual.<br/><br/>
I might be limited in what I know and understand thanks to some heavy leg-spin. But what I understand is that a call for 'bharat ki barbadi', is anti-national, not dissent. A call for 'bharat ke tukde-tukde kar denge' is anti-national, not dissent. A call for 'Afzal Gurus in every home', is anti-national, not dissent.<br/><br/>
According to you, the government should "take a few 'allegedly' anti-national slogans in stride". Doesn't that strike even you, as a little casual? The Congress and Abhishek Singhvi went red in the face about Javier Moro's Red Sari and Sonia Gandhi's privacy. Why couldn't you 'take that in stride'? So malice about Sonia Gandhi, serious issue; malice about India, not so serious. Doesn't that sound too selective?<br/><br/>
Have done by SFI stint as well, Mr. Tharoor. And in a reasonably 'free' University of Kerala. But let me tell you this, if I had raised slogans like these on my campuses, neither the SFI nor the faculties, would have tolerated it. Maybe they were not intellectual enough. Or, maybe they knew where 'freedom of speech' ended and where the next guy's nose began.

                            Everyone is entitled to their opinion including Tharoor. However when a law stands in the statute books it is incumbent upon the government to enforce it. Amend it by all means, but until then you have to abide by it. If raising slogans against India and for Afzal Guru, not to speak of independence for Kashmir, is not anti-national, it is better left to Tharoor to define that term. The right to freedom of expression, as well as the right to dissent, have certain limitations. One of those limitations is defined by the sedition law. So all Indians, including JNU students and Tharoor, have to observe those limits.

                            You were expected to be a bit better than in reasoning that the others from the 'Secularism &amp; Intellectual' brigade. But reading through the article, you seem to come out with the same set of arguments and same rhetoric with much of substance. Lately, through debates on news channels, there is an deliberate attempt to show the govt 'anti-dalit' or 'anti-student' which really is an attempt to disrupt peace in the country by the Left and Congress and nothing else. <br/>
I am amused by the way some so called 'intellect' students from JNU come to debates and talk as if the the whole lot of intelligent and upright students are only found in JNU and students from other universities are dumb. JNU is just another university like many other universities spread across the country and which are way too good in the quality of education as well as the level of political debates. A small group of JNU students have started thinking themselves to be torch bearers of 'free speech'.  Its this very leftist group which is at forefront of opposing any other idea than what they feel is correct.<br/>
The basic problem in the 'intolerance' debate that is going on since last 6-8 months is Modi's  popularity. The opposition is desperately trying to create a atmosphere of friction and discontent. In this case they have gone a bit too far by trying to protect students giving anti-india slogans. I believe the govt will come out stronger through this and work towards development instead of falling in oppositions trap to derail development.<br/>
BTW, I have seen many 'intellects' including Mr. Tharoor making comparison with 'Hitler' and 'Nazizm'. But they forget that the very fact that they are able to talk this proves that they are not correct. Otherwise they would already have been put in gas chambers forget debating and blogging.<br/>
So chill and let the elected govt function. The more you do all these tactics the more people like me get reassured that we have elected the right people.

                            The issue is not just about the dissent voices of some handful of misguided students who are studying almost free of cost at Indian Tax payers expense but is about questioning the very judicial judgement of the honourable supreme court and the President of India. How can an intellectual of calibre of Mr. Tharoor do not see the long term disastrous consequences on the minds of our younger generations of glorification of terrorists and terrorism?

                            Mr. Tharoor<br/>
You are accepting that the students who were chanting anti-national slogans were misguided and did not know what they were doing. currently, there is an immense danger of ISIS invasion/expansion looming over India and by turning a blind eye to any anti-national activity may be translated as promoting the act. Congress and its leaders like you have done a great job of playing a caste based and divisive politics at the interest of Indian security. <br/>
ISIS, LeT and other terrorist organizations were not not so potent decades ago when your JNU colleagues shared anti-national sentiments with you. It must have dawned upon them that it was not proper and they must have reformed their ways. Why it pains you to see them as true nationalists. <br/>
It is high time that all the Indian unite to fight terrorism and students like Umar should be  punished for their brazen act of insulting India and its loyal citizens.  <br/>
I am a proud Indian and have seen enough to ascertain how much freedom can be practiced in other countries. <br/>
Jai Hind!

                            The facts here are being twisted to spread confusion and gloss over the main point of argument. I don't think the government is stifling dissent. It is only objecting to the slogans demanding for breakup of the country, glorifying the actions of a person who was associated with the attack on the Parliament of our democratic country which also upholds various freedoms given to the citizens. The person, Afzal Guru, was given all the options to defend his actions and when he could not convince the Supreme Court and the Hon'ble President of India, only then was he hanged. Since this hanging has constitutional sanctity, calling it a murder by the Government is wrong. <br/><br/>
Second point is that if curtailing freedom of speech spanks of emergency like conditions, I would say that talking about breaking and destroying the country is emergency like situation.<br/><br/>
Here, I would like to point out that JNU is a crucible for bureaucrats of the country on account of the number of students who go on to clear the Civil Services Exam and occupy high posts, are involved in policy and decision making, etc. If the anti national feeling is allowed to assimilate in the students, I feel that such persons who go on to occupy senior posts in the Union and State Governments cannot work for the unity of the country.<br/><br/>
So the sooner such feelings are nipped in the bud, the better it will be for the country. One other option is that anybody who has been associated with JNU in any way should be, as an ample precaution, not be allowed to join Government service at any level for you don't know to what extent that person's character has been moulded by these anti-India elements.

Tow people can have diametrically opposite views on a subject but remain good friends. That what I believe in. But Mr Sashi Tharoor what is playing out is a on JNU campus is rooted in what happened over the years since independence. We have famously got into the business of banning and not tolerating difference of opinion. <br/><br/>
Lets for Instant take that the police and Government kept quite and ignore what happened on the JNU camps of celebrating Azsal Guru the same Congress or some other party will create a scene saying such things are happening in the Country's Capital. <br/><br/>
Free Speech does not screaming and shouting and celebrating a convict. It means that a mature debate can be had in a forum to discuss and say whether the Death sentence handout to Aszal Guru was right or wrong and may be even writing article saying that there has been an error in judgement. <br/><br/>
Ancient India had this free speech and that is depicted in the scriptures and writing.

You are setting a wrong president in asking to release. DO NOT object to rule of law. There are thousands of cases police file on a day to day basis in India and ultimately the court decide which is to be taken up or not. You are aware of the success rate of the police which is abysmally low. So let court decide, you never know the material and evidence police has. If police has erred and court decides to group charges so be it.

If you call "Pakistan zindabad, Bharat mata ke tukde tukde kar dengey, azadi chinke lengey" as mere dissent from innocent students, then you must also recommend Polygraph test of these students to ascertain their innocence.

This is the cornerstone of Freedom and independence. In the zeal to prove Modi wrong, you and your party have towed a very dangerous line and on a really slippery slope now.

                            Dr. Tharoor if the ideology of these students were the majority [of students] view then leftists would have been in power in many states &amp; centre. More over there is a pattern in these institutes. Since 'the great Nurul Hassan' the left ideology has taken control of the institutes like JNU, IHRC etc and as a whole the intellectual space of India.Since then in JNU the faculties has created an ecosystem which helps teachers/students of the left ideology and they get absorbed within the ecosystem and thus the ideology keep its hold on the institute. Same can be said about Kanhaiya, with MA from a dubious 'Nalanda open univ' with no track record of brilliance gets a chance to do PhD in JNU because of his &amp; his family's ideological track record. Btw, what is the rank of JNU as a univ in India &amp; world? By chest thumping 'its a world class univ' does not make it one.

Freedom of speech and stuff works when you go against the ruling party or when you don't agree with them and are critical of them.  But shouting slogans against your own country is not dissent.. It's more than that.. <br/>
The student leaders too agree that there were slogans raised against India.. If they dint do it then they need to help the police in tracking down the culprits. There is no need for this much hype around the issue.

                            What Kanhiya did was not just dissent, but staged a war against Indian supremacy. He shouted slogans against Indian martyrs, against Indian Judicial system and against Indian unity. It is nothing but sedition. He should be tried for that.

                            We know that the biggest threat facing the world today is terrorism. It just so happens, that most of this terrorism emanates from pakistan. Therefore, slogans, such as 'Pakistan Zindabad', coupled with "India Murdabad', 'Bharat Ki Barbadi Tak Jung Rahegi, Jung Rahegi' and calls for the destruction, dismemberment and downfall of India, especially when these slogans are directed at university students by people in positions of authority, should set the alarm bells ringing throughout India, which has frequently been the target of terrorism, especially from pakistan.  Instead of condemning activities which in the prevailing atmosphere in the world today, certainly appear to have terrorist overtones and cannot be ruled out as mere 'dissent', and isolating them as incidents which must be a subject of further investigation to see if there is a link to other universities across the nation as well, the Indian media has chosen to mix two completely different issues, and not only completely marginalise the main issue, which is incitement to hatred and a call to war against India, but also thrown a very dangerous red herring amongst the entire student community!! The seeds of terrorism begin with mullahs in pakistan raising similar rousing slogans, aimed at people of university going age, leading to attacks such as the ones in Mumbai and on the Indian Parliament, which have resulted in the loss of many innocent lives.

                            All Indians.. Pl note that all politicians are patriotic but they always speak the ideology of party to which they belong. I am sure if Mr. Throor would have shifted to BJP, he would be speaking the same language and would be reacting on such statements by blogs/TV interviews/Debates etc. now it is left to all political parties to think what is required to make India and Indian people great in the eyes of the world . Praying God that he gives Sadbuddhi to all.

                            Few facts which are generally misrepresented by Media for some reason :<br/>
1. No one is charged yet including Kanhaiya; only FIRs have been booked. No one told he is a terrorist. In fact, police had even told they will not contest his bail plea.<br/>
2. No one responsible is telling that JNU is terrorist hub...media might be quoting chotu leader<br/>
3. Kanhaiya is arrested because he was the president and leading the event. Also his family came out and told that he is feeling safe and police protected him. So others cannot justify reason of not having security to surrender to police.<br/>
4. Delhi police went inside JNU on the request of Vice Chancellor and not barged in (though they can and should have).<br/>
5. For people who are disputing slogan shouting, we know that posters were put for a cultural festival to protest on Afzal Guru's death anniversary for his "judicial killing". This is despite permission for the program had been withdrawn. In such an event one can expect Anti-India slogans. Initially organizers said ABVP guys did that to corner them. Do they have any proof for that ??<br/>
6. Media is wrong in equating Bathla House scuffle with Anti-India slogan shouting in JNU. Hand on their heart, do they really believe that both are similar ?? There is major difference in gravity of crime for an AAM AADMI.<br/>
7. Why can't media and so called intellectuals allow police to do their job ?? It is quite obvious that they need to question certain leaders including Kanhaiya. So what is wrong if they are arrested....wait until they frame charges at least if at all. Also have faith in judiciary.

                            "the Indian state is not so feeble that a few irresponsible slogans shouted by misguided students can destroy it" - what u r saying Mr Tharur.

You people lecturing all these nonsense, because, you are enjoying lot of securities at our money.

                            Next he will say, don't arrest me. Facilitating wife's death/murder and silently allowing  wife to die is not a crime. Building a defence platform. How this man( how ever distant or remote the suspicion about his involvement in wife's death may be) is being invited to various festivals, social occasions and is being given platform on news channels to enhance his otherwise suspicious and tarnished( rightly) image.What exactly is the difference between him and petty criminals. His ability to write and speak in eloquent english.That is impressing all these media intellectuals to give him this space. In reality How cruelly intellectual  these intellectuals are? Otherwise,When the case is on how can anyone, especially an ex central minister say that a suspect in lawful custody must be released , when next hearing date has already been decided by the court.
