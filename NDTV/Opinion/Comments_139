                            Why government has to pass ordinances? Because the Congress party is not interested to work and discuss the bills to pass them in the interest of the nation. If your party would not wash out entire session after session; then you can work with government to discuss, debate and amend the bills before passing. Therefore your stats on high number of ordinance is actually your fault!

And there you have the root cause. How's exactly is "boycotting parliament" going to add to the richness of deliberations of a democracy? If people with a valid point can't speak, if people can't have their genuine questions answered,then clearly, Parliamentary Democracy isn't going to work.

                            These amendments were long overdue. These only reflect the march of law in various decisions of Supreme Court and are substantially the Law Commission's recommendations. More importantly, the power of Indian Courts to pass interim orders in International Commercial Arbitration has only been restored (Bhatia Intl case). When one does not allow parliament to function and boycotts parliament, would he be justified in faulting the Ordinance? The amendments and the Ordinance have reinstated the faith of the stakeholders in arbitration as an effective dispute resolution mechanism.

                            Also, the pending cases are not due to erecting more courts but due lack of empowerment the laws create due to its cumbersome nature. Make it simple to give judgement in a day itself. Eg: For murder, why on earth we want separate the motive of muder, planned operations, attacked nature etc... etc.. Make it simple - by real or by mistake. That's it. And award verdict on the day itself. SEVERELY. Otherwise n number of courts or judges won't make anything better but will another curse in our already reeling system.

Your views are very valid, but the same would have been considered while debating the parliament, rather than just complaining to the public thru news channels. You being an educated MP, should teach discipline, decency and Tolerance to your party who is just disruption the parliament due to personal reasons of your party leaders. I as a citizen is also having equal frustration for not being able to know, what kind of policies government is adopting.

                            Mr. Tharoor, you are a reasonable man and so will probably agree that every lawmaker in the country has his/her own perception on every subject.  You have a perception and probably can put it across in the parliament, if you permit it to function.  If you think that there is a scope for improving it, you must permit the bill to go ahead unobstructed and then take up amendments, based on the experiences gained over a period of time.  Secondly, you were in power for most part of the period after independence.  This problem of us not being able to attract foreign investment has been there right from the beginning, what were you doing then.  It appears, your only objective is to put Gandhi/Nehru family stamp on everything that happens in the country.

Independence of the judiciary has no meaning with so many pending cases. Why should the judiciary be independent? To refuse accountability, do very little work and not be accountable? The Indian Judicial System is a total disgrace. If courts do not dispense justice, we may as well dispense with courts themselves.

                            Dear Shashi Sir, I still read your column because it is good and makes sense. Some times you take the party line in your columns and those are tough to read. I agree all the recommendations in this column makes sense. We need SME's as arbitrators along with people with knowledge of law to arbitrate. It would have been great to have you in the ruling party than in the opposition which only obstructs. I was reading a statement from Anand Sharma that BJP should have approached congress for backroom deals on other bills. But that is belittling the parliament. Discussions were supposed to happen in Parliament and points debated. When you use the institution for other purpose like settling the scores then there is a problem.<br/>
Request you to write an article about how to make parliament work which takes good points from opposition too.

                            There is not much of a difference in the approach of UPA and BJP. When UPA introduced important bills, BJP ensured the same are not passed. Bills on FDI in Insurance, Land reform, GST etc. are testimony to the same. Now with BJP in power, the bills are more or less the same with a few changes introduced here and there, UPA is ensuring the same are not discussed and passed. Given the situation, there is nothing wrong in going through Ordinance route except that we risk ending up with inapt and inefficient governance. Something noteworthy here is, the number of ordinances brought in by Modi is exactly the same as Indira Gandhi which is one ordinance in 28 days of its governance. The best record is that of Manmohan Singh - 1 ordinance in 60 days in spite of the fact that the disruption time of both houses during UPA was 61% (LS) and 66% (RS). Considering Indira Gandhi's record on Ordinance and BJP's record on disruption, neither have any moral standing to point fingers but both have responsibility to govern efficiently &amp; honestly and oppose sensibly.

                            Sorry Dr Tharoor....while you've gone to great lengths to point out what hasn't been incorporated in this bill you have failed to observe the critical issues that the bill does address....the sector which desperately needed this bill to clear a massive logjam (and which has a huge multiplier effect on the economy) is construction and infrastructure, and this bill does address the issues of timely arbitration completion, arbitrator appointment and arbitration costs, all of which were essential. It's frankly very difficult to take such blatantly biased oped's seriously and that's sad because you could have used your indisputably high intellect and sophisticated world view in support of the country at such a critical juncture

                            Dear Sir<br/>
I am glad that you are making a difference by saying your point and engaging in law making.<br/>
This raises hope and pray there are a few more of you, Baijayant Panda come out to engage in discussions and law making rather than shattering the popular mandate.

                            " The points Tharoor makes do not make the Bill "deeply flawed" but only "needing improvement"

                            The last bill passed by congress Govt before 2014 elections (Andhra Pradesh Re Organisation bill) was a assassination of democracy in this country, Where were you Mr ? What were you doing that time?

                            Glad you accepted that the proper discussion on the bill couldn't happen because congress is boycotting the proceedings. And see, you and many others wanted to speak but couldn't because of Congress's dirty game of politics.<br/><br/>
I keep wondering why an intellectual like you (and I didn't like you until I heard your famous debate in UK) is doing in Congress? Don't join BJP or any other party but why to threat your own identity by identifying yourself with Rahul and Sonia like leaders. Think big man, you have been this close to be a UN Chief and for you, these petty politics doesn't make any sense. Wake up and show some courage. I like you but I really don't like you bowing in front of Rahul and Sonia. And I am sure there are million Indians like me who like many congress leaders but are pissed off seeing them impotent due to the pseudo charm of Gandhis.

                            We love quantity over quality. Pendency is due to adjournments granted to litigant party. Regulate adjournment and issue will be resolved to a great extend.
