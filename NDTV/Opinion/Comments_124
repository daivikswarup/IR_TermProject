                            THANK you NDTV for posting a much needed debate instead of continuously hyping up the intolerance issue.<br/>
Go out on the street on different corners of the country and ask people what can improve their day today lives and hype those developmental issues till they are resolved. But I guess hyping a communal issue keeps your TRP up so why would you bother?

                            If you are uneducated and unemployed there are only two options available to you - either get a driver's licence or the easier option, become a watchman. To be a driver you need ID proofs and a few rupees to bribe the licence issuing authority. The army of agents and license issuing authorities is an invincible nexus. So there, most folks obtain a licence without learning how to drive. Truckers especially learn to drive on the job. I drive from Mumbai to Pune on a regular basis and there is no cure for loaded heavy trucks incorrigibly driving on the right side of the road. Also, in cities most illiterate drivers(including educated ones) think the right of way belongs to them since they are in a car vis-a-vis a pedestrian - a punishable offence in even countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka. Their honking tantamount to bullying and forces errors from cyclists and other drivers. What we must realise is a vehicle in the hand of an idiot is akin to a gun in the hand of a monkey. God knows when we will wake up to this...

                            Not really sure why we rake up this issue all the time. The simple fact that one needs to understand is that we Indians just don't value our life. Period. We don't care a damn about others lives either. We are a nation that's so insensitive that we don't want to give way to an ambulance and get irritated by their constant sirens. On our highways, people drive on the wrong side, people cut the divider where they want, people create speed humps where they want, and above all, there is absolutely no policing whatsoever. No matter how strong the law is, when there is no implementation, nothing will change on ground.<br/>
Btw, I am not being insensitive here but saying this due to the pain of losing two people in road accident caused by a drunk truck driver in broad daylight. Yet, he is still out in the open.

                            There are other factors apart from the GSR standards. Poor roads, poor in every sense. Poorly designed, pot holed, narrow, no lanes, poorly lit, non existent signals and traffic lights. Poor road discipline of drivers and absence of traffic police. Lack of punishment for traffic offences. Corruption in RTOs and traffic police. Poor quality of vehicles and safety equipment. Most importantly, human life is cheap. So we do not learn lessons from mistakes leading to accidents and repeat them.

                            Road safety is the most neglected area in our country. Politicians, police and people, in general, have total disregard for traffic rules, road conditions, and condition of the vehicles. Unless, awareness is increased - the situation is not going to change. We will keep on creating accidents and blaming destiny for the same.

                            It is just amazing to see such less comments on such a major issue which results in more than 2 lakhs deaths each year including seniors, women, men, children and infants. <br/>
But it just mind blowing to see no political band wagons are interested in this debate. They can for stall the parliament for 1 communal death because Communal issue can make them win or lose elections. But really, who cares about the development?

                            Our highway designers does not know or do not have any training on road safety that has to be incorporated in during the design stage itself. I feel very sad to say this but it is the naked reality. You can see for yourself the design of the green circle  in vellore bypass(Tamil Nadu) connecting Katpadi, Vellore town, Sathuvachary and Bangalore. You can see the very pathetic situation of the pedestrian wading through the traffic and you can see the accident statistic at this location and I am pretty sure it may the highest accident prone zone in Tamil Nadu or may in India. Also all the service roads between Bangalore and Chennai highway are very unsafe. Can the highway authorities and state government official consider to make a safe design sooner for the pedestrian and motorist.

                            Thanks NDTV to highlight an important issue of Road Safety. <br/>
Just a small correction and highlight about Trauma registries. For the past 6-7 years we have been instrumental in bringing about a change in attitude of policy makers towards their attitude for a National Trauma registry. A great amount of research has gone and is ongoing to develop minimal datasets for our country to develop a national Trauma registry, it's important to know our country's limitations in data collection and therefore not merely copy the western registries in their original format as they are very extnsive. <br/><br/>
Efforts are also going on to research and develop electronic data management platforms to support this big problem. The GoI, MoHFW has this on a priority list of things to be accomplished within the UN decade of action on road safety 2011-2020. <br/><br/>
The United States of America has been able to develop its national trauma database over 4 decades or more, still it does not cover all 52 states. With health care being a state subject the union Govt. can only lay guidelines and encourage states to be a part of (registry) data collection process. The other barriers for effective Trauma data collection are that it is extremely manpower intensive as the timeliness of care needs to be captured real time 24x7, only then effectivity and quality of Trauma care can be compared between various systems in India. <br/>
We at AIIMS are seriously trying to implement all that, through collaborative efforts under AITSC (Australia India Trauma Systems Collaboration and TITCO - Towards improving Trauma care outcomes in India) research projects. <br/>
Please rectify so that the efforts of some wonderful researchers all over the country don't go waste. <br/>
Thanks, <br/>

                            How some of us wish that G K Pillai would stop pontificating on all kinds of matters! This person made the premature and totally irresponsible announcement that Telangana would be created soon from his position as the Home Secretary. Thus he closed off all options to the then government. A very long period of silence from him is the least he can show.

                            When the authorities take road safety seriously only then can it be improved. Road safety is not about awareness, it is about being afraid of stiff fines and losing your car or your license. In a city like Delhi the police turn off traffic lights to encourage speeding on a stretch of empty road to catch people for speeding so that they can earn revenue is deplorable if not illegal. Road safety can be legislated and controlled with excessive fine, like in countries like Switzerland. If there are no laws for proper driving, no tests or driver training and licenses being issued with bribes and no checks, there is going to be no improvement.

                            Pedestrians are not allowed to cross roads even on pedestrian's crossings. To avoid accidents on Indian roads all the motorized traffic to stop at regular intervals by clock.ie 0900, 0903, 0906..

                            I live in the UK and visit the Punjab Twice a year and drive there. The main reason for bad driving and accidents is a lack of compulsory driving test for all drivers. That includes car, van, truck, bus drivers including motorcyclist's. In the uk all drivers and riders go through driver training leading to a test. That way everyone knows the rules and drive to the same standard. In India no political party ever talks about sauch a policy, let alone implementing it. State and national governments lack the vision and will power. So every one drives badly leading to accidents! Sesa Lehal. UK.
