                            Very Good One Sir!!! I hope PM Modi sees this Article!!! It is time Government removes Subsidy in all Government Universities!! It is not only JNU Delhi even Osmania University has the same issue!! Many people who are in the wrong side of 30's live in universities for subsidised food and subsidised accomadation. Problem is politicians in India need to change!! They are using students in Govt Colleges as political pawns. These students don't have bright future!! It is time government removes subsidies for IITs and IIMs too.....they finally serve US and other western countries!! Why should tax payers money be used to subsidise for students who will not serve our country!! It is time they are told to take bank loans!!! Govt is not a Nanny!!

                            Leftists complain about right wing intolerance. What about the intolerance they show towards right wing? The glimpse of their intolerance can be seen big time in Kerala and Bengal. When you point fingers at others, look at yourself first.

                            Now the BJP is really losing it. One demonstration where some foolish slogans were raised and BJP wants to shut down a whole university!!!<br/><br/>
Why is the central govt so insecure? The country isnt. We know JNU has always been known for leftist policies. They will say all sorts of things when they are young students and will outgrow this when they grow a little older. <br/><br/>
BJP's inability to handle this type of dissent is alarming. No real harm will be caused by the foolish statements made by the protesters. Very real harm will be caused to the country be this type of aggressive hyper-nationalism propagated by the Sangh.

Now it is clear that majority intellectuals of JNU (max 100)and media love to defend anti india slogans/pro pakistan strategies.<br/><br/>
I dont know why channel like NDTV got trapped in this pro pakistan strategy.<br/><br/>
Now 50 cameras are shooting 25 people shouting anti india slogans....<br/><br/>

Especially this para "Frustrations emanating from JNU students, once respected for their intellectual caliber, have led them to reside in an unwanted Jurassic Park, housing creatures the world forgot or would at least like to forget. What we are witnessing in Delhi for the last few days is a futile rebellion of the subsidy-deprived. They have been led to believe that only if their tin-pot agitation succeeds in dislodging Modi, everything will be back to being "normal": Subsidies would return, they can stay on in hostels eating highly-subsidised food till they are old enough to be grandparents, and the Left's patronage network will eventually get them a job, at least by the time they become pensioners."

                            JNU has lost relevance in present time. Civil services aspirant go there, enroll them in one course after other, making civil service preparation like two 5-year plan. While doing MA, MPhil and Phd, they participate in activity like recent one. If they are not able to get in civil services, despite having best facilities at their disposal, they become human right activist. As a taxpayer we demand better value of our money. Right now JNU has become holiday resort of anti national under garb of left ideology. Administrator should take note of it.

                            I must say you represent and serve Modi Regime very well. In fact, you deserve to be appreciated for spelling out their agenda clearly. JNU, AMU and  JMI are thorns and eyesores for RSS and it's foot soldiers. So you have to malign, ridicule, disrupt  and damage them  one by one to finally destroy them. Obviously, you can't paint them with one brush. Hence,  you use a communist/leftist tag as a stigma for JNU and reserve terrorist AND anti national tag for JMI and AMU. <br/>
If you could temporarily become a rationalist for few minutes, you will realize  that being communist  or muslim is not a threat to the nation but  forcing the saffron agenda by hook or by crook is. Dissent is not anti national but stifling of dissent is. How about for a change you compare and contrast roles of communists and Muslims  with that of RSS and it's foot soldiers during Independence movement. While the whole nation was up against British imperialism, RSS was still keeping them amused.<br/>
Do remember this nation is resilient and can withstand the  Saffron Brigade's onslaught. You just can't kill the reason and human courage.

                            Re-defining non-colonial Sedition. <br/>
Sedition is: <br/>
- When a country has 340 million people below poverty line which is more than the population in 1947, it is Sedition.<br/>
- When every year, 16,000 farmers are forced to commit suicide because of failure of government policy, it is sedition.<br/>
- When a country has 87 million people rendered illiterate, 37% of total world illiterate population, highest in the world, that is sedition.<br/>
- When a country has 40 million of its labor unemployed and the government failed to create employment opportunities, that is sedition. <br/>
- When every year, a country has 2.1 million children dying of malnourishment and the government is reducing budgetary allocation to midday meals, it is sedition. <br/>
- When a country has 25000 rapes every year, and the government couldn't prevent them is sedition. <br/>
- When a country has 626 million people openly defecating with no sanitation facilities, making India the worlds largest open air toilet, it is sedition. <br/>
- When even today, more than 150 million people walk at least 2 KMs in search of drinking water, it is sedition.<br/>
- When politicians spend Rs.30000 crores in conducting national elections and states spend 100,000 crores in state elections, despite such abject poverty and lie about their election spending on an oath on the constitution, it is sedition.<br/>
- When getting justice takes up to 20 years and still 30% of vacancies exist in Judiciary, it is sedition. <br/>
- When politicians, bureaucrats and the super rich send their children to foreign shores that costs India Rs. 200,000 crores p.a because they dont want to trust India when it comes to their own children's future while espousing the cause of nation building every day, it is sedition.<br/>
And this data is for India that includes Gujarat too. Gujarat is no different and walks hand in hand with rest of India in each of those parameters. Sedition is not some idiots shouting slogans in some corner of this country. Sedition is not some misguided youth waving black flags on a republic day or green flags on another day. Sedition is not some youth having stupid debates on issues they don't understand but profess to understand.<br/>
Sedition is when a government turns a blind eye to violence against humanity, with an ulterior motive to break people resistance and force them to rise in rebellion. Sedition is forcing people to take law into their own hands because government's failed. Sedition is testing the patience of its people.<br/>
It is no foreign power that will disintegrate our great country. If ever it happens, it will be the apathy of the government, the inaction of the administration to the real problems at the grass root level. It will not be for want of a temple or sloganeering by idiots. Our enemies are not outside but inside. And most of them sit in the Indian Parliament.<br/>

The amount spent on one JNU student is not even equal to the price of Modiji's suit. Why do you not also talk about subsidies which government doles out to MNCs by denying tribals their bare minimum rights? You cannot brush off JNU's contribution for one single incident. Do you even know how many government functionaries your own government has appointed those who are from JNU? How many faculty members are inducted in your planning and policy making decision bodies?

How is this incident different? Shouting Anti India slogans are more serious than a murder. Why this partisan journalism?

If there are problems solve them.. do not just run away from it.

                            JNU , Osmania , Jadavpur and ... how many universities are  you going to shut better dialogue  and engage them listen to them and there will be a positive result you people have taken it too far BJP Politicians are the real culprits and Some media houses who have for last few days repeated these videos again and again have helped the separatists propagate their message from one institution to other. A few channels have lost the sense they are divisive and provocative.

                            We all miss the point. Afzal guru is regarded as a martyr for Few Kashmiri separatists and PDP  with whom BJP joined hands with. It has nothing to do with branding Kahaniya kumar or the whole JNU as anti National.<br/><br/>
There are few Kashmiris who raised anit national slogans. There are Kashmiri students in every university and if you ask them, most of them tend towards a separatist attitude. This is clearly visible during cricket matches. Few students debate with them and few leave them alone as its sensitive matter. Now the same thing happened in JNU. Do you recommend shutting down all universities in the country because of this section of students. <br/><br/>
Media and govt has diverted the matter and we all  blindly believe them .

                            Chandan Mitra should first shut down his "Pioneer" for failing to keep up the trend, instead of suggesting to shut down JNU. Whether JNU is a Left bastion or not, it surely breeds a liberal environment which he cannot swallow. No doubt, students shouting anti national slogan should be punished and individual liberty cannot be allowed to be misused.

                            Brilliant minds suggest that instead of curing the disease kill the patient. The divisive politics of Modi and Hinduvta politics has created an atmosphere of division all over. Lots of universities have been discontent, just as FTII, Hydrabad, JNU and now Jadavpur- so how many univerisites will you close and in what pretext. These are Indian Students and any overdoing must be investigated before slapping serious charges like sedition. Only the hardcore anti-national elements could be suitably punished but only after exhausting less harsh punishment. They are Indians. PDP has time again hosted meetings where Pak flags where installed yet this same BJP found it convenient to form Government with it, -. if Modi can visit his Paki friends for chai, the same guys who are killing our soldiers everyday, sending terrorists to Pathankot yet can be considered nationalistic, young Indians except the hardcore promoters can not be treated as seditious. Conselling, probation can make them realize their mistake because every Indian has India at it's heart even when their views might be different.

                            In a democracy dissent is the highest form of patriotism. Choking off dissent is the prime trait of a fascist regime even if, it painstakingly hides that hate-mongering, lumpen face of disgrace, behind Chandan's meticulous promulgation of some impotent nationalism based on lies and factual artifacts.<br/><br/>
This Arnab Goswami flavored statistical inference involving Chandan's "dollops of state subsidy" logic should face following facts first.<br/><br/>
- Tax exemptions and incentives to corporations had had a revenue impact of Rs. 62,398.6 crore to the exchequer in 2014-15, 8 per cent higher than the previous fiscal, according to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley<br/><br/>
-29 state-owned banks wrote off Rs 1.14 lakh crore of bad debts between 2013 and 2015.<br/><br/>
-India is already among the lower spenders on education. In 2012, according to the World Bank, India spent 3.9% of its GDP on education. Even Mozambique and Morocco spent 6.2 per cent each. Both the U.S. and the U.K. spend more than 5 per cent.<br/><br/>
A university should promote rational thinking, scientific temperament and a culture of dissent. These values are the lifeblood of any democracy and nation building. So do not copy from hypocritical tax-grievers like Mr. Mohandas Pai who is the Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services Pvt Ltd, a private provider of higher education services in India as well as abroad. While leading a private education enterprise your compatriot Mr. Pai may have got some tax exemptions too. So grow up Chandan and try inventing newer forms of sycophancy your new age fascism is calling for it.
