                            The basic problem is that all the Sanghi types did not lift a finger for the nation's independence. <br/><br/>
While Nehru and Gandhi and others spent years in jail away from family and friends, these people basically helped the British implement their divide and rule policy. So they are basically on par with Jinnah who helped the British implement the Muslim side of the divide and rule policy. Not surprisingly, neither the Sangh parivar types nor Jinnah spent a day in jail. <br/><br/>
And now their successors are busy trying to rewrite history to make them into the heroes they were not.

His Kalapani or life imprisonment in Andaman and Nikobar islands, his contribution to Marathi language by giving more than 1000 words, yes thankfully we have Marathi words for very common English words used in Hindi, and we pride we can talk in Marathi more cleanly without using English words, inventing an appropriate and accurate and concise Marathi word for an equivalent English word and that too 1000 of them needs a Sahitya academy award. But his struggle for independence also mandates a Bharat Ratna. Yes he did not like the Leftees and Atheists  and Nehru Gandhi pariwar, that I agree.  Vande Mataram.

                            While in jail, Savarkar wrote the work describing Hindutva, openly espousing Hindu nationalism. In 1921, under restrictions after signing a plea for clemency, he was released on the condition that he renounce revolutionary activities. Travelling widely, Savarkar became a forceful orator and writer, advocating Hindu political and social unity. Serving as the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar endorsed the ideal of India as a Hindu Rashtra and opposed the Quit India struggle in 1942, calling it a "Quit India but keep your army" movement. He became a fierce critic of the Indian National Congress and its acceptance of India's partition. He was one of those accused in the assassination of Indian leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and was acquitted in the trial.<br/>
unlike other patriots like Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Ashfaqullah, who refused to ask the British Raj for mercy even at the cost of their lives, Savarkar, the father of the BJP's Hindutva ideology, had actually sought clemency while lodged in Andamans' Cellular Jail. <br/>
.<br/>
 Savarkar's letter asking for forgiveness dated November 14, 1913 is reprinted in a book, Penal Settlement In Andamans, published by the Gazetteers Unit of Union ministry of education. <br/>
.<br/>
 Savarkar described himself as a ''prodigal son'' longing to return to the ''parental doors of the government''. While referring to his earlier letter of clemency in 1911, Savarkar wrote, ''...if the government in their manifold beneficence and mercy release me, I for one cannot but be the staunchest advocate of constitutional progress and loyalty to the English government which is the foremost condition of that progress. As long as we are in jails, there cannot be real happiness and joy in hundreds and thousands of homes of His Majesty's subjects in India, for blood is thicker than water; but if we are released, the people will raise a shout of joy and gratitude to the government, who knows how to forgive and correct, more than how to chastise and avenge.'' .<br/>
 Savarkar went on to add, ''Moreover, my conversion to the constitutional line would bring back all those misled young men in India and abroad who were once looking up to me as their guide. I am ready to serve the government in any capacity they like, for as my conversion is conscientious so I hope my future conduct would be. By keeping me in jail, nothing can be got in comparison to what would be otherwise. The Mighty alone can afford to be merciful and, therefore, where else can the prodigal son return but to the parental doors of the government.''

                            A very strong argument on why the airport needs to be named after one of India's freedom fight hero Bhagat Singh. I hope more public support rises for this just cause. As for the current establishment and its vain activities, there is no use saying anything. Only people need to give a fitting reply.

                               Stop manufacturing pseudo Secular's / Sickulars and please save our country from so called liberals,intellectuals &amp; artist litter lobby.They were never a part of our national mainstream politics.If so these liberals would have returned their awards during 1984 anti sikh riots and so many other violent incidence happened during Congress and UPA regime.What made them to wake up now? This shows the hippocracy. That shows they were no where near the national sociopolitical mainstream. <br/>

                            People who were born in free India and if something is named after them then do you mean to say that because the person born in free India was not part of freedom struggle so nothing can be named after them<br/>
or they do not have freedom to put forward the names of other ? Something seems to be drastically wrong with you people in CPI(M), Congress and media.

These brahmins have been changing history and distorting it for their benefits for a long time now they have got the chance to exploit it.  they infact changed the technical books and made it so hard that only brahmins and very much elite students of the backward and downtrodden can pass these exams. they increased the gap between backward andbrahmins such there would be many dropouts from school as the syllabus gets hard on the least privileged class of society and the jobs go only brahmins as the reservation was for backward and not brahmin

                            and who is your / congress hero.... Rahul Gandhi ????? Common Brindaji... have some self respect and show you are educated and literate. The article talks what BJP is doing... where were you when Congress was doing all these things? What happened to your thoughts, your education at that time? <br/><br/>
The school text books are so skewed towards the Gandhi - nehru parivar....ask a school going kid.. what is so great about 2nd October and you will hear it is Mahatma Gandhi's birthday...you will have to prod the kid by asking what else is so great about 2nd October...the kid would be wondering...whats so great...and when you tell the kid something about Lal Bahadur Shastri and the kid will say...aahh..yes<br/><br/>
That's the kind of ignorance the school text books show towards people who do not belong to Gandhi-Nehru parivar. That's what the congress has been teaching for last 68 years. Its time, someone stood up and wiped the slate clean. We just don't want Gandhi-Nehru names reflecting anywhere..does not matter who they get replaced with...but no more gandhi-nehru..we have had enough of them.

                            The CPM is fast becoming a fading party. Naming a street or Airport after some one is a non issue. There are more pressing glaring issues like the Reservations Raj and the direction of deliverance of Justice. Even after 67 years , meritocracy does not prevail. Tainted politicians walk free, and probably will die free. Corruption breaches  3000-5000 crore range and will soon be more dynamic mode. Pot bellied force reigns the Police and Defense cadres at all levels. Education had become and Trust and capitation business. The whole country is filthy beyond belief. There are burning issues.

These people with leftist leaning also teach us history where mural Emperor Aurangzeb, Babar and Tipu build the temple however reality is they all destroy and looted numerous temple and also forcible build the mosque on temple structure. I am not supporting NaMo and RSS if they are manipulating the history but reality is history is already manipulated by left leaning Congress and communist.
