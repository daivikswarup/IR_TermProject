                            Ram Madhav should keep his fantasies to himself. His party did not put 'Akhand Bharat' to any test of the people's will 's in the 2014 elections.<br/><br/>
Why does he forget what his party actually promised? Have they already given up on "Achhe Din"?<br/><br/>
Ram will do well to remember a certain 20th century Leader whose fantastical dreams of "Lebensraum" ultimately ended in the destruction of Germany.

                            Excellent piece. "Any updated version of Akhand Bharat cannot but aim to reconstruct that trading system - one where national boundaries may well be sacrosanct but energy corridors, river-development projects and expressways would cross these boundaries at will." Nice.

                            Even as national identities can remain, the concept of Akhand Barat is a great means to unity. Just like how the european union operates, Akhand Barat can offer a great platform for trade and financial empowerment of a deprived people for so long.

                            Well articulated. Additionally, we as a nation, are unable to even manage what is today India. 100% of govt employees are corrupt, 90% of police is super corrupt, much of the judges are available at the right price. Dear Ram Madhav, stop drinking, start working. We gave you the mandate to bring about a change and that change isn't coming. We don't want the Congress style of working. Change this corrupt system. This is the legacy that BJP should try to achieve. We don't want another stupid Manmohan Singh as our leader. Wake up, and work.

                            Nature has given us so much richness but still we are beggar and will remain like that because of our beggar mentality. Bharat was Akhand but we break it down to maintain some perks for Kings and Jamindars. In 1857 we fight united but in 1947 we ask for Muslim Rashtra, we ask for Hindu Rashtra and we ignite the religious flavor to obtain it. In results of that we ask King of Kashmir and Nepal not to merge with Bharat and further divided ourselves. We are not still satisfied with this partition and our deeds are asking it more. In general, prosperity never comes at the door of a beggar because he or she could not think beyond own needs like an animal. Somewhere, we have to generate some maturity in ourselves to think that we can achieve or maintain our prosperity only when our neighbor also becomes prosperous. We can certainly fight to go to haven but its loneliness will become hell for us. Thus, it is highly essential that we must collectively work to make Bharat a socialist republic rather than a broken Akhand.

                            In my view there was no controversy. Mehdi Hassan asked a pointed question about RSS's philosophy of Akhand Bharat to which Ram Madhav provided a straight reply. He also specifically said it could only come about through popular goodwill and not through war. The interview is available on youtube<br/>
Was there an expectation that an RSS ideologue would actually step back from a well known position that his parent organization is known to take on this issue? In my view this is just a manufactured controversy as is the controversy on intolerance that arises from media's interviews of less than articulate BJP members

                            one geo economic region extending from afghanistan to burma and leh to maldives - will only result in more prosperity, peace and cultural development for the coming generations. those kids learning to read and write now ... have this enormous task to write the constitution of such co-operative region so that its people become stronger and compete freely within the developing dynamic world. It constitutes the future of 1/4th of humanity. Enough with the political borders, religious divide and small mind attitude. If you are not happy with AKHAND BHARAT - Just call it South Asia Economic Region. But the Idea of Strength in Unity is not totally nonsense - as a matter of fact, by keeping each country small, we reduce the potential of each individual. An example: any American artist or businessman  has the highest potential  in the world only because of the country being so homogenous and its economy so huge - not so in Europe / Japan / or any other country. So you choose if you want to be a citizen of a small country or a country which is the part of a vast economically homogenous region - the option should be made available to everybody and the action plan needs to be taken at all levels.  And this is not rocket science.

                            To the Author,<br/><br/>
I did not read the entire article. I stopped at the word controversy itself. Why should there be any? It is us Hindus [please refer to this word as a regional identification as given to us by the Arabs] who had to give away our land to those Muslims who consider to be descendants of looters, rapists, intolerant religious bigots who cannot live with their brothers and sisters with whom they share their roots. What Ram M said was nothing but a wish that Hindus who converted to the Arabic religion for gain, or fear of death etc will one day realize that, I can have foreign adopted religion, but my culture, my roots are vedic. Thus, with this revelation, one day Akhand Bharat will be a reality. <br/><br/>
Besides as far as the host of the program is concerned, he had an agenda and narrative was well placed to fulfill the agenda. RamM fell for it. Lets not make a Jihadi apologist in closet be a toast of the town. Plainly speaking, he is a moron who believes in flying horses but will call me a kuffur cattle cause I believe in Ram and unification of people of vedic roots.<br/><br/>
How can this be a controversy? All the smart intellectuals must be reminded of one fact, borders change every 20-30 years or so. History is witness to this. Now I'll finish reading your article<br/><br/>
Thx.

                            English educated modern Indian did untold damage to Indian Civilization following the Englishmen's Macaulay stratagem; today's corrupt India is a direct outcome of that 'miswork'. Still worse, modern Indians' 'cultural condition' has been deteriorating all along. I wonder at their ignorance of India's civilizational stakes. The West is on its way out- the waning of empires is no news. Pakistan and Bangladesh are though back wind to the West's hegemony's sails; they coolly carry on with their Veto diktat over rest humanity. The only challenge to that 'imperium' is a strong India for reasons of its subcontinental size, an enduring Vedic civilization however dormant- held so by India's 'Macaulayed class', and some critical factors more. Modern Indians are little knowledge is a dangerous thing thing. They are a far cry from Chanakya, or for that matter Vivekananda. These people suffered upon them a dyarchy of de jure and a de facto Prime Minister. They were fooled! Still they think they know. Oh no! They don't know that they don't know. I watch modern Media from our nation's wings. I pour scorn over their 'bird brains'. Big brains is the need, and those big brains see in subcontinent's unity the promise of next millenniums. Ah! Why shall I cast pearls before swines? Yet I did for the odd chance that the odd soul catches on to the spur to foresee future and work for it- just as I do, nose at my modest Redeeming India mill.
