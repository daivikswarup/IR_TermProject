But he has turned out to be a political tool who sit in an ambush all the times to spout cliches, lies and all the fallacies in the book to create obstruction in parliament and to vitiate the political discourse. When he did some thing good for the country by rising above TMC's shallow politics is yet to be seen. Last few times we saw, he was shouting for congress-I.

You should have known that professionals go to school, get trained and become engineers, lawyers and doctors unlike 9th grade fail becoming deputy CM! Is that all you need to become politician? If Lalu's son wanted to become a politician then he should have worked at grass root level and find his way up and not by being Lalu's son! Go get some life dude!

But there should not be any such mistake with such important dates of Indian democratic history. Its like telling India got Independence in September.

                            The only reason for this article is that O'Brien is a member of the Rajya Sabha. What is the merit in his arguments? Can the indirectly elected Raj Sabha ever have the status of the directly elected Lok Sabha? The Lok Sabha represents the will of the people. The Lok Sabha directly decides who will form the Central Government and the Prime Minister. The Rajya Sabha came into existence only because we followed the Westminister practice of the House of the People and the House of the Elders. Nothing will happen if the Rajya Sabha is abolished. It is just a nominated group of persons mostly of poor calibre. What are the contributions of Rekha, Sachin etc.? On the other hand, Indian democracy will come to a close if the Lok Sabha is abolished. In fact without realising it he has made an important point. The Constituent Assembly that approved the Constitution itself was not a truly representative body. The Constitution therefore did not and does not represent the true will of the people. The Constitution itself recognised that and provided in Article 368 that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution. The Supreme Court later invented a basic structure doctrine of the Constitution based on the assumption that fundamental rights could not be touched. In actual fact it used that arguments to entrench itself into power by arrogating to itself the power to appoint, transfer and regulate judges of the higher courts. Therefore the uproar when the NJAC was struck down. Since absolute power corrupts absolutely this has led to the massive deterioration of our judiciary with 3 crore cases pending, nobody accountable and justice not available to the common man, only to the rich and influential. In any true democracy only the House of the People rules. Even in India, it is the Lok Sabha that truly embodies Indian Democracy. The executive, the judiciary and even the Rajya Sabha, are necessarily subordinate to it. O'Brien only reflects his and his party's views which are grossly out of tune with Indian democracy. The TMC is a one person party and O'Brien a mere camp follower with no identity of his own. It is hardly a democratic party in any sense. His views will only reflect that warped reality .

Lower house at least have provision to suspend people obstructing the business in the house. <br/>
Parliament is for debate and discussion. If this is not happening then people are not fit to hold that position. Passing the responsibility to the ruling party is shirking the responsibility.

                            I AGREE – "such ideas are not just dangerous, they go against the grain of our federal democracy"<br/>
But Tell me: How come a national party holds it to ransom, IS THAT NOT AGAINST THE FEDERAL DEMOCRACY? <br/>
You Said – "And so those who mock the Rajya Sabha and play down its importance are actually questioning the foundational basis of our Constitution"<br/>
Tell me – have the political parties not played down its importance? Are the state governments not selling the seats to business persons for money? We have a case where a businessman from North India, with no business / personal interest in East India is appointed Rajya Sabha member by a state government from Eastern part of India.<br/>
Are such practices not making the mockery of foundation basis of our Constitution?<br/>
I AGREE that these people are not HONEST – "Those who have asked for the Rajya Sabha to lose its powers to question and force a rethink from the government are being dishonest"<br/>
Do you agree that ‘Those who are not letting it work, not letting the matters be debated, not letting bills being voted are being DISHONEST TO THIS COUNTRY AND ITS PEOPLE'<br/>
You said – "This is fair. The Rajya Sabha is an indirectly elected House, representing the legislators of states and the peoples of those states" <br/>
ARE YOU SERIOUS? Do you want me to list the incidents where RS Members from a state has no direct or indirect relation with the states they represent other than monetary?<br/>
You said: "Is the Chamber of the States - which is what the Rajya Sabha is - not qualified to consider such matters?"<br/>
I agree that RS is qualified, but you tell me: Are they considering? Are they working? OR They are not working? Not letting it work? Not Discussing? Not Debating? Doing Politics? Playing with future of the country? Billing the People of this country by NOT WORKING?<br/>
I am for RS, but it has to work, debate, argue, question. It can't behave in the same manner as LS, where the representatives are elected and if they don't work, they are questioned by the people of INDIA, unlike the RS members – WHO ARE NOT ANSWERABLE TO PEOPLE OF INDIA.<br/>
In my view, these people are supposed to have a CONSCIOUS and should be answerable to that, JUST THAT these days they are ANSWERABLE TO their political masters and not CONSCIOUS………

One only has to see his aggressive body language and hear his angry, boorish voice to conclude that he isn't using the Rajya Sabha as revising chamber but more as a platform to get cheap publicity.  His shameful loyalty to Mamata on issues where she is in wrong is evidence of his total lack of integrity.  Under such circumstances, anybody with integrity would resign.  He is incapable of using civilised language, calling the Prime Minister 'Butcher of Gujarat' while ignoring the atrocities committed on a daily basis in West Bengal.  O'Brien should be aware that we ordinary Indians are will continue to keep an eye on him.  He is dangerous for India.

You are not the people's representative, but the representative of politicians and your seat is there because you have chosen to lick the excreta of Mamta. You talk as if you are the only person who understands democracy. Further you had called Mr. Narendra Modi "the butcher of Gujarat".. Where is your apology?

Is this not tyranny of unelected Jaitley who should be aptly called MANUFACTURING Minister as he knows nothing of Finance.. Modi needs this shouting brigade and create issues when on back foot to divert attention.. BJP blocked GST and did not let Parliament function and not shedding crocodile tears.. and has awakened to the needs of India.. Let them remember this for post 2019 when they will be in opposition..

He questions Supreme Court's tyranny in deciding how SC judges will be appointed and RBI's tyranny in deciding interest rates and now Rajyasabha's tyranny in questioning the bills that they would like to be passed without questioning. But then what gives him, the unelected, any right to be the Finance Minister?

                            Mr. O'Brien has not one word about how the Rajya Sabha has stalled bills. It is not that the TMC and Congress opposed bills on merit - they went after the BJP, refused to allow a debate. Even today the GST is held up, not because of merit (because a Parliamentary committee has worked out a compromise), but because the Congress is uncomfortable about the judgement against them in the National Herald scam. And TMC is concerned about their own skin in the Sharada scam. Please don't try to fool us, Mr. O'Brien. We can see right through you. One day, even Bengal's voters will.

                            Whether one likes it or not, do away with the Rajya sabha dialogue is not something a sitting minister should be writing about on the internet blogging sites. Its nothing more than gaining a few votes. With India being a population of 1 billion i can guarantee that its not going be heard or read by even 1% of what he wrote. If you really want meaningful argument explain what is the problem or fault in Congress's objection to GST. They have maintained time and again to three objections and i believe its more worth looking into it than taking to internet to explain yourself. Parliament is meant for such things.

I am not even bringing the personal scams of the Gandhi family like Bofors,National Herald and all the scams of their Damad.The government is simply investigating these scams, if they do not investigate you dare them to investigate, if they investigate you call it vendetta. The propaganda of your media agents may give you false comfort that people are being fooled by your strategy to cry vendetta, it will be at your own peril you seek comfort from propaganda of your media agents.

Sometimes emergency is exactly what is required. Who is actually causing this problem? get to the depth of this first and then comment. Anyways, Indira Gandhi had activated the emergency and she was made popular because of this bold move and the country still respects her for this. The Man who got India on the map Mr. Vajpayee was jailed too. Do you not think that our country needs to be straightened first and then everything else. What's for people/politicians such as your selves who live in ivory towers and talk about the situation in the country when you are reason for parliament disruption.
