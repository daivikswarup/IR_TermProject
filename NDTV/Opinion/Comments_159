                            Delhi can never be city of dreams. It is city of sharmas, Yadavas and other goons who always flaunts "don't know me" and now it also belongs to AAP goons, to whom you dare to speak a word against AK.

                            As I have always maintained... New Delhi is a lovely city, large open spaces, wide roads, parks and gardens. Pity about the people governing it, though.

                            Dear Author,<br/><br/>
I stayed delhi for two years &amp; observed the following<br/>
1.Most of Delhi peoples are frustrated and impatient -due to this problem frequent fights in roads &amp; colonies.<br/>
2.Most of people are corrupt and greedy- expecting everything for free &amp; looting others even no difference between have`s &amp; not have`s and that`s why you have elected APP for freebies-SD was doing good job but unfortunately CWG scam by congress Gandhi family -she lost the election  <br/>
3.Women can not travel alone in bus or walk in road- if she goes, she will be abused and verbally raped her.<br/>
4.Delhi`s 80% people`s culture is equivalent to Taliban<br/>
Because of capital of india  -- Delhi is surviving otherwise Delhi would have collapsed

<div class="com_user_text"><p dir="ltr">Badly written, and that pouty photograph also doesn't add well on to this mudslinging article. At a time when silence and actions would have been dignified, this article only serves to further alienate Delhi from India. Very immature. The safety of women in Delhi is low compared to many other metropolitan cities. I and my masters batch mates visiting Delhi one fateful winter can vouch for that.</p></div>

                            Arrogance is reflecting from this writer like any other Delhi wala. As proud Delhi wala, he might be feeling pride about all the rapes, molestation, traffic law breaker, 'dont know who m i' attitude, Delhi walas wear new dresses with price tag on to flaunt the same. Delhi is not a city of dream and opportunity but city of shame and arrogance. People are not migrating to Delhi for opportunity however they are migrating to cities like Bangalore wherein true cosmopolitan culture is present. Bangalore is struggling due to its own infrastructure problem and lack of governance however Delhi is far behind then Bangalore in all cases. People who have moved from even Delhi to Bangalore are not willing to go back to Delhi due to the charm and opportunities of Bangalore. I think this writer lost every sense of his and hence he is feeling proud about Delhi and comparing with Bangalore. Requesting the writer to please come to Bangalore and spend some time, you will realize what type of bad city Delhi is. I was in Delhi for few months and by looking around and communicating with those arrogant people, I felt shame that Delhi is our capital.
