                            Mr Thampu, as a student from the batch of 2008 (your first year as Principal and our third year), I can confidently say that you have become completely delusional! You started your first year with humiliating and harassing our teachers and finished your tenure with hounding and emotionally torturing a person you yourself termed a "samosa wallah"! Even after he died of tuberculosis at an advanced age you couldn't help yourself and cursed him in death! we loved and respected that old and poor dhaba owner more than you and we are elitist? You on the other hand misused your power and authority to torture an old poor man with tuberculosis just because you could, makes you great? And you call yourself a man of God! Some padri you are! You're the worst thing to have happened to that institution and not to mention how full of hate you are. Good riddance! Better late than never

                            All claims apart Mr. Thampu, you are always in the news for wrong reasons. Is mearly your holding of a important position is a reason enough for us consider you above suspicion. Sometimes guilt compels individual to do damage control exercise. You are no Angel . History will decide your ranking among your esteemed predecessors. Education Mafias  are bringing bad name to this noble profession. Nationalisation of Educational business is last resort for reformers. Do you agree?

                            Dear Dr Valson, Thanks for such an honest write-up.

                            During my time at St. Stepehans in the early 90s, Valson Thampu was still a lecturer and for some petty churh politics with a students parents, he harassed and humiliated the student in college. For the first time in several decades a formal student meeting was called and it was unanimously demanded that he apologise and be punished. <br/><br/>
He survived only because of his privilege of being steeped in church politics. His rise to his position can also be entirely attributed to this privilege.<br/><br/>
I have no visibility to how his tenure as a principal was, but a petty, political and vengeful man can never do any good to any institution.<br/><br/>
If there is any lesson he has given his students, it is to never be like him. And that perhaps is a great lesson for any young mind.

                            I'm sure you're a decent man, but you have not been good for the college. Please get rid of this self delusion. It will harm you in your retirement.

                            I am not going to bash the principal for Christianity and conversion, etc. While I did not fully appreciate his views whenever he had appeared on TV, I agree with him on some of his observations here. St Stephen's is like one of the good old IITs--they owe their stature to the attributes of their respective student communities. However, with one difference--the IIT students are good at academics, while St. Stephen's ones come with pedigree and privilege, and rarely with academic achievements. Moreover, as the principal points out correctly, the students believe that "whatever is to be learnt, it is outside the classroom"--and IMO, they also believe that getting through the IAS exam requires different qualifications (read pedigree, privilege, background and connections) than mere academic excellence...How else would the school have produced such utterly miserable, obnoxious and supercilious dorks like Mani Shanker Aiyar and Shashi Tharoor?

                            The principal of St. Stephen's seem to have forgotten why St. Stephen's was established. It wasn't for the poor or the rich but for the spreading the message of the Gospels and for the christian community. <br/><br/>
This article is a sad depiction of Mr. Thampu's distored view of St. Stephens and this contempt for christians was expressed through out his tenure. As a net result St. Stephens has lost its christian character and will soon loose its charm as well.

                            When Thampu says that he changed the admission policy of St. Stephen's to bring in social justice he seems to be lieing blatantly. He was perhaps only implementing the current policy of the Society of Jesus which runs these institutions to convert the Hindu backward classes through offering them free education. Clearly he is a man who seems to be too stingy with truth.

                            Why is the article written by a person with a title - Rev - I thought all titles were abolished in India long ago around 1971 by Indira Gandhi? NDTV perhaps is not aware even though it is a 'news channel'!!

                            the guy is shouting i was hated because i allowed the poor in. well he was hated because he has no leadership qualities and only survived because of backing by church of north india. and he did cni's bidding the entire time he was there. his last line is quite revealing - " I am happy...especially its spiritual foundation."
