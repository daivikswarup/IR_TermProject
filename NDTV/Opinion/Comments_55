                            Why do we have this on Indian site? Who in India cares about US primaries? We don't care about it even in Canada!<br/>

                            Trump is correctly voicing the threat to the American way of life. The Americans have the right to choose the  who they believe is right for their country. The non Americans who donot agree with him can stay out of USA as no one is forcing them to go there.

                            I am just wondering why you NDTV had to publish such a column when we have elected our Donal Trump in LS 2014 elections? Who knows the Trumps of the world are all learning from the Sanghi snakes.

                            the way to stop donald trump is in the hands of US voters or  give more chances to open his business all over the world, including his companies as FDI in india.:(

                            So what if Trump wins? Or loses? It is all the same to Indians. The US will still support Pakistan. In fact, generally speaking, the Republicans have been more favourable to us than the Democrats. Trump will at least have entertainment value.

                            What does India got to do with this? The writer of this article is a complete idiot, he says that Trump inherited all his wealth from his Father. This is BS, he borrowed $1 Million and turned into a $10 Billion empire. He repaid the $1 Million he borrowed. Please get the facts right before you write. He was married thrice, yes but after divorce. If people can accept a person to be the CM with 3 wives (without divorce), why not a President.
