                            Hope with the passing away of Mufti Sahab the nonsense of Ganga-Jamuna Tehzeeb will also get buried for ever

                            From an ordinary Indian's point of view it is very difficult to find any positives from Mufti's tenure either as Home Minister or Chief Minister. Considering the amount of help and money given to that state, the return on that investment has been worthless. The Indian government should have abrogated article 370 and integrated J &amp; K into India long back. How long will this separate status be allowed to continue to the detriment of the nation as a whole?

                            Just like the Abdullah father-son duo, this family also has ate up all the money from Centre taken in the name of special status and bringing peace to the state of Kashmir at the same time keeping teh situation volatile and the youth of the state jobless and directionless.

                            The absence of sincere comments here expressing condolence over the death of M M Sayeed (even after more than two hours of publishing this news) shows that people never held him in high regard and his soft corners for various anti-India agencies have not been taken too kindly. RIP MM Sayeed.

                            He was real Kashmiri citizen who had no curtsy or respect for India. He used politics and lived for himself and his own family agenda like what Indira Gandhi does for her family to hijack Congress Legacy. These loose character leaders cannot be idols for any society except for third world countries compared to western society norms. Russians people praise whosoever in power once they are gone they abuse them. Chinese model Criticize on face when wrongdoers. Indian criticize people while in power and then once he or she dies we praise them build monuments and statues. Now its Mufti time to build his statues and monuments will be taken over by his daughter Mehbooba.

                            Alienated people and Compassion ? As the history shows, It is the kashmiris who went in to the evil lap of pakistan and started terrorism. It is not that rest of India was already developed and then the govt and people went to kashmir to loot resources or harass people. The problem was created by kashmiris and the govt of India has been spending lakhs of crores to appease those spoiled people. India should have done what china did in ugher. Historically Kashmir is part of India since ages and these people are outsiders. India should remove article 370 and integrate the state like any other state. No special status or treatment. That is the only solution.
