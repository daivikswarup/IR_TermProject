                            The BJP, not being able to fulfill its election promises of bringing heaven on the earth, is resorting to all other tactics to polarize the society on communal lines. The TMC leadership seems to have fallen for the bait without realizing the long term consequences to the society as well as polity. The leadership of the government has kept a studied silence .

                            Construction of Ram Mandir is not an issue of BJP or even RSS. It is the wish of over 100 Crore Hindus of the world, one-sixth of Humanity. Lord Ram represents the very cultural ethos of our nationhood.<br/>
Its comparison with Malda incident represents the ideological bankruptcy of Left, particularly the Karats...

                            It is time that a few statesmen emerge to make people understand and realize that a it is a series of such incidents that are being triggered, like the incendiary comments of Tiwari, Subramanian Sami, Bhagvat, Das et al, designed to bleed India of its tolerance and syncretism to achieve the objective of  a unitary and homogeneous Hindu state of India. In short the strategy seems to a long term one of bleeding India to complete communal polarization  by shoals of such communal incidents rather than big ones like Ayodhya or Godhra .

                            The misrule of decades of CPI government is one of the very causes for the prevalent situation in Bengal. The communist party did not check the influx of minorities from across the border. They came and went as they wished. The concept of "National interests" was torn apart to reap the dividends of electoral victories because of the minority votes. An IPS officer was stabbed in the back on the streets of Kolkata by minority member by no action taken. Why? For votes.<br/><br/>
Now trying to assume moral high ground is one of the pathetic things that CPI can ever think of. You have created a mini Kashmir in the east. Why? For votes.

Now when BJP has taken to the highest level since 1992 you guys are only left to write and cry. It is too late for everyone. They have mastered the strategy.

                            The communists have no sense of humour or Brinda would have been rolling reading her own article. The TMC learnt the art of political violence from the original masters, the CPM. They learnt it so well that in rural Bengal the CPM cadres were butchered wholesale and had no protection when the CPM lost power. Hence now they decry the violent politics of the TMC. It is silly for a virtually defunct party like the CPM which rules tiny Tripura only, and that too because of the charisma of Manik Sarkar and no thanks to the CPM, to pontificate on national issues. The high moral ground belongs to those politicians and parties that have clean hands. The CPM does not qualify in any which way. Vomiting media articles in the name of political analyses is stupid. But that is the only alternative when you are incapable of original thinking.

                            It is Muslims who are responsible for violence and roits in Malda, but TMS, CPM, Congress are blaming BJP for the incident. Also no action is taken against rioters. Since rioters were Muslims and victims were Hindus, no one is protesting against incident, no support for victims, no action against rioters. Secular groups, Media, Artists, Mamata, Rahul, Sonia, Kejriwal and Nitish are all silent. There are not planning to visit Malda. In India, secularism means anti Hindu and tolerance means minority appeasement. Malda is one more wake-up call to Hindus. The game played by Mamata, Rahul, Sonia, Kejriwal, Nitish should be exposed and people of WB should reject them in upcoming assembly polls.

                            Brinda - I think you are politically dumb or pretending to be anti BJP and other people who are really doing good job for the country. Look at the bold actions taken by BLP leadership in the past 1.5 years. Have you been a part of any such kind of bold initiative in any of the parties you have been associated with in past? You can just keep crying and keep pointing fingers on others who are doing a good job for the country. This is unfortunate for India to have politicians like you in our system. Have you seen the improvement of image in the international fora for Indians since BJP has come to power? NDTV - you guys should be nationalists first rather than just posting anything on your website that comes to you.

                            The plight of the communist party is deplorable.Instead of talking about classes and working to bring parity in wealth and income over all the classes ,they have resorted to the communal approach. Castes ,religions now form a staple issue of their politics. TMC itself is a communal organisation and it has to be countered with the issues of poverty ,income disparities and security and safety.No other party can compete the communalism of TMC in Bengal ,think out of the box ,go in for issues much needed to be addressed.

                            Dear Communists,<br/>
You were powerful. For your fear in 1940's, Nawabs funded Pakistan movement. The difference between India and Pakistan today is due to strong communist streak of thoughts. Congratulations.<br/>
Had you delivered more effectively, Ayodhya would have been a forgotten issue by now. But you didn't. <br/>
You didn't arm twist 100% literacy from central government, you didn't enforce tillers' act across all states. You didn't nationalize all religious places. You didn't bring truly (Western sense) secular government.<br/>
You didn't do a lot of things when you could.<br/>
Do you agree?
