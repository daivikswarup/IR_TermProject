                            BJP has 3 simple mantras<br/>
1. If u cannot convince them, communalize them<br/>
2. If u are not with us, u r against us(and of course anti national)<br/>
3. Any barbaric act committed by any party member or affiliate party member that is made public should be countered with "congress has done, so we can do it"

                            It has become really fancy to blame BJP for everything. Why are there no accusations on BJP where there are no elections? Why are there no resignations. This site is really becoming extremely anti-BJP site

                            Basically BJP was/will be, a one election wonder of 2014.The cocktail of modi rhetoric along with the CAG uproar of "corruption" and Anna hazare/Ramdev pitching in, caused a tsunami against the Congress. However It did not make for a pro BJP/RSS/Hindutva wave. As time passes, and the anti congress, Tsunami recedes, the country's politics is back to normal. Delhi and Bihar results are the new normal, and so BJP will recede back to being a non entity in the assembly elections. Modi's bluff of some silly "gujarat model" has been busted. People cant get fooled again on a "development agenda", with so much of poor performance of Modi govt.

                            A beautiful political insight given by Rishi Ji in the present day West Bengal. Apparently the BJP is going to meet the same fate as Bihar. There too Amit Shah committed the blunder of reigning in outsiders for the elections which he appears to repeat in Bengal as well with ominous consequences.

                            Where ever BJP wants to make inroads, communal polarization is its first strategy. It is time tested and has given great results to the party right from the days of Advani's rath yatras. 2014 Modi elections were different in that sense. They followed a 'development' strategy for the marginal swing voters who sit on the fence and tapped into the disillusionment of Congress's non-governance ... but they also followed their traditional communal strategy in UP and made it very subtle to pander to their core extremist base. This two-pronged strategy: obvious development and subtle communal strategy gave them good results. If they want success, they should stick to this new strategy rather than the old one.

                            Well written. BJP needs to show what alternative it has to offer and how better is that in compared to Red, White and Green parties. Communal Polarization in W.B. will not work in favour of majority.

                            Civic poll was all a staged affair. You have to be in Bengal to know the truth. In our ward, in just 15 minutes 86% voting was done. But just wait and watch for Assembly elections, with huge troops deployed, manufacturing wins is not going to be possible. Urge CVC to deploy huge troops to Bengal for elections. From a concerned citizen of Kolkata (Budge Budge area).

                            NDTV is now has become mouth piece of AAP party, even a small sneeze by kejriwal comes in headline in NDTV. This channel was mum on MALDA violence and  was asking to maintain peace and that news didn't appeared on front. But now since last day this DALIT suicide is on their front news since yesterday and it is keep fueling this debate. I know it will continue for another week and Raul Gandhi will visit today or tomorrow and give it useless lecture

                            See, BJP does not need West Bengal. West Bengal may need BJP, me not sure. West Bengal have seen Left rule and now seeing TMC rule. It is their choice. WB did not give much seat in general election to BJP. Certainly, you get what you deserve by your decision making. BJP are minnows in WB, Assam and Kerala. So, where does the question of BJP coming to majority come ? Are you not seeing what is happening in Bihar on daily basis?? So, choice is yours, not BJPs..

                            BJP is primarily communal, fascist. They grow by strengthening communal hatred feelings, where they have grown it's sane. Wether in UP, Gujrat, only on hatred with minorities and Nehru-Gandhi family. Down with BJP, they represent CIA, British- Jinnah two nations theory. People of WB and Assam, stay away from BJP.

                            People poorly understand the Gujarat model and hence they get beaten at their arithmetic and predictions again and again. After 2002, Gujarat has seen many elections - 2007 state elections, 2009 general elections, 2012 state elections, 2014 general election. In each of this elections, BJP has won and there has been no communal agenda. It has won because it performed. Now under the corrupt brokership of CM Anandiben Patel, Gujarat is losing BJP slowly and gradually. The current CM is super corrupt with her daughter and son-in-law personally brokering deals and taking corruption money. So much so that even peons have started asking money, openly claiming, if CM takes, why should he. In the next elections, if BJP loses Gujarat, it shall be because Modi allowed his personal chemistry precedence over merit.

                            like most ppl in bengal who can write in english.. u too seem to be oblivious or are at least pretending to be oblivious to the scheme for the girl child(kanyashri), increased support to small &amp; medium scale farmers, improved heath facilities, increased education facilities, proper usage of funds, providing medicines at fair price to the impoverished, peace in jangalmahal &amp; darjeeling, a clean Kolkata, and above all, convincing a state full of lazy idiots who never worked fr 34 yrs to cm to ofc on saturdays.. .. all of these contribute to the sustenance of tmc in the state.. even though nobody is perfect.. nd thr r several loopholes in the current party as well.

                            so when commies and Mamta, appease and polarize musleems , it is ok and no problem.  Even if that appeasment is creating national security problems and changing the demography in border districts, sickulars and liberals have no problem but when BJP protests the appeasment and raises the  security issues, they are  communalising and doing polarization. So musleems can be appeased and nation can go to dogs but when some body opposes it and tries to unite majority against the danger, these sickulars  start shouting. India is full of traitors...
