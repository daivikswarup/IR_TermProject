                            Who and what exactly is going to happen after writing/reading an article on issues like this. Is judge corrupt or is it the pathetic system? Opinions are divided so who is right? Who will decide who is right and whats wrong? Isnt it better if we learn to live with reality that we live in India that is becoming horrible place on earth as day pass by. Its tragic, it hurts but the fact of matter is nothing can be done about this, not today, not tomorrow so create a space and comfort for yourself by hook or by crook. As simple as that.

                            You have very selectively picked statements from the film industry people who may have been in the opposite camp on the intolerance debate than that of yours. Although I fully agree that the acquittal of Salman is disconcerting to say the least, but what was the need for you to relate this with the intolerance debate. What about Shahrukh Khan and his statement that Salman khan's acquittal is positive. Positive for whom? What about Shobha de? Do you think even Aamir will be able to say that Salaman is a free man because of his celebrity status combined with power of money. What about even the news channels like NDTV which after the success of the Salman's previous movie started touting Salman as some sort of apostle of peace between India and Pakistan.

                            The justice system is broken for sure.  People in India will go to length to hide the truth because in reality, if they came up the police/ courts with the truth and say, it was an accident, they would be basically put to death.   The justice system is not fast, fair and it has no morals to help those who cannot help themselves.   So the poor will always be afraid of the justice system, as they cannot afford the lengthy process and cost and the punishment to their family.  The rich will be afraid as well and so they will use the lengthy time/lawyers/power to stall and basically use it to get away, because they do not believe they will get the right punishment.  I don't believe that Salman Kahn had any trust that the system will give him a fair punishment and allow him to make peace with all those he hurt.  I think he is a great hearted person vs all the others in the industries, as he will give time to a good cause without any return.  His return is that he will be judged by God on how well he did for others in this life time.

                            The article could not have been more objective. It is a slap on the faces of those , who are  celebrating the "acquittal". In fact, they are , indirectly, celebrating the death of those killed. Is not the owner of a vehicle responsible in any way for the deaths? Even if some financial help is rendered now, it will be too belated to be called succour.

Apart from a handful of blind fans (we have such fans for every political party as well) and the "out of options" film fraternity (be practical...why would they ruin their relationship now when they haven't spoken against him in 13 years), there is a huge discontent amongst the society. Twitter is full of jokes, the system is being ridiculed. But face it Miss, this wasn't news to anyone that he got acquitted, it was just a matter of time. So go back home, enjoy your Friday or get into active politics to change the system. Your writing articles and people like me responding to it has never and will never change a highly corrupt system.

The same thing happened in Jayalaithaa's case. The lower court had the courage to convict the celebrity while the High Court caved in. Justice was lost. In Jayalalithaa's case the judge had 2 months to retire, so things became obvious. When does this judge retire? Being Human. What a joke. This creep should have been put away for life. And the Collegium should introspect on the poor quality of the judges it selects.

                            It is indeed very intriguing that so many of the high moral value people are coming out in favour of Salman Khan.  Just imagine if that an innocent Salman Khan with all the resources at his command had to fight through a shoddy police investigation for 13 years what is likely to happen for us commoners.  Judges seem to prove that they are human and technicalities seem to make more sense than common sense. One judge seems to be weak in mathematics and lets a politician go scot free and here a judge appears to have taken extra care to find loopholes to let Salman free.  But i still have not lost hope in judiciary for the judge in the Salman case did not conclude that there was no conclusive evidence that there was any incident on that fateful day or someone lost their life.

                            Yes, the cruel twist of the knife was a HC judge declaring the lone witness who was all along with Salman Khan, as "unreliable". That was downright deplorable for a judge to say of a man who is dead and cannot defend himself.

                            This guy Salman shows the whole world that he is a great hero in his movies, but he cannot admit the truth in a court of law. He is a creep when it comes to facing the real world. <br/>
Feel sorry for the victims and Ravindra Patil. May some humane organization honour them in some way. Maybe Rana can organize a special fund for them.

                            I do have my reservations on the verdict. But why Rana Ayub is questioning Salman? Is it because of the support he got from Anupam Kher/Ashok Pandit?<br/><br/>
Are you genuinely opposing the verdict or opposing it as Anupam or some BJP members supported acquittal?<br/><br/>
Intentions were not clear but understandable

                            After declaring him innocent, can the Judge not tell Salman Khan the following ? <br/><br/>
"I now am declaring that you were not driving the car. But you certainly know who was driving the car. So you tell me Who was driving the car so I can punish that other person.  If you do not tell me then I will punish you for hiding the truth, protecting the criminal and frustrating justice "<br/><br/>
Another approach would be to sentence all the occupants of the car to jail terms until the real culprit is identified by the other who will feel the pinch of being in jail for no fault of theirs.<br/><br/>
Why can't these creative, effective and reasonable alternatives not be used by the judge to deliver real justice ?<br/><br/>
Remember the story of the king who easily identified the real mother of a child which was being claimed by 4 ladies simultaneously as their own ?

                            A simple-worded but well-written post. But I totally agree that other than the Bollywood folks (who may have something or the other at stake) nobody else is celebrating. Posts in the social media are proof to that. Even if the act was unintentional, there is provision for punishment for that and should have been imposed on him as in case of any other common citizen. A lot of people are stressing on the fact that he is a person with a good heart. Let me ask a simple question – if any common good-hearted citizen had been booked for similar offences, would the treatment be the same ? But then, in this country power, stardom and money have in most instances fooled the law. What is absolutely certain is that the credibility of the judicial system and police administration has been badly hit once again. In any case the outcome was not unexpected to anybody, irrespective of the colour of the regime.

                            To add to my previous comment, I think Hindi film industry is full of the most hypocritical people in any industry. Add to this the general tendency of Indians to make celebrities/politician as some sort of demigods, so what the people in the industry is also a symptomatic of our general attitude towards famous people. It is always ready to close its ranks behind its own without caring if the person whom they are supporting is responsible for someone's death. In nutshell, you are barking up the wrong tree. We would be living in some fool's paradise if we believe that people from industry are going to be moral standard bearers. Although, to be fair to Shobha de, she appeared to be critical of Salman in her tweets.

1. It's not "WE" it's  just Salman Khan fans who are celebrating and if Your "WE" is addressing his fans then it's fine. But if it's for WE as In Indians then rest assured WE are not celebrating coz we are not bothered..<br/><br/>
2. Ofcourse Salman' s fans will celebrate that their superstar is a free man, after the verdict.. that they have been hoping for was given. Nothing wrong for them to be happy or his family and friends to be showing there happiness on twitter.<br/><br/>
3. If you want WE To be concerned about plights of homeless people suffering on road accidents due to negligent driving of people of course most of us are concerned..coz nobody should suffer such fate and I guess everyone will acknowledge it.<br/><br/>
Lastly, I don;t understand the point of your article..Coz Salman's Fans Will celebrate the verdict as they shud...and Others wont be bothered..so if you are trying to address His fans then Good luck!

How is that Salman and his legal team did not bring Kamaal Khan as a witness and Ashok Singh as a defence witness 13 years back. Instead they appealed and appealed to delay.<br/>
When Salman got convicted he got bail in hours, the high court judges stayed back.<br/>
For fear of contempt of court, it is hard to say the Judiciary is corrupt. But that judgements can be fixed at highest level is disturbing.<br/>

But No, he is Mr. Sallu, and he supported NaMo and has flown kites with him. So how can BJP's holier-than-thou pundits go against him now.  My heart goes with Ravindra Patil who fought for truth until his death.

As for the case itself, the High Court judge simply applied the law as he possibly had to. But there should be an appeal to a larger bench or even to the Supreme Court to establish the truth. According to this article, Patil and Kamaal Khan agreed that Salman Khan was driving and Patil said he was drunk. It must be true. Is that something to celebrate?

                            In India, everybody tries to be a judge including the author of this article. The basic principle of justice is that an accused has to be proved guilty "beyond any reasonable doubt" to get a conviction. The learned judge of the High Court has elaborated in detail why the prosecution have failed to achieve that. Public perception just does not matter. None of the people commenting here were there at the scene but have formed opinions based on what the media has fed them. Media often believes in sensationalism and hearsay so cannot always be relied upon. Judge has done a commendable job by just following what is presented to him in the court by strictly adhering to the law rather than getting biased by outside influence. Relatives of the victims have repeatedly said that they only want to get compensation but some people derive sadistic pleasure when rich and famous get punished even if they dont deserve it.

                            There is a difference between and accident and criminal activity. Salman is not a criminal and it was a drunken driving accident similar to thousands of accidents happen in India where lakhs of people are kelled due to negligent driving. If a common man did this accident, the case would have settled with some compensation to the victims after 1 or 2 years of trial. Because Salman is a famous movie start, this case took a different turn. Sanjay Dutt is a different case where he hobnobbed with terrorists and anti-nationals.  Even hard-core criminals who involved in murder get a second chance in many countries. Salman did mistakes like not helping the victims but later with his being human project he helped 1000s of poor people and  helped blind people get eye sight. I hope he helped the victim family if not he should help them now. I think we can forgive him now.

Anupam Kher, Ashok Pandit and Subhash Ghai, all 3 have spoken in Support of Mr. Modi on subject of Intolerance. Why she has not shown till now, what Shahrukh or Dilip Kumar or Shabana Azmi has said on this matter or any other film personality. Guess Rana Ayub is clearly sick with Modi phobia and now trying to generate some smoke from the Fire which is virtual. Get well soon Rana. you really need to come out of this phobia. God Bless you.

                            Salman was not drunk, he wasn't driving either. He has to name the driver as he was in the car.

                            I agree to some extent with this viewpoint. I also see that the case became more of is Salman was guilty or not instead of the Hit and Run case. If anything this case should have been reexamined to see who was driving which cost a human life and disabled others and not focus on was Salman driving the car. I think the fact that there is such a gap between a trial court and high court judgement also tells us that there needs to be more analysis to be done on which one has failed in the path of justice and work on some course correction.<br/>
I think this is a classic case of the dangers of trial by Media where from Day one the case was not hit and run but is Salman guilty or not. So the Media also needs to focus on asking the right questions and not make a judgement because some one is rich and/or famous.
