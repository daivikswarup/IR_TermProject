                            Curious elements expecting explosive information from declassification . Nothing substancial (to the disappointments of new rulers) came out and gloom descended in the camp which is bend upon to demean everything of the past governments . Strange but true, what substance was there to keep secret of Nets Ji's disappearance.

                            Yes, transparency is a must. A government elected by the people has no business keeping secrets from them. But it was the Congress that kept the Netaji files hidden for 68 years. For no apparent reason at all. The entire files relating to the 1962 debacle should also be released, especially the Henderson Brooks report. All the papers relating to how and why the Kashmir issue was referred to the UN also needs to be looked at afresh, as it has been an unending problem for 68 years and has deeply affected the integrity of the nation. And after 25 years, all documents relating to any issue should be made public. Like the Bofors controversy and why none of the culprits were ever brought to book. How Walter Anderson escaped from India or how Qattrochi was allowed to flee using his high connections should be exposed. And all the guilty should be brought to account.

                            Yes, but what about that apparant fake encounter? Has Congress apologised yet? Are we looking for excuses and wasting time?

                            Why did the previous govts NOT release the documents as nothing is there which would have harmed the country as a entity.?

                            Wonderful to see you all enthused about the issue now! At least this PM's actions has given rise to some soul searching in a country and a bunch of politicians who swore to sycophancy

                            This still misses the point; why were the Bose-related records classified in the first place, and why were they not declassified earlier? Yes, there is a culture of secrecy in Indian officialdom. But this has got to be more than that. Any number of people have been insistently clamouring for the release of these records. Still the refusal; why? It is a pity that Shashi Tharoor doesn't go into that. My own suspicion is that successive governments have feared the reaction of people who believe Netaji is alive.

                            While out of power Congress leaders want things that they dreaded even to mention when Congress was in power. Indians have not forgotten the lies by Congress for not making Netaji's records public. Though they continue disrupting parliament and at the same time expect laws to be passed. It's nothing but a gimmickry. At present passing GST should be on every PM's mind but Tharoor is playing politics by suggesting amendment to public records act.

                            Why did you not do it? You were in Government most of the time. Where were you? Do you and Manishanker get browny points for criticising the current Government all the time. Shame on you.

                            By putting his information under Classified clearly shows that the dream of freedom of the people was killed with Neta Ji Subash Chander Bose.<br/>
Then elitists ruled whose clothes were enjoying the British hospitality. Even now by declassification the games are being played.

                            Theoretically, valid points raised. But practical issues will be huge. For digitised data, govt. need huge resources, I guess. And also, are we matured enough to handle information, data in fruitful manner?! What we read of the RTI usage is mostly misuse of information to sensationalize pity news. Yes, more transparency is required, but then as a society we also need to get mature enough.

                            It time Indian film makers produced movies like the Hollywood movies. Cowboys and Red Indians, World War 2, Korean and Vietnam War etc. They always portray the Americans as good guys and the rest bad. Continuously produce movie, Indians as good and the British and rest as Bad. This will do a lot of good for Indians. Why did the Americans snatch away thousands of Vietnamese Infants during the last days of the war. The truth is out on Australian TV. Read about this and other lies. Just for the support of the American Public. We need India to be united!!
