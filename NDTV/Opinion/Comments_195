                            I support the education of all Indians irrespective of the religion. However, I like to make clear that don't call yourself a minority.

                            Dear Prof. please also write about the protection of the minorities (Hindus) wherever they are in minority in India like in J&amp;K, Malda, Mallapuram, etc. etc. But you won't do that because the hallmark of any pseudo secular is to talk about the protection of only  Muslim minorities.

                            not convinced. still don't see why a so called minority of 200 crore people should have universities where there is discrimination on basis of religion with 50% quota for muslims. same goes for st stephens. imagine a leading university where only hindus get 50% quota. ridiculous.

                            This is one of many consequences of khangress vote bank politics. Minorities believe that special treatment given to them is their right and they are better than majority. Also they want to use this to convert other poor people from majority. Khangress is cancer to India and AAP = khangress + corrupt-liar-uncivilized-goons.

                            Yes, pritection of minorities should be there. But what happened to you when Kashmiri pandits were getting cleansed ethnically from the valley. Are they not minorities there, or your definition changes in such cases? Don't create issues just for the sake of it!

                            There should be a proper definition of Minorities in India, be it Religious, Linguistic or anything else. Since, so much of diversity exists in all spheres of Indian Society, Minority definition should be capped at 5% of population. Anything, above 5% population is not minority or majority, but equal in all respects. No need of special benefits, they can compete in open selection and achieve and earn what they want

                            If anyone steps into AMU , he will feel it right away it is a Minority Institution. Right from its historical set up to its current prevailing culture. Those who point &amp; shout - lets modernize madrasas and then want to take away AMU's Minority tag shows the double standards and the insecurities towards Minorities. Lets be fair &amp; sensitive to all and stop rationalizing everything.

                            On what basis are we asking a minority status for someone? When we are not supposed to differentiate based on caste, color, community, cuisine, crotch (gender) then why are we seeking benefits based on these? Is it not promoting discrimination and sowing seeds for discrimination in the society where professors such Faizan seek equality? Also, muslims are 17% in the country. So, creating a false minority status for muslims by putting their own interests over other religions such as sikhs, Jains, buddhists, Christians which are in minority in relation to Muslims is not appropriate. Rather we all are in minority if we consider based on religion against Muslims as our ideology is different from the muslims. So, professors such Faisan are trying to widen the divide and seek undue benefits when instead they should contribute having benefited for so many years due to false minority satus. Muslims =17%, Jains =0.5%, Sikhs = 1.7%, Buddhists =1.7%, Christians = 2.3%, Parsis = 0.1%, jews = 0.05%, Confuscious followers = 0.03% - if you see these so called representatives of muslim interests ask for minority benefit when they forget that there are so many others who are in minority and these minority communities do not raise such concerns. How long will these so called muslim representatives continue to seek undue favours from a secular country. Live like Indians - work hard just as any other indian does even if a from religion perspective he is in minority. But Muslims with a 17% population in India is the second largest religious group can never be considered a minority... as they continue to already enjoy so many perks for being a muslim. Converting poorest of the poor into muslims and then seeking benefits is also a strategy followed by these so called muslim representatives. Extremely corrupt professors such as Faisan should not do injustice to the subject which he teaches. Act like a Constitutional professor.

                            "Indian secularism is indeed unique...kirpan in no way impinge on our secularism."<br/>
This is not secularism at all. If you want to learn secularism, turn to the United States Constitution. No religion gets special privileges of any kind. Why is the government caring for temples? Is it also taking care of gurudwaras and mosques: a detail perhaps the author chose to ignore? In my opinion, a privately funded institution can choose to be a minority institution. But AMU is a public institution. How can a public institution cater to one sect of society? The concept in itself is a violation not just of any article in the Indian Constitution but also of our very preamble. How can secularism have clauses? How can an educated man such as you be so communal in your thought? What special interests are you talking about? The Muslim rickshaw driver's son from Assam still can't afford college despite being one of yours. But your child should be able to get a place at a reputed institute out of merit alone. Why should your child enjoy more privileges than my child simply because they vary in religion??

                            800 years muslims ruled this country...today they are 25 crore which is a huge population and they they dont feel shame in calling themselves minority and still looking for some reservation..what a shame..parsis and sikhs never portrayed themselves like that and never asked for any special status or reservations. if in 800 years or after independence uslims are deprived of basic education and needs...then blame ppl like ghulam nabi azad and other muslim leaderswho did nothing for u..PLEASE DONT CALL URSELF A MINORTY  as the last census showed increase in muslim population dnad reduction in hindu poplutation...even educated professors like u are so fanatic

                            What is the definition of minorities? Is it that numerically they are smaller? Numerically in what sense? Is it religion based? If so, in trying to adhere to their religion,the nuisance value caused to the rest of the people is not defined. Also the percentage of progress to the country the 'minorities' inhabit is not calculated, by any yardstick<br/><br/>
Any country which allows the word 'minorities', is by default bringing religion in the picture. This applies all across the planet and it is high time we got rid of it<br/><br/>
Either you are an inclusive citizen to the country you belong to or you are not. This is my simple message
