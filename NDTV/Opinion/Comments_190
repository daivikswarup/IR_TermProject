                            Very sensible. He should have made use of his own sensibility when he was the CM. It would have been appreciated. And he would not have been booted out of power. And reduced to offering unwanted gratuitous advice.

                            She is really mulling over the issue of recommending fresh elections to get sympathy votes. She is not the CM , that is the dilemma as in what capacity she can do so

                            Why would he not communicate this with Mehbooba Mufti directly, rather than communicating this to the new readers. What's the intent and why would NDTV publish this ?

                            I like Omar's Father Dr Farook Abdulla. To me, when he speaks, I hear Lions roar. Omar has to learn. Lot from his father. Had Dr Farook today looks as young as ever he was. I watched his NDTV interview " Pundits return to Valley". Other then that " Rajniti me Nsyak aur Khslnayak Dono banna padta hai". Cheers and long live to u Dr Farook

                            Omar should that Mehbooba can only say that she is not interested to be a part or form the government. It will be up to the state governor to explore alternative and to call for elections.

                            Apparently a Very innocent,sweet and touching letter but a deadly salvo been fired. Read between the lines,"Your alliance with the BJP stands and no fresh negotiations are taking place, so why is the state under central rule? What are you waiting for, Mehbooba? Taking over now is not a sign of being power hungry but If you are unable or unwilling to assume the responsibilities then recommend for the  dissolution of the Assembly,".  So if she takes over,it would be a suicide, and if she recommends the dissolution,she will be blamed for toeing the line of Mr Omar Abdullah. lol
