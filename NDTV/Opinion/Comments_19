Its sad that no one took action for 20 years on this. I am from Delhi and I was fed up with this kind of nonsense in JNU and Jamia. <br/>
Anyways Congress and AAP do not have a sense of nationalism in them so let nationalists be considered stooges. I am paid for in terms of an ability to live with my identity and hold my head up when I travel. <br/>

                            Some semblance of logic - well done! At the end of the day, all the constituents - politicians, media people, journalists, students etc. are driven by their own greed and agendas. Everyone is playing it up and no one (NOT ANY MEDIA HOUSE INCLUDING NDTV) has any concern beyond their immediate gain. Politicians are playing up their vote banks and hence the hardened stand of BJP and its opponents and journalists (actually journalists is a wrong word for these guys - pseudo politicians may be the correct word!) and busy pandering to their masters voice on the right, left or center. It seems like JNU is the only thing that is happening in India while no one even talks about it in real life <br/><br/>
Its only for the "Aam Aadmi" (not to be confused for the supporters of AAP) to judge this and move ahead and get on in their task of building their lives and the country while all the jokers (politicians, journalists, intellectuals etc.) create impediments in this. <br/>

                            For once I find myself agreeing with 95% of what Malik is saying/writing. I would only differ, when he says Kanhaiya's speech was vituperative. I don't think it was. He was just reflecting the anger that is mounting against this govt, for its own faults and for the neglect that rural India has been facing for the last 6 decades. He was delivering a political speech of course. But a student leader with a left affiliation is permitted to do that. What is wrong in that? How will you sugar coat resentment that is boiling in rural parts of the country? People are starving. Crops are failing. Prices are rising. And nothing seems to have improved despite a change in govt. I don't belong to any political party. I just cant figure why cant we act like people who can argue and counter-argue without having to invoke Bharat Mata or calling the other a sanghi? Internet is, despite all its transformative benefits, is also creating a society that his forgetting to argue constructively. Honestly, my friends I know did not vote BJP to power to see this. We want a country that is liberal, equal and equally accessible to all. But if we turn into a bunch of angry, mad and eccentric people, we will end up electing angry, mad, eccentric people. It will lead us all to doom. So everyone take a fresh breath, get that young boy out of jail and make room for arguments and counter arguments. Like responsible adults.

                            Though I read Mr. Malik's opinion mostly, the title of blog, discouraged me to read. Nonetheless I read and it turned out to be balanced as usual. Very objectively he states everyone is playing to their constituency. Everyone is interested in blowing up the issue. And it suits everyone. Media has Block-buster topic, as they believe. Opposition believes they continue to strike gold with Hydrabad and now JNU. BJP thinks to capitalize on nationalism. And Mr. Malik rightly  point out about tiny geographic circle of influencing people thinking (as usual) high about themselves. Mango people in City understands everything, and Mango people in rural area doesn't bother to watch news channel.

                            Very good analysis by Mr. Ashok Malik. But, unfortunately, the role of NDTV was not impartial. They should be more judicious in reporting news and should not allow fanning of such act to promote anarchism. <br/>
JNU students are the most privileged class to continue their studies at least possible cost through subsidy from government which is paid by common people of India. They are shouting against our mother land. Freedom of Speech does not give anyone liberty to defame our mother land. Truly educated persons are aware of their limitations and shall never give anti-national slogans; other cynic persons may do so as they are crazy to be at the center of attraction of media through "Breaking News" and pseudo secular Politicians. It is known to us that the crooked politicians always try to fetch some political gain (vote bank politics) during such impasse that may happen in any part of the country. If such anti-national slogans happened to be shouted in Pakistan, could you imagine what punishment is expected..... <br/>
If someone at JNU has given anti-national slogan, then let the law takes its own course.....<br/>
Those who shout anti-national slogans in the campus are black sheep; they should be driven out from the university.....<br/>
Politicians should be more judicious in their approach to solve the issue, should guide the students to the right track and should not allow fanning of this sort of anti-national activities (shouting slogan like - "divide the country into pieces…..") to promote anarchism…..<br/>
Media should be more tolerant and wise in spreading "Breaking News" on 24x7 basis and should not add fuel to the fire; should try to douse it at their best. Media should always come out with specific positive solution and message of unity to the students to restore peace and harmony in the campus…

At a time we are losing people s lives incl soldiers crpf etxc to countering terrorism , contextualy Jnu admin is guilty of allowing such events and talks. Legally technically sedition is there or not the JNU propped up by vote bank seculars are creating haters of the Constitution who adore enemies of nation under name of free expression and abhor the elected Govt for no reason save their own definition of pluralism. Such people and institutions need to be taken on head on to protect the nation and irrespective of technicalities, Govt needs to take decisive action and my accusation is Govt has not done enough still.

                            The fundamental problem is the very name of the university.  It is a travesty to name any university after a person whose myth as the benevolent leader of India is now being debunked.  Nehru, the leader in question was an incompetent leader who put himself in a position where he was accountable to nobody.  Thus it was that he was able to dismiss an elected government in Kerala, he was able to take the Kashmir issue to the UN without anybody's agreement, he was able to send thousands of unarmed soldiers to certain death in the ill-advised war, started by him, against China, he got clean away with the Mundra and jeep scandals, and, most dreadful of all, he imposed on India the dreadful dynastic rule!  A direct consequence of the imposition of dynastic rule was the visit to the mis-named university by the universally derided Rahul Gandhi for no better a reason than to make trouble.  Ironic that Nehru was himself not the popular leader that the myth-makers have made him out to be; Patel was the preferred leader but regrettably, in another ill-advised act, Gandhi imposed Nehru on the nation.  With all this in mind, true patriots who are proud of India and being Indian would in this day and age be quite right in asserting themselves and not stand back when witnessing the advocacy of the destruction of India by such devious characters as Kanhaiya Kumar with the indulgence of journalists who also sneak into enemy territory, flitting from studio to studio and effectively collaborate with India's enemies.

Hence the TV and media are doing a great disservice to the nation by discussing/debating that second opinion. Media should not allow them to sit in table to give an alternative view.   .   .

                            Good assessment! But still the attitude of anti Indians and the support given for such a position by political parties and a section of the media needs to be taken much more seriously as it portends ominous things for the country going forward and can not be contained in a soft assessment of how people could have handled the situation.

Nafrat ki aanch mein khud ko dhundta hai <br/>
Iska zameer kahan kho gaya yaaro<br/>
Tere bhgwa ki roshni mere azaan ki guftgu <br/>
Phir yahan sannata aur andhera kaun bo gaya yaaro<br/>
Who avvaze aati hai diwaro ke us paar se , kuch teri hai kuch meri<br/>
Jis zameen ko hum dono apna maane who kuch meri hai kuch teri<br/>
Jab waqt hai bachho ki bilakhne ki awaaz sun ne ka, tum apna dhyan kahan laga gaye  yaaro<br/>
Masla zindagi ka hai isse fizool hi dhuen mei ura gaya yaaro<br/>
Tujhse mera raafta na sahi , tujhse mera raasta na sahi<br/>
 Magar Teri cheekho mein kahi khud paa gaya yaaro<br/>
Is shahar ko kya ho gaya yaro<br/>
Ye kya manjar hai , tere mere dono ke haatho mein khanjar hai<br/>
Shheshe ki is imaarat ko kab tak sambhalega tu , pure zamaane ke haatho mein pathar hai<br/>
Jis awaaz ne hume jorna tha us awaz ne hume  zuda kiya<br/>
Is saher ko is zehar ki nazar kaun  kar gaya yaaro

Instead, he blames Government,due to his allegiance to some parties.
