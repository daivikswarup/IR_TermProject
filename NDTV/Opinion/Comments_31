                            Politicians go by the popular mood. They need votes. The fact that Republicans and Democrats are evenly poised most of the time shows that Republican perceptions are shared by a good percentage of Americans. Even in Republicans behave inappropriately, there are many who side with them. Like on gun control. Democracy is untidy, but it forces you to accept all types of views, even if those views disgust you.

                            Agreed but the true problem lies in the fact that what happens in the US (the dominant economic and military power ) has a disproportionate impact on the rest of the world. So it does matter who gets elected. Just do a quick comparative recap of world events under Bush and Obama. The Republicans are focused on their voter base who don't really care to consider the world and their position in it. The Democrats on the other hand have resolutely done so, and as Klugman remarked - their speeches during the primaries clearly exemplify this.

                            Politics in the courts is as bad in the US, as it is in India! Only, they are not corrupt, unlike Indian judges, at all levels. For every honest justice, there are three corrupt justices! It's considered ok in India! Even acceptable! Unless you are caught, which is rare!
