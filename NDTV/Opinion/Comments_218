                            Repeat after me: "anything that is too good to be true is always a lie or a scam"<br/><br/>
Go to their website; they cannot even seem to make up their mind about the name of their firm. Logo says "Ring bell". Write-up says "Ringing bells". Founders have no links to the mobility business. Other than one picture of one phone and images rendered on their site, has anyone even seen a real phone. Well, it is a simple scam helped by free publicity thanks to media (but Nitin Pai here does a good job of raising the right questions). Stop falling prey to scamsters guys...wake up Bharat/India

                            I disagree with the author. I think that the smart phone which is sold at the price of 50 thousand rupees is over priced over 50 times. Otherwise the raw material usually involved in manufacturing a phone in large scale in my view should not be more than 50 rupees. Thus there is no need to subsidise the phone. Things are overpriced and we are conditioned to believe that it is normal, thus anyone who sells something at the right price, we tend to think that it must be subsidised.

                            Appreciate the company's exemplary initiative.  But how will this " garibon ka / common man ka phone"  reach out to its buyers thru etailing ?  Is it some major marketing oversight or just a media managed gimmick? You don't expect 95% of its  prospective and genuinely needful buyers to be etailing and e shopping savvy !!

Many times I paid up to 300 INR when I made purchases worth of 1000 INR only :D

A four month wait list adds to the suspicious nature of business. It is as clear as daylight that no one can manufacture and sell a smartphone for Rs. 251. Why will any business sell at a loss? The overt display of nationalism is a ploy to attract buyers. STAY AWAY even if its just 250 you are risking away.
