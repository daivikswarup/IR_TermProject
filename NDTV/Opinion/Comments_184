                            Your writing is thoughtful and defends human rights of minorities in India.  Glad that we have parliamentarians like Tiruchi Siva  and Tharoor.

                            mr tharoor should star worrying more about the FBI report confirming Sunanda was poisoned. He should defend himself in sunanda case 1st. he will have lot's of free time to write books on section 377 or why BJP MP's attend parliament on Tuesday's, Thursday's or Friday's in Jail. some one is going to jail. Karma is always a knacks back.

                            Mr. Tharoor now start facing PUSH AND PULL TEST from Modi. Now Bhim Sain Bassi will be only deployed on you.<br/>
Modi will not hunt Cingress for 1984 as there is chance of shouts of 2002 from Congress. SO THAT PACT ALWAYS BE HONORED but you will be spent for Kerala elections. <br/>
ONLY WAY LEFT JOIN MODI-SHAH to have clean chit.

                            It is natural for a congresswallah to blame the BJP. How many of Tharoor's own congressmen are willing to support striking down of section 377? Tharoor should remember that every MP is entitled to his opinion and these cannot be forced. Indians have always been traditional and conservative in their views. Better he starts an education campaign in parliament first. Good luck to him.

                            Wow sir you have time for this article 377 issue and what about your (late)wife's murder case. You always give priority to these issues which always gives indication that you are least bothered about your (late)wife murder case, so should we think you really like article 377 so you are happy without your wife now are you going to become gay???

                            Keep fighting sir. It was disgraceful the way the elected members of the parliaments behaved toward you and toward the LGBTQ community. It was an insult to the whole electorate in fact. So do not give up. We will do what we can. We have signed the change.org petition. So we have you reach the target. The hopes of so many people are now tied with your fight. Dont give up sir. Jai Hind.

                            Good on you Tharoor and keep fighting.  You will have plenty of time when you are serving time in Tihar for the Sunanda murder.  Please be careful though!  As a South Indian you are fairly small compared to say the average sardarjee serving time in Tihar.  Make sure you are well lubricated as 377 or no 377 such characters are bound to have their evil way with you in Tihar!

                            To be in political news a politician has to take up some cause or the other.  To escape from the heat on other personal issues also Shahi Taroor needs some issue to rake up and cry wolf if things go against him.

                            It is appalling that the 'liberals' never saw this as a violation of rights for last 6 decades.  Or may be they were sleeping all this while assuming the Congress government will take care of these issues suo moto.  That apart, it is even worse that your attempt though late, was defeated by our MPs.   It is evident that Indians are still not free in the correct sense.

                            Why he is not arrested yet.  What would have happened to an ordinary citizen or an AAP MLA in such a case??  Why judiciary and police have different rules for people in power and for poor helpless ordinary citizens.  Shashi Tharoor is trying to change the attention.  Why no Lie Detection Test on him.  He should have been in the forefront asking for a speedy enquiry.  He is smiling, attending conferences, writing books...business as usual for him.
