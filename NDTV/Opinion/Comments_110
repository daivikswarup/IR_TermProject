We did a major international blunder against Nepal. Nepal was a very close ally and a border cushion against the not-so-friendly China, but now it is gone.<br/><br/>

On one hand we call them brother and on other hand we deny them access to even basic medicine after such a natural disaster. So much ego. Did we make mistake by voting for Modi and BJP. It seems Modi doesnt have one quality. It is called compassion. He thinks he can dole out money and buy people thought and loyalty.. What kind of development policies will be made by this person who doesnt have any compassion.... Will his policy benefit people or only industrialists.

                            An excellant and well researched article highlighting the true fact of current Indo-Nepal relation. Only 11 out of 116 elected Madhesi 'Terai region' voted against the constitution is the burning proof to highlight that only a minority section of Madhesi Group in Nepal were against the new Nepal constitution, But Modi ignite the fuel with fire by sidening with those minor section and provoking the entire country who still hasn't recovered from devastating earthquake, and worse by putting an undeclared blockade for the last 3 months. This is not humane in any forms, shape and size. Now with no food, fuel, gas, medicine for winter, if the entire Nepalese are against the India, then it is no fault of their own...but only due to the man-made crisis generate by the namo 'Modi'.

                            Biggest disaster ever to happen to India is the Nehru gandhi family and people like mani shankar iyer.

                            To all my Indian friends: Truth hurts and I can tell you that Mr. Aiyer is 100% right on this. If you read Nepal's constitution, you will find that it is an inclusive and democratic document that does not discriminate against any group. Almost all of the leaders of Madheshi groups helping Modi save his face on the blockade had lost elections and they are trying to gain ground. In fact they lost election to other Madheshi leaders who voted for the constitution. There are social issues that definitely need to be sorted out through strict anti-discriminatory laws and all Nepalis whether from the hills or Terai are in support of such laws. Holding the entire nation hostage and creating a humanitarian crisis for petty differences that could be addressed through constitution amendment is inhuman and unacceptable.

                            Well done Mani Shankar Aiyar, thank you for exposing Modi government's hidden agenda in Nepal. Modi has already damaged relationship with our friendly neighbor and compromised with our security. Modi has also failed to respond to the humanitarian crises that has crippled life in Nepal due to Modi's undeclared blockade of Nepal. As Indians I feel ashamed of this present communal government in India that is trying to inflame communal disharmony in Nepal and causing humanitarian crises in Nepal. We condemn Modi's policy and treatment of Nepal.

                            Thanks to Mr. Mani Shankar Aiyer. Indians salute you for exposing the communal and criminal agenda of the Modi Government in Nepal. Modi government has not only punished the people of Nepal for not submitting to his bully but also compromised with the security of India. Please remember we have an open border with Nepal and it stretches to more than 1500 hundred kilometers. Those fools who support Modi's stance should go to the border and observe for themselves. Modi has done a great damage to India and Nepal by imposing the undeclared economic blockade on Nepal and creating a humanitarian crises which Nepalese will never forgive for generations. I as an Indian condemn the communal politics of BJP and support and salute Nepal for not bowing to Modi government's agenda. Indians have a long historical and religious affinity and relations with Nepal. Modi may not realize that thousands of Nepalese serve in the Indian army. Why is he punishing not only Nepalese but all the Nepalese who serve the Indian army. Modi is famous for his backwaas.. He had told the Nepali speaking Gorkahelse in Darjeeling during the parliament elections that the dream of the gorhalese is his dream. He has forgotten the gorkalese and his own dream after becoming PM, he used those words only to beg votes. No wonder people call him the FEKU PM of India. Shame on those who support communal and criminal elements. Shame on those who disturb the peace and harmony of Nepal.

What is Modi doing to Nepal? Why is the opposition silent when we are creating this mess on our border. We will pay the price for this in the coming generations. Nepal will become friendly with Pakistan and China and we will end up with another hostile neighbor where we could have had a friend. Next we will have terrorists transiting through Nepal into India. <br/><br/>
And all because the Nepalese said they were secular and didnt want our dictation when it came to drafting their constitution?? THis is incredibly silly on our part.

                            Here is a comment from a Nepali. Mani Shankar Aiyer's dislike of Modi aside, there is no denying the fact that the Indian Government's handling of Nepal is a blunder. Why a blunder? Because like Mr. Pawan Kumar Verma said it runs the risk of handing over Nepal to China on a platter. How so? It better come from Indian think tanks and diplomatic pundits rather than from me. The blunder, however, is more on the part of the Indian bureaucracy which rules the roost when it comes to handling Nepal. The Indian Ambassador has always acted as Vice Roy in Nepal with direct access to and strong influence on all key political leaders, including PM and President. Diplomatic protocol has never been applied in Nepal. Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj appears clueless on Nepal. She has certainly not been briefed correctly. Otherwise, how would you account for two grave factual mistakes in her statements in Rajya Sabha: 1) Citizenship by naturalization for Indian daughter-in-laws in Nepal has not been removed in the new constitution as she claimed. The fact is that the exact same clause in the interim constitution has been maintained as is. 2) Nepal promulgated the new constitution hastily in a matter of two days without adequate time for consultations, discussions and debate. The fact is that each and every procedure of the constituent assembly would be very much out in the media. People knew about the understanding between major political parties and a definite timetable for the promulgation was disclosed weeks in advance. It is just that the Indian Ambassador thought that it was still within him to be able to dissuade the key leaders in Nepal. When he realized that it was out of his reach and therefore asked for the Special Envoy of Modi, it was a little too late.

Its a very dangerous step by the current Govt. to even entertain voices of descent in Nepal in India's capital. Over the years our botched foreign policy with our smaller neighbors (in terms of economy and size) has seen India being seen as their enemy than a friend. I would hate to see Nepal turn to nations like Pakistan or China if this continues. Nepal has always been a very good neighbor and it would be really sad to loose that relationships. I hope at least some in the Govt. are able to see past the bs and able to rise above cast/divide politics India is current playing in Nepal.
