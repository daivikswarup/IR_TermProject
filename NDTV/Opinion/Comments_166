                            Fully agree...this disguising of commercial interests behind "helping the poor Indian " campaign is disgusting and used several times earlier by American MNCs...

People who are against this have vested interest. Case in point: aib is protecting it's sponsor's interest.

To all supporters of free internet, give some other free alternative before killing an initiative. Do not be luddites. You are killing many start-ups which will cater to the rural India which do not wish to pay for internet now. They need to know what they are getting before they can decide. In the rush to protect the NSA monitored internet do not kill the facebook monitored one.

                            I don't see any valid reason for this 'Free Basics' bashing other than that it is free(the bashing)! The consumer has the choice to NOT use 'Free Basics' and go ahead and 'spend 50 cents a month for 100 megabytes of unrestricted data access than compromise his freedom and dignity'!

                            What is wrong with you guys? Facebook, as a business, is free to provided a service. You as a consumer are free NOT to use that service. Is FB suggesting that their's will be the ONLY internet service in India? Could you penalize BMW for not building a car for poor? Could Ferrari not build a car that maxed at only 40 km/hr or drove 5km/ltr? What is this nonsense that you guys are perpetuating? A business has a right to bring a service or product to a market till they DON'T stifle competitor's products. You have a right to NOT use that service.<br/><br/>
It would be illegal for FB to restrict access to other packages available in the market. Are they suggesting to do that? How brain dead you guys really are?

                            Something is definitely better than Nothing. Please  don't try to take away from the poor unless you can give them something better.

                            cant this idea be introduced as an optional data plan which only those people has to choose who wants it. everything else for everyone else remains the same.this is not going to be the only bundle plan.various providers would come up with various bundle plans.let bundle plans be used by those who makes limited use of internet or who is being introduced to internet.They should always have an option to move out of it.<br/>
           "Free" is making the plan more confusing, charging a nominal fee would define the the boundary and bring more clarity. <br/>
           There are many who thinks there is no use of internet in their lives,and they are right, but introducing them to internet can atleast connect them to updates in govt policies which they can make timely use of.Slowly they can find use of it the way it profits them ,and can also move out of the bundle plan.<br/>
           The problems would start if service providers makes it mandatory to take up the bundle etc or when corruption creeps in with service providers getting paid unaccounted to get in the bundle :) .TRAI should be the bottle neck not the service providers. <br/>
           It is not just India which has people not connected to internet, other countries whether developed or not, has their own set of internet illiterate people, either they have no use of it in their daily lives or they simply dont understand how it works , it is not a problem , it is their choice.With facilities provided,whether to swim or not is one's choice.But while learning to swim in the small swimming pool,one should be aware of the vast sea out there.<br/>
          India deserves better,but if it decides to move in this direction of internet literacy, it has to start somewhere i.e it has to take the first step(a cautious and well thought of one).
