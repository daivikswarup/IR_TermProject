                            The islamic terrorist groups mentioned in this article ae all `benevolent' islamic terrorist groups i.e they operate under the aegis of the pakistani deep state and some have funding from elements in beduinistan. The pakistani corrupt ruling elites will act against these jihadi islamic terrorists beacuse they are terrified of what the USA can do to their gravy train. But there are serious risks of civil war in pakistan, with breakaway sections of the military, if comprehensive action against these islamic terrorists is undertaken. Pakistan will have to be dismantled and balkanized.

                            Very practical and realistic assessment. Hope Ms. Nidhi (Razdan) reads this carefully. It will help her.

                            These views have been expressed by a number of Pakistani writers in the past but it has had no effect on the Pakistani state particularly its army which sees an existential threat the moment friendship with India is revived. Whatever the actions of the Pakistani state vis-a-vis Masood Azhar let us have zero expectations on the final outcome because as the writer has enunciated the complications within Pakistan on terror are extremely difficult to unravel largely because of a gory history of supporting terrorists to further the Pakistani state's intentions of creating trouble in both India and Afghanistan which ultimately came back to hurt Pakistan with its own people the unintended victims. BOTTOM LINE - INDIA SHOULD HAVE NO EXPECTATIONS WHATSOEVER, THIS IS THE STARK REALITY, THE PAKISTANI ARMY AND THE ISI IS NOT GOING TO MEND ITS WAYS, it is like asking a leopard to change its spots.

Delusions of grandeur, friend! Pakistan is an ideological failure and has no basis to exist. This was re-inforced with the defeat of the pakistan military and the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971. may or may not realize but your response admits the islamic terrorists in pakistan operate under the aegis of the failed and bankrupt pakistani state. Your islamic dream is actually a nightmare. Wake up!
