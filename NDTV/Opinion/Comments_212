                            Here  Kareem Abdul Jabbar has not suggested any  solution for curbing Islamic terrorism. At least Trump will surely stop American funding of terrorism under the guise of helping rebels. Why do Kareem wants to influence the voters. Let the people use their free will.

                            If America has to survive, it has to get rid of muslims and their orthodox religion. India is facing many problems because of these people. You can't live peacefully till these people stop supporting terrorism.

                            Everyone everywhere needs to chill a bit and figure out ways of living peacefully. Yes, it requires love for fellow human beings (and all living things). At the very least tolerance. Somehow, the world (and us, Indians) is getting confused and going about this the stupid way. Violence and war and the same old "basic" reasons of conflict from time immemorial. <br/><br/>
I thought Indians can show the world the "proper" way... but sadly, we are headed in the same route, no?

                            You could replace Trump with Modi in the article, and it would still make sense.

                            Dear NDTV, It would be great if could cover stories from Indian villages. You don't need to go so far as United States to find stories, that too irrelevant ones.

                            Kareem is the most ignorant player NBA ever had and could not add 2+2 and lost everything before he left NBA and I am surprised to his response ? Who wrote it for him ? Some liberal papers ! How come he is quiet about IS and their killing destruction and babarism ?

                            America has already a road map of new world order  in place. Breaking of U.S.S.R. paved the way for U. S. to  establish their supremacy in world affairs . Now in Trump America  has appropriate candidate to go aggressively for enjoying benefit of new aquired monopoly of power . World has already experienced the destruction in terms of blood sheds and growing animosity (in the name of numerous reasons in various civilisation ) in all over world has always some/all role of U.S.. Keeping in account all the ever adopted tendency of America one can easily anticipate the grim future for the rest of the world as a unannounced world empire ( UNITED STATE OF AMERICA ) is ready to take on who so ever come in their way of this so called NEW WORLD ORDER.

                            Response to Amit " what the point of publishing this in India". In case you have not noticed Amit, India has its fair share of politician with the Trump's mindset.
