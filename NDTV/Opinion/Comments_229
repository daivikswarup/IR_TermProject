                            Dear Prof. Sujatha, tax payers' money is spent to educate students and not to create unruly mob. Let the students study and not indulge in anti national activities. If these things continue, the day is not far away when people turn against all aided universities. Please behave responsibly and teach good values to students.

                            Professor Sujatha the way you have summed up your observation that education system in India is collapsing due to political pressure and that "defenceless JNU" students are being targeted is very saddening. Entire country saw what was happening in name of culture festival in JNU campus and professors like you taking sides of those vary students who were involved in spreading hatred for there own country. Is this JNU ideology to breed anti national elements and who are just following the agenda to spread talk separatism. India is democratic country and people have right to speech freedom of expression and have every right to have opinion. But I believe your institution has taken this freedom for granted and that's why you seem to be oblivious with fact that your students are working for Bharat ki Barbadi and praising Pakistan who is hell bent to jeopardise our nation's security. Had you and your so called defenceless students were in some other country and tried to something similar than all of you would have been out in jail without questions asked. You should thank indian system tolerance that you and remaining students are still walking free and you posting such opinions.  You and those JNU students who were involved in these anti social activities must be striped of indian citizenship and put behind bars. I am professional working for Indian MNC and posted outside India alongwith my other staff members Very firmly believe that indian government should come up with harshest laws to curb sedation and anti national activities.

I suppose you people want to encourage that in your ivory towers of JNU. Those who keep poisoneous snakes in their backyards, will be responsible when the snakes bite their own children to death.

                            As a 66year old with some experience of being a teacher and researcher in a good university I would like to record my uneasiness with the news coverage of politics in Universities.<br/><br/>
1. Students are in a University to study and teachers are to teach.  Teachers in fairness should present all the sides of any issue whether of evolution of species or of nationalism or universalism. Universities that have leftist or rightist academic/student bodies (JNU vs say IIMs) are doing disservice to the business of studying  the world.<br/><br/>
2. None of them have experience of being politicians. That is, of making useful compromises. Just being theoretical gets no one anywhere. Where are he student leaders of the 1969 Paris revolts or the Kent State University? <br/><br/>
3. Lets ensure that students study, when any student comes to a post-grad institution, he/she is prepared for academic (at times cold) rigour and teachers do research or teach. Real world activities (involving intellectual compromise) be done outside the academe.<br/><br/>
4. I recall many heated discussions with my students which left no scars on us. Why does it happen in these storied Universities?

                            "...political activism is important to socialise youth to become responsible citizens. Skill development and technological education alone will only produce automatons. The experience of the rich and prosperous middle-eastern economies, and those of East Asia, where high incomes, smart cities and technological sophistication have been achieved without parallel efforts in building an intellectual culture, gender equality or democratic practice is indicative of what happens when the focus is only on economic growth and technology. In fact, such intellectual and cultural vacuum in a situation of material wealth is likely to breed fundamentalism. If we clamp down on youth activism, plurality of opinion and debate, then there would be no insight or creativity." This is actually untrue, in the Middle East the opposite is true. Also, just look at The US and UK. There the students concentrate on skill development and technology education and becomd very successful in life. This professor's agenda is to brainwash students with left-wing politics. It is not necessary to politicise all education. In my opinion she is a danger to true education.

Their anger, although wrongly, was directed at an individual. The recent deplorable celebrations did not call for destroying the nation. If you think these are similar, then God save the country.

                            As citizens we should trust the State, and in the name of democracy and freedom of speech need not indulge in strong remarks, particularly when occupying responsible positions. Rather than straight away assuming anti-government stance just because it is not in consonance of fundamental atmosphere at JNU, it would be appropriate to influence students to calm down, handle the matter on evidence and legality through interface with Government, if not satisfied then approach the Judiciary. One should appreciate the good aspects of the same Central Government also. It has been able to deliver corruption-free governance, launched laudable social sector initiatives, working towards 'One Nation One Market' in Agriculture, activating manufacturing and reviving Industrial growth, Improvements in Defence sector, working actively to skill the youth and encourage entrepreneurial aspects etc. When the macro, significant national issues are progressing on good lines, then we should ensure that such incidents are not magnified beyond a limit to waste precious time and energy of vital elements of the Government and act as a hurdle in momentum of development.

Afzal Guru was punished following the due process of law for an terror act. Organizing events in his support itself is Sedition and additionally we should also slap "Contempt of Court" charges.

                            As is being advised by the writer, inquiry is underway. If the arrested student leader has indeed raised anti-india slogans, then he will have a chance to explain why he did so. But a person who lives on subsidy being provided by the country with tax payers money has no conceivable reason to raise slogans against the country. Secondly, every democratic country permits freedom and gives space to groups to vent their frustations if any. Thirdly, if these groups in JNU had such strong feelings about Afzal Guru and Maqbool Bhatt, they should have approached the proper forum like the Judicial Courts, etc when they still had time. And Prof. Sujatha appears to have become incoherent in her blog since she starts with the current incident in JNU and has meandered to unrelated topics like treatment of women in our society, paucity of teachers, toilets, etc and giving advice to Ministry of HRD regarding providing facilities to educational institutions all over the country. So, can she further enlighten the tax paying public whether the anti-national slogans were raised in support of persons who were hanged between last year and couple of decades back or for lack of toilets and other facilities in educational institutions across the country?

                            The JNU drama reflects on couple of things, like the upbringing of these people at their homes and their parents and the education level provided by the teachers. <br/>
It is the failure on the part of the parents and the teachers to inculcate the love for ones motherland.<br/>
I for one would say give him a one way ticket to which ever Islamic country he and his parents want to go to and cancel his Indian citizenship.<br/>
The JNU leaders parents had the opportunity to migrate to Pakistan at the time of partition, but chose to stay behind but have never accepted India as their motherland.<br/>
The teachers are equally responsible as the students.

From the opinion of Prof. Sujatha, it's evident that professors are key culprit in moulding anti-social thinkings wihtin students with tax-payers hard earned money. Prof. Sujatha and all professorts - Please help to build the nation, students' career in your hands.  This is a nation proudly mentions the name of professors like Dr. B.R.

                            Violence and slogans to incite hatred against a nation (Bharat ki barbadi tak jung karenge jung karenge) is not something that comes from defenseless students!! There is always an option to ignore such activities. They have right to protest Afzal Guru's hanging and even Kashmiri rights. But they have not right to incite people to take down India. The same democratic India who taxpayers paid for their education. Campuses are for free thought &amp; ideas but not platforms from which violence is generated. It's for betterment of society not it's "barbadi". India is probably only place in world where students are used by parties for gaining political mileage. I am sure CPI(M) &amp; political bosses of SFI, AISF are very happy to use these as tools to gain mileage in an era where they are increasingly being pushed out by the electorate. Would such things be allowed in their ideological havens like China or Soviet Russia? Please do not take advantage of this peace loving nation &amp; it's taxpayers who have been providing for these rabble-rousers. Nothing positive has come out of them.

As a concerned professor, why did you not take any action against the students who put up posters all across the univ well before the event.<br/>
As a concerned prof do you consider a ruling by the Supreme Court of India to be unjustified and definitely encourage students to shout out anti national slogans.  Cannot believe that the concerned professors of JNU are not aware of who these students are.  Why are they protecting them if they feel that the innocent have been incorrectly arrested give the names of the guilty - unless they themselves are anti national. Also is it not the duty of the professors to pre-empt the ramifications of such actions and counsel the students well before rather than encourage them.<br/>
As a very concerned professor why was the sloganeering not nipped in the bud or do you consider that as freedom of speech.  How ill informed and uneducated you are.... Sad that students are guided by such narrow minded teachers who have no iota of what goes on beyond their four walls and are absolutely unable to give a mature perspective to student angst.

                            The Left has had control of a number of academic and cultural institutions in India for a long time and dictated the curricula and syllabi, not to mention authoring of text books. This has ensured that only a certain viewpoint, or a certain version was available and made to look like the gospel truth. At the same time, they also ensured that opposing or alternate viewpoints did not find a legitimate space and were eased or hounded out. With the emergence of the Right in a position of power, they are unfortunately using the same draconian and stupid tactics. Let Universities and colleges first be temples of real learning and open to multiple viewpoints. Second, let them remain free of the pernicious effects of organised politics- Kerala and Bengal bear witness to the deterioration of education thanks to such partisan and often brutal, politics in colleges. Third, the state too should take a chill pill and refrain from using charges of sedition etc on those who offer opposing viewpoints. There are other ways to tackle dissent than using other student thugs, or brute police force or the draconian provisions of archaic, British era laws

These are grown up adults who know what they are doing and what will be the consequence. The university aided by Governemnet funding is to enable it to produce high quality intellectuals who can help in Country's growth. But whats happening is otherwise they are breeding anti national elements in the name of ideology. Left ideology is a sacred one it does not support traitors in any way. This is a country where Afzal guru had a chance to defend himself for 10  long years , would this have happened in communist ruled countries or the kanagroo courts held by maoists in certain placed in India.There are so many matters in India which requires attention and help from the Elite students of JNU, instead choosing such anti national elements topic is an example of the lowest level of politics JNU students are stooping to.

                            It's not only deeply regrettable but to be denounced by all civilised means that educated professors support these completely misguided youth becoming a threat to national integrity and sovereignty  first and foremost the politics should take their hands and the law should take its course for what ever punishment it needs for a clear case of sedition

                            Imagine, you all are wasting money of every tax payer in this country. You cant go on and support all the terrorists who are planning to destroy this country. It is a weird alliance in JNU: Students who dont want to study+teachers who want to arm twist administration and government. So, both of them celebrate when things like these happen there. I really wonder How many of you attend classes regularly. the whole India know that you people do not attend classes in the name of 'freedom to move around'. You shout at anyone and call them fascist and imperialist just because you dont like her/him. And by end of your five year subsidised stay in JNU you have contributed to slowing down this country rather than uplifting the poor. Does anyone has the guts to show your attendance certificate from school? Colossal waste of national resources !

                            @Anonymous: it is time to remove BJP and RSS to be rulers of India. The faster it it , the better for India. They are becoming idiots in the name of development , but Indian economy is going down day by day. The facts of Indian economy is not clear.
