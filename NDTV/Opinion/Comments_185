                            Very good column with a wacky humour to boot, enjoyed reading it besides walking is good for the body and interacting with strangers is good for the mind, though news readers and television anchors would find it a tad bit difficult to do so because of their easily recognizable faces the 'stranger quotient' being one way.

                            Such a nice read - mainly because it represents the feelings of so many of us. <br/><br/>
Whenever I first read some comments about this scheme in its early days It felt like it is such a bad experiment. But after seeing the reaction of my friends and colleagues - who I thought would hate the inconvenience of leaving their cars behind - I was really pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>
It seems that most people who had most negative comments on the even-odd scheme are actually those who don't even live in Delhi. <br/><br/>
The best thing that we got from this, is the assurance that Delhiites do care.

                            Nice article NDTV. For a change nice to read an article of human interest and that too without any political bias.

                            Having an affair with public transport? Well the pollution in Delhi seems to lead to strange bedfellows.

                            Sunetra, we have so much foreign exchange currency by saving precious hydro carbon in the process as a austerity measure. The commoner's are feeling their share of oxygen is safe and cannot be looted by prosperous. Thank God the process of bringing benefits to ordinary citizen has started. Now, we can expect ban on huge s.u.v.s . Don't forget we also get roasted by heat generated by air conditioners  in the summer on daily basis.

                            Beautifully written. This piece has its heart in the right place. Meeting and interacting with new people has become very rare today. If its the odd-even rule that is making it possible, then we need to appreciate every bit of it.

                            Very nice! Now, can Kejriwal do something about public transport so that people feel like using it all the time instead of having to do this odd-even stuff? Why is it that middle class citizens always have to 'accommodate' instead of public services and governments doing something for them? Odd-even is at best a success 'of' the common citizen, not of the government by any means ... infrastructure building will be a success of the Government. And for God's sake, make it 'apolitical' and a broad movement, something like swacch bharat.

                            Glad that the citizens of Delhi gave it a genuine shot. I am told the usual jugaad factor was missing, and people adapted in letter and spirit. I use the Delhi metro extensively and I am many more can do so. Felt, culturally, most people in Delhi, dont like to use public tpt.
