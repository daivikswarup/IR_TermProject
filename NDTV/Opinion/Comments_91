                            Shameless people. When MMS started the talk with Pakistan they said he was not strong and patriotic. Shame on all the politicians. There is only one set of people who can be lower than these politician;the with a brain smaller than Ant and their ego bigger than elephants the blind supporters of any political party. You guys will own blood of democracy on your hand. You people deserve to live under some exotic king and Sony deserve democracy. Slaves!!!

                            Modi represents India. Not himself. Hope you blind-bhakts realize that. <br/><br/>
Besides, there needs to be our flag and national anthem and a 24 gun salute when he lands. <br/><br/>
you would never understand the value of those because none of you guys fought for them. <br/><br/>
if you dont agree, check how the flag was hoisted upside down with Modi in the frame as well as how disrespected the anthem in Russia. <br/><br/>
I am not even going to mention the possible steel coup because it would make it too apparent that I hate that he is our PM. Looks like a thug with that trimmed beard!

                            I would prefer that PM of india should speak like a PM in sober language instead of PROFANE and VULGAR RHETORIC.you can criticize people but the language and polity must prevail.<br/>
Mr. modi spoke in Kabul against Pakistan in a caustic way among AFGHAN parliament like KEJRIWALL as jat knows no better unlike of PM.Mr.nwab sharif has never spoken against INDIA or Modi like that!LALU , KEJRIWAL should not be the example MR. modi follow , he should be following world leaders and class. in public,the sobriety and gace must prevail above all , no matter how much scthing attack you make.<br/>
after that NAWAB SHARIF invited him to his house and treated him with warm friendly cordial welcome must have PUT MR. MODI INTO SHAME !!! AS AN INDIAN,living in USA, I strongly feel that MODI SHOULD PERSONALLY APOLOGISE TO MR. NAWAB SHARIF FOR THAT. It's not easy to be PM in Pakistan and the more he would bash NAWAB SHARIF ,the more MODI will loose the ground as it happened in BIHAR. MODI LOST IN BIHAR FOR THE MUDSLINGING VILLAGE STYLE REHTORIC SPEECHES!<br/>
IF HE SIMPLY SAID "BJP would develop Bihar and uplift your living status";it would have worked like magic instead THEY SHOED BJP AWAY ! NO MATTER HOW POOR AND BACKWARD IS BIHAR,THEY HAVE SENSE THE SENSE BEING INSULTED!<br/>
I must mention that I have listened to ALL THE POLITICAL SPEECHES OF  PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE IN US CONGRESS FOR 30 YRS(hard drive TB FULL OF WORLD LEADERS) BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD THIS MUDSLINGING AND PERSONAL ATTACK IN USA because public are very much educated and never like that. Some times off the cufff remarks are made by few, AMERICANS toe them out ! what happens in Indian parliament is a laughable CIRCUS PARTY !! INDIA IS  CIVILIZED OR NOT  WILL BE DETERMINED BY THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR!

                            There had been nothing that prevented the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan meeting one another. It had always been possible for the Prime Minister of India to meet his counterpart in Pakistan and vice versa and the time, venue and duration of the meeting of such meetings have always been decided with their mutual consents. This time, they decided to introduce a surprise element into it with an obvious view to create a sensation about it.  Then, where is the question of extraordinary brilliance of seizing an opportunity that came out of the blue?

                            Dear Mr. Nalin Kohli, i must remind your position on Pakistan when you were in opposition. Even during the Lok sabha election campaign, you people have lambasted the UPA on Ind-Pak relations. (1)When our jawans are being killed on border, how can we talk to the terrorist state? (2) untill terrorism from Pakistan doesn't stop, we should talk to them. (3)Our jawans are being killed on border and UPA Home Minister is serving Biryani to Pak envoy. etc. There are lot of comments to be said. Amit Shah's comment during Bihar election and sadhvis and swamis are telling anything they like to. But what changed the mind of Modi towards Pakistan? Why he became lamb from Lion? Pakistan ko unke he tareeke se jawwab dena hoga. Pakistan ko yeh love letter likhna bandh karo. What the clear example of double standard. Modi has lost the trust of the sensible people of India. He is followed only by Blind Bhakts.

                            I agree with Mr Kohli. Opposition spokespersons come across as being lost for words in their response to these gestures of the govt towards Pakistan. They keep harping on the fact that they dont see a roadmap. In my view its this govt's prerogative whether or not it reveals the roadmap at this stage. <br/>
Personally I think having a point of contact with the Pakistani army had been a drawback of this engagement process which seems to have been addressed by having an army general as the Pak NSA. A more coherent roadmap is now possible since this govt would now be better aware of the Pak army's point of view and not just that of the civilian govt. Its important that neither the civilian nor the military arm of the govt should be seen to be losing face if these talks are to go anywhere

                            lot of Pappu Chamcha's trolling. Chamcha's / Chelas can never understand this masterstroke. As far as Kargil is concerned, it was due to a war monger Musharaff and Nawaz himself was caught unawares. And for LOC after Saree exchange, Pakistan has never cried fowl after such a strong retaliation by the Indian Army. Such strong reciprocal response can only happen under BJP and "chelas / chamchas" will never understand or acknowledge it, because the party of appeasers (congi) has never cared for India, and had been selling india's soul to fill personal coffers.

                            Very wisely written article by Mr Kohli which deserves all praise and appreciation and puts to shame all those anti national congress elements who have been so critical of this great feet of Modi diplomacy.
