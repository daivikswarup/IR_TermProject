                            Aiyer addresses all his hate mail to Modi. Who never bothers to respond. Now Aiyer wants him to respond to Aamir Khan! I mean, really does the Prime Minister have no other work than to respond to various inanities? Here Aiyer analyses various statements reportedly made by Aamir to show that he was a patriotic nationalist non-violent Indian muslim who has been unfairly targeted for using his freedom of expression. What he forgot was that none of this ruckus would have happened if Aamir had kept his mouth shut on controversial issues. As they say, discretion is the best part of valour. Which applies as much to Aiyer as to Aamir.

On the intolerance though he has to ask Aamir and others who support his uttenance (e.g; Javed Akhtar) and others who have divorced their first and duly married wives? What was the reason? "Intolerance". When Intolerance is at home, who can stop it in the streets? And what about 1984 - the Intolerance of Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress against the Sikhs - one of the bravest in our country (50%^ of them are in the Armed Forces fighting for our country). Intolerance has been an integral aspect of our lives and our politicians are the worst to take advantage of the situation to fan the fire. If Mani had realied this, he would not sit down to pen his biased thoughts.

The issues Aamir has raised may be relevant but need to be raised at the right level of the state governments. What does Modi have to do what gets discussed in a media event which is not even a formal platform. If you are representing the citizens please guide them to the right departments. For a change write a blog on something more real i.e. Climate Change. And if you do please note that advise on solutions and don't point fingers to the PM again.

                            "Bollywood has always preserved us from the poison of Hindutva"<br/><br/>
Wake up you moron. Bollywood is nothing but people who get paid to act, not some social champions or patriots who need to be taken seriously which also includes you btw..

                            Poor chap Mani. NDTV is the only web site that patronises his blogs. Where else can he vomit his poison out?The sting after the 44/540 marks he got for his stinging chaiwala remark is still hurting him. Writing caustic remarks about Modi is Burnol for him

                            Who is Aamir Khan. He is what we public made his out. Majority Indians like me give a damn hoot about Intolerance. We only want development of the country and not to play religious politics or belittle Our Country in foreign countries. Let us grow up and remove the dirt from our minds.

                            But what is Aamir Khan?<br/>
A philosopher,thinker,educationist,scientist<br/>
He barely completed school<br/>
He is only a entertainer and yes he is superb in his job<br/>
So who cares what he and his wife discusses<br/>
Mr no-nonsense has become a non sense or may be he is again entertaining us <br/>
His wife wants to move out or stay or leave him (like his earlier wife) is entirely their own disitions

                            Mr. MSA, at least show some respect to Hnrble. PM of the very country you live in. Your first question shows the kind of mentality you have and your approach towards Mr. Modi. If you are looking for problems ONLY, then you will see them everywhere. If you try to find solution, well, we definitely have system for constructive solution. What surprises more is, since May 2014, I haven't read even a single article from you acknowledging (let alone praising) work done by Indian government. So you are saying, since last 18 months, nothing (and I mean absolutely NOTHING) good has happened? GROW UP................

                            Mani Shankar Aiyar, why don't you just change your surname to 'Khan', and then continue your anti-Hindu jibes and statements. I am sure we will understand you better then. Your continuous diatribe against all things 'pro-Hindu' betray your true nature and belief. Everyone is aware of the actors 'KHAN' anti BJP motions, and their alliance to Congress (similar to you in all ways...). Stop preaching your nonsense, and go to a country which will tolerate your non-sense (i.e., Pakistan).

BUT that does not mean that he has the understanding, or the right to make a comment on a public platform - very well knowing that this will light a fire... He has full right to make comments in his private life - but when it comes to a public forum - he has to be careful... and now that he has said it - WHERE IS HE? why is there a barrage of other personalities defending him - he has gone into hiding... !!!!!<br/><br/>

He has other things to concentrate at, I expect u to work sometime in ur office or better yet to understand the works of Modi rather than supporting an idiot who tried to play smart. Hasn't he seen nirbhaya case ? Hasn't he seen the issues during congress regime ? When he felt safe by then he should be much safer now ! So please mind ur business !

                            This is what is said by Aamir Khan - Supporting his religion -<br/><br/>
"A person holding a Quran and killing people, he may feel is doing an Islamic act, but as a Muslim I don't feel he is doing an Islamic act....I am very clear that a person who is killing innocents is not a Muslim. He may claim to be a Muslim, but we should not recognize him as that. He is a terrorist and we should recognize him as a terrorist".<br/><br/>
When his wife told about 'intolerance' why did he not say that "those who do these acts of violence are not Indians". Quite strange how religion has been owned and country has been disowned by Mr. Khan.
