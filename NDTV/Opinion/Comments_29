Journalist doesn't mean impunity from playing politics with situation for their masters because they employ to do act motivated to support their masters political ideologies. <br/>
Second Government is handling this issue to surface the truth before nation and debate what exactly going on in Jawaharlal Nehru University and who are sponsoring perverted ideologies. Government wants that this issue of Communist sponsored anti-national and separatist agenda remain Major National News Headline  to embarrassment and humiliation for Communist Parties and Congress JDU kind of parties. BJP strategy is working on ground as majority of Indians don't know about Communism and their hidden agenda are surprising witness communist and terrorist are on same side. This is advantage BJP at this stage and this will continue until elections in Kerla and West Bangal.

Do you all remember the beef controversy, youth who never ate beef wanted to eat it just for the sake of being part of the crowd, setting aside their inner belief. Yes, each individual is free to chose his/her actions BUT the same individual seems to be making silly decisions just to be part of their larger group of friends. Looking at videos, when pro-Afzal slogans were shouted, few were just lost like where did that slogan come from, but continued just to be in the crowd! Youth needs to wake up, think what they do and then action on it.

                            Dear Rana Ayub, it could very well be a youthful error yet, it is a slogan against the country and needs to be investigated. Organizations like ISIS, Alquaida were also started with slogans from somebody. Middle east unrest and Civil wars started with a slogan from one that has gone on for past 5+ years. So, as a responsible Citizen, we need to investigate the roots of the slogan and ensure that it will not cause unrest within the society. I hope you would read this and understand the message and support the same as a responsible citizen of India.

No Doubt, This being such an emotive issue every one's passions will be raised. <br/><br/>
If you just forget according to your convenience what happened at JNU, and blame just the reactions, you are being unfair to a major part of our society who believe what happened at JNU was wrong, and the treatment they got should have been much more worse to set an example to others.

                            This is what is called selective outrage and selective journalism. The writer mentions points which she feels suitable for her version of thoughts. She again forgets that all this is fallout of the anti-india activities that were going in the campus on the name of free speech. Each time these self declared 'secularists' and upholders of 'peace' concentrate on the later part of an event, but conveniently forget the events leading up to the situation. <br/>
She mentions that the "most Left liberal intellectuals, academics, activists condemned it in the harshest words". But fails to cite any proof of that in this article, while giving selected statements by BJP as a proof to drive her point. I have watched 4 to 5 discussions on various channels including the ones she mentions in this article. And NOT ONCE did any of the left leaning commentators has condemned these anti-national activities in 'harshest' of the words as she says. Each of these 'intellectuals' have mainly talked about how its is freedom of speech and the government should allow students to put forth their thought even though they talk about destroying India. <br/>
NDTV has been crying for the last 2 days in all its shows about how once of their reporter was beaten up. Some select journalists also took out a march in protest of this 'goondaism'. But why did they conveniently forgot to take a march against the anti-national activities is anybody guess. <br/>
So dear writer. Please STOP taking moral high ground on all issues and if you want respect for your thoughts and ideas, please first try and respect others thoughts and ideas. If giving 'anti-india' slogans is freedom of speech then Sambit asking to say 'Bharat mata ki Jai' is also freedom of speech.

Whether Afzal Guru was a terrorist, guilty of plotting to attack Parliament and related issues are within the jurisdiction of our police and courts. They are NOT issues to be agitated upon by university students, and definitely not on campus. Go outside and do it. The problem is that outside the campus nobody cares two hoots for these self proclaimed activists. And every issue in the article attributed to so called Hindutva and RSS activists are allegations of threats. Nobody was killed. Compare that with what happened during the various Mumbai blasts and other terrorist activities in Kashmir and elsewhere and you get the picture.

This is absolutely unacceptable on the part of the JNU students and they shall be dealt with as per the law of the land. Now coming to your biased and myopic views on what's right and what's not ... We have seen enough of that evidence wherein you shout where there is no substance to back your argument. The very youth that had voted for Modi is happy and can see the evil designs of so called secular parties trying to create problems just before the parliament sessions. We understand we shall deal with that as well. So, chill a get a life.

The larger question.Does the JNU have a very deeply communist ideology with a very leftist curricula and is there bias towards communists while selecting faculty?.Does a university which gets free monies be used by a certain political ideology as its own bastion?

Being an alumnus of a university of the same pedigree as JNU , I can very easily identify who are real students and who are there to make nuisance. Many of those guys shouting "India ki barbadi tak ...." look well into their 30s. No sure what kind of research takes so much of time.<br/>
Its high time that universities should be declared as a sacrosanct place and ONLY education should be promoted over there.<br/>

                            Rana Ayyub conveniently you ignored many things. YOu just focusing on how BJP or Police or Lawyers behaved after this incident. Can I ask simple question. Forget about Gilani or Guru these all studets says they were not involved in slogans lets agree to that point for a while but when anti Indian slogans were shouted what these CPM patriots were doing their hands were tied? what hold them from stopping those slogans ?<br/><br/>
I think your cry on how BJP police behaved is really look irrelevant freedom of speech can not be up to that extent. <br/>
Off course Nathuram was bad and these guys celebrate him is worst but they don't sing and anti national or split India slogans over there. There can be difference of Ideology Many follows Mahatma Gandhi many dont but with that they dont harm India. But these slogans in universities yes it does harm in India.<br/><br/>
Don't be opportunistic I know some time going against the public sentiment gives publicity but this is something serious. We grow up singing Vande Mataram in our schools and colleges what bad happen to these guys suddenly they coming with this ideology ? <br/>
Is it just a political stunt to get early publicity and in to main stream as I thuoght over every possible things but dont find a reason. You getting a free education funded by tax payers of India getting every possible comfort compare small time villager can get in India. What made you sing these songs of dark ? I would have liked if someone come up with this analysis. This really concerns me.

There are millions of youth who feel insulted not by govt's handling but by what the youth of JNU have done. <br/>
The fact is JNU has history of such events, only that the previous govt's decided not to take notice, reasons known to them only. Everyone is conviniently talking about how the govt. bungled, no one wants to talk of the root cause of all this. <br/>
All experts like you and ofcourse politicians of all parties have so many adverse opinions about the govt action, it would be in the right spirit if you could have some advise for the "youth of JNU als" Please voice your suggestions to JNU also to avoid such unpleasant events

What is the right of the people of our great country. We still have lots and lots of problem to deal with, most importantly 'Poverty'. Enough of problems and its analysis, can these so called Nationalist speak about solutions. Can we be a bit more creative towards our society. There are long standing historical issues of injustice and equity in this country. We still witness homeless people dying of hunger and at the same time have super rich people showing off everything money can buy. We still have average citizens of this great country desperately trying to get a loan for his/her dire needs and at the same time have rich citizens not paying back bank loans. We Have Enough Of Problems but no solutions. When the western world laughs at us, still think we are snake charmers land. We must develop strong characters and stop behaving like fools. This is our time to develop as a economy and as a society and I don't think that the foundation of our republic is that weak. Let us not get persuaded by what Neta's and Abhinetas says or what our real time media reports. There's a lot of work in hand we all have to deliver to make our country the Best. And please stop thinking of any ideology, institution, or our political class represents our great nation. Time is important stop wasting it.

For one, had Kanhiayya Kumar shown balance in his approach as a responsible student leader, he would have been at odds with his masters who sustain him. The reaction however condemnable was spurred by politicians (who until now defended it as freedom of speech) and the paid media are no less at fault. Today it's the lawyers; tomorrow it will be the masses who will demand right to lynching. It's time we balanced our responsibility as a citizen and a social duty to our countrymen and perform the tasks we are ordained to do keeping in mind the hsitorical legacy of this country.

And what ever violence happened is all because of Modi, RSS and BJP. It has always been the case. So once we get rid of the popular mandate govt, Ms Rana and cohorts can write more articles and dance on streets and invite Mr Hafiz to JNU for a special lectures and sessions.

She again forgets that all this is fallout of the anti-india activities that were going in the campus on the name of free speech. Each time these self declared 'secularists' and upholders of 'peace' concentrate on the later part of an event, but conveniently forget the events leading up to the situation. <br/>
She mentions that the "most Left liberal intellectuals, academics, activists condemned it in the harshest words". But fails to cite any proof of that in this article, while giving selected statements by BJP as a proof to drive her point. I have watched 4 to 5 discussions on various channels including the ones she mentions in this article. And NOT ONCE did any of the left leaning commentators has condemned these anti-national activities in 'harshest' of the words as she says. Each of these 'intellectuals' have mainly talked about how its is freedom of speech and the government should allow students to put forth their thought even though they talk about destroying India. <br/>
NDTV has been crying for the last 2 days in all its shows about how once of their reporter was beaten up. Some select journalists alos took out a march in protest of this 'goondaism'. But why did they conveniently forgot to take a march against the anti-national activities is anybody guess. <br/>
So dear writer. Please STOP taking moral high ground on all issues and if you want respect for your thoughts and ideas, please first try and respect others thoughts and ideas. If giving 'anti-india' slogans is freedom of speech then Sambit asking to say 'Bharat mata ki Jai' is also freedom of speech.

By the same vein Ms. Rana should not object to what Pravin Togadia or Sakshi Maharaj speak abhorrent stuff. She would be on all channel if one of the Hindu leader speak about the minority community. Why is there a call for action in those cases and not in this. If students stop focusing on learning and indulge in anti-national activity, it is important for teachers to correct and help them getting informed. However the teachers leaning on to the Leftist ideology would fuel this and turn these students into Maoists. I think it is time for Government to take strict action and re-consider funding such institutions. Place like JNU can get students to pay for all this nonsense.

Everyday morning, the Leftist AAP supporters with a Gandhi Cap, stand in front of a mirror and praise themselves. They  must read and learn more and realize the truth. The internet offers vast information. Please try to verify the following facts in the net (1) The British East India Company was a Pvt Ltd Co owned by opium traders (2) In the beginning of 19th century, China was richest in the world followed by India (3) The Europeans sold opium forcefully in China. The opium dens were used to opitae the civilians. In India the opium cultivation by force created many famines. (4) At that time India never faced any malnutrition or famine. The cows used to be more than the human population. Also the rich vegetation and forests of the sub continent was able to provide sustenance for more than one lakh tigers and its herbivorous preys. Now the tigers total just around 2500. Due to the acute food shortage during 1960's, the Govt under Lal Bahadur Shastri started Green revolution and milk revolution. The green revolution destroyed vast areas of forest land and wiped out the indigeneous seeds of food grains. The milk revolution helped to eliminate the desi cows. The desi cows give A2 milk instead of the toxic A1 milk by hybrid cows (5) CIA was instrumental in installing Mao in China. The Chinese revolution was planned and executed by agencies in USA. The Chinese did NOT eat dogs till Mao's "great leap forward". Mao's Great Famine was the most Devastating man-made catastrophe in which at least 45 million people were starved, beaten, tortured or worked to death. Princeling is the word for the fake intellectals or Revolutionary families of China who had falsely and forcefully indoctrinated the hapless and drug addicted Chinese population (6) The Indian National Congress was started  by the British as a safety valve after the 1857 uprising. Almost all leaders of INC were Empire loyalists. (7) Nobody cares about the demand for a seperate state status for jammu and Ladakh, considred as colonies of Kashmir due to the stupid Article 370. The Union Territory status for Ladakh was a long-standing demand. So the best solution is to make Kashmir a buffer state like Bhutan or a guarded neutrality similar to Switzerland and then grant statehood or UT status for jammu and Ladakh
