                            You sure are one heck of an actor, there is no doubt about it. Your perfromance would do justice to the chracter as well but PLEASE PLEASE dont succumb into writing or any other mode of talking about it. Stay focused and let Indians enjoy your brilliant performance even in future. Temptation of trying your hand on writing could be lethal and you would invite more flack for no rhyme or reason. Very best luck for movie.

                            Manoj Bajpai- you are a fabulous actor. Kudos to you for essaying the role, I can't wait to watch the movie and your performance . Agree with everything you said except 1 bit- being gay is not a preference, it is an orientation. Just like people are born left or right handed, similarly people are hetero, gay, bi or trans.

                            I am sure SRK, salman, ranbir or others wouldnt even dare to take up such a role. Infact all that they can do is make funny comments on sexuality on awards or tv shows. Hats off to u. it takes some guts at ur age and career to even think of taking up such a role

And good that you have not just taken a role but also shown the courage to stand up for fellow citizens who are being discriminated against based on sexual orientation.

                            Giving a right to the homosexuals to harass everybody on the road and act as if they own the world. Nobody talks about it but see the terrorism these LGBT types create on the trains harassing male passengers into givng them money. Now it would be legal.

                            Dear Manoj, I am a fan, but without reading this I will tell you this is a big mistake, you may have been tricked into doing this stupid role, you will only damage your image and create unwanted and unnecessary controversy here. Connecting AMU with lgbt is so damn crazy. Your producers should know these things don't work here in our country; so just calling people (who may oppose this) hypocrite and so on is just useless and uncalled for; see if you can still get out of this mess..!!

You will  also get a lot of negative comments from the bigots for this I'm sure, however just ignore them. All the best.

I am sure the movie,your screen presence &amp; your skills will make this a beautiful movie and convert many of our brutish brethren ( including some of our parliamentarians ) into more empathetic and sensible ones.<br/>
wish the movie the very best.

                            Mr Bajpai you are as articulate in your writing as you are in speaking and acting. Loved your panel discussion on We The People forum. Most of us definitely want homosexuality to be decriminalized. I think 'Aligarh' will go a long way in taking that important step.
