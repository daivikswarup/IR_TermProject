                            Thank you Mr. Pai for putting context around JNU events! While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, the discourse still needs to be sane and civil! Unfortunate to see students organizations aligning with the political parties - be it with left, congress or BJP. Its perfectly ok for students to have the organizations; but it's purpose and practice needs to confine to its constituents - that is Students, faculty and related matters. If you want to align or dissent with a political party's views or a judicial decision, there are several other avenues - and college campus is not one of them.

Don't understand why half educated people like these even write 'opinions'? Why didn't he also give his 'expert advise' to ABVP students?<br/>
Being an administrator why didn't he also give gyan to the administrators at the university to handle the matters internally instead of handing them to the police? Would he have given any disciplinary issue at his company to police instead of an internal committee?

                            @TwoCents: Why burn national flag as a freedom of expression? Can you extend burning of public buses and buildings and people as a freedom of expression? Any destruction howsoever small it may be can't be termed as freedom of expression.  No doubt central universities and many state universities are in clutches of leftists who resort to extreme means. They often indulge in cold blooded murder of students who don't fall in line. However any small action by govt is blown out of proportion. Need to cleanse universities of these leftist elements (including those professors) and remove all kinds of unions (especially political) from all universities and study places.

                            @TwoCents: Universities such as JNU also need to urgently look into the matter of allotting rooms to students. Some of these students, enroll at university at the age of 19-20 and are still students when they are 45 years old and start a family while living in the highly subsidized accommodation at a prime location in Delhi. The university needs a clear policy, regarding enrollment of students in a study program and the maximum time limit allowed for them to complete the study program. For example, if it is a 3 years program then give them up to 5 years to complete it. Presently, some of these students are only using enrollment in the study programs as a means to get extremely cheap accommodation and other highly subsidized facilities like canteen etc. and keep staying there for as long as possible. They keep dragging their studies for years and years and it is clear that completing their studies on time is not a priority for such students.

In effect, in India education at university level is a highly prized event that can shapes one life. And the India taxpayer funds these Universities. Please ask the taxpayers if they want to fund anti India sloganeering people at the campuses around the country. The answer will be a resounding No. It is hard earned money for many poor people. I believe if such people hate India, and are simply using universities to launch themselves, rather than work, let them leave their universities.

                            @TwoCents: <br/><br/>
@Varun: you may know this expression already "The lady doth protest too much, methinks" – essentially says if someone protests too much in favor of some assertion puts into others' minds the idea that the assertion may be false, something that they may not have considered earlier. That's what I think happened with the students' protest – they protested too hard. Where is the substance? They haven't provided a rational explanation as to why they are saying what they are saying. <br/><br/>
I agree, the ‘best course of action' would have been for JNU to deal with the matter internally and to JNU's credit they did that to certain extent - by not allowing explicit protest. Nevertheless, students went ahead with the protest under the cover of ‘Cultural Program / Exhibition'. It's hard to believe that such an even would go on without the connivance of some influential officials. How is it that the exhibits / artifacts / posters were not vetted out for their suitability for public exhibition? There sure is more there than we are led to believe. I agree with you; the matter should have been handled with more sensitivity and let JNU deal with it internally. But what do we do when the ‘best course of action' is not taken (and I don't know if that's the case here), then we need to go for the second best option. <br/><br/>
I'm all for having the debate, but there is a time and place for that. You can campaign and crusade for your view point, but it still has to be civil.  <br/><br/>
@Sri: All freedoms come with a few riders. I'm free to drive on roads, but can I go 150 km/hour? (not that I have a car that goes that fast :-) ) . The freedom still needs to be expressed within certain perimeter. It's for my safety and that of the others. The right to ‘freedom of expression' is often misunderstood and misused. Everyone has freedom of expression but fortunately it comes with reasonable limits. <br/><br/>
@Kumar: I respectfully disagree with your view that there is nothing wrong with Student Unions having affiliations with political parties. I'm for students having political views and preferences – after all, most are adults and participate in social and political discourse in some fashion. However, that view needs to be well informed. Like I said earlier, of course everyone can campaign and crusade for their political view point, but campus is not the place for it. <br/><br/>

Money invested by government, in form of subsidies to industries, more often than not, gives higher dividends than subsidies on such endeavours.<br/>

                            @Tilak:The 4 ingredients to start a company are Land, Labour,Capital and Technology(Entrepreneurship). All the 4 are required. Only with Land and Labour,without Capital and Technology, a company cannot be STARTED. In 120 crore population country like India, Government cannot be expected to do all the 4 for all the sectors of the economy. Like "It is not Government's Business to be in Business". Government's main business is GOVERNANCE. So, India requires Private Entrepreneurs like Mr. Mohandas Pai etc for Job Creation and economic growth of the country. Private Entrepreneurs like him bring in Capital and Technology to create jobs. So, your too much focus on only Land and Labour is highly misplaced. The Private Entrepreneurs can easily change locations to other countries where they will be given Red Carpet welcome, with Land and Labour too. In Government Universities like JNU, a portion of hard working INDIAN Tax Payers' sweat and blood through Budget is channelized to establish and run the educational institutions.The main aim of JNU students SHOULD BE to engage full time in academic study and indulge in nation-building activities. They are indeed lucky to enjoy highly subsidised facilities(Room Rent only Rs11/- pm, Fee of only Rs219/- per year etc.). After enjoying all these out of hard working INDIAN Tax Payers' sweat and blood, indulging in Anti-India, Pro-Pakistan Slogans is highly condemnable. The nation should stand together, setting aside Political Ideologies in condemning these acts and support the Government of the day to take strictest actions. This should be a lesson to all those "Progressive Intellectuals", who enjoy all GOVT of INDIA's benefits, accommodations(overstay in posh Government Bunglows in Delhi) and subsides but create discord and disharmony in colleges and society. Rather than feel jealous of others,who are more hardworking and enterprising than them, CPM Leaders should start generating Revenue and Wealth by its own efforts and then redistribute that Wealth to all. That is TRUE COMMUNISM, not opposing each and everything just for the sake of opposing.

I feel, we should question the so called GOVT, Politicians and university professors failing to control, guide and mentor healthy environments within campuses. Every citizen should get free education than classifying rate of subsidy and taking such incidents to threaten poor students in that way! We have not seen anyone asking to do council to the students who raised anti-nation slogans in order to understand their reasons and educate. Some of our greatest journalists/media can only do opportunistic emotional act in front of camera to only benefit thyself. Wish, we keep questioning such elements, wish we keep standing against such opportunists, wish we hold tight to question the causes than the victims..........!!!!

                            Sir, with all due respect let me state something.<br/><br/>
Your expectation of students is deeply flawed and probably reflects your poor understanding of the idea of education. It is quite possible that you are expressing the need of industry, in terms of how their future employees should be- all subdued and without any sort of political awareness. What you really want is an army of automatons, coming out of an assembly line which people mistake as a "University"<br/><br/>
What is expected of a university is much more than learning and research. It should be a place where a young chap matures into somebody who can think and make right choices in life. Universities should be places where there is active debates and discussions, a place where students learn to respect and accept contrasting views, a place where they learn to look around and see what is happening in their midst. NOT a place like Manipal, Lovely or SRM, where they churn out graduates in their thousands, who are totally bereft of any social or political thought. <br/><br/>
And about the subsidized education. The money being spend for subsidized education in India is not even one tenth of the corporate tax sops and other benefits. And its quite ironic that a beneficiary of all those corporate tax subsidies, is now arguing for cutting down educational subsidies. And talk about accountability coming from the sacred mouth of a corporate honcho who ruled over a company (read infosys) notorious for squeezing the last drop out of their employees, is nothing but OXYMORONIC

                            Thank you Mr. Pai for putting context around JNU events! While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, the discourse still needs to be sane and civil! Unfortunate to see students organizations aligning with the political parties - be it with left, congress or BJP. Its perfectly ok for students to have the organizations; but it's purpose and practice needs to confine to its constituents - that is Students, faculty and related matters. If you want to align or dissent with a political party's views or a judicial decision, there are several other avenues - and college campus is not one of them.

                            Well said. Left rule in Bengal was a disaster and the most atrocious in Independent India. Most good students would go to college in BHU as there were no good colleges/universities in Bengal. Left totally dominated the ideological landscape and any different point of view was met with a harsh suppression where the left party cadre along with police and other wings of administration participated. Left has perfected the art of violence globally and in India this takes the form of state suppression in their bastions and naxal/maoists violence elsewhere.<br/>
JNU should either be dis-banded or purged of anti-national and leftists elements to make it a contributor to national resurgence and development.

                            WOW. Mr. Pai what you are saying is that there because the college is funded by tax payers money, the college should always toe the line of the majority in the country. Are you not saying that ideas contrary to that of the majority of the tax payers should be stifled? It is because of this mentality of the rich to look down on others that we are still a developing country. Should not every idea be debated and the bad ones thrashed out and the good ones adopted? Or should all policy be dependent on where the funds come from? I guess we see the accountant side of you in this article. You should learn to enjoy an orchestra instead of whining on the wastage of having a dozen violinists instead of just one and an amplifier.<br/>

                            Is it time to challenge ABVP to a debate on nationalism? Will they even get past the definition stage, even if they agree to something that is intrinsically democratic - a debate!<br/>
The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad has a long list of taboo subjects that it considers outside the purview of discussion and contestation. To engage with these subjects or ideas is to violate the ABVP's idea of the sacred. What has precipitated the crisis in universities is that the Bharatiya Janata Party's student wing also wants to impose its notion of the sacred on all students and teachers.<br/>
The tendency of one group to impose its idea of the sacred on others has its origins in the caste system, which, as we all know, is organised on the principle of purity and pollution. Any violation of the ABVP's idea of the sacred now runs the risk of encountering violence, or invites punishment from the authorities, or both. This too is a feature of the caste system.<br/>
Taboo topics<br/>
The ABVP does not want students to discuss the hanging of Yakub Memon or Afzal Guru, or the inclusion of beef in the mess menu. It believes a seminar on human rights violations is akin to supporting Maoism, which is deemed anti-national. It opposes seminars on Hinduism unless these are unequivocally in its praise. The list is long and forever evolving.<br/>
Just how this form of imposition is linked to the caste system can be illustrated through an example. The higher your caste, the less polluting your occupation – but you would be defiled in case you were to shake hands with those whose very touch is polluting, or dine with him, or partake of beef, or remove the carcass of a dead animal.<br/>
You can choose to refrain from certain activities. That is your decision. You can, for instance, get another person to remove the carcass from your compound. You can, obviously, abstain from eating beef.<br/>
But you also have to depend on others to subscribe to caste rules for preserving your purity. What are you to do if the pariah insists on touching you? What if the outcaste draws water from the tap you too use, or demands to drink tea from the same tumbler as yours?<br/>
Either you will adjust to this reality or you will dissuade him from polluting you by striking the fear of retribution or punishment in him. This is often at the root of horrific caste violence in the country. Indeed, for caste rules to have salience, it is vital not only for you but also for others to adhere to them as well.<br/>
Caste ethos<br/>
It is this caste ethos, and arrogance, the ABVP brings to universities, more fiercely now because the BJP government rules at the Centre. Ideas designated as sacred can't be violated and what the ABVP views as profane must be shunned. In case some choose not to, the ABVP would pressure the authorities to take punitive action against them. It is on the fear of punishment (or violence) that the caste system breeds<br/>
Discussions on ideas that the ABVP considers taboo cannot defile its members. Whom does it defile then? It is the Mother, the deity that is India, whom we must worship. Her spirit infuses all spaces, more so the campuses. Just as Dalits were (and are still) proscribed from entering temples, certain ideas have attributes that defile Mother India.<br/>
This was indeed the theme of the statement Union Minister Smriti Irani issued following the arrest of protesting students at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Ideas of purity and pollution and religiosity are fused in the politics of ABVP, as is true of the entire Sangh Parivar.<br/>
The ABVP's list of taboo subjects can be arranged in a hierarchy. The most profane is the idea of self-determination. Try conducting a seminar on the issue on campus. It is bound to get disrupted by boys who will later be discovered to be belonging to the ABVP.<br/>
Ask for a just trial of terrorists – and every word spoken in favour of it will lead to the defilement of Mother India. Try to get Delhi University's Law Faculty to organise a talk on the need to withdraw the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. It won't, because that is a taboo subject, as is the issue of observing human rights in Chhattisgarh.<br/>
Proscribed from university campus are even those whom the AVBP considers Naxalite sympathisers. To check this hypothesis, Delhi University should invite writer Arundhati Roy to address the students. It was the reason the ABVP cited to deny journalist Siddharth Varadrajan from speaking at Allahabad University.<br/>
Historical personalities can be assigned to a higher or lower order of profanity depending on the location of a university. It is taboo to make a critical appraisal of Shivaji in Maharashtra or Rana Pratap in Rajasthan. It is taboo, as students of Hyderabad Central University have repeatedly discovered, to demand that the college serve them beef. Outside metros, you periodically hear of the ABVP demanding a dress code for girls.<br/>
Lost ironies<br/>
The ABVP's obsession with its list of taboos creates hilarious situations at times. The ABVP vociferously protested against philosopher Ashok Vohra at Mohanlal Sukhadia University, Udaipur. The reason: he had addressed an audience of around 100 on The Religious Dialogue: The Need in the Contemporary Times. The ABVP claimed he had insulted Hinduism.<br/>
Vohra had done just the opposite – he had criticised western Indologists, such as Wendy Doniger. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vohra wrote,<br/>
"To evaluate theories supported by these scholars one has to use their vocabulary, their descriptions and their interpretations. I chose this because American writers speak very derogatorily of Hindu gods and goddesses… (But) if you want to rebut an argument, you must quote it."<br/>
The poor philosopher, quite clearly, missed the point. They protested against him for much the same reason as the higher castes disallow the Dalit groom to mount the mare in a wedding procession. It may not violate the principle of purity, but it certainly conveys Dalits assertion. It is possible they could feel emboldened to infringe caste rules in the future, just as a few in Vohra's audience could become intellectually curious about Doniger and learn to question the Hindu religious tradition.<br/>
In the ABVP's imagination, Mother India is dressed in the fabric of nationalism and Hinduism. To question either is to defile her. It is of little significance to the ABVP that its activists don't contest these two ideas. This is because it believes Mother India would be defiled anyway because of those who are willing to debate the taboo subjects.<br/>
The ABVP has now taken upon itself to teach them a lesson for their audacity, in much the way, the dominant castes punish the transgressor of caste codes in villages. This is why our universities are now in tumult.

Here any tom-dick &amp; harry politicians can block rail tracks, roads for months or burn train just like that to demand quota or burn police station, crate riots just because they didn't like someone's comment. Most amazing thing is when the left media, leaders[not talking about Mr. Pai] talk about 'freedom of speech' they give example of USA not of any leftist nation!!!

                            I am not able to understand theory of "taxpayers money/funding", is it only middle class that is paying taxes? only 2% people pay income tax. All other taxes are paid by every citizen irrespective of their income. Does our country run on taxes sole, then who takes the money extracted from natural resources like minerals and spectrum? what ever tax people like Mohandas pays, it returns to their pocket itself as subsidies to industrialists and middle class.Remaining money governments spends to provide security to you all people. Students and general people just gets the tiny of the money extracted from the natural resources on which every citizen has their part.

Govt response can be termed as harsh but till date nobody has had the guts to take action inspite of these incidents happening regularly.

You are one person, please speak for yourself, if you are speaking as a taxpayer, every other person also has a voice in this matter. You are neither a spokesperson for the government, neither are you one for the funding public. In my opinion, we fund each and every student, period. We do not fund their education, we support them as persons, flesh and living human beings with their own thought processes, we fund them as they are the future of this world and this nation. We fund them so that their "... minds (are) without fear and their heads are held high...". We want them to lead the youth power of India with diverse opinions where "... clear stream of reason has not lost its way in the dreary desert sand of dead habit ...". This is the great tradition of the great universities of the world, modern and ancient. They admit students whom they think are worthy of those portals and let them start the journey of life work and let them be. Please let them be Mr Pai.

                            It does smell a rat. Wikipedia search shows T.V. Mohandas Pai is the Chairman of Manipal Global Education. A Chairman of a private institution in higher education is sounding foul on a Government run renowned University and talking about tax payers money. Which is absolutely a different debate. Though I fully agree with his point of view, the timing is suspect. It's purely fishing in troubled water. The issue is not restricted to the leftist ideology dominance in JNU. It is about the effort of replacement of leftist ideology dominance by right wing fundamentalist ideology. The article would have been appropriate on a different context, but today it may be taken up as a support to the right wing fanatics who are getting increasingly embolden under the present government.  The results of fundamentalists taking central stage in country's politics can be found all over the not so peaceful today's world.

                            I think this article - particularly the headline - completely misunderstands the role of the academic institution in public life, especially one like the JNU whose coursework is meant to create future leaders and thinkers. All over the world, students in universities like the JNU have sparked off larger movements for justice. Student movements in Berkeley and Sorbonne in the 1960s played a key role in expanding civil rights and personal freedoms in their respective countries, Tiananmen Square in 1989 was essentially a student revolution on the political right. The role of institutions like JNU in India is the same: to ask questions to the system and bring change. <br/><br/>
For that matter, IITs and IIMs also use taxpayer money to subsidise education. A large majority of those students practice a different kind of politics - one that allows them to benefit from subsidised education and leave the country blaming "the system". Atleast the JNU students are here, and doing something about a system they don't like.

Many of them are proud professors in top institutions. One important attribute of the institutes curriculum (unwritten)is the freedom of expression. That is being attempted to be throttled. Sad.

The funding of Universities by Government out of the Taxes we pay has to be stopped and all higher education should be left to the Private enterprise.

The larger issue  is 'do we really value   freedom of expression and   individual freedom in general ?'. The history of JNU and past misdeed of certain gentleman or regime just shouldn't count. The freedom of expression shouldn't be limited to political leaders alone. The meek citizen should enjoy the freedom. The sad part is that our journalists and media also take sides.One should always remember 1976 whenever we are in doubt about individual freedom.

Actually Rahul has opposed crushing the voice of dissent which you also defend by giving the example of America, where you say "…the freedom of speech includes the freedom to burn the national flag!" In fact, among all parties in India, Congress has seen the largest number of good leaders dissenting and parting ways with it without suffering any personal or political harm. I don't think we can keep politics away from universities because of the very nature of social sciences subjects they teach. But you are right in expressing concerns about the students' and faculty's obsession with politics. All parties must form a common stand on raising the quality of education and research in the institutions of higher learning.

                            Brilliant stuff Mr Pai! However JNU is a public institution with great national importance and of international stature. Despite its politics it has produced an outstanding alumni who have contributed to the growth of modern India. It was tax payer's money well spent. On the other hand I wonder, how much of the tax payer's money went to fund the private and for profit company in which you were working? Why was it that Infosys is unable to open shop anywhere without the benefits of SEZ facilities? How much export duty did your company not pay? How many labor laws have you violated within your precious SEZs? Why does your company not pay the fair price to the governments on land acquisitions?<br/>
I bet, by lobbying with politicians, the money you have saved by depriving the Indian exchequer is far more than the government grants that JNU receives!

                            Pai is right. JNU students should be made to bear the full expenses of running the university so that any disruption comes at their cost. This includes dalit students as well. And suitable entries made in the conduct certificate of each student activist who misuses the JNU for political issues.

                            "India spends around only 2% of the GDP on education. It is even lesser than some of the poorer countries in Africa and neighbouring countries.<br/>
1. Education is a right, not a privilege. By privatizing education you are going to make it inaccessible just like health care system in India.<br/>
2. Not every one has resources backing them to go to private universities , give donations. And if you are talking about resources, then also talk of resources being systematically being drained from tribal areas and nothing given back to them. <br/>
Where are you getting your wood, coal, metals from? Delhi ya Mumbai mei toh nahi ugtaa ye sab.<br/>
3. And just because public education is paid from tax payers money you have not bought people. They can have an opinion which might not agree with your conformist view.<br/>
4. And if you have so much problem with subsidy, also have problem with government giving subsidy to private sector like writing off loans for corporates, giving away land to corporations for peanuts. Who is benefitting from this? Clearly not the masses.<br/>
Also you can clearly compare education policies in other countries who you aspire to be like - e.g US. Students are in debt for all their life because education is privatized. Students across US have been protesting against this.<br/>
But oh how will you analyze all this because you want to shut down universities !!!"<br/>

Plus sir, they are also studying political science- not just practicing politics. The study of political science, along with other subject of the humanities and social sciences are important. People who study society come out with perspectives informing their work towards nation-building too. You see practical examples in education, policy, journalism, the development sector - to state a few, prima facie.

                            exclusivist centralised dogma? Almost seems as if you're referring to the sangh agenda. Mr. Pai I don't pay taxes just so that businesses and businessmen could cut corners and circumvent the system and add to the mounting NPAs of our PSU banks. Its tax payer money too. Lets talk about that for a change. <br/><br/>
Or how about talking about the fact that freedom of speech and expression, even if not absolute, should allow for peaceful right to dissent. And let me add that the PDP has called Afzal Guru's hanging a travesty, now maybe we should also be questioning "opportunistic" BJP for tying up with a seditious movement?
