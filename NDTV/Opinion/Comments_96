                            I have a sincere question to you human rights activists: whose side are you on, the victim's or the criminal's? Your claim of "brain developing till the age of 18" is rubbish. Anyone who commits a crime of rape, is party to a crime or rape, cannot claim he didn't know what he was doing. It is a violent crime and looking at the brutality of the crime committed, you cannot grant him the benefit of the doubt by saying he was a juvenile.

                            It's disappointing to see an eminent person write an immature article. The JJ act amendment bill does not lower the juvenile age. It treats juveniles above 16 equally in case of heinous crimes such as rape and murder(which have punishment of 7yrs or more) This act is so far the only real tribute the country has paid to Nirbhaya. Please cite facts whenever you write a critical arcticle.

A criminal is a criminal to his victim. What has age got to do with it? If you are old enough to kill and rape, you are old enough to be punished for it. All criminals are not amenable to reform, but without fail all should be punished. The certainty of punishment is the biggest deterrent. Compassion to criminals is a misplaced virtue.

In UK , USA and other democratic countries lawmakers take quick decisions and they come out successfully and we feel proud to quote them. You lawmakers are only to be blamed.

                            All the parties that opposed the bill, are usually associated with on the ground bullying to get their votes. Such acts are carried out by young adults who would get away as these parties will focus on youth below the age of 18. With this rule, these parties would suffer the most. Facts are normally quoted to suit the argument. Eg if person is over 18 and in jail, the ratio of poor would remain the same.

"On the contrary, the US continues to have one of the highest crime rates among juveniles in the world..."<br/><br/>
Being from the US, this is because here crime is REPORTED. In India, crimes are not readily reported, especially in poorer areas of the country. As more crimes are reported, the official crime rate will naturally increase.

                            It would be great if the writer actually reads this comment. We all know that it hardly happens, but I'm posting it only so that people who read the article know the full story and then decide for themselves whether this bill makes sense.<br/><br/>
Typically in India, when a corrective action is taken, we tend to over do it, by considering only the present in mind. Though I've been extremely disgusted, like so many others, to see the guy walk out free even after being involved in such a crime, I have spent considerable time in objectively analyzing the implications of passing such a bill.<br/><br/>
What was very apparent as I read through is that the article/writer is guilty of the deliberately not considering/revealing certain details to suit one's agenda (whatever that is).<br/><br/>
Of course, the accusations of the DCW were ridiculous. No doubting that. <br/>
But passage and implementation of this bill does not mean '16 to 18 year olds will be tried in the same manner as adults' and just that.<br/><br/>
If you look at the full text of the bill, it is quite clear that everything the writer raises as a concern is taken into account. <br/><br/>
Here is the text copied verbatim from the bill:<br/><br/>
 - The Bill permits juveniles between the ages of 16-18 years to be tried as adults for heinous offences.  Also, any 16-18 year old, who commits a lesser,   i.e., serious offence, may be tried as an adult only if he is apprehended after the age of 21 years.<br/><br/>
 - Juvenile Justice Boards (JJB) and Child Welfare Committees (CWC) will be constituted in each district.  The JJB will conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether a juvenile offender is to be sent for rehabilitation or be tried as an adult.  The CWC will determine institutional care for children in need of care and protection.<br/><br/>
So, for one thing, this is applicable for heinous offences. And a preliminary inquiry is to be conducted to determine how the case is to be taken forward. We know that adult offenders are not tried this way, at all.<br/><br/>
Knowing that the bill has enough provisions, I personally feel that it is not as 'illogical' as the writer seems to make it look like. That's my opinion.<br/>
But the thing with opinions is, one is entitled to an opinion. But it can only be respected if the opinion is formed after considering all the details.

The age of treating a person as juvenile is NOT lowered, but what has changed is the possibility of treating a juvenile aged 16+ as a adult for heinous crimes.<br/>
The bigger issue here is IF juveniles committing heinous crimes should be treated as adults. While this law may not retrospectively affect the Nirbhaya case, how many such cases should be enough for Parliament to enact the reforms?

They support strike altering normal life process and in the name of supporting trade unions, supported successive pay commission to govt employees who do not work for more than one hour,supported bank employees who do not work efficiently,forced the govt of the day to increase their salaries astronomically,not knowing that they have increased the digitas  divide, fueled inflation,increased the level of corruption,and never allowing the situation to stabilize.<br/>
However communism is a discarded romantic thought process constantly dividing people and never allow human value to guide the civil society, and hence virtually out of power world over, and in china too it is waiting to burst at the seams, sooner than later.

On top of that there is a battery of people in all the time in the world to fight against capital punishment for most gruesome killers, criminal rights for 3 times good meals, yoga and bail on call. I have never seen them fighting for victims, witness protection and changing laws for better. I suspect their is a conspiracy to further destabilise Indian society by spreading anarchy through apparently innocent looking but sinister ideological miscampaigns.

                            Does she wants to protect any similar criminal ? For law loving citizens it will be discouraging to dilute punishments for criminals on basis of age. The criminal in Nirbhaya case and any other clean boy of same age will be at same level. Isn't it encourage the clean boy to commit crime without bothering society. Every criminal should definitely loose something in life as price. Most important aspect is victim. Rape like crime leaves irreversible effects for victim, criminal should be punished with similar effects for lifetime.

                            Cure the patient not the disease- Increasing crime is a symptom of sick and uncivilised society. By just lowering the juvenile age and passing punishment bill will not solve the problem. If we want to defeat the crime, it is important to look at the root causes of crime. We all know the root causes that include terrible public infrastructure, gender inequality,  illiteracy, poverty, socio economic conditions, terrible law and order, deteriorating human culture and values, and living conditions. State has responsibility. State must take blame of not providing equal and quality education and assure necessary economic conditions to millions of kids who are deprived and forced to live in unhuman conditions that can leads to  terrible crimes. True justice shall be delivered to Nirbhya when we eliminate the root of causes of crime. Prevention is the only way. Government can not run away from its responsibility by just passing new bill- it must deliver its constitutional and moral responsibilities by building a just and equal society by providing equal opportunities to its citizens. I believe the bill has been passed in a rush keeping people's prevailing sentiments and gain political mileage. We need comprehensive bill that provide balanced approach including deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation, and clear state commitment to provide necessary means to stop future crimes. <br/><br/>

Hope all political parties learn to behave in a similar manner and also learn to accept defeat with grace.

                            Madam, Your opinion is well written, appreciate your starting of statement as "India" NOT Modi or BJP (your did not politicize the statement).<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, when a Child is provoked with Adult act and behavior the Child in that person is dead - it is just the reference frame "Age" is left out.<br/><br/>
As a society, all of us responsible for the Child turning into that - it is a "Social Impact" or "Economic Speed" or "Financial Gap" or "Media Cult" which has contributed.  Statistically, the crimes which I could see from the reports in the media are belonging to certain group of people related to "Economic Speed".<br/><br/>
As a parent of a girl child, we need to have some sigh of relief and thought of protection. It is like a security guard at ATM.<br/><br/>
We need a tougher act to contain it now and not later when it turns into a bigger issue.  Thanks to all MPs in both the houses who did pass this bill to protect our innocent and tender girl child. <br/><br/>

                            I fully and entirely agree with Mrs Karat. It has become fashionable in India to succumb to the pressures of the so-called "civil society" which shouts about issues on the basis of half-baked information. Law-making is serious business: it cannot be done in television studios or on the basis of a trial by media. Indeed, the Supreme Court should lay down some parameters and countours within which TV studio debates and media debates may be conducted, to eliminate any chances of the Judges becoming biased.

                            Me Karat and lot like her like rational talks, though they don't mind to indicate a political party while talking. Anyway, let me improve there highly questionable knowledge of Democracy. In democracy everybody had right to say his piece of mind, but decisions are made by popular mendate, or majority public opinion, and I am sure you guys are aware of these words.<br/>
So when decisions are made, laws are made or changed or update, it is purely govern by what majority is thinking (represented by someone who is just a popular choice may be 30% of voting age population). Don't go on 30% because 40-50% of Indian population doesn't vote and rest are influenced by 100's of available option and selfish motives... it's number game... but in any case fact remain unchanged that majority took the decisions.<br/>
So Me Karat you are actually questioning intelligence of Indian population. Moreover, punishment should purely be goverend by severity of crime and intent and not age... because none can say u r a dumb piece till 25 all of a sudden you got super natural powers and start giving opinion.<br/><br/>
I read you talk about highest crime rate of juvenile crime in US but you missed that US has highest standard of living which you consider as one of the influencing factor in Juvenile crime. You talk about poverty as one reason of Juvenille crime and forget to mention that in 30 years of leftist era in West Bengal actually industrilisation dies across WB, poverty increases many fold, poor people migrated across India, bangladeshi infiltration incresed (that again contribute in your WB loot).. and thus in conclusion your left party and as a supporter of leftist politics .. you are partially responsible for Juvenille crimes.. so as a grown up mature adult.. you should be punished, isn't it.<br/><br/>
So in your own language law is rational Crime and Punishment is just an extension of What if Scenario... and law reflect what society in general think.. for example Sharia in KSA is a law... and chicken heads like you never dare to raise a question on inhuman interpretation and implemetation of side of Sharia .. and I agree its law of land.. people accept it and that's why rulers survive.. so u accept it too if u r in that land.... In the same line if you are in India and if Indian majority (I hope you are mature and intelligent enough to not to read "Majority" as Hindu or Muslim) is not agreed with law it has to be changed... and nobody cares about what you think..... me too.

                            CPM in Kerala has always used Juveniles for their dirty political gains. I would encourage readers to check the stats of the number of youngsters who took to hate politics in Kerala which lead to many families losing their loved ones. Organizations like SFI used to destroy public property and were known for their misbehavior during the 80s and 90s. No wonder Brinda is against the bill. This shold act as a deterrent to those young minds and in turn help them develop as good citizens for the country and bring much needed solace to their struggling families.
