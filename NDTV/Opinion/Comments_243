We saw how British MPs ridiculed Scottish MPs who asked for "Azadi". Please keep the sermons to yourself and your unwarranted interference in our internal matters is least appreciated and welcomed.

                            Sensible advice. In any event, some student making silly statements does not shame India. We are a nation of 1 billion people - with 1 billion different points of view. Many will be mainstream, some will not. And thats fine - it hasnt done any harm to the nation in all these decades since independence. <br/><br/>
However, if a mob is allowed to take justice into its own hands within a courtroom for two successive days in our capital city, and the judges and police stand by as mute spectators - that certainly shames the nation. It shows we are a country without the rule of law. Thats a damning indictment. <br/><br/>
So in short - govt, please focus on the real issues - and that is not students making speeches, however objectionable...

India always had views which were never aimed towards a common society. States vs state, caste vs caste, rich vs poor. Hence having few radicals across all sections was a part and parcel of our society.

I would draw your attention to the fact In India thousands of small communities with their cultures, languages, customs and religions are surviving and florishing for the last 7000 years under Indian Civilisation. Do not lecture India about humanity and morality. You are the scums of civilisation as you impose your system on others by creating a hubis that it is the best, which is not. Fact indicates otherwise. You and your ilks understand the language of force and after decimating your opponents preach peace. You should be ashamed of what your forefather did slavery is your invention. You should apologise for the crimes of your forefathers now.

I also hold a section of our media responsible for this. We are in a day and age where media is influencing public opinion. And everyone in the TRP business knows,,, Fear sells. Media houses know portraying these students as terrorists hatching a devious plan to break our country will sky-rocket their TRPs. Yeah,,, because that's how terrorists work right? First they will hold a march,, announce what they are planning to do in public,,, and then act on it. Really??? And this actually sells.

                            The context of India's angst must be understood Mr. Whitehead. From Afghanistan to Japan, Indian thought (philosophy, art and math) and its indigenous religious beliefs (Buddhism, Hinduism etc) spread and co-mingled with the sciences, arts and faiths of the local population. Different strands of rich thought was developed. However, ever since the Judaic religions mainly Islam and to a certain extent Christianity started its assault on this rich tapestry, which started obliterating people who thought any differently, the trouble has started. Wherever, a fight was not put up entire communities have been wiped out - Hindus in pakistan and Bangladesh have all but disappeared in 50 years. The same happened in Indonesia and Malaysia 300 years ago. The Buddhists are under major attack by Christians in Korea, China and Japan (one of the key reasons why the North Korean state is propped up by China - to avoid the Christian evangelists overrunning South east China and North Korea).  Thailand, Srilanka, Burma Buddhists are under threat from Islamists and the list can go on. So, any seditious behaviour has existential dimensions in Indian mindset. This is not about Scotland and England coexisting as mainly white Christian neighbors.

                            Dr.Radhakrishan's observations were right . Indian students in Britain vilifying that nation. Pl  do not quote Bedi. American students rose  for a cause that they thought was good for their country and people. Here in India, besides raising slogans on Kashmir, the students were shouting slogans about destrying India. This is not good and if the govt acted it was the correct step.  The author can as well stay away from such issues that do not concern him and his country. Everyone offers his or her opinion on India. Try it with China, Pakistan, North Korea, and all theocratic states.

We do cope up with people who celebrated the death of the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi.<br/>
We cope up with people who called the underprivileged in our society as dogs.<br/><br/>
The issue now is there are a lot of things for this government to bury.<br/>
1. Rs.11,400,000 bad loans written off for the corporate out of the tax payers money.<br/>
2. The underprivileged Rohit Vemula's suicide because he was a victim of the witch hunt similar to the current JNU incident.<br/>
3. The failures of the government on the agricultural and health front. India ordered maize after 16 years. Most of the countries on which the order is given are telling that they can't ensure the quality.<br/>
4. The international reduction of the crude oil prices were not passed down to the people.<br/>
5. The vyapam scam.<br/>

                            So why does British media constantly harp about 'Britishness'? Why does the extreme right in Britain (UKIP, BNP, EDC) hold marches and rallies against non whites, Muslims and immigrants and get elected? Why does British media and law enforcement come down heavily on those involved in anti British activities because of the wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan?  And as we speak the British PM is negotiating how to stay in the EU because British people don't want to as they don't want immigrants. Also, have you forgotten your colonial past &amp; Falklands? Stop being a hypocrite and practice what you preach. India, despite its problems remains second to none in its tolerance institutionally and culturally.

India is secular, all religions, language have place here but y not one law for all, y not nobody speaks for population control.

Opposition parties must be the happiest bunch around to have a political party thats running the central govt self-destruct like this within a couple of years of assuming power. The inexperience of Mr Modi in running a federal govt clearly shows in the handling of central universities. There were enough challenges as it is. Clearly this govt has bitten off more than it can chew with these kind of controversies. The sooner BJP restrategizes the better. It can either run the govt or run the RSS agenda but cant do both.

The geography of 10-12 km radius within Delhi, do not at all represent India as whole. Its rather exception, though (exceptionally) powerful. The people within that small area has blown everything out of proportion (as usual). And In India we have infinite opinions with Billion plus population. However country is not at all charged up as seen from TV studio or Social Media commentators. Yes, opinions are divided sharply being (as portrayed) sensitive matter. But such incidents are taking place everyday in every nook and corner of the country. So pls. don't drag country as whole.

This is another matter that police in this case was dragging their feet but public participation forced police to take action. If these so called students take their movement to streets then they will be beaten in the street by the public and they will hide behind the same police they are alleging to be heavy handed
