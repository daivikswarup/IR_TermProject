                            Thank you Air Marshal saheb, for so vividly describing the hostile environment in Sialchen (so true of many other locations throughout the country where our troops operate) and the daring rescue operations carried out by the brave hearts of the Air Force. Every time there is a loss of precious army men's lives, it breaks the hearts of this nation. I have had many friends in the Army and the IAF who have served in Sialchen and it sends shivers down my spine when they describe the harsh and inhospitable conditions in and around the area. All I can do is to stand at attention and salute all you brave hearts and send a prayer to the Almighty to keep all our brethren in the Services safe and in good health.

But just want to standup and salute the bravery of these young lads.<br/><br/>
Salute!!!

                            Why don't we start using Drones if not any advance medium instead of posting Jawan's, to safeguard these frontiers which carries 100% risk on our Brave Jawan's life.

                            I lost a cousin in an avalanche along with 13 soldiers in Siachen. We are proud to serve in the most inhospitable and treacherous terrain. But what  is galling is that a bureaucrat or IPS officer serving in the North East or in Leh town gets almost double as 'hardship' allowance than an Armed Forces equivalent individual. The country is being taken for a ride by the Babus and Politicians in power couldn't care less!

                            Sir, as the eyes skimmed over the words, it formed a running picture in the mind. Each word is true and even the chill could be felt when the doors are opened. On hearing the news a thought was passing through my mind, about half a decade ago when "Mars" flew over this area, crevasses were constantly forming and in summers they were wide enough to engulf a complete football field. The snout has receded almost 500m in last one decade. Probably the crust of ice is thinning out. Who is monitoring all this? A SASE news release says they had warned of a snow avlanche in the general area, which is hardly of any consequence. The place is not only to be protected but conserved too. The valour and sacrifice of Indian Army deserves the highest respect, where simple survival itself is impossible, for decades they have held the fort. Jai Hind..

                            Sir, I have a different question . Is it worth those human lives and the amount of money we spent <br/>
on maintaining such assets in  siachen glacier ? Is it militarily avoidable expense, forget about any peace move with pakistan, even with a hostile pakistan, do we really need such massive deployment ? Have our military generals evaluated the whole thing ? Instead of always pointing fingers at IAS all the time , the <br/>
correct deployment of forces are in the domain of Military, which they need to do a lot of work.<br/>
If we work cohesively on this subject, a lot of avoidable deployments can be identified and solutions can be found out . <br/><br/>
In india, the problem is that when there is a problem in a particular area especially in Northeast/J&amp;K, we  deploy police,paramilitary, military and so on. WE never address the issue or evaluate the deployment.
