                            Modi ji always shows maturity in every aspect of governance. He is working hard for country, whole world is recognizing it. Hope his haters in country also understand that.

                            One thing Sudheendra needs to avoid is bringing Sudheendra into the article. That he tweeted, was criticized etc. - we are not interested. But he always does this - bringing himself into his report. On the substance part, he fails to recognize that this meeting occurred without the Hurriyat being involved. This is huge. It says that Pakistan is dropping the pretentious drama they indulged in - trying to show they were acting on behalf of Kashmiris. Another thing to note is quite likely the US has played a significant role, given that Raheel and Nawaz Sharif and Modi all met with Obama in the last 30 days.

                            The joint statement says that India and Pakistan, "guided by the vision of a peaceful stable and prosperous South Asia", would resume discussions covering "peace and security, terrorism, Jammu and Kashmir, and other issues, including tranquility along the LoC".<br/><br/>
So BJP realized its tough stance is not working and they included "J&amp;K" now in the joint statement.. I wont call it U-turn but realization ... for UPA was ridiculled and called Anti-National !!!

                            First RSS BJP &amp; their goons should stop malign our freedom movement which they are attempting to do through Bise files and invoking controversaries between Nehru-Patel &amp; Bose. This is an old vicious plan of CIA and pro-British forces which their agent RSS is implementing in India from May 2014. RSS has only to malign everything related to our freedom struggle, the growth we had under congress regimes. Modi is just a puppet.

                            In India Pak it is one step forward, two steps back. If Pak is willing to stop sponsoring terror, something may be achieved, In the long run the result will be zilch, as Kashmir is an issue that cannot be resolved.

                            Welcome bak after long time. A dedicated Bhakt of his masters. We can not expect any thing better from him. The title speaks for itself. Article need not even be read. It revolves around the author and dedicated bhakti of his master.

                            We should keep talking. Maybe it will strengthen Nawaz Sharif. That itself migh help bring peace. But we should be prepared for more terrorism.<br/><br/>
Ultimately we have to work to solve our problems either with or without or in spite of them, as Narasimha Rao put it in 1994.

                            Let us hope for the best however, maturity made in USA has never benefited us so far. Hopefully, this time we will be able to regain our lost South Asia dominance, which is very much essential for our economical health. As US wants to bell the safe cat before departure from Afghanistan, we can certainly use this opportunity with the help of Pak to our advantage.
