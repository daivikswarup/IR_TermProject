                            The problem with our society is we expect collective consciousness only from poor people but middle class, upper middle class and rich are never expected to show collective consciousness. I would expect Ms. Rukmani to visit Kishan's place and ensure his children get good education. She shouldn't do it as a reward but as a part of collective consciousness and with some clue from jawahar's thought. This may be a god send opportunity for you to boost your Karma.

                            At last, a simple article from Rukmini, with a simple message.  A good message.  Makes a change from her usual articles that are full of academic quotes from sources unfamiliar to the average Indian.  Considering Rukmini's expertise in English, I am not sure if 'Glancing distractedly' is correct usage but that is an aside.  I do hope Kishan was rewarded.

That's actually a VERY good point Kristr. It also gave me food for thought. <br/>
Thank you for that thought-provoking idea.

                            The author happened to meet the good people in Delhi twice, hence she seems balanced in her approach in generalizing people of Delhi.<br/><br/>
Had she not found her bag for whatever reasons, or a man had not helped her daughter 10 years ago, then she would be cursing Delhi and its people even though Kishan and that man 10 years would still be Delhiites, right? Maybe she just happen to meet these good guys.<br/><br/>
The conclusion: Every place has its share of good, bad and ordinary people, including Delhi. <br/>
This article is actually a waste of resources, nothing more. <br/>
The author is reacting as if Delhi is like a hell, and she is so happy when she found two good men here which is almost like a miracle.<br/><br/>
I am proud of being a part of Delhi. If a crime happens in Delhi, it becomes a national news and then follows routine criticism of Delhi and its people. But if the same thing happens outside Delhi, then all non-Delhiites take enough care not to even react to it. Strange, but true!<br/><br/>
As I understand, the author herself is a Delhiite, then how come she can claim Delhi has bad people only. (I am assuming she considers herself a good person).
