                            StartupRahul has been an ongoing project for more than a decade. Since 90% of start ups collapse, that is where Rahul is heading. In spite of party support, he simply does not have the capacity to lead. Or the capacity for anything else. And anyway was always an unwilling player from the start. So, no startup. Only wind down. Both him and his party. RIP.

                            raga is an unwilling politician and the country knows it. He's just being pressured to run a family business for which he neither has the interest not the capability. <br/>
The seculars and the pseudo liberals want him coz they can continue to flout the rules with impunity and be equally corrupt under the garb of secularism.

                            Nice column, the flip side of Rahul is destruction of the Congress party because he is the OLDEST FAILED start up on the horizon - fourth generation telling his sister's grandchildren, he is increasingly looking unlikely to have his own, how he blew it in secret EXOTIC DESTINATIONS!

                            Stop talking of Rahul. He is in opposition. Tell us when ur suit boot pm will start up governance. The economy is tanking, terrorists are running amok, students are being murdered by ministers, one minister is absconding following rape charges n the rupee is tanking n the pm is on a merry tour around the globe. Instead of focussing on Rahul focus on 'stay-in-india' and 'govern-india'

                            An "image Guru" i do not know what that means, talking about politics, alas if it was an image makeover i could understand. And you saying Modi is focusing on UP, the problem with him is he is only focusing on elections, whether it is Delhi, Bihar, Assam, UP, punjab and the administration focusing on publicity. A great opportunity in the wake of record low oil prices ( not to mention the full benefit is not passed on), record low metal prices, yet this government has no Clue. Alas lets wait till 2019

                            Worry not. If the product has a substance, eventually society will appreciate. For the rest, bankruptcy laws are being simplified.

                            @Gulam Mohd. Sadiq,  You seems to be born yesterday.  The incidents of farmers suicide is not new and did not start after Modi's arrival.  It is the result of lack of vision by successive governments where they always tried workarounds rather than finding the solution.  And for the suicide of students, do you know that in the same university, there were nine or ten suicides during the previous regime?  Just chanting right wing, RSS etc doesn't change the fact that the hypocrisy of the so called leftists are actually helping the other section to grow.

                            It is really unnatural to ask Rahul to do startup to win electronic election so he can become PM, does he any time say that he want to become PM then why we want to impose on him our lost dream. The reality is that the people of India has rejected socialism that means they have rejected congress and accepted capitalism. When there was no food and clothes they have accepted socialism and when they get it in surplus they killed it to become multimillionaires. Naturally, one can become multimillionaire only by grabbing from other and that need violence. Generally, in a peaceful society people can achieve almost prosperity for all but cannot become multimillionaires. Basically, we are very much expert in violence as after killing millions during partition our demand for violence is day by day increasing. Today, everyone is looking towards other as an enemy of their prosperity. Thus, in such an environment humanity will naturally take a backseat and to ask Rahul to take a front seat is really unnatural.

                            @Ashok: Mr. Cherian's idea of a individual is diversionary tactics just to avoid attention of nation from government made pro suicide spree for farmers and dalits. Given the distress of farmers it was desired to have stand up farmers (75% population) instead of stand up India meant for 1% population to get prospered at the cost of 99% population just to test patience and tolerance of money  lender driven pro suicide policy. Tolerance is exemplary as no farmer has resoted revange so far.
