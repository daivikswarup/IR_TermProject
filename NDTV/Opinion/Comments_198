                            oops.. A bright student committed suicide because of intervention of political powers on one side and forcing the administration to suspend students who were otherwise cleared of any wrong-doing. The politica powers that did this are in the Central Government. That's all is the issue. If the Central Government takes action against its own ministers who intervened, the issue is settled. The conspiracy theory you are creating is an insult to the deceased. Please be human first and then party apologist.

                            My question is - are'nt these dalits hindus - yes they are. Politicians such as Asadudin owaisi, Rahul Gandhi, Derek Obrien are at first trying to make it hindu-muslim issue and then within hindus - dalit and non-dalit issue. This is oppression of Hindus in the name of majority community by dividing them along castes. Look at the tolerance of this majority community. Despite being in so called majority of Hindus - the BJP (which is wrongfully accused for being a communal party and also wrongfully accused of a representative of only Hindus) has come to power for the second time only in the history of independent India. This shows two aspects - Hindus are divided on caste lines for votes by Congress and others. In this, divided community gets one more blow from an ever rising and highly volatile and aggressive Muslims. There are so many muslim nations and if you visit these muslim nations - hindus have no social space. However, we Hindus in majority never acted in unison and acted as Hindus when voting. Rather, politicians divided this majority group into castes and sub castes for votes. This has to stop. Congress and even AAP is doing the dirty work of dividing us into sub castes. In this fight, evil muslim such as Asadudin owaisi is trying to get more mileage for muslims by weakening the Hindus and contributing to the divide among Hindus on the basis of castes - and in this case - dalit and non-dalit. <br/><br/>
Rather - This is a case of student assaulting a fellow student. Investigation is necessary. Who is saying all these positive things - It is the ABVP and the BJP who are requesting all that do not make it a caste issue. For god sake - do not divide this relatively quiet and sobre Hindu community which is already suffering...<br/><br/>
But ROHITH and his so called sympathizers are anti national and anti social. Despite enjoying financial aid, reservation benefits - they demean the very Institution, NATION and their professors by indulging in these three well documented heinous, unlawful acts (1. assaulting a student, 2. making anti national slogans by supporting a criminal convicted by Supreme court of India). ALL three and the attempt to suicide are criminal offences in INdian penal code. Had ROhith been alive. HE WOULD BE CHARGED FOR these offences and be convicted. So, pressure to commit suicide was indeed on him as he knew his acts were wrong. So, this is why he did not blame anyone in his suicide note. Please read these facts before reaching any conclusion. <br/><br/>
ROHITH WAS AN ANTI NATIONAL AND ANTI SOCIAL being. CONDEMN HIS ACTIONS WITH FULL FORCE.. Condemn the division of Hindus by Congress - Appeal - Let us all unite as Hindustanis. Reject Congress and its allies...

Congress's Crwon Prince is without his inherited Crown. that is inconceivable to the Queen Mother of Congress. Gandhi/Nehru parivaar is born to rule Indian, they know nothing else. The leftists, just like the so called intellectuals with extreme left left leanings, just want crumbs from the Top Table of Congress. It keeps their King Sized egos going. They see themselves as better than all, other then the crumb throwers. If the crumb throwers stopped throwing crumbs......we can dream of a fair India. It will not be realised as long as One Family rule persists.

                            Dr. Chandan your argument suffers on a few counts, in both the murders/ deaths you mention there was a BJP MP/ minister involved and complaints have been registered. Why would that happen if there was no BJP hand in this. Also I wonder why your party has not highlighted the incident which happened in WB your home state where the TMC was clearly involved. The BJP was very effective and had even the media by their side when it was in opposition and was able to corner the congress for its corruption, why is it now crying fowl when the situation has reversed. It would do the BJP a world of good to focus on governance and deliver on your promise instead of diverting the attention of the public from the lack of growth by blaming the opposition. It is your party's job to deal with the issue politically and correct the perception that you claim. The argument seems to be week and signs of helplessness in reigning in your brigade

<div class="com_user_text">
                            Badri Narayanan - Biographer of "Dalit" Leader Kanshi Ram on the unfortunate event at Hyderabad says: "It is not a fight between Dalit Ideology versus Hindutva Ideology. But of radicalism of Dalit Ideology." Radicalism of any Ideology is not for betterment.<br/><br/>
Social justice and upliftment of oppressed sections is fundamental for the country's growth. It should be carried forward by the privileged community heartfully "as a duty and not as a moral obligation". Through spiritual sense and understanding, where all beings are fundamentally the same and all people have same aspirations and needs.<br/><br/>
Also the leader who killed himself said he was feeling empty (in the suicide note). Ideology not strengthening but weakening a person  from within to take an unwise decision is a questionable ideology. Either Ideology is not taking the right shape by creating strong intelligent individuals or the person who identified with the ideology didn't have the maturity to grasp the depth and breadth of the ideology, approaches and outcomes.<br/><br/>
A life has been lost in the name of an ideology which was politicized, but not humanized. May sense prevail and peaceful, intelligent and humane approach be followed for all thoughts and deeds for betterment and upliftment for the whole society.

                            Does Mitra want the opposition to be showering encomiums on this government? In any case, if not social unrest fanned in the name of beef, Ram Mandir, Church attacks, unprintable language used by ministers of the government and MPs, the state of economy is an indication of the efficacy of functioning of the government, which came to power only on the basis of high rhetoric, exaggerated promises and alleged infractions in the award of coal blocks and 2G spectrum by the ministers of the UPA. Did the BJP ever compliment the previous government on the good work-3g spectrum auction and realizations for example- even as many of the old schemes are being re-named and re-launched by the BJP government. The article betrays some sort of woolly-headedness and, also, lack of understanding of real politics. With Dal(pulse), vegetable and food prices sky high there is very little to crow about the performance of the government under very favourable conditions of historically low crude oil, commodity and food prices in international markets

If the government used the all time low price of oil to bring down the prices, its support by the middle class would not have worn out so quickly.  People expected many things from Modi.  Government should improve its perception by doing something may be even populist.

From ghar wapsi till today the ruling coalition have created such situations. If your coalition is already tainted as a casteist, minority hating group from decades back, its better to change the perception rather than walking the same road and getting defensive later.

Its very clear inyour own article "It has now been revealed that seven out of the at least nine students who committed suicide during the last decade on the Hyderabad University campus were Dalits! Where were the anti-BJP groups then? It is common knowledge that many students of this university are influenced by radical Left ideologies, but they never mounted such a feisty nationwide campaign when those Dalit students took their lives. Why would they? After all, the Congress was in power at the Centre for ten full years from 2004 to 2014 May"<br/><br/>

                            Dear Mr Mitra, What a jumble of truth with half truths and a bit of nonsense. <br/>
Firstly, let me say i wanted the BJP to come to power and voted for them. But people like you come along and distort info. Let me remind you that Mohd Akhlaq was killed by a bunch of rabid hindu guys. As news reports state , very much linked to the BJP. You cant deny the truth. The Hyd incident is very clearly a case of a BJP Minister writing to the Min HR and asking for justice to the BJP student wing. Much of what we are reading and hearing is clear to what extent the govt went to ensure these students were punished. Punished for a crime that has not been proved. And as news reports are bringing out was probably a figment of imagination. Dont take us all citizens for a ride !!!

                            Instead of whining, Dr. Mitra needs to understand that the Congress is deftly exploiting the BJP's reputation by using the media effectively. The counter to this is to condemn quickly - for example, the delayed and weak condemnation of Dadri has cost the BJP a lot of support. Delay in condoling the death of Rohith has put the BJP in an awkward situation. And finally, many in the RSS and BJP have helped the Congress. Dealing with them swiftly is critical - expelling them, telling Mohan B to shut up in public is important.

                            To the Author ---<br/><br/>
(1) No other murder of student(s) is under news scan --- Sir, this is not simple suicide. The same student was discharged from all accusations - but your minister could not accept the judgement and forced the university to act to his play by pushing pressure through another "Minster"<br/><br/>
(2) It is true that current BJP government is incapable to rule --<br/>
   (a) PM travels already more than half of the world -- but no foreign investment so far in reality-everything we hear is the promise.<br/>
   (b) India is assembling parts to make fighter plan and other military equipment - yet suddenly Minister declare India would buy from Indian company first-- why do we need to hear this lies <br/>
  (c) What did the Education "Minster" last several months other than speaking against Rahul Gandhi and placing RSS people at the topmost positions.<br/>
  (e)Why one after another celebrity speak against intolerance and lack of freedom for speech - does every single person is Congress "Chamcha" or they are Pakistanis<br/>
  (f)Even in USA till today, there are so many people belief that 9/11 was a Governmental conspiracy - but no politician, small or big did not tag them as anti national. Why BJP can not admit any opposition - <br/>
  (g) Why we Indian are still paying so much for petrol and diesel -- why government is putting more and more new taxes to keep the price of gasoline higher?<br/>
  (h) In which advance country, we see more than 22% tax to eat outside --- <br/>
  (i) In which country we see a lawyer as a Finance Minister, a "one day Yale Graduate" as Education Minster and so on---<br/>
  (j) In which civilized country, we see a PM is cursing previous government on his foreign trip -- have we seen any foreign delegates push their national political agenda while visiting India - did Obama curse Bush? - why our PM does not have political decency?<br/>
  (k) If India is shinning, then why dollar is more expensive (68 vs 58) than two years ago?<br/>
  (l) why we have to hear that anyone voting against BJP should go to Pakistan and that from responsible BJP people<br/><br/>

We have seen last 60 years of UPA rule, what was accomplished  ? just throwing nation close to brink of extinction, hitting corruption level to  all time peaks scared hell out of everyone to do any business in india. So i am patient enough to wait to give another 10-15 years for current government  minimum,though its not required we are already seeing the significant progress. From what i am seeing the ones who enjoyed special privileges during 60 years they are the  only ones opposing strongly because there payrolls were cutdown. They are used  to luxuries under corrupt rule. I can understand there frustrations..

It had the cleanest of all cities. It had no terrorist attacks. it had no corruption. Everybody was very honest.The media was upright in its reporting. No  politician was corrupt. No political-business man nexus. No rapes. the forex reserves were in trillions, every village had electricity, best roads, education and farms were full of grain. No farmers suicides, no dalit suicides, no hindu muslim riots. the owaisis were very secular. Everybody was rich in this country. everybody was healthy in this country. No price rise. No shortage of food, no shortage of medicines, no muslim ghettos, everybody was equal before law. it didnt matter whose son in law u were... if u did wrong u were prosecuted. All this happend in the country in the past 66years. It is only after the BJP came to power and Modiji became the PM.. India lost all of this  and now its hell... this should silent the secular/left brigade. jai Hind

                            To intervene at a university campus and leave such a strong paper trail of that intervention when the matter was already sub judice smacks of very incompetent handling of the issue. The issue isnt whether this govt is pro or anti Dalit. The issue is one of competence. Is getting involved in university politics the best that two of its union ministers can do to display their competence? Clearly there are Dalit fault lines in this country as Rajeev Malhotra writes in its book 'Breaking India' but one would have expected the govt to have handled it more adroitly to address and repair those fault lines. Instead it stooped to this. No wonder Arun Shourie calls this govt the most dis empowered in the history of India

                            Scores of Dalit students committed suicide in Hyderabad University from 2001 onwards, mostly during UPA rule.  NONE, including the MEDIA cared.  Now, 1 year into NDA rule, same unfortunate thing happened again.  A boy, who, instead of utilizing the chance he got to bring up his family and himself to a better position, got involved in what most would say anti-national activities (yes, raising slogans like "every house will produce an Yakub Memon" is what a sane Indian would call anti-national) committed suicide under UNKNOWN circumstances.  No one knows, or cares to know, what the boy's own friends in ASA (Ambedkar Students Association) were up to in the few hours before the tragic incident.  Did he really commit suicide or was he forced into it by his own ASA colleagues?  No one has answers to this, but who cares for answers as long as BJP can be shown as inept.<br/><br/>
As for Chandan's whining, the BJP deserves every bit of it.  A party that is unable to expose the plans of opposition parties, and take it to the common man, surely deserves it.

                            @: I think the Ministers are not be blamed. The matter was a skirmish between 2 students group namely ASA and ABVP. ASA made the ABVP president make an apology for his comments on facebook calling them hooligans.<br/>
ABVP being well connected, tried to get at the ASA by taking the matter to Centre and got the 2 Ministers to intervene. It was the Executive council that succumbed to the pressure when they suspended the 5 students instead giving some wrap on the knuckles to the 5 students. Withholding their stipend was a bad idea since the students had humble background.Maybe a 15 cut in stipend for a month or 2 would have served the purpose.After the letter to the VC, the EC and the VC should have got into action and resolved the matter.After all the students were not some hardcore criminals.<br/><br/>
Solution<br/>
VC and the EC members to go on 1/2 pay for 6 months. Rohit's family to be paid Rs.10 lac and the other students atleast Rs. 50k each. The money to be paid should be atleast 75% from University fund and rest 25% from EC/VC contribution.

In every field, in studies, in streets, in politics, and in dying and living On the night of January 17th 2016, a young, highly talented student of Hyderabad Central University killed himself leaving behind a note from which I have excerpted the lines given above. The death of Rohit Vemula is the 11 suicide on the Campus of the University and in none of the earlier cases was there any show of concern. In 2008, Senthil Kumar a former student of Pondicherry University who was pursuing his Ph D in Physics killed himself. His complaint was that even after 2 years a Research Supervisor was not allocated to him. In sheer frustration he killed himself. In that instance there was clear and valid grounds for holding the University accountable for neglecting deliberately or otherwise, its academic function. However the Congress was in power then and the whole controversy was hushed up. I am only pointing out to the fact that public outrage in India is getting more and more selective with political parties jumping into the fray and milking the tragedies for their own narrow partisan political ends. Since the tragedy,HCU has seen a steady spate of high profile visitors including the heir apparent of the dynastic fascist party. As someone associated with Higher Education and one who has successfully guided three scholars from the SC community for their Ph D, I think I have something to say. SC people have been discriminated and there is absolutely no feeling in the University circles of harming their interests. In fact, I have had to hold special classes in order to bridge certain shortfall particularly in the skill of academic writing and all the three Ph D scholars are teaching in Universities and colleges. SC students are sensitive and so one must not and should not draw attention to their caste in any manner. Unfortunately in the identity marinated post colonial theoretical formulations that pass off as Social Sciences, Identity is not only valorized and "foregrounded" but students are socialized to believe that there can be no justice and their efforts are doomed. The Academic Community, particularly the post colonial Social Scientists are adept at creating a miasma of hopelessness which SC students find extremely disconcerting and they start embracing identity based politics in the hope that it would deliver a better world. Unfortunately, identity politics as we now know only leads to violence and death and it is unfortunate that Rohit Vemula died and his suicide note rightly draws attention to the futility of identity politics: A man reduced to his immediate identity. The University Administration has mishandled the whole tragic affair. From published Newspaper accounts it is clear that there was a scuffle between Rohit and his Ambedkar Student Association and the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. The issue at hand was the alleged namaz offered by Rohit and his friends to Yakub Menmon, the terrorist who was executed for his role in the Bombay Blasts that killed 185 people. The constant need to take adversarial positions in the name of fighting "majoritariaism" is a sine qua non of Campus politics of the sort HCU is now acquiring a global reputation. By no stretch of the imagination is protest against the execution of a convicted terrorist a right of a student. Even so, the University could have been more circumspect. Since the Vice Chancellor, one Sharma was laying down office and a new one, Appa Rao was to take charge, the matter was kept pending. In the meanwhile the ABVP student who was allegedly roughed up, underwent a surgery which was probably related to if not triggered by the result of the assault. The Union Labour Minster Shri Datatreya was approached and he wrote a letter in which he drew attention to the protest organized by ASA against the hanging of Yakub. His letter in no way can be construed as an interference in the University as he only sought information about the action taken. If the University had just written saying that an Inquiry was constituted and the guilty were identified and punished, the matter would have ended there. Instead, the University just sat on the letters by not replying and in late September 2015, one Appa Rao, at the behest of Shri Venkaiah Naidu was appointed. If there is anyone individual to be blamed it was this man. Unfortunately, the BJP as a Party and the Central Government are being dragged into this mess because of the stupidity of this one man, Appa Rao. Instead of just saying that the students have been suspended he again sat on the letters from the Ministry. Meanwhile as is routine MHRD kept sending letters and each was escalating the level of official response. Appa Rao constituted yet another Inquiry and decided to rusticate 5 students including Rohit Vemula. The legitimacy for this course of action was given by the so called Proctorial Board. Appa Rao mis handled the situation and has created a huge crisis for the BJP and the Central Government. When earlier the stdents were suspended, now they were thrown out of the Hostle and their fellowship cut. This ignorant vice chancellor did not allow himself any escape route and is now dragging the Hon'ble Minister of Education into the mess he has created. The student Rohit Vemula identified himself as an SC belonging to the Malla caste to which his mother belonged. His father was from another caste. His identity as an SC student is clearly proved by the certificate he produced and so to evade accountability by bringing in the caste of his father is both cruel and unnecessary. His father had deserted the family very early in life and the mother had brought him up. Now the scholarship is important because every SC student that I have taught sends a major chunk of the fellowship to the family back home. Obviously Appa Rao was unaware of the implications of his decisions and he like most University administrators had a thick skin and head. It will not help to muddy the waters by now claiming that Rohit was not an SC. I do not use the term dalit ans it creates more confusion. SC and ST are legal and constitutional terms, not dalit. Dalit identity is a constructed identity not a natural one as Rohit realized just before his death. HCU has had a history of discriminating against SC students and this is clearly established by the fact that out of the 11 suicides over as many years 10 belonged to the SC category and one Muslim. Unfortunately the hegemonic post colonial discourse in Indian Universities will rob SC people of the ability to understand and conceptualize the existential situation they face and even deprive them of the ability to fight back claiming the legal protection given by the State. The post colonial trash bags in the form of social scientists who promote their individual agenda in Universities are essentially to be blamed.

                            Dr Mitra, I am not interested in an incident of a suicide over which people are playing politics. However, as somebody who voted for Modi, I am dissatisfied with the way this government is just sleeping &amp; not making any improvements. We see slogans &amp; speeches but would like to see action by the government on the various aspects affecting the Indian economy. So far, apart from a high profile foreign policy which has reduced India to a nation that does not even insist on Pakistan taking action against terrorists who attack India with impunity, I am yet to see any action.
