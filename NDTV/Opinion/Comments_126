                            Ashutosh, I am surprised how did you get your first job and then how a media house with stature of NDTV can even allow views like the one express to be published , until unless it's a advertisement. Help me to understand a series of questions 1. How a city with over crowded buses can adopt  such policy and force people to commute in a specific way 2. What happens to millions of people who commute late night and work in a offshore service centers like BPO , who usually change day between arrival and departure from office due to night shift. 3. How a person going on a weekend vacation is going to follow the logic .  4. I lave lived in Singapore and NYC, not sure you can even do a public transport comparison with Delhi in yeRs to come 5. Why cannot court order on the old vehicles be applied and banned from road who are major pollutant 6. Why cannot you provide zero tax on hybrid and electric cars.        I am sure you or any political party would not answer these as it does not help the populist culture

Proper pedestrian ways , over bridges and a proper public transportation system will help too. It is easy to say do not use cars but it is not practical as every one does not just go to and fro from office to home. In business time is money. People can say things for effect but this is reality

But still, how will Delhi's public transport stand up to  it for two weeks? Metros in delhi might be the best i India, but they are overcrowded during peak hours. Even doubling the capacity wont do anything for meeting a big challenge like this.

                            The idea is very good measure to control the pollution but you should really understand what is causing the pollution level to reach beyond the limits. It's not only private cars making air polluted but industries, autos, taxis as well. Moreover your opinions doesn't resemble a common man's opinion. It looks you already aware the frequency of metro and buses needs to be increased. Without doing it how you are expecting people to come out forward to get rid of their private transportation ? Truth is people are not comfortable with public transport for some reasons... Until you find these reasons and resolve, you can't change the people. One question, are the pollution level from industries in and around Delhi under limits? Was there any study done on it?

                            Well its good to see u guys r trying to take some action but plz do a thorough analysis before claiming something might help.Delhi is not a safe city where women can use public transport at late evening.Moreover its good for them who have many cars and can switch between them(nd if u r nt aware abt the wealth of Delhi people then FYI there r many people who will buy a new car rather take a metro)..this will hit hard on those people who hv a single car and use it for dropping kids to school or wife to office and then for themselves...it will also hit hard on those who hv a single car nd hv to travel at night with their families...Moreover what about people coming from other cities they can't bring two cars and dnt come for business for a week that they can afford sitting idle for a day...Travelling on metro is not that easy and convenient and i don't understand hw cum u even got a seat during the office hours in a metro let alone read a newspaper..NT POSSIBLE...i've been to delhi as an outsider and if i'm on business for a day its not that easy to use public convenience...Simply tryong to copy what paris or Beijing did first try to find out whether it suits your city or not

Apart from Metro, DTC buses are one of the worst I have seen in my life. How can you even rely on them? You cannot implement this just cannot.

                            Mr. Ashutosh, <br/>
 I used to live in Beijing before when this policy was implemented. In todays scenario i feel it would not be as effective as the people who use their private vehicles to commute have 2 -3 vehicles in possession, which will have either even or odd registrations. so people will pull out alternative vehicle on alternative days. So personally feel will not reduce pollution on Delhi streets as it did not got reduced in Beijing either which is one of the most populated cities of the world.<br/>
if we look in to the problem, we can observe that endless traffic jams on the road lead to more pollution, moving cars or automobiles running on cng or petrol cause less pollution. So rules can be made that during peak hours trucks or other heavy vehicles should not ply on the roads except for few hours in the noon and then after 10 in the night. This concept is widely followed world wide. Only in India we can see loories,trucks moving with the passenger vehicles same time on same road. This will surely reduce congestion on roads and traffic will become fast moving creating less pollution. Plus citizens and especially children can be prevented from inhaling toxic fumes. PLs. give it a thought.

                            Good way to control the pollution. Also like the decision to close Badarpur Power Station. It was worst even in late 80's and no one tried to improve. <br/>
But let the Pollution control checks be intensified to attack the real problem. No need to punish the guys who drive pollution controlled vehicles.

                            Odd/Even car formula is a good measure and should be supported by the car owning/using public voluntarily. Problems that this scheme will face are following:-<br/>
1. Police Commissioner for bureaucratic and attitudinal reasons. Or say, the problem of self-imposed restriction of exclusivity and hierarchy by the Indian bureaucracy that emanates out of the strictest possible straight jacketing of authority that includes all its wings. The attitude that says: Anyone who is not the authority over me is subordinate to me and therefore the CM - so what if he is elected- must seek appointment with the Commissioner and seek His advice; and also of the LG, before his mates (MLAs) make something that they call a law. Excuses like manpower or briefing etc. is hogwash; where there is will there is way.<br/>
2. My Bad culture. Car is not just a mean of travel; it is my social arrival report.It is also my status symbol. It is my announcement that I am Middle Class.  I once suggested to a colleague (a retired IAS officer) cribbing about his driver (privately hired after his retirement) to travel by Metro instead. He pulled a long face; his eyes were widened; his mouth was half open in astonishment; his nostrils worked rapidly and they all allowed him to let out a single word in disgust: Metro!! I need a cultural shift that is not easy to come unless I am a volunteer for the change. So there will have to be appeals from the Government; not only from Arvind or Gopal, but also from LG Saheb, PC Saheb and some more Sahebs. The trick is  to appeal to the Heart and not to the Mind. Challaning by the police will not do; that will create much problem for the police and the public. Only turning the errant back from the u-turn with a chit fevicoled on his vehicle announcing "returned home by the Eco-police" may answer the purpose.  <br/>
3. Our public transport is not bad; it is only too crowded. I have been travelling in all kinds of buses and the Metro. They are all too crowded. If you get more buses, they will take the place of the missing cars, but one fifth or one-tenth. Get my Middle Class some luxury buses with higher tickets. My quest for exclusivity over the "riff-raff" will be settled. I can boast I travel in "Executive Special Common Cars." Besides, Metro is not all that riff-raffy. Some of my cousins do travel in that. I have heard them discussing in English how bad a journalist Ashutosh is and why a topless Putin is fond of horse riding. They aren't even apologetic  for travelling in the Metro. So some shift is there already.. some more is needed.<br/>
4. All good things in the environment of Delhi have been caused by the Judiciary. Delhi Govt is lucky to get personal approbation of the CJI on the issue of the Odd-Even traffic. Hyperbole aside, some of my middle class cousins actually need an excuse to switch over to the public transport. This decision will help them follow their wish. <br/>
5. I am sure it will click. Do it whole heatedly. Do it well; all else will follow.

                            I appreciate the effort and thinking of odd-even formula for private cars, but before that what AAP govt. is doing to handle the most pollutant vehicles, Cabs, commercial vehicles, govt. vehicles, PhatPhat sewa and above all your dear Autos. I agree most Delhites are irresponsible for environment but majorly these commercial vehicles are totally ignorant and indifferent for vehicle maintenance and PUCs. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE AND PLANNED TO NAIL THEM, Your vote banks?<br/>
Being VIP an traveling on Metro is good fun and add to your Political value and mileage.<br/><br/>
Delhi govt. need to educate and implement first where it hurts most, look at pathetic facilities of PhatPhat sewa, irresponsible vehicle maintenance, pollution totally out of control but so called, GAREEB / POOR people are your vote bank and you will not take any steps to teach and control this category.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately your this article is not read by those who are major contributor to chaos and pollution in Delhi and ODD-EVEN formula will not work for them as they will take out SOLUTIONS to handle it as well, in no-times.

                            It would be amusing to read your arguments if it were not so tragic for us and a direct hit to the livelihood, lives and freedom of the common man.  Car pooling??? Are you people only catering to babus who sit all day in an office?  What about those who have to move around from place to place or client to client?  Try getting an auto / taxi from any place to any other in Delhi in rush hour.  What about those who have to carry any items of luggage with them?  So now I cannot even plan an overnight trip in my car because I cannot come back the next day.  What metro are we talking about?  What happens if one has to go to a place it does not cover?  What about those who work hard and late and need to come back after midnight?  What if I have to go to a family member or friend in an emergency?  And all emergencies are not medical, so please do not ask me to take an ambulance.<br/><br/>
For years the pollution problem has been allowed to fester and then all of a sudden you have these drastic decisions without any alternative to people whatsoever.  In Singapore you can get a cab anytime to anywhere.  You are in power, we voted for you, and now you do not spare a thought for how it can ruin the lives of people.<br/><br/>
Extremely disappointing, put in without any thought being applied to how it will affect people.

Because in commercial vehicle Union become the stakeholder.<br/>
Govt vehicle because they themselves will be effected<br/>
Public transport are already overcrowded.<br/><br/>
Main reason for pollution are:<br/><br/>
Pollution making industries.<br/>
Thermal power plants.<br/>
Due to Jams in crossing or road due to bad roads or improper traffic management.<br/><br/><br/>
The odd and even vehicle plying instruction is like Tuglakmani instruction who invented leather coin and it was total disaster.<br/><br/>
Benefit for:<br/>
Auto and taxi as more people will avail this.<br/>
Auto company as per vehicle will be sold more. be it taxi company or private vehicle each person having both even and odd vehicle.<br/><br/><br/>
More polluting vehicles are diesel. What decision they have taken on this? none. What about Generating set in all commercial as well as Govt office? none. <br/><br/>
The decision of odd and even vehicle plying taken because this is most simple as common person cannot say or do anything. That  too if court say so.

                            Crazy Idea in a City like Delhi,  the Metro is chocked up the DTC is dilapidated no link service from Metro.  This is absolutely a crazy Idea,  what if people have two cars with  even and odd numbers? Instead of addressing the real issue of increased pollution in Delhi the government is getting into crazy ideas. It shows the quality  of the people ruling the State of Delhi. The real increased cause pollution, of course one is the  change of weather, the other is that all along Delhi this government has allowed people to set up shops on foot paths, the waste consisting of recycled plastic glasses, bags, tobacco pouches and leaves  are collected and burned everywhere by these people, Road crossings are encroached upon and vehicles get piled up. In the morning today at 8.00 I have seen in a stretch of about 5 kms from Mayur Vihar Phase III to Mayur Vihar Phase I , at  13 places people were burning these materials on the road side.  Stop encroachment on footpaths and crossings, enforce strict laws for burning materials on road side on anywhere, half of this problem will be over. Mr. Ashutosh, on the shahadara main drain, every year descaling of the drain is done, what come  out of the drain is mostly plastic materials which are never collected or disposed off, it get burnt and surely in winter the uneducated and poor people burn it so  is that there are thousands of drug addicts who roam around.

The intention is good but not properly planned.  My suggestion:<br/><br/>
1.  About 35000 vehicles are added in Delhi every month.  Govt. must fix the number f additions allowed.  Bring in the concept of certificate of eligibility for these additions wherein the bidders bid for CoE.  This system will make the cost of ownership much higher and deter people from buying vehicles.

                            For once Asutosh is espousing a good cause.  The thrust of the campaign must be to reduce the number of cars on the road rather than the odd or even number cars.  Incentivise people to car pool or use alternative means of transport rather than force them with odd or even car numbers.  If in a family there are 3 or 4 cars but if they all have even or odd number plates due to astrological or numerology then all of them might not be able to use cars on the same day. So plus given the comments received i dont think there are sensible people around and forcing them might not help as they will find a way around and so pleading with them and making them realise would be the better option

                            Ashutosh, a good effort by AAP. However, the root cause for this problem is many many fold increase in Delhi population. Delhi has grown beyond its carrying capacity. Beijing introduced even-odd formula to restrict cars for sure and it was a success too. But it also stopped migrants from settling in Beijing. Would you be bold enough and introduce compulsory registration of migrants in Delhi and restrict number of people who could settle in capital each year.

                            Nothing will work if you have a negative thought. First vote for well qualified people to run the country. Treat them as an employee. Get rid of them if they cannot perform. Ministers and MPs are not Gods, they are elected public servants. Stop talking and get to work.

                            Delhi has had Mohammed bin Tughlaq in the past. The same has been repeated. What does government, politicans and environmentalist think, that people  drive cars for fun on Delhi road. No sir, they drive it for their rozi-roti.<br/>
Transportation is essential for modern life - as essential as clean air. You can not block transportation at the cost of clean air. <br/>
People use their cars because the public transportation is not available or feasible. India is a poor country. Curbing use of the car is going to make us poorer and not make air cleaner.

                            Bring the public transport system to a usable level for the population, make road pedestrian and cycle friendly, ensure last mile connectivity and integrate all modes of public transport, you won't have to worry about even-odd.

                            A person can afford two cars with odd and even numbers and easily defeat the system. Only middle class people who cannot afford a second vehicle will be forced to depend on the poor public transport. Aam Admi Party is trying to help 'Khaas Aadmi' a smooth sail on the roads?

                            Sorry if I missed something, but why doesnt the govt limit the number of vehicles you can have in a family (living together). No more than 2 (or 1) cars in a household?

                            This is not good to promote automobile industry at the cost of people's hardship; there are other ways to earn commission. People may willingly accept this type of hard ship if it really solves the problem of pollution but it will prove just another farce as cap movement and source of commission for some people. What happen to CNG, where we spend millions and millions, does it solve the problem. The pollution is there because of higher density of population per square feet area and unless and until we relocate the source of employment, it will not solve the basic problem of pollution. Mean time if we keep the difference of two hour in the opening and closing timings of different govt., and private establishments including schools and markets may significantly reduced the current pollution level.
