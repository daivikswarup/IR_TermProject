                            For them end justifies the means. Strange is the lust of power. The two ideologically opposites are up to a arrangement which signifies opportunistic setting. Free ( Mufti ) is   ride. So the plight of Kashmir is undergoing the experimentation of two stake holders.

                            Politicians and experts can give suggestions and advices to currently running government instead always have blogs or nice articles on what the issues happened. Its obvious that comments for president rule and currently optimistic government formation discussion s.  Just to know during floods time where is the local governance in JK.

                            Mr. Omar Abdulla has flare for good writing. He should change career &amp; keep writing. At least that will keep him busy for next few years.

                            Omar there were no tweets in the times of you and your father as you guys were doing pretty same thing all these years. You too have ruled over the miseries of wonderful people of Kashmir.

                            Mr Omer being the politician he is also one nice story maker. I happen to use the flight tracker app too and different radars give information online about the transponder information of the aircrafts accept Srinagar Radar which is controlled by Airforce. So I can safely presume that Omar Abdullah didn't take out his mobile phone while being stuck on a traffic signal and pointed it towards the sky from his car rather I should say a cavalcade of six to seven cars you have in Delhi. Omar the height speed and vector needed to head north for srinagar is not fixed permanently that you would know. It depends on the type of the aircraft the weather and the flight level assigned. So typically sitting in delhi anywhere if look at the sky there are several flights well it's amazing that you were able to point out one  which was just climbing to cruise altitude of let's say 30000 ft at the rate of 1500 ft per minute it would take it 20 mins to get there and flying at eg a speed of 500 km per hour in 20 mins would cross over 150 Kms how on the earth did you see that flight just by pointing unless the same very CID didn't inform you from Srinagar Airport that the flight with a Tail no just landed in.Thus we all saw your tweet around 6 pm same time the flight landed. Omar come out of this childish self and get to business.

                            Day by day RSS is ruling India as its fiefdom. It has no qualms in misusing state machinery for its political purposes. We know how Modi used PM position to drum up support and Sanghize every NRI . Its really shameful we are becoming banana republic.

                            Ha ha.... blame the App. arrest the developer and cancel the distribution of the app. Life will be back to normal again. Can there be any charges filed against Omar for snooping on a ruling party functionary? what if he was plotting some thing serious :)
