                            Since Rohit Vemula's death, I have been trying to understand the underlying meaning of his suicide note. Every time I read it, it sounded very different to me. Each time it was as convincing as much as confusing. Your brilliant analysis as well as the context of study circles has helped me in addressing some of my questions and confusions about his note. While it is extremely unfortunate that our society has killed an exceptional individual like Rohit, I hope and pray that our universities pay attention to your suggestion to moderate healthy dialogue  between ideological groups/study circles without politicising the discourse. Thank you!

                            I don't understand. It is the students from the 'General' catgory who are at the receiving end of this quota system but it is those who are benifitting the most that are complaining. Even with the lowest of marks they are still able to get into the best instituions and all their future generations can too.<br/>
No wonder the Nadellas and the Pichais are leaving this country for good. At least they are valued outside this country for their merit.

                            It is an sad irony that Rohit Vamula's suicide letter is being largely and conveniently being misinterpreted casteism perpetrated by forwards against SC/ST. Everyone I repeat EVERYONE including this writer is singing the same tune. A careful analysis of the suicide letter reveals that Rohit was overwhelmed, frustrated and dejected by the challenges faced by children of Non-SC/ST fathers and SC/ST mothers like himself. This is because of a outdated and sexist Indian law that presumes that If a child's father is forward caste then the child will also be automatically considered the same caste regardless of the mothers SC/ST category. This was exactly what Rohit's situation and even worse because his dad abandoned him. Even though Rohit did not get the presumed benefit of having sired by a Non-SC/ST father because he apparently abandoned him and his mother,  he still could not avail the quota reserved for SC/ST's because of his fathers caste. Everyone from RG to AK to CPI are conveniently milking this sad situation to polarize the voters and keep the caste cauldron boiling. It is a shame that not one opposition politician has demanded fixing the oddity of the law.

                            Author has tried to carefully put the discrimination shown by upper castes as something flowing from the  teachings of Vivekananda. Why don't you admit that, in doing so, you are only a casteist but a sophisticated one! Can you please point out where in his teachings Vivekananda touched upon varna system or upheld it? How did you conclude that Dalits are opposed to Vivekananda teachings? The student groups are opposed to caste systems and caste discrimination which is what Ambedkar fought for and Vivekananda has never referred to..

Someone with the intellect of this guy could just focus on his academic pursuits and never bring up his roots in any conversation. I have also not personally experienced anyone asking what my caste is before they decide how they will treat me. If someone does ask, I usually tell them I am human!

                            No doubt dalits suffering is immense since the immemorial time . But it is unfair to punish the present generation of non-opressed people. All the so called dalits are enjoying privileges are just because they comprise big chunk of total population and  play decisive role in outcome of the results of elections. It is for this this reason dalits are consistently enjoying favour of governments since Independence. Despite all possible support dalits are not improving implies that they will remain climber and will newer become tree . So we have to have a new relook to this policy of upliftment and save resources and prevent rift between co inhabitants who feel oppressed.Specially when there is no guaranty how long this reservation will  remain.

                            I appreciate reading Prof. Nair's thoughtful prose and look forward to reading her column. However, this particular column as well written and expressive as always, raised a serious question in my mind. Swami Vivekananda was a great Hindu reformer, and as such criticized the caste distinctions of his day. He saw all humans with the divine light inside them. I would expect that a Vivekananda Study Group would follow Swamiji's teachings and consider all human beings as equals. So why is there a hint of opposites between Vivekananda and Ambedkar Study Groups?

                            One day we will have a Ph.D thesis written on Rohith Vemula and why he committed suicide. Rukmini Bhaya Nair has read more into his suicide note than he probably intended. To place emphasis on Vivekananda Study Circles for the upper castes and Ambedkar Study Circles for the lower castes is divisive, and not to be encouraged. The social tensions of modern India are reflected in its universities. As and when India becomes a homogeneous social unit, then and then only will our universities stop fermenting on the basis of caste and community. Rohith is not the first young student to have committed suicide, nor will he be the last. His suicide has been politicised, and that was not necessarily to his advantage.

                            Dear Dr.Nair, The article is well-written and drives home a good point to allow students to make "comparative" study of different ideologies. I felt you could have been a bit more forthright and direct on emphasising that Swami Vivekananda and Baba Ambedkar are two sides of the same inclusive society. Ambedkar himself underwent a total transformation during the last phase of his life ( becoming a Buddhist ) and so his earlier writings need to be reinterpreted, with his changed mindset and views on society. People like myself , educated in a Theosophical school , knew how to respect all religions from a very young age . Entering college / university was a cultural shock but our strong value of based education has stood the test through out my life - over five ++ decades. It is the lack of value based education / comparative knowledge of religions / social systems that is a disadvantage to render likes of Rohith Vemula to resort to avoidable acts of desperation. This young man needed good / balanced counselling at his age but unfortunately none in that University could provide that. And the only one group that he got identified with gave a slanted view and drove him to confusion and depression. Sad state of affairs indeed. Incidentally, suicides don't make anyone immortal- philosophically , it is a route to be avoided and not resorted to gain attention. Regards. Raghava.

                            I read his suicide note, he did not sound anywhere that he was committing suicide because of caste issues. The articulate way the note is written, does not seem to me like a  guy with really troublesome past was involved.<br/>
Around the same time 3 muslims burn alive a rag picker in Pune and not a single political party said anything, since I have seen very closely how police efficiently controls a dire religious situations that may arise in such cases, hats off to Pune police. The Hyderabad police may have deliberately  failed to control this case. A thorough investigation in the Rohit's case may shade light as to whether this is a political murder conspiracy.<br/>
I really admire Ambedkar and his work... have a lot of SC/ST friends...and never realized any different treatment to those friends not only at my home but at any other place. If you are really an admirer of B.R. Ambedkar, one can not just give up on what they start to achieve, but you make sure to be a brave heart and get it. At least that's how I look at Ambedkar. Look at the facebook postings of this guy....you can say a frustrated guy committed suicide and political parties are making an issue to turn votes on their side. wastage of time....

                            I do not think B R Ambedkar would oppose the ideology of Swami Vivekananda. Swami Vivekananda certainly wanted to see the upliftment of everybody (including the Dalits). Anybody can read what he said. Without the development of Dalits and all the oppressed we can never be a prosperous country.<br/><br/>
I think caste system does exist and caste based discrimination happens. But the solution is education and skill development. That is the approach the present government is taking and I think this is the right way. Once we have a lot of opportunity for everybody, these problems will disappear automatically. Until then we would need reservation. However this needs to be reviewed every few years to make it effective. <br/><br/>
Leftist ideologues would like to keep this discrimination to keep themselves relevant. They talk about intolerance, but they are the most intolerant and divisive force in this country and it is very obvious now. Congress, AAP, communist everybody is going to Hyderabad and trying to put the blame to RSS and BJP. But the fact is, RSS and BJP are trying to unite and it is them who are trying to divide. <br/>
I wonder if a group of student starts supporting a convict of Mumbai blast, can we term them nationalist? I think the government has a right to crack down on anti national forces (be it Islamic fundamentalist or ultra leftists). However this has nothing to do against the Dalits.

                            Dear Mr Upper caste bigot, nice attempt at diverting the issue which is being nicely swallowed by your upper caste/swavarna readers. In spite of not having the benefit of the quote, Rohith was doing well and got admitted to the PhD program in a good university, not bad for a first generation learner. He made it clear in an earlier letter that the discrimination and abuse he suffered as a Dalit (that is how he and others identified him) and as a member of the Ambedkar students association that drove him to suicide. In fact in his letter written less than two months before his suicide, he asked the VC for some poision or rope so that Dalit students can kill themselves. The VC ignored that letter. Get rid of the hatred in your heart first and then try to understand how horrendously Dalits are treated all over India TODAY and not just in the past. The days of upper caste dominance in India is over. If people like you don't learn this lesson using democratic means, then other means will need to be adopted.

Except imagined things, the author has not cited examples of Rohith's activities that can show what type of person he was. Why the author has shied away to analyze Rohith's mental status from medical point of view. It looks strange that Rohith was suffering from mental sickness but his friends didn't notice it. If Rohith had received medical treatment, he could be alive today.

Also, even at the IITs, we had a wide range of subjects in Humanities, including, History, Social sciences, literature, Art. One should see the way, the american universities teach diversity of knowwkedge. What is to blame is our awful college curricula, and the fact that now the RSSis playing mond games with students.

                            Indian law on inter-caste marriage and most high court judgements on the issue clearly give preference to the father's caste. Since Rohit's dad was not SC/ST, he had to overcome the 'burden of presumption" which is extremely tenuous, difficult and expensive to prove in court to avail the SC/ST quota. Based on his suicide letter, it is obvious that he was the victim of this unfortunate situation wherein his SC/ST status was constantly under question. As a tribute to Rohit Vemula, AK, RAGA and their Cummie comrades should bring a bill in the parliament to amend the misogynistic "father's caste to child" law. But I doubt they will because there is no political incentive in that. Instead they are all beating their 57 + inch chests to twist and milk the situation to divide the BJP's vote bloc.

And if is about the news that he was denied his fellowship, you please ask around, every research scholar gets their fellowship like the same way, I mean pause in between. It depends on the release of funds by the funding authority. If for that reason one commits suicide then there should be a serious doubt on his integrity and he may not be fit for research in India. And do not shout 'Dalit, Dalit, Dalit', if after so many years of pampering, one wants to be a 'Dalit' then so be it. Last but not least, every suicide note is touching if you read them all. Therefore, before making some out of proportion comments be very careful.

                            Casteism is a curse of our society where the ancient Varna system has been distorted over centuries. There have been significant improvements over last 25 yrs esp in urban and semi-rural areas and i dont think we bother about the caste of the person standing next to us in a local train , sitting in the table beside us in a restaurant or in the desk next to us in our office. <br/><br/>
However, the affirmative action programmes open ended nature and the continued and shrill rhetoric of backward victimsation as well as one sided laws incl SC/ST Act has created further alienation and a "us" against "them" syndrome. The Ambedkar circles are spreading the seeds of mass victimisation and are a breeding ground for creating schism and separatism on campus and in society which is exactly what we dont want. Also their rhetoric is further sharperned by counter societies like the Vivekananda society. (what a tragedy that both of India's greatest sons are used for narrow minded discourse) . Rohits suicide is very tragic and in my opinion avoidable if his so called friends had understood him better. If he was being punished for a alleged violent aact basis someones complain he should have been counselled by his friends and family to seek appropriate legal remedies (which for a PHD student would have been easy esp given recent stringent laws against SC/ST discrimination). The politicisation of Rohits suicide is very apparent with RSS offices being targeted for the protests when RSS and BJP has several workers from backward caste. Is it the Ambedkar societys argument that OBCs and baackward castes hate and discriminate against SC/ST. The caste cauldron has been completely poisoned by opportunistic politicians where each caste and sub caste is now just thinking of their benefits and entitlements.  <br/><br/>
In all this we unfortunately end up ignoring the growing angst of a significant number of meritoriuous students and professionals who despite coming from poor families and scoring high marks are left out due to the quota system

                            True.  Vivekananda and Ambedkar are not the opposite of each other.  Lot of politics.  But it is to be noted that the student identified himself vociferously as a Dalit only to ensure that the benefits that accrue are confirmed to him considering the dispute about his caste.  Here, he has been more selfish than socially conscious.  The dirty politics played in this episode only confirms the cheap mindset of our politicians and the media.

                            Rukmini Bhaya Nair has absolutely nothing about worthy of mention about the episode of violence that invited disciplinary action from the University? Why? Why are she and all the other banner bearers of social upliftment in India of the opinion that desecration of a university campus with violence is an inconsequential episode, not worth a pause or thought?<br/><br/>
It is ironical that academicians that profess their support for freedom of expression, find nothing wrong in ideological debates escalating into on campus violence. <br/><br/>
Institutions that have managed to uphold the ideals of openness and creativity (indeed Ms Bhaya Nair is part of one such institution) must have zero tolerance towards violence of any kind, regardless of the ideology that drives it. Hyderabad University's decision to bar the perpetrator's of violence from using the student hostel's is IMHO, the mildest disciplinary measure the university administration could have taken.<br/><br/>
Linking the university's actions with the reasons for Vemula's suicide, whatever they may have been, is disingenuity exalted to an art form. Ms Bhaya Nair, please don't go down that route. It does not look good on you or on IIT Delhi.

                            Before Rohit, the fake dalit died, 10 more real dalits made suicides in the same universities. Strangely no body talks about those suicides because they were in the congie rule not BJP rule.

                            Tagging humans with caste is just disgusting. India remains a backward nation until caste system is abolished completely

                            Let us not politisize a death of a student. I feel political parties and their affiliated unions should be banned from all educational institutions forthwith. Instead of studying students are politicking. As far as caste is concerned there are sufficient laws and legal safeguards and reservation has been in place for 67 years. Even then if there is state discrimination then something is wrong with the people who got appointed through reservation. Let us now do a self goal and hold a one year old government responsible for a social ill which other parties such as the congress could not set right after ruling the country for 57 years. let us desist from dividing ourselves into petty communities and castes and act as one nation...otherwise forget about any kind of meaningful socio-economic development ever.

                            It is sad that a young student's death is being politicized in such a manner. I would like to ask a simple question - there is reservation up to 50% for SCs/STs and OBC all put together in central government services, there is even larger reservation in some states like TN. This reservation has been in place for more than 6 decades for SCs/STs and more than 2 decades for OBCs. What are the so called socially and economically backward government officials in high places doing if SC/ST and OBC students are still being victimized? What are they doing if SC/ST and OBCs are being discriminated against even after so many years in villages and small mofussil towns and big cities? The constitution and the laws are there but no one seems to be implementing it? What a shame? Everyone has been empowered but still no one seems to be owning up for their failures? Where is the accountability? Congress and the Left and the Socialist have ruled the centre and the State for more than 57 out of the last 67 years after independence/ Where is the accountability on these political parties/ Where is the accountability on Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and on Lalu Prasad Yadav, Mamta Banerjee and on Devi Gowda and their so called secular brothers-in-arms / colleagues?

                            It is nice to note that the author has analysed the root cause so thoroughly. It shows, clear mind can still be visible amidst socio political chaos. Hats off to NDTV for its ability to pick this voice. I was saddened &amp; disturbed ever since we lost this boy. This country has seen great souls debate contrasting views in healthy tradition. Hope to see universities encourage real debate &amp; democracy and extricate from getting involved in unhealthy politics. I humbly appeal to all students to respect each other and move on with faith that the great country will correct itself.

                            But people like some hypocrites and sickulars forcing the young mind to choose their interest on their caste on on the basis of Indianness <br/>
or patriot. Indian intellectuals have too much of freedom and using it for person gain rather country's prospects.

                            I actually think he was motivated by social causes, including that of caste, but was used and consumed by student politics. He was wrong when he decided to beat up another guy. And I think perhaps he realized that but got caught up with the wrong crowd and at some point, it became impossible for him to get out of it alive. It is sad at many levels, but objectively, there are also many lessons of student politics, role of state (central and state govt.) in universities, caste politics, reservations and quotas, and politics of suicide that is typified in the behaviors of Kejriwal, TMC, Rahul Gandhi etc.
