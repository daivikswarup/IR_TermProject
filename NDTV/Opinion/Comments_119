                            Why US and its paid stooges are so shaky after Russia's entry into Middle East ? You were supposed to fight against ISIS and Russia is just lending a helping hand, why so bitter and paranoid ? Ohh wait....if US eliminates ISIS and brings prosperity and peace in Middle East, then who will buy weapons from their arms lobby which funds both Republicans and Democrats ? US should stop fooling around now, their bluff is over, everyone knows that they are engaging in shadow boxing with ISIS, it wants ISIS to thrive and create havoc in Middle East. But now its tentacles have reached the NATO countries (Read : Paris attack), hence US is feeling the heat from Europe. Putin with all his selfish reasons, is at least destroying these barbarians called ISIS. He is the only who has never been in bed with Islamic forces like Saudi Arabia let alone taking them head on. So all the humanitarians in the world should support Russia's actions in Middle East instead of these double faced hypocrites from NATO.

                            Yes, Russia is under economic hardships but so is US, Japan, France, Germany, UK, Canada etc. Be it due to plunging oil prices or geopolitics. Saying which Russia is far ahead of all these nations in terms of preparedness and self sufficiency. <br/><br/>
In Moscow, Nationalistic pride runs through their veins.So, as long as the people back the government which sorry to disappoint this US stooge is at a shattering 80%, Russia will continue to flurry great heights.

                            First of all Syrians should decide who should rule them. It is western powers who desire to decide who should rule in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya , Syria etc... etc.... Why? What is the difference in the nature of those rulers from that of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait etc... Can Colbert I. King explain?
