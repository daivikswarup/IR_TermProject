                            To me free basics is nothing but a ploy to become gatekeeper of internet which in turn will kill the entrepreneurship and plan for "make in India" as big corporations will ensure that smaller enterprises are blocked from "free" access and only the ones with deep pockets survive. This will have a negative impact on job creation as well.<br/><br/>
As suggested by Mr.Nandan Nilekani in an article recently, the government should created free internet subsidy via DBT mechanism and the big companies should be encouraged to contribute to the same to bridge "digital divide" in a transparent manner.

                            Good article. Now what are the steps that the government is going to take to ensure a free, fair and open internet to all Indian citizens? Over to DoT and TRAI.

                            Makes a lot is sense. We should not be made to pay more or have a sluggish experience while visiting some parts of the Internet. You've rightly said that the telcos should not act as he gate keepers of the Internet. And if the telcos have the financial interest in some sites or the apps, they definitely are going to push for making browsing those sites cheaper and faster for consumers. Govt and the TRAI needs to act fast and ensure that the Internet stays free and a level playing field is ensured for all.

                            Please stop the propaganda just because one Tel company has got the winning deal and others are crying foul now because the bus is gone. Why there is/was no voice, TV channel packages works same way today. You cannot buy for just the channels you want, you have to buy a whole package. Change that first.

                            Very well written. I also recollect that a senior scientist recently comments that Modi needs good advisers. Modi is surrounded by Patanjai marketing, that needs to change.
