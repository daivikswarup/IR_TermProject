                            Point is, if they did ask for independence, there would be civil, perhaps heated, discussions and debates and arguments. But will their government come down on them with their law enforcement tools, would they be slapped with sedition charges? Would the troll army come out to drown their voices, cower them, and tell them to go live in another country? Now do you understand the anguish of thinking Indians who are talking more and more about intolerance? This simple word is now making people go ballistic!!

Let him not forget that nationalism defined Europe for centuries and ultimately led to the terrible world wars. So, we do not need an Englishman preaching to us about listening to diverse opinions. Indian political discourse is inclusive and abhors any extreme sentiment. This is the reason, why, all political dispensations that may start out as revolutionary, ultimately settle down in to a smooth rhythm of give and take politics and compromising on their extreme positions. Any extremist position is naturally shunted to the extremities of the political landscape.

Many will be mainstream, some will not. And thats fine - it hasnt done any harm to the nation in all these decades since independence. <br/><br/>
However, if a mob is allowed to take justice into its own hands within a courtroom for two successive days in our capital city, and the judges and police stand by as mute spectators - that certainly shames the nation. It shows we are a country without the rule of law. Thats a damning indictment. <br/><br/>

I would draw your attention to the fact In India thousands of small communities with their cultures, languages, customs and religions are surviving and florishing for the last 7000 years under Indian Civilisation. Do not lecture India about humanity and morality. You are the scums of civilisation as you impose your system on others by creating a hubis that it is the best, which is not. Fact indicates otherwise. You and your ilks understand the language of force and after decimating your opponents preach peace.

                            Hello Prof Andrew:<br/>
I disagree with your views. India is known for its revolutionary leaders and visionaries who were first nationalists rather than any other "-ists". They themselves have been masters at what they studied and believed in core values. Unfortunately, that is NOT the current situation. In the name of socialism and communism the real core values have been long forgotten of equality and social justice. <br/><br/>
No one in India would have had an objection if there was a debate about a policy for example a death sentence (to anyone) but terming those who helped terrorists as martyrs and shouting against India - is completely unacceptable. UNACCEPTABLE. <br/><br/>
More Importantly, these "students"(?) play into the hands of those against India, sometimes, even unknowingly. If we do not nip it in the bud, it will spread - see what happened in Jadavpur university? <br/><br/>
To summarise - "Can India Really Not Cope With A Few Anti-National Slogans?" - a better question would have been "SHOUD India Really Not Cope With A Few Anti-National Slogans?" and the answer is NO NO NO.

                            The context of India's angst must be understood Mr. Whitehead. From Afghanistan to Japan, Indian thought (philosophy, art and math) and its indigenous religious beliefs (Buddhism, Hinduism etc) spread and co-mingled with the sciences, arts and faiths of the local population. Different strands of rich thought was developed. However, ever since the Judaic religions mainly Islam and to a certain extent Christianity started its assault on this rich tapestry, which started obliterating people who thought any differently, the trouble has started. Wherever, a fight was not put up entire communities have been wiped out - Hindus in pakistan and Bangladesh have all but disappeared in 50 years. The same happened in Indonesia and Malaysia 300 years ago. The Buddhists are under major attack by Christians in Korea, China and Japan (one of the key reasons why the North Korean state is propped up by China - to avoid the Christian evangelists overrunning South east China and North Korea).  Thailand, Srilanka, Burma Buddhists are under threat from Islamists and the list can go on. So, any seditious behaviour has existential dimensions in Indian mindset. This is not about Scotland and England coexisting as mainly white Christian neighbors.

                            I am sure the Students protesting about Vietnam War was not raising Anti-America Slogan. We have such protests on hourly basis and no one covers it. Having difference of opinion about an issue is different than raising anti-national slogan, that too when its a Free Country.

                            The question is not about coping, its about tolerating. Can't India cope with a few anti-national slogans? Certainly yes. A few anti-national slogans can't destroy a giant nation like India. But should a few anti-national slogans be tolerated? I don't think so.

                            Sound advice. But obviously this govt is intent on shooting itself in the foot. Opposition parties must be the happiest bunch around to have a political party thats running the central govt self-destruct like this within a couple of years of assuming power. The inexperience of Mr Modi in running a federal govt clearly shows in the handling of central universities. There were enough challenges as it is. Clearly this govt has bitten off more than it can chew with these kind of controversies. The sooner BJP restrategizes the better. It can either run the govt or run the RSS agenda but cant do both. It just doesnt have the mandate or even the skill for it

                            I understand your concern writer, but India and US are different. US has no threat to integrity. India is everyday facing this. From Kashmir to North-East, Punjab and many states ready to be divided into two, there are many internal threats. <br/><br/>
No need to create issue after issue each day. Once Aamir khan goes silent, then Rohith Vemula, then JNU. These students are just taking practical lessons to be a Congress or Left or BJP MLA/MPs.<br/><br/>

                            Fair enough.  Next time, when Sakshi Maharaj, or Yogi Adityanath open their mouth to exercise their right to freedom of speech, do NOT start whining.  Freedom of speech is applicable to NDA guys too.

                            Surely there is a difference in opposing your government especially if it is waging a war on distant shores and advocating the breakup of your country. Also again there is a difference in those asking for autonomy or even secession as opposed to those seeking to "break the country into thousand pieces". Ironical that possibly the difference is academic...but we are talking about debates in highest academic institutions and intelligentsia and not a fire side chat in village chaupal

                            You have valid points. But as you (might have) lived in Delhi for couple of years, and also within Media circle, you must be aware of actual situation. The geography of 10-12 km radius within Delhi, do not at all represent India as whole. Its rather exception, though (exceptionally) powerful. The people within that small area has blown everything out of proportion (as usual). And In India we have infinite opinions with Billion plus population. However country is not at all charged up as seen from TV studio or Social Media commentators. Yes, opinions are divided sharply being (as portrayed) sensitive matter. But such incidents are taking place everyday in every nook and corner of the country. So pls. don't drag country as whole.

                            LoL - by his own argument, the government is actually doing students a favour by forcing them to make a strong movement. This is another matter that police in this case was dragging their feet but public participation forced police to take action. If these so called students take their movement to streets then they will be beaten in the street by the public and they will hide behind the same police they are alleging to be heavy handed

                            It is a dangerous start and can snowball. There are over 180 Million Muslims who are convinced that they are the rulers of this country. They were ruling over India for several centuries and can easily overpower timid Hindus

These people hv murdered innocent Indians, our soldiers die keeping country safe from them. We will never allow any base to be created for these anti-nationals. Congress and left just want to provided cushion to all anti india elements who ar desperate to divide india

                            It would be great if the students who were shouting anti-India students were granted a pardon and the freedom to air their so-called anti national views before a set of wise people such as Sudha Murthy and Gopalakrihnan Gandhi. It is only through a free and frank discussion that skewed thinking on the part of young students can get corrected. The problem very often is that students have only one another to sound off about national issues and don't have the benefit of interacting with older, wiser people.

                            From the comments here it is clear nothing will have nay effect on these Bhakts. Sometimes we need to have sympathy for these Bhakts. Research has proven that people who think like the Sanghis (or Talibanis or ISIS ...) suffer from disabilities resulting in low IQ. The studies conclude that: " … conservatism scores correlate negatively with measures of education and performance on mathematics and reading assessments".<br/><br/>
You can find it on Google. Search for: "science direct Conservatism and<br/>
