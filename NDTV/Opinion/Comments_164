                            Rajiv Gandhi wondered whether Kolkata was a dying city. Mother Theresa exposed its warts for all the world to see. Thirty years of CPM rule and 5 years of Mamata have only made it worse and it is definitely the poorest and dirtiest of our metros. Glad that O'Brien likes it. It takes all types to make the world.
