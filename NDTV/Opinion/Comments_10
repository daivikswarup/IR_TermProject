                            Indeed it is great speech . really shocking that Teesta was allowed to write NCERT books for children. How was she chosen  ?  this is shocking and disgrace .  Sonia, Kapil sibal  still preach  secularism. Teesta as social activist. No other country has such tolerance as India has.

                            There is no doubt that Irani's speech in Parliament yesterday will go in to history as THE BEST one could have seen and heard. My word what an articulation ,what command of language and what clarity. if only she had bee allowed to continue, she would have gone on and on and on and would have torn the entire opposition into shreds.  For the matter of fact, people like us watching her on TV literally  got mesmerized. Must have seen this speech over and over again so many times that I lost count of it.  Was this the aggression PM wanted his law makers to show in the Parliament? BJP definitely has briefed their law makers very well. A great homework done by Smriti  and hats off to her. Rahul should have been in the Parliament when Smriti was roaring and would have loved to see his reaction.

                            She made one of the most dramatic and fierce-full counter-attacks Parliament has seen. When people from non-political backgrounds enter politics and find their integrity questioned based on fake claims, they do break-down easily. She must not be blamed for her emotional speech. Moreover, her speech was far more than just emotional - amply supported by facts and documents. Sugata Bose speaks very well without any doubt, and what he spoke really made sense, but I doubt that in the name of allowing students to make mistakes and making them learn from their mistakes, he may risk demoralizing our troops guarding the borders. The opposition and the government need to develop a habit of meeting each more frequently especially whenever there is a crisis like situation. Whatever happened be it Mr Vermula's suicide or JNU students raising slogans, should not have turned into a political storm to the extent that the parliament log-jams. The government and the opposition need to learn from these two issues and ensure that if in future such a situation ever occurs they behave as responsible parties rather than school children.

More of a TV-Serial style drama, crocodile tears, mis-placed emotions. And 56 inch who has never commented about all these ABVP arrogance, is tweeting Smiti speech.

                            The leftists have always been despised by Indian voters, as shown by their miserable electoral successes since Independence. Yet hey have managed to disproportionately influence education in India as also the economic policies of the government. This is one of the significant reasons India has not progressed either economically or academically. Leftist thinking basically belongs to the nineteenth century and has little relevance to today's world. The 1991 reforms broke the shackles of the economy to some extent. The academic world has not been so fortunate. Our universities, especially JNU, have been hubs of marxist thinking, which is inherently anti-national. Manmohan Singh had as far back as 2008 identified the red menace in many of our tribal and forest areas as India's most significant internal threat. The aim of any naxalite/maoist/leftist insurgency is to bring down the democratically elected government by using violence. The JNU students are only the young face of this menace and have to be handled accordingly. India needs educational reforms as badly as economic reforms, and Smriti Irani is doing a good job, which is why the left and the pseudo left like the Congress are trying to discredit her.

                            Kiran Bedi was once a pride of India, and a role model for Indian Women. Now, she is cheering for a ministrs oratory skills. People have realised the true colour of Modi and his party that all of his promises were just an election gimmick,and the only difference between Modi and Manmohan is oratory skills of Modi. India is still ruled by corporates especially reliance and oil prices are still high. Bihar and Delhi elections have already proved the discontent of people. instead of travelling all over India and realise people of India, our Prime minister is on a world tour. I really dont understand why Kiran Bedi still supports BJP.

                            Wasn't Sri Najeeb Jung also appointed by Congress? The counter that 20 of the VC's were appointed by Congress carries little weight. Must admit I didn't understand the seriousness of the evidence from Grade 4 and Grade 6 teaching in schools. Is it wrong to speak about Congress inaction against anti-Sikh riots? Maybe there are shades of grey within Shivaji's legacy as well and when we teach history we should discuss those as well.<br/><br/>
How difficult is it to get a signed statement from the security team of a university where the VC is pliable enough to declare a student demonstration a "law and order" situation and asks for police help. <br/><br/>
OK, so a  political meeting was misrepresented as a cultural meeting. That is indeed a great crime for which one needs to call in the police and slap charges of sedition and just maybe justifies doctoring video recordings as well<br/><br/>
Celebrating Mahishasur and denigrating hindu mythology has been a custom within certain extreme Dalit sections for a while now. But does that amount to inciting violence? There have been various intellectual influences from the west at work here (read Rajiv Malhotra's body of work) and the only way to counter this is to build up a narrative of our own and by engaging with Dalit intellectuals. By muzzling dissent we just give more credence to these extreme views<br/><br/>
And hasn't Kashmir suffered due to the heavy handed policies of the previous govts when they were all at sea seeking a response to Pakistan's machinations in the valley. Hasn't that govt also muddled things badly in the Naxal infested area of the country. Due to these policies these two problems cost our country immense amounts of military spending that could otherwise have been used more productively in the social sector. Is it therefore not justified to highlight the state's failures in these areas?<br/><br/>
So the education minister does get involved in getting people's kids admitted to schools, getting lecturers appointed to universities. Isnt that something ministers should stay away from and focus instead on formulating and implementing policy so systems work rather than ministerial interventions. How is this govt different from its predecessors if it relies on ministerial interventions to get appointments /admissions done in our universities or schools. And I suppose it is appropriate to use an instruction issued by a UPA minister to justify responding to requests for intervetions by an MP or MLA.<br/><br/>
I am afraid the Hon minister was only targeting the opposition in her response which is already on weak wicket in this debate. She has not really answered the issues that have been raised in TV debates by public intellectuals over the last few weeks. On that platform unfortunately the debate is already being lost

But it is a pity that it seems no parent had time to look into these text book aberrations, as objections ought to have poured in and inundated by public outrage are apparently absent or the parents are unable to find a forum to express.Actually it is the job of the media to bring into focus these issues.Unfortunately the media is collapsed in the country.<br/><br/>
The time is ripe for people like Kiran Bediji who has come up with the idea should take the lead to form a forum and devise means and a medium for the parents for projecting these evils, before our children are infested and reach the institutions like the JNU.

                            Kiran Bedi - BJP's agent interested in post retirement benefits, ever since her association with Anna Hazare movement. <br/><br/>
We all saw, what you did and accomplished in assembly elections.<br/>
No doubt about the services rendered to the country, but your actions post association with BJP, reveals your true colours. <br/><br/>
On the subject matter,<br/><br/>
Smriti Irani - Acted very well yesterday - Thanks to her acting skills (Saas Bahu Fame).<br/>
High voltage emotional drama, on the floor of the parliament.<br/>
Shameful, if actors like these act in the parliament.<br/>
Instead of talking on the real issues of her involvement in all the condemnable happenings and logically/rationally defending herself from her actions, leading to Rohit's death, atrocities on IIT-M - Ambedkar Periyar Group and handling of the JNU incidents (Innocents, until proven guilty by courts branded as anti-nationalists based on the doctored videos played on some news channels and re-played by BJP's Samvit Patra ). She portrayed herself as great ''Mother India'' and emotionally influenced the house.<br/>
Issues she talked about, Durga, Mhaishasur, Mother (assumed), her Caste, Amethi elections, - all were irrelevant.<br/>
One theme remains common in all the three cases - All those involved in the three separate incidents in different universities are branded ''Anti Nationals''. Also, not to forget the so called pseudo nationalists – ABVP (BJP - RSS's affiliations) involvements in all these three occasions (Pracharak's of the ancient mythological beliefs in India not rationally based on reality)<br/>
She earlier said, on the JNU incident and about her version of insult to ''Mother India'' and ''Nationalism''. What is mother India - Its we the people - Irrespective of our caste, religion, creed.sex and the region from where we come from. No Indian needs to prove his or her nationality, based on what BJP thinks the version of nationality should be (whether it be hoisting Indian flags in central universities or linking the binary of linking the lives lost by brave soldiers and the condemnable incidents).<br/>
Forcing young children's in state like Gujarat and Rajasthan to believe on ''Planes'' invented in Ram Rajya (Complete myth and not reality), as one example, is stupidity. Where is this BJP government taking India towards ? We are getting backwards. In the age of science and technology, what on earth would make a government to spread their ideologies and beliefs on young aspirational minds. Just mere propagation of ''One line slogans - ''Make in India' - marketing and smartly canvassing them is not sufficient, until concrete actions are taken.<br/><br/>
Smriti Irani - who has made false declarations about her education credentials (Not guilty until proven), is forcing the RSS agenda and ideology, to be propagated in educational institutions of repute. These institutes will ''Make India (We the people) prosper in the world arena and should be isolated. Instead of meddling in the affairs of the universities by forcing the VC's, under the garb of shooting letters of students being branded castiest and anti-nationals, Smriti Irani must let the Universities function autonomously (The case of IIT-Delhi, should not be forgotten).<br/>
Finally, those who made anti India slogans should be dealt with severe punishment and let us leave it for the courts to decide. However, why are we branding people as anti-nationals, before authenticating the veracity of the claims (Doctored videos). Police commissioner B.S.Bassi reporting to BJP's Rajnath Singh, says, let the accused prove their innocence, after Rajnath singh propagating that there are links to terrorists from Pakistan. Why are you in a hurry to make your own judgement and propagate it to the whole world,unless  you have proven anything.<br/>
Also, there is double standards being displayed by BJP. In Kashmir, every week there are anti-India slogans raised, but no one is booked under law. Is Kashmir, not a part of India ? So, instead of allying with the PDP in Kashmir to form government, who have taken a wrong stand on Afzal guru - a terrorist, time and again, BJP should have booked, Kashmiri separists making anti-India slogans into jails, when they were in power. Moving forward, BJP should walk out from forming a government there with PDP and win elections on their own and book the anti-Indians from Kashmir into jail.
