                            Very Good One Sir!!! I hope PM Modi sees this Article!!! It is time Government removes Subsidy in all Government Universities!! It is not only JNU Delhi even Osmania University has the same issue!! Many people who are in the wrong side of 30's live in universities for subsidised food and subsidised accomadation. Problem is politicians in India need to change!! They are using students in Govt Colleges as political pawns. These students don't have bright future!! It is time government removes subsidies for IITs and IIMs too.....they finally serve US and other western countries!! Why should tax payers money be used to subsidise for students who will not serve our country!! It is time they are told to take bank loans!!! Govt is not a Nanny!!

                            @Indu India: Totally disagree with you ! Subsidy should be removed for the stupid Politicians. Education is future of a Nation.Nothing wrong is using tax payers Money.Just because few students are misusing it , dosent mean the whole Country should not get it. There are so many Country's where entire education is free and provided by the govt for its citizens.

As a common man I see this as a great opportunity for us hard working tax payers seeing our taxes going towards more important projects and not ending up subsidizing these anti national vermin. For example the money saved from stopping funding to these so called Central Universities can at least buy our brave service and para military personnel more sophisticated weapons &amp; equipment and also go into improving their welfare.

So why should India not do the same? Students want to destroy the nation on tax payers subsidy, no way. Let them do their extra curricular activities on their own time and with their own money!

There are problems in our Universities and education system, but answer is neither to shut them down nor to replace left philosophy with right. Subsidy, if at all required in any field, it is education, which should make it accessible to every one. Countries like Germany have 100% subsidy but dole out quality students. UGC was started to keep tab on what is taught and quality of education, but has failed miserably. I have no solution, but this is what I feel should be debated rather than politics over an incident.

BJP's inability to handle this type of dissent is alarming. No real harm will be caused by the foolish statements made by the protesters. Very real harm will be caused to the country be this type of aggressive hyper-nationalism propagated by the Sangh.

It is abhorrent if some one raised anti national slogans  and you label whole university anti national is far fetching. Freedom of expression is guaranteed by constitution and in Universities most of the youth are anti establishment. Let administration of JNU take care of incidents in campus and if they can't then they can call police. But central Government and BJP's youth wing ABVP is playing role which is undesirable. Charging students with a suggestion is beyond the comprehension of any one. We have  to harmonize and unleash youth power and what we are doing exactly opposite.

It would be shame if they did not seize this chance to do something that they do not have the brains to do - it would definitely be some achievement in two years.

                            Sorry, didnt have the patience to read your arguments because it doesn't feel right to close down the university down yet. There is a need for universities and it is not easy to set one up. Just take stern action on erring students and staff so some order can be brought back. If it means invoking sedition laws, so be it so long as that can be justified in the courts.

This money can be spent in rural development / farmers / health etc. rather tha wasting on hooligans and antinationals

                            I must say you represent and serve Modi Regime very well. In fact, you deserve to be appreciated for spelling out their agenda clearly. JNU, AMU and  JMI are thorns and eyesores for RSS and it's foot soldiers. So you have to malign, ridicule, disrupt  and damage them  one by one to finally destroy them. Obviously, you can't paint them with one brush. Hence,  you use a communist/leftist tag as a stigma for JNU and reserve terrorist AND anti national tag for JMI and AMU. <br/>
If you could temporarily become a rationalist for few minutes, you will realize  that being communist  or muslim is not a threat to the nation but  forcing the saffron agenda by hook or by crook is. Dissent is not anti national but stifling of dissent is. How about for a change you compare and contrast roles of communists and Muslims  with that of RSS and it's foot soldiers during Independence movement. While the whole nation was up against British imperialism, RSS was still keeping them amused.<br/>
Do remember this nation is resilient and can withstand the  Saffron Brigade's onslaught. You just can't kill the reason and human courage.

                            Re-defining non-colonial Sedition. <br/>
Sedition is: <br/>
- When a country has 340 million people below poverty line which is more than the population in 1947, it is Sedition.<br/>
- When every year, 16,000 farmers are forced to commit suicide because of failure of government policy, it is sedition.<br/>
- When a country has 87 million people rendered illiterate, 37% of total world illiterate population, highest in the world, that is sedition.<br/>
- When a country has 40 million of its labor unemployed and the government failed to create employment opportunities, that is sedition. <br/>
- When every year, a country has 2.1 million children dying of malnourishment and the government is reducing budgetary allocation to midday meals, it is sedition. <br/>
- When a country has 25000 rapes every year, and the government couldn't prevent them is sedition. <br/>
- When a country has 626 million people openly defecating with no sanitation facilities, making India the worlds largest open air toilet, it is sedition. <br/>
- When even today, more than 150 million people walk at least 2 KMs in search of drinking water, it is sedition.<br/>
- When politicians spend Rs.30000 crores in conducting national elections and states spend 100,000 crores in state elections, despite such abject poverty and lie about their election spending on an oath on the constitution, it is sedition.<br/>
- When getting justice takes up to 20 years and still 30% of vacancies exist in Judiciary, it is sedition. <br/>
- When politicians, bureaucrats and the super rich send their children to foreign shores that costs India Rs. 200,000 crores p.a because they dont want to trust India when it comes to their own children's future while espousing the cause of nation building every day, it is sedition.<br/>
And this data is for India that includes Gujarat too. Gujarat is no different and walks hand in hand with rest of India in each of those parameters. Sedition is not some idiots shouting slogans in some corner of this country. Sedition is not some misguided youth waving black flags on a republic day or green flags on another day. Sedition is not some youth having stupid debates on issues they don't understand but profess to understand.<br/>
Sedition is when a government turns a blind eye to violence against humanity, with an ulterior motive to break people resistance and force them to rise in rebellion. Sedition is forcing people to take law into their own hands because government's failed. Sedition is testing the patience of its people.<br/>
It is no foreign power that will disintegrate our great country. If ever it happens, it will be the apathy of the government, the inaction of the administration to the real problems at the grass root level. It will not be for want of a temple or sloganeering by idiots. Our enemies are not outside but inside. And most of them sit in the Indian Parliament.<br/>

Didn't they have a better choice to join other upcoming institutions known for their excellence in learning? Of course not, in the same mold as the left-leaning students, the ABVP were motivated by their credo and not in learning. So if you plan to close JNU, where will all ABVP "vidyarthis" go?

Lots of universities have been discontent, just as FTII, Hydrabad, JNU and now Jadavpur- so how many univerisites will you close and in what pretext. These are Indian Students and any overdoing must be investigated before slapping serious charges like sedition. Only the hardcore anti-national elements could be suitably punished but only after exhausting less harsh punishment. They are Indians. PDP has time again hosted meetings where Pak flags where installed yet this same BJP found it convenient to form Government with it, -. if Modi can visit his Paki friends for chai, the same guys who are killing our soldiers everyday, sending terrorists to Pathankot yet can be considered nationalistic, young Indians except the hardcore promoters can not be treated as seditious. Conselling, probation can make them realize their mistake because every Indian has India at it's heart even when their views might be different.

                            In a democracy dissent is the highest form of patriotism. Choking off dissent is the prime trait of a fascist regime even if, it painstakingly hides that hate-mongering, lumpen face of disgrace, behind Chandan's meticulous promulgation of some impotent nationalism based on lies and factual artifacts.<br/><br/>
This Arnab Goswami flavored statistical inference involving Chandan's "dollops of state subsidy" logic should face following facts first.<br/><br/>
- Tax exemptions and incentives to corporations had had a revenue impact of Rs. 62,398.6 crore to the exchequer in 2014-15, 8 per cent higher than the previous fiscal, according to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley<br/><br/>
-29 state-owned banks wrote off Rs 1.14 lakh crore of bad debts between 2013 and 2015.<br/><br/>
-India is already among the lower spenders on education. In 2012, according to the World Bank, India spent 3.9% of its GDP on education. Even Mozambique and Morocco spent 6.2 per cent each. Both the U.S. and the U.K. spend more than 5 per cent.<br/><br/>
A university should promote rational thinking, scientific temperament and a culture of dissent. These values are the lifeblood of any democracy and nation building. So do not copy from hypocritical tax-grievers like Mr. Mohandas Pai who is the Chairman of Manipal Global Education Services Pvt Ltd, a private provider of higher education services in India as well as abroad. While leading a private education enterprise your compatriot Mr. Pai may have got some tax exemptions too. So grow up Chandan and try inventing newer forms of sycophancy your new age fascism is calling for it.

                            Looks like this Govt+ friends are systematically targeting universities to seed their slipper level ideology. <br/><br/>
We can see a systematic approach, started with Hyd and Delhi ..... many more universities to come, I guess. <br/><br/>
Only God can save this country...... make in india and swach bharath is all eye wash, just to keep people blinded on the disgusting things this Govt is doing inside India. <br/><br/>
Matter of time, BJP and their friends will taste the same medicine soon. Our own eyes will see it.

                            wow that's great. You want to close an university only because of some students are protesting...tomorrow you will argue that few politicians who are from IITs are corrupt ( or not aligned with BJP), so lets close the IITs also. I strongly feel the issue is with the Name JNU, everyone knows how our present PM doesnot like this "name".Any one who goes against the country should be punished but not in this way..

                            I think Mr Chandan Mitra should shut down The Pioneer and work with The Organiser. They both serve the same purpose.

                            The Dollar cross the age of Prime Minister. It will cross soon the age of all seniors soon like Advani, Murli Manohar joshi. Hopefully in 2016 we will enjoy Rs. 100 Equivalent to One US Dollar. Sensex will start from the starting line again.  The economy is collapsing. Youth need the Job. Now there will be huge unemployment. There will be news that people suicide all over India. God forbids

                            Mr. Mitra - please shut down all the universities. Then we will have gurukuls and RSS agenda will be fulfilled. You can then teach everyone to use bow and arrow and attack recklessly like the RSS, Bajrang Dal and VHP. Our Minister for HRD can lead all these gurukuls with her outstanding qualifications.

                            Mr Mitra it is your opinion that JNU is a place to make babus. May I ask you where you be without  the committed babu to run the government for you. Sorry to say all students in JNU are not leftist/ SFI neither are they separatist. We are a bunch of intelligent thinkers. What happened inside the campus is of course deplorable but the most student may themselves be in shock at the turn of events.  I understand your anger as ABVP can never make it in student body , that is why JNU must stay as it stands for secular India.

                            BJP goons never built anything, no institutions ever in their lifetime. They don't know how hard it is to actually conceive an institution and get it running. Instead of building other institutions they are hell bent on destroying everything that exists. Using ABVP and MHRD they are doing a power grab of FTII, IITs, NSD, IIMs and now JNU. When students revolt they are labelled anti nationals and arrested. <br/><br/>
When will you stop? Next is it going to be IISc and BARC also? Are they not hindu enough for you?

                            Mr Mitra edits a newspaper called 'The Pioneer', which has survived ever since he became its owner not through competition but by obtaining government and PSU advertisements. Now that this source of funding is drying up because of his being part of the Advani faction, he can fully understand the pain of the 'subsidy deprived'.
