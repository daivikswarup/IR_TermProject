Sonia, Kapil sibal  still preach  secularism. Teesta as social activist. No other country has such tolerance as India has.

                            Dr Rajasree Malpath said when she came to examine Rohith, he had been dead for two hours.<br/><br/>
 "There was no pulse or blood pressure. His body was cold, tongue was protruding and rigor mortis had set in," the doctor told <br/><br/>
A video of Rohith's body on the day he hung himself also shows policemen, which contradicts the minister's claim that the police were not allowed near the body till the next morning.<br/><br/>

                            There is no doubt that Irani's speech in Parliament yesterday will go in to history as THE BEST one could have seen and heard. My word what an articulation ,what command of language and what clarity. if only she had bee allowed to continue, she would have gone on and on and on and would have torn the entire opposition into shreds.  For the matter of fact, people like us watching her on TV literally  got mesmerized. Must have seen this speech over and over again so many times that I lost count of it.  Was this the aggression PM wanted his law makers to show in the Parliament? BJP definitely has briefed their law makers very well. A great homework done by Smriti  and hats off to her. Rahul should have been in the Parliament when Smriti was roaring and would have loved to see his reaction.

Whatever said and done , She has been harassing the educational institutions and a puppet to bring in to effect what the BJP polluted think heads wants.<br/><br/>

                            She made one of the most dramatic and fierce-full counter-attacks Parliament has seen. When people from non-political backgrounds enter politics and find their integrity questioned based on fake claims, they do break-down easily. She must not be blamed for her emotional speech. Moreover, her speech was far more than just emotional - amply supported by facts and documents. Sugata Bose speaks very well without any doubt, and what he spoke really made sense, but I doubt that in the name of allowing students to make mistakes and making them learn from their mistakes, he may risk demoralizing our troops guarding the borders. The opposition and the government need to develop a habit of meeting each more frequently especially whenever there is a crisis like situation. Whatever happened be it Mr Vermula's suicide or JNU students raising slogans, should not have turned into a political storm to the extent that the parliament log-jams. The government and the opposition need to learn from these two issues and ensure that if in future such a situation ever occurs they behave as responsible parties rather than school children.

                            Why Bedi - How long does it take for you to set the emotional aspects of the fiery drama speech and look at the facts behind - it has been proven that much of what Smiti said in parliament is a lie or based on wrong facts. More of a TV-Serial style drama, crocodile tears, mis-placed emotions. And 56 inch who has never commented about all these ABVP arrogance, is tweeting Smiti speech. The whole thing looked like a good PR drama.

But correcting an education system inherited with generations of inaccuracies that corrupts impressionable minds and perpetuate with unbridled force is mightily Herculean task. After seeing Smritiji live on loksabha TV during the classic debate , I am convinced she will do her role admirably.
