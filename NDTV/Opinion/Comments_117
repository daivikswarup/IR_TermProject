                            Sir David is a legend in the truest sense. A man dedicated to his profession all his life and is a consummate professional. I very much look forward to viewing this interview on NDTV.

                            This is fascinating. Two of my favourites- Sir David and Swati (madamðŸ˜Š). Is there a link for the interview or is it yet to be released?  Hope someday, I get to be a fly on the wall in such an interview.

                            What a lovely write up.As an Indian living in the UK,I often find the journalism in India a bit fake,however this article is such a breath of fresh air,capturing the simplistic greatness of Sir David A.Well done!

                            I have been following Sir David (note: NDTV's headline calls him Sir Attenborough which is not in keeping with etiquette) for decades, starting with 'The World Bout Us' in the 70s.  Some of Sir David's best documentaries were made in India and I particularly remember his interview on a boat in the Ganges with the Maharajah of Banares.  Readers may be interested in learning that Sir David had a brother, Sir Richard who produced the famous movie 'Gandhi' and also acted in the famous movie 'The Chess Players' with Sayed Jaffrey and Nasiruddin Shah.  The works produced by these talented brothers will live on long after they have gone.

                            Sir David is great but the way this article was written does not do justice to his greatness. The focus was more on what the author felt about Sir David rather then ask him some pertinent questions about his work. Overall, a puerile article that should have been sent back to the author for significant changes by the editors at NDTV.

For the interviewer, though the questions were good, what is the need to fake the accent?

                            I love Richard Attenborough's documentaries, beautifully shot, highly informative and truly inspirational. Having said that what is the point of this article? is it trying to introduce Attenborough to people who don't know him? For a writer who I have followed for being forthright about her views this star struck feature is weird to say the least. On the same vein why is NDTV wasting it's space  on such insipid article that I would expect from a 12 yr old not a outspoken environmentalist.

                            What was the point? Just adoration? Try interviewing an Indian great like Dr.M.S.Swaminathan, father of the Green Revolution. More relevant to an Indian media channel and an Indian audience. Rather unfortunately he is brown skinned being an Indian. And a Tamilian at that. Hope the white step son is doing well. Karmic connection and all.

                            They should biology in schools with his documentaries, particularly the Life series which is brilliant. Sir Attenborough is a credit to his country

                            Swati, this piece is so warm that I feel you are right in front of me and narrating this special meeting with the true legend Sir David. I spent a decade in the UK in the Sixties and watching Sir David on TV was a special moment. The authenticity of his voice and the way he would crawl on the sand to watch a crab on the beach, with his face showing the effort on a hot day in Namibia, said it all! Sir Richard, his brother was special in his own way but, for me Sir David's passion for nature is truly special. I look forward to watching this on NDTV. keep up the great work, young lady!
