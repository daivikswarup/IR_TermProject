                            Achchhe Din Same As Purane Din? That means NDA is doing same as or slightly better than The UPA. Then why is Mani Complaining? He never Complained in UPA time!! Also Corruption came down &amp; Spectrum &amp; Coal gave good money to Government rather tha to private cronies.

                            In either case, UPA did not have the vision nor strategy to launch programs like start up India, gold monetisation, smart cities, clean India etc but instead gave us useless and populist laws like retrospective taxation, farmer debt write offs and NAREGA which plunged the economy and stock markets into a downward spiral.  And let us not forget about the corruption and crony capitalism that thrived under the congress, reintroducing the stench of days of the license raj that Sonia and her pappu son are only too happy to preside over.

Though he disliked and hated Lord Narayana until his last breath, he went straight to heaven instead of hell, for the simple reason that even when he was hating Lord Narayana, in a way he was chanting Lord's name inumerbale number of times.<br/><br/>
I wonder where would Mr.MSA be heading after living his full life hating Mr.Modi. After all, I believe he probably must have chanted Mr.Modi's name more number of times than anybody else on the planet.

All we see is mounting intolerance being fanned and encouraged by senior people in the Central Government? Modi has really not shown any vision, any leadership at all. Smart Cities and Clean India (now renamed Swachh Bharat) are all continuation of earlier initiatives. In secularism, pluralism, and genuine patriotism, Modi is a disgrace to the country.

                            Another piece of brilliant writing by the one and only Manishankara Iyer. People may note that he has not spared policies of the UPA governments as well as the "Manmohanomics" that India is blindly following since 1991. No doubt liberalization enabled a section of poor and lower middle class to acheive higher levels of earning as well upward mobility economically. It has also allowed skewed growth ;service sector occupying over 60% of the economy at the cost of both agriculture and manufacturing unlike in the years prior to growth. Of course, Rajiv Gandhi was the most modern and visionary among India's PM as he exhorted Indians to be prepared for radical changes that would overtake the mankind in the 21st century even as his government started  massive programmes of computerization and ushered in a revolution in communication network and its expansion. The opposition including the BJP, the RSS, the left went hammer and tongs at Rajiv Gandhi and organized strikes and Bandhs for his emphasis on computerization and development of communication citing it would take away jobs of Indians. It is time for people to reflect whether the then opposition played a constructive role or not.

Statistics speak volumes about the truth. After Modi's take over, things have gone worse and is going to be worst in the coming days. The difference is, a learned P.M, thinks in long term benefits and have counter measure in tackling things from his own brain, which Modi is very much lacking. Because his knowledge in the subject of economy and finance is very limited.

Modi is the toast of the world, not because he  has delivered anything, but because India is today the 3rd largest economy in the world, ALL THANKS TO MM SINGH. Indeed Purane din are the acche din. With Rupee in ICU, exports in a COMA, IIP is missrable, daals at 200/-, we can only feel sorry for the billions of Indians, especially the rural poor, who modi has completely ignored, as if they dont exist.

                            Mr. Aiyar must be still ruing his ChaiWala comment.<br/><br/>
A chai wala is driving the economy with all humility despite global headwinds and bad monsoon. Not to forget the congress scams he inherited.<br/><br/>
Aiyar unable to digest the fact that economy is doing better with out the need for any scams.<br/><br/>
The IMF, World Bank, all the fund managers worth their salt are betting on India and here is a guy who cannot stop himself from writing such canards.<br/><br/>
And about the bank loans, Mr Aiyar they were all doled out during your regime under political pressure. Now don't try to tarnish Modi for your wrong doings. He has a capable and qualified RBI governor whom he trusts in and seeks advice from. Bottom line our banks are broke not because of Modi or BJP. It was 10 years of Congress rule that made them what they are today. The super growth figures that you are quoting were achieved during UPA regime was achieved by looting the banks.<br/><br/>
So if todays acche din were same as yesterdays purine din as you put it, it means economy is still growing at +7%.<br/><br/>
Under MODI rupee came down from 63 to 69...but in the 10 years of Congress rule it came down from 35 to 63. What can you say about it Mr Aiyar.

                            Totally bemused by the analysis of Indian and World economics by Mr. Mani Shankar.  Just doling out criticism against the present governance to create a virtual comparison with the last Congress led government. In the article it is portrayed that India's robust growth is inversely proportional to China 's growth. This is utterly unbelievable, coming from such a senior politician. The present Modi government is having a positive approach and not giving too much optimism and neither setting unrealistic targets. Thus, this helps in case of a downturn market trend as people 's confidence stays with the market instead of withdrawing as a result growing at a smart rate eventually. My take is that the Modi regime is taking forward and improving the standards and legislations set by Dr Manmohan Singh government. Not to take away anything from Dr Singh's brave handling of 2008 economic meltdown. India did well. Criticism just for the sake of it does not help.

holding gst ,seeking votes of poor by ensuring minimm productive ejob facility, confrontation on smallest pretext with wish to weaken present govt are more of fantasies bec even if modi weakens congress on own is unlikely to be in EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF INDIA till they change mindset to focus on better .<br/><br/>
we read and react to irrelavent column like mr iyer but it hardly offer solace of solution to indian society .better he wakes up for better india and better future for grandchildren of mir iyer

                            All said and done things are projected as if everything is going wrong with the economy/country and the govt. but just to ask Mr. Mani how are you contributing to fix these things. The party you belong to does nothing to support the ruling govt. in passing bills and just keeps taking some or the other excuse to stall the activities in the parliament and not let the Govt. function. If you have some ideas to bring improvement why not share and think in a positive direction instead of just complaining ?? As a responsible citizen of India is it not your duty to provide some brilliant ideas to bring the economy in track ?? Or you just glorify yourself by saying that all of us were fools to select and bring a party to power which you and your party members will not allow to function because your party lost miserably. If there is a tiny bit of conscience left in you it may be better to use your intellectual brain and suggest some constructive thoughts of improvement for your own country instead of just complaining like an old hag on negative things..

                            In UPA, we had 10% whole sale inflation. Due to global commodity crisis, price of raw materials has come down. So, manufacturers can produce more for the same investment and if they sell at the old prices, their profit would be more. Only revenue growth will show less. On the other hand, if inflation and commodity prices are high, even high growth rates will not help get profits or real money on the table.

Rajiv Gandhi died a quarter century ago!  He only got where he did because morons such as Mani were unable to even consider replacing the dreadful parivar that had colonised India following the departure of the British.  Just one simple fact will give lie to the moron's mutterings: The debt acquired by major businesses did not happen during Modi's tenure.  Modi merely inherited this from Manmohan's time!

                            Mani boy, your Congress party mismanaged the country for past few decades.  It just isn't possible to turn around the economy in 2 years.  You well know that, right Mani boy?  Even Obama needed 2 terms.  You should learn to forgive.  We can imagine how you must have felt, and is still feeling now, about how your "chaiwala will never become PM" statement catapulted Modi to PMs chair.  We also know that you haven't forgiven yourself for that slip of tongue.  But my dear Mani boy, you should try to forgive yourself.  People make mistakes, you know.  As for Rahul beta, he will never give you a post even if Congress comes to power in 2019.  So, dearest Mani boy, please take it easy and spend the rest of your days enjoying old age, instead of worrying too much about Modi and this nation.  You did what you could for Congress, and the country too, so please try to let it go and be easy on yourself.

1) Can damage done over 60 years be rectified in 60 weeks or 60 months?<br/>
2) If the opposition opposes for the sake of opposing (this applies to BJP too when they were in opposition) can a government function.<br/><br/>
My request to all political parties (Congress and BJP included), you can have your political differences but when it comes to the nation please work together to make India great again.
