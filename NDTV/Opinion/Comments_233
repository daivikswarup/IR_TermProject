Dear mister Khera, we can also sense which way the wind is blowing like it happened in Amir Khan's case. We sensed his words, not matter how it gets justified later on.<br/>
We sensed this drama too. Period.

                            What Obnoxious and spacious arguments Sir, if that was the case then why arrest anyone who violates the constitution! Mr. Pai was absolutely correct that WE the PEOPLE OF INDIA pay taxes and that is used for paying subsidies to the tune of 300,000 Rs. for each of the 8,000 students at JNU. <br/><br/>
Why should we pay for students who are not interested in studies, but politics? Now don't tell me Supporting Anti-Nationals is part of the learning.<br/><br/>
With this 240 Crore Rs we will be able to pay off debt of those farmers who are committing suicide due to their debts. We will be able to pay for our those brave heart soldiers like Lance Naike Hanumanthappa who along with his colleagues laid their lives for this Nation.  I think that will be a more worthwhile usage of this fund.

                            Pawan Khera, as a political analyst with Congress you lose the moral authority to be seen as a one worth the salt. Even your rebut on Mr. Pai is lame. Indian universities have failed miserably in the global arena. There is hardly a single Indian university among the top 250 universities in the global list. Only Africans and third world students want to study in Indian universities while Indians want to rush to USA and UK to study.  Now it is obvious that the Universities are a great breeding ground for snakes among the retards rather then intellectuals. This is a great tribute to Congress that has been the ruling elite of the country for a large part. Congress has to take responsibility for the mess the universities are in, for that matter the state of the country.

Congress and their cohorts raise a big cry when hate is being spread against muslims but you want to push the matter under the rug if the target of hate are hindus.<br/><br/>
Students may raise any kind of slogans, in favour or against any political party. But when they wish and hope for the destruction of India, say "India will be partitioned, insha allah....insha allah", "There will be war till India is destroyed" and so many other cries for the death of you country, how can you still support these people spreading hate.

The students got ample opportunity in visual media to present their logic.They couldnt they dont have one. A simple question, the supreme court judgement on Afjal guru is not based on slogans. It discusses each and every point and provide detailed justification for each observation. Please explain (since you are representing the students now) why it was unfair logically. I want to understand, and if you can convince us with logic we will consider the students as great thinkers may be.

And mammon are anti national and they should be put in condemned cell. Who ever question such action should also be put along with traitors as they are indulging in promotion of anti national act.

                            It's completely wrong to equate what happens at IIT, Hyd University, IIFT with the JNU incidence. There could be fight between different classes, religion and opinions within our vibrant democracy. But to tolerate anti India clash within JNU is atrocious on the part of all politicians irrespective of any party. If the students and faculty stand against anti India slogans/ actions then why are they not pointing out persons involved in it. Elected student body and the faculty are responsible not to shield the culprit. And if they take a stand it's none of their problem then police and state administration will act with heavy hand. Perpetrators of anti India should not be allowed. Because the political parties tolerated such elements in Kashmir since 1949 the country has landed into this mess.

                            Whether the Police action has been appropriate or not, the students as a training ground for involving in politics is unacceptable by any standards. Just because RaGa has spoken some crap (I strongly disagree what RaGa has spoken), all the Congress politicians should not justify what he said is right. Come on, have some brain of yours too. He says that 'those who curtail freedom of speech in this University, they are only anti-national'. What type of stupid remark he can make ?<br/><br/>
Does this freedom of speech / expression would mean I can stand in Taj Mahal or in Parliament building and give abuses about the President or PM of India. In the same manner, here is a man who had waged a battle against the constitution of this country and he has been given a very fair trial. The highest courts of this country has found him to be guilty and he has been hanged after fair opportunity to justify his points. Now that the highest judiciary body has decided a final verdict, there is no question of providing martyrdom to Afzal Guru. He is a terrorist and period. No arguments thereafter. Shouting slogans supporting Afzal Guru is definitely anti-national.<br/><br/>
From this perspective, what Mohandas Pai said is right. Students are sent for studying and once studies are over, exit the College / University campuses and stand naked in the road and shout / yell / roar / bark. Who is going to stop you ? Take the case of Rohith Vemula. His mother is finding it difficult to meet both the ends. Here is one irresponsible boy (who does not realise the seriousness and / or commitment to bring up the family) and sitting in University as PhD student talking crap and making detrimental statements. Understand what amount of expectations his mother would have had on him. Why Rohith Vemula could not fulfil these expectations ? All because, you are in a bad company where these rogues join together and do unproductive things.<br/><br/>
As mentioned earlier, Pawan Khera - please do not justify what your political master said. Have some conscience and understand. Final question : Would you allow your son / daughter to do what Kanhaiya Kumar did ? What shall be your reaction then ? Please ponder over. If you are serious, send a reply to this post.

                            Here is an excerpt of an interview of an apolitical JNUite who is thick in the cultural and educational activities for a better democratic society. The name is withheld. The interview took place in 2007 and see what he says about his soulful interface with his alma mater:-<br/><br/>
"Bhoomika: How different would your work profile and perspective be, had you not been a JNUite?<br/>
Mr….: It would have been entirely different. I can not think of my existence without JNU. If I had not got admission in JNU, I would not have been anywhere. Despite being a very good student, I got only 52% marks in B.A in Patna University. I would never have made it to any place where marks decided one's fate. So JNU was a boon for me.<br/>
Bhoomika: Which characteristic of JNU do you think is most attractive?<br/>
Mr….: The high level of cultural and ideological awareness in JNU attracts me the most. This is not seen anywhere else in India. To think of oneself as a citizen of the world and to be able to ask questions are the most important thing one is taught in JNU. This is the strength of JNU.<br/>
Bhoomika: Do you still go back to JNU?<br/>
Mr….: Certainly. Just two days back I went there with an ex-JNUite friend of mine who simply wanted to have a bread roll at Ganga dhaba.<br/>
Bhoomika: What message would you like to give to the JNU students' community?<br/>
Mr….: JNU teaches you not how to answer questions but how to question answers. So long as you keep questioning, you keep up the spirit of JNU."<br/><br/>
All that Mr.... states here is the most authentic and true description of the university. NOTHING IS MORE DANGEROUS TO THE UNITY, INTEGRITY AND PROSPERITY OF THE COUNTRY THAN THROTTLING THE CHILD'S CURIOSITY AND HIS EFFORT TO ACQUIRE A LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST INSTRUMENT OF EMPOWERMENT. <br/>
DO NOT KILL THE ETHOS OF TAKSHSHILA. DO NOT ACT LIKE NADIRSHAH. DO NOT PLAY WITH FIRE AND THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY.

                            Today you will allow dissent, in the name of freedom of speech. Tomorrow when the arms sneak in, you will be the first to criticize Modi and his govt. for being casual and lax in security matters.Best thing is to curb such anti India activities in the nascent stage itself.Congi knows to play politics only and first let them allow dissent against Rahul in the party..and then let them talk about freedom of speech, right to dissent.etc.....there are so many instances of intolerance in Congress..take the case of Jayanthi Natrajan..she was thrown out just for expressing her opinion about Rahul and that fellow talks of allowing dissent...

                            Dear comentrator, please have a correction in your totally biased story. They were not insulting the government but Mother India. Learn to respect your nation above your thinking lines.<br/>
And lad freedom you are talking .. Let you kid insult you on road and see what you do to them. Discipline is not a mere word it make or break virtually any thing we see.. The universe is also result of discipline.<br/><br/>
Pai's comment were neutral not bizarre, he opposed sedition charges (i too think that the term sedition was not required) but also opined against wrong doing by students.<br/><br/>
Freedom has a meaning and responsibility too. You should have highlighted that first before your dose.

All based purely on convenience not on any conviction. Talk of conviction and be prepared to be buried under an avalanche of "tolerance", "secularism" and what not outcry. No pride in anything. Want everything free and easy. No responsibility because of absolutely no accountability. Always mistaking articulation for action. Anyway not that - as a political analyst for the congress - one expects anything different from this person. Question is do such people not realize the country did not become what it is overnight - it has been systematically turned into a banana republic by mostly what has been Congress rule. Very sure he is elated at his Chakravaka quote. And the sad fact is the Congress party and its coterie of sycophants are prepared to play politics with anything and everything in the country. When a surname is the only claim and enough qualification to lead the nation, when a whole gang - quite educated and articulate - gangs up and prays to you to take on the reins as if there is no viable alternative in this country - can there be any deeper or darker abyss we can hope for. One thing is very clear - we have been indifferent, lackadaisical and even clueless for way too long - allowing anyone and everyone to run slipshod over us - and we do not deserve any better.

Slogans like 'India tere tukde honge, Insha Allah, Insha Allah' or Afzal ham sharminda hain tere qatil zinda hain' are some thing prompted by anti India forces. Any govt can not be mute spectator to all this and allow to spread this hatred against India.  This has to be nipped in the bud.

                            Of late, everyone has become a commentator, it looks. What is wrong in the statement of Mohandas Pai, who was a successful IT man in Infosis, that 'the tax payer's money spent on universities is meant to fund not their politics but their studies'. Like a typical Congressman, the correspondent tries put words by stating 'Because a university is funded by the state, is it meant to obediently adhere to the ideology of the then head of state? Mohandas Pai was 100% correct that Universities are meant for STUDIES and NOT for politiking. He did not say anything about 'obediently adhering to ideology'. The Party which declared emergency and jailed hundreds of thousands of innocent citizens for protesting and the Party whose party men were responsible for killing thousands of Sikhs after Indira Gandhi's assassination lost its right to talk about freedom of expression, long back. Why is that your party is adding fuel to the fire?

You lost your brain when Malda happened. So as an indian who pays his taxes i find your piece as disgusting . The events which is happening in JNU is the result of wrong policies of your master for past 60 yrs. The so called future PM of India who lacks even basic knowledge about his own country rushed to JNU to support the students forgetting that it was UPA govt when Guru's case happened .<br/><br/>
For u I have 2 questions -<br/>
1) Why should i fund somebody's education when i have my own children to take care.<br/>
2) U d congrees party WHO gave you the right to put tax payers money in kashmir's day to day running.<br/><br/>

We have all been to universities I can not remember hearing anti national slogans and destruction of India being the activities undertaken by us. <br/>
If Mr Guru's hanging has lead to protests and sloganeering and had not been curbed in the past then it has been your failure for last ten years. You did not have the gumption to take the so called anti nationals. Do not sit there and boast about your failure in the name of secularism and freedom of speech.<br/>
Mr Mohan Das Pai is absolutely right that as taxpayer of this country we decide where our money is spent. It CAN NOT and Will not be spent on anti-nationals that is for sure, wether you like it or not. If you love them so much I suggest you should fund there education from your own pocket. Stop providing silly and nefarious arguments to support those who oppose the integrity and solidarity of this nation.

What are you talking about. Please remember JNU is a centre for education. JNU, or any University for that matter is not a political office. Young students come here to learn science and arts not politics. If somebody wants to learn politics, certainly the universities are not the place. If politics, dharna, rallies, stone throwing, sedition etc are taught in JNU, then better name it as a Neta Training Centre. But funding should not be from the tax payers. I can understand, only a handful of currupted minds are involved in such activities with the backing of political parties. Need of the hour is that the unions and political affiliates groups should be banned from the centres of learning. Certainly, the Universities want only serous students, not netas on probation. It is high time to mercilessly weed these probating Netas.

                            It is clear that both BJP and CONGRESS are caught in a race to the bottom. While Congress over the last 60 years specialised in "caste" and "minorities" card for vote bank politics, the BJP is now lost in trying to pamper to the "Hindutva" crowd. Unfortunately, the balance lies in the middle, where a true Indian identity independent of caste and community has to be carved. But with the way politics is in India, that would be a distant dream.<br/><br/>
It is the most appropriate time now to recall what Tagoreji said...<br/><br/>
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high<br/>
Where knowledge is free<br/>
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments<br/>
By narrow domestic walls<br/>
Where words come out from the depth of truth<br/>
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection<br/>
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way<br/>
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit<br/>
Where the mind is led forward by thee<br/>
Into ever-widening thought and action<br/>
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

                            If you read this article, you will be almost made to believe that JNU students are some 10-12 years toddlers, who in their innocence can do anything and law shouldn't apply to them. For god's sake, these are mid to late 20s young men and women, who know what they are talking about. There can be no excuse for their behavior as they are not some kids, and need to be dealt with firm hands. And anyone who has been to JNU knows very well what many of these so called students are upto. They along with political masters Left parties create intellectual terrorism, suppressing any voice that comes from others. All those sympathisizing with JNU students, should do well to google about JNU. In 2009, a major clash occurred between JNU students and the Delhi Police when Policemen were injured and thanks to UPA govt, not a single student was arrested. Since then, five incidents of alleged rape have been reported from the campus and this has all been in the news.

                            What these JNU students have been doing is being seen by the entire nation by sharing of videos by twitter, whatsapp. No number of open ed will be enough to change the perception regarding these people in particular and JNU in general for a long time to come. Indians in general are patriotic.

                            What 's wrong in what Mr Mohandas Pai has said when we all know the misuse of the academic campuses in divisive politics and groupism, over the years, rather than excellence in education and character building? All parties are guilty of such activities at one point of time or the other.

                            Pawan Khera represents the lobby for whom the word of Hafeej Sayeed "( a parody account of Hafiz Sayeed (Sayeed himself issued a denial)" is more important than the word of our own police. Pawan Khera and others like him do not see difference between "giving an opinion" and defiantly " shouting slogans"  He has still not criticized the persons who shouted slogans " barabadi of Bharat" This is the mind set developed by sickular left.

                            Everyone is a commentator/writer/critic in this country.. on one hand he ridicule Mr.Pai's point of view as "This has been the most bizarre argument offered on the issue. Because a university is funded by the state, is it meant to obediently adhere to the ideology of the then head of state?". So what should be universities doing? patronize anti-national ideology?<br/><br/>
Actually the main issue is, the social issues are coming to the forefront and academics are being totally neglected by the student community. That's the reason, we are producing several thousand tech and non-tech graduates in to the open world and hardly 10% are academically worth of any suitable job for their respective degrees. Mr. Pai is absolutely correct, we don't want to fund hooliganism in Universities.

                            Actually, Mr.Pai got it right. Student must focus on studies. There are elections where ideologies can be debated. Students are free to do social work. If Universities and other govt institutions are funded from Public tax money then they must do their work. Regarding politics at these educational institutions, most of these institutions are leftist and were supported by the Congress, UPA. The leftist ideology knows how to raise questions and make people unstable. It never gives practical answers (forget implementing them) to the questions it raises and that's a BIG BIG problem.

                            Mr. Khera, even though you know what had happened in JNU is wrong and should condemned, i feel amazed to see you commenting on some one who has rightly pointed some arguments against funding of JNU. Do you or all other secular leaders want India to become Pakistan?

                            Such poor defence. Mr. Khera, India is growing at 7% y-o-y, creating jobs and life for millions due to the likes of Mohandas Pai who have created companies, industries, not the politicians who have come out of JNU, who have little else to contribute other than intellectual angst, which you yourself justified as misguided youthful rebellion. But Mr. Khera, the professors on campus are no youth, neither is your grand old party, so why this partisan view against even the larger interest of our nation

                            What a tragedy. We are willing to believe and agree with the denial of a terrorist like Hafiz Sayeed but not willing to believe our HM.How does the facts of the situation change if ABVP has won elections or not at JNU. I through my Tax pay and subsidize education at the colleges and hence surely can question like Mr. Mohandas Pai on the funds spent for education or student politics. Wish all the debate and discussions ever contribute to up-liftment of society and social civic sense of our country. Would surely not like our own countrymen fighting for a Terrorist and wasting time debating his innocence even after due judicial process.

                            If the discourse was for common good, one can understand. But hailing a terrorist who waged war against the nation and sloganing against nation good cant be called discourse. It deserves to be condemned and if we have a law it must get enforced. Country majority has suffered enough in 60 years and it is time to assert its right if democracy means respecting majority sentiment.
