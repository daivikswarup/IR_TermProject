                            British education made sure we never know our great history. Our history glorified our  invaders including moguls with chapters over chapters in text. Our govt continued that tradition. Hopefully there will be more inclusion of our history in the text. Govt needs to update our text.

                            Kandahar's original name was Gandhar. The Gandhar kingdom has been recorded in the Vedas and most famously in the Mahabharat. Dhritrashtra's wife, Gandhari, was from the kingdom of Gandhar. Recent excavations in Gandhar trace human civilisation in the region dating as far back as 30000 BC which we Hindus refer to as Satya Yuga.

                            Gandhar was once a civilization that created the Bamiyan Buddhas and has now become a civilization that destroyed the same statues. What positive things have come out of Afghan civilization ever since the Shahi dynasty was defeated and moved to Punjab and then India? Over the past centuries, Afghanistan has produced marauders and raiders in to India and whenever India was weak these raiders have come and ravaged the country. The earlier civilization that existed is no longer there.

                            Rare gem in 'opinion' section. Informative, and to an extent educative. Looking at the 'comment' section, No wonder NDTV avoid such articles. Netizens just throng and rush to comment on MSA or Ms. Karat, or Ms. Ayyub, etc. If there is an absence of Hero from Ashok till Mahatma Gandhi, is it due to genuine dearth of Hero? or is it that they only remained attraction for historians? And if Indian historian do not research and publish on others, how would international historian be attracted? Will including such research in education, won't raise noise about 'saffronization'? I afraid !! Would love to read more from the author.

                            the writer of this article needs to respect the king by addressing him as Ashoka The Great instead of killer Alexander. Learn to respect your culture and motherland
