                            Very well said, Mr. Tharoor. A lot of us are with you in the same sense of being a "Hindu" as you have described. Being a Hindu is very cool precisely because of some of the facts you have mentioned (all encompassing, doesn't claim to be the only true religion etc). That humility is what is great about being a Hindu and also used to be about being an Indian.

                            Dr. Tharoor - As always a pleasure to read your noting! Absolutely right on your points about Hinduism. It is the freedom of practice afforded by Hinduism and its non-autocratic and progressive tenets which make it so unique and lovable. Various vested interests over centuries have usurped (or tried to) its administration, but fortunately failed. Only religion, if I may so, which in its pure unadulterated version, was progressive since initial promulgation and remains relevant today and will do so tomorrow. As for Mr. Kher, he's suddenly become an angry bitter 'old' man, and much as I respect his brilliant acting nous, my respect for him as a political activist never took off the ground.<br/>

                            Mr Tharoor, please ponder over why many Hindus feel like this. You glossed over the appeasement politics of the so called secular parties. If this policy of appeasement produces a reaction who is to blame? Malda is a  recent example and what do we have in the media and reaction of the "secular" parties, nothing, instead it was termed a small fight between BSF and local population. Hindus reformed themselves and passed laws in India that are more in tune with modern living, why have we not been able to pass the uniform civil code?

                            Pretty awesome, bookmarked! It made me reflect on the positive aspects of Hinduism I was hitherto unaware of, or indeed knew subconsciously but couldn't articulate as well as you did. However, I tend to view religion in my own personal way - how and whether does it answer existential questions about death, aging, compassion and finding your larger purpose in life. My experience of Hinduism unfortunately did not seem to provide any of these answers and was reduced, in childhood, to visiting raucous temples. indoctrinated priests and their rituals and people blindly following them, which as I grew older looked more and more distasteful and irrational. Buddhism seemed to be willing to discuss the aforementioned, very real, questions in an honest and open way and I've partly taken a liking to it in recent years. Also, in my account, most of what you say is extremely positive but framed in a way that focuses on what other religions do not have which makes your well-reasoned argument a little bit not standing on its own feet, a promotion by comparison if you will. And for all its goods - no insistence on rituals, no set books to proclaim your faith by, no insistence on prayers etc. - life as I live it doesn't change by the practice of its principles (as enunciated in the Gitas and Vedas) so I don't feel as proud about Hinduism as you do, but appreciate nonetheless all that it stands for, as laid out in this article. And please don't mind Kher's silly, half-baked, foot-in-the-mouth statements - on your Twitter handle, the JLF or elsewhere. A late bloomer who thinks he can join the party anytime he likes without first seeing all sides of the story deserves to be responded in the sort of manner that best serves such sorts - with no response at all.

But unfortunately today Sanghis try to bring into their brand of Hinduism sans no spiritual depth in it.And I think today it is a fashion among certain people who support a particular party to proclaim that they are scared of being a Hindu/telling openly that they are Hindus etc.Actually  Anupam Kher's words must read in this context. I have seen the real 'fear' in my Muslim friend who resides in Delhi during Dadri incident and thus I realised  how it being a minority in a country where religion touches all aspects of life.Perhaps one must experience that sort of fear to understand that and it pains me beyond words when people try to paint the whole community with the same colour.

Maybe, an accurate statement would be: Hindus believe that all religions are equal ONCE they too say the same thing. The details of theology and ritual can of course be different. But this one point is critical, though. Very critical.

                            Who is a Hindu? That question does not have satisfactory answers. Just as defining Hinduism is an impossibility. The issue here has obviously more to do with the current debate on intolerance. Are Hindus inherently intolerant? Does Hinduism propagate intolerance? This would be more contextual if juxtaposed against another religion and the same questions asked. The answers stare one in the face. Various minorities like Muslims and Christians, not to speak of Parsees and Jews, have survived and prospered in India only because of Hindu tolerance. And this tolerance has existed from time immemorial. Do Christians, Hindus and Sikhs prosper in Pakistan which was a part of India till 70 years back? If not, why not? What about every Islamic country in the world? Even the West learned religious tolerance only a few hundred years back, before that the Spanish Inquisition and similar movements persecuted minorities who were not Christians in every country in Europe bar none. Anupam Kher is a Kashmiri Hindu and he knows a thing or two about religious intolerance. Which Sashi Tharoor with his westernised background and views obviously does not. Claiming to be a proud Hindu and being a proud Hindu are two different things. Tharoor is the former, while Kher is the latter. And if Kher claims he is scared to openly admit his faith in a country overwhelmingly Hindu in every aspect, then that is something that needs to be debated in the background of so many public figures whining about growing intolerance. Without any proof as to whether it is actually so, and if so, who is responsible for it.

To counter your argument, why don't you try to live in a Muslim neighborhood like Old Delhi or Old City of Hyderabad or for that matter any other city... i'm sure you will come back as a discriminated Hindu.<br/><br/>
My point is, please stop this sickularism trash. This is exactly what Mr.Kher has objection too... On one hand you are trying to act smart as a proud Hindu, at the same time you are talking about victimization at the Hands of Hindus....<br/><br/>

                            Exactly my thoughts on Hinduism. But let me ask you a few things, Mr. Tharoor. I was born and brought up in Kerala as a Hindu Nair. Many of my friends, both Christians and Muslims have always been given special privileges especially in admission to higher educational institutions as well as in Govt jobs. Even though they are rich, they still get reservations everywhere.The reason is that they always stick together and hence a convenient vote bank for politicians. If the majority feels a little disgruntled by the situation, can you find fault with that?

                            Gandhi ji enjoyed trust of masses . He is the best example of real Hindu and practiced all good facility to the fullest be it tolerances, equality, truth and harmonious coexistence ."Hey Ram" was the last spoken word by Gandhi ji. His model of Hindu religion helped to gain popular attention of chritions and many of them get converted to Hindu faith. The present extremist minded Sangh parivar's activists are apposed to everything which was epitomized by Gandhi ji and bringing disrepute to this faith . Religious complexities in  India is a big taboo in the present times of intolerance/extremist fundamentalism. The tragedy of present majority Hindu religion is that the it's self styled leaders are reinventing religion on the pattern of religions who have have already departed from their original religion's basics. In this process of forced evolution the original Hindu religion will neighter remain Hindu nor become adopted deformed religion and leave us nowhere. So it is very aptly declared that these fringe elements claimant of representative of Hindu faith are pseudo Hindu and they are misusing religious for worldly gains.But just notice at what cost?

                            Dear Dr Tharoor... your idea of Hinduism is spot on... but you use the term "Sanghi" as if they are aliens or monsters that were sent from hell to create mischief on earth... to the contrary they are common people, normal Hindus like you and me who have seen or experienced the tentacles of conversion, faced the ugly truth of minority appeasement propagated by your INC and decided to be aggressive rather than passive. You and your friends at INC are hell bent on imparting a devilish facade to the RSS, which has never ever denounced minority's beliefs or ideals rather taken steps to protect the dilution of Indian culture and values Hinduism stands for. Your saying or portraying so does not make RSS ( for that is what you allude to by using the word "Sanghi" ) anti national, for had it been so, your own CONgress governments that ruled India for decades would have outlawed it. So please stop being a hypocrite and let Hindus be.

                            Sir, very well written, but I only wish it was 100% true. There are some elements of truth, when you mentioned that sporting a non-Hindu name might land you in trouble hunting for a house in certain areas. It is also true that there is no need to be a belligerent Hindu. But, you cannot deny the fact that minority appeasement has reached disgusting levels and the average Hindu feels that he is being discriminated against. The state which you represents, I believe has a special help for widows from the minority community. I even saw a poster which mentions converted Christians. This sort of a blatant appeasement is what makes the average Hindu seethe and pushes him to be belligerent. The cliche - 'To be secular is to be anti Hindu' has been proven more than once by the young MLA from your party and state. Your understanding of Hinduism cannot be disputed and the majority of them follow it - that is why India is such a vibrant place. As one of the Bishop's recently commented, even before the constitution was framed Hindu's and other religions lived peacefully here. I only wish there were more people like you who truly believed it!! Unfortunately you are a gentleman among congressmen.

When your party does only minority appeasement and totally ignore the concerns of Hindus,you are actually giving birth to more such people. Minorities should be protected but not at the expense of victimizing the majority. Please refrain your divide and rule policy. Hindus have suffered a lot when your party was at helm. Please don't push them past their breaking point.

The reality is that India is the only country in the world where we cater to minorities irrationally and horribly submitting to their terrible religious prejudices (e.g.; the Shah Bano case) and punish the majority community only for being a majority (e.g.; taking control of their religious temples and their wealth to be misused by leftist / communist / anti-Hindu bureaucrats). No wonder the Hindus feel suffocated and threatened.

India and Nepal are the real last bastions of this great religion or should I say way of life, and it has nearly been eradicated like polio from places it flourished before, monotheistic religions refer to it as paganism or kafirs and looked down upon, so isn't it natural for a protective and vocally aggressive version of a peaceful religion to emerge?

When you have to receive it back, your MP patronage gets invoked. remember, people don't care what you are. But in the name of freedom of expression, you should always mind reasonable restriction. As an MP you must have followed this basic etiquette. For not doing so, you deserve what you received. On top of all you write a long article on this silly subject. Instead you could have done something good in your constituency. World is changing, people are changing, you better change for good as well. Otherwise you will be ignored like many others... the diggies, sibals, thivaris, soon pappu etc are the live example for you.<br/><br/>

                            The burden to always to remain politically correct and secular must be immense on congress and chamchas. Although Kher's remarks are not politically justified, calling yourself a Hindu is very rare these days. BJP and RSS are thwacked by the Media left, right and centre when they call themselves as Hindu's and Tharoor has the nerve to justify this viewpoint by calling RSS as different Hindus. FYI,Tharoor right now the burning issue is not about Hindu, Muslim or any other religion,it is about equality. Where do we have equality in our society? We have passed many amendments to our constitution since its inception giving special privileges to communities. Equality does not mean special privileges it means equal privileges to all. Right now, our constitution does not offer equality. Media and Congress have worked remarkably well over the years to continuously mold the minds of the youth to accept this inequality. Hindu's are better treated in the west than in its own country. No matter how hard you try, you cannot keep Hindus subdued. Either treat everyone equally by having the measuring stick (law) else India will have to face another split just like Pakistan. We never learn lessons from the past, Pakistan felt they were not being treated equally hence they separated , now going by the trend Hindus will again ask for a separate land or even prepare for a holocaust just the way it happened to Pandits. These things can be subverted only by getting one law in place. It's time to act and defeat religion based politics from it's roots.

                            Shashsi Tharoor is right from his perspective, Bur problem lies when a Hindu Girl is raped and killed in West Bengal same Hindu politicians don't visit their homes to console them because votes of Hindus are taken for granted since politicians divide Hindu votes on caste lines. it is obvious that when we don't see Hindu Politicians  greeting us on Diwali, Holi and other festivals but they   never forget to attend Iftar parties, hence value of Hindus and sentiments are always  undermined . When has Rahul Gandhi ( Who claims to be having roots from Kashmiri Pandits) because Mr. Nehru was  born a Kashmir Pandit visited  homes of Pandits whose family members were killed by Terrorists in Kashmir.  Indira Gandhi had some concern for miniscule minority of J&amp;K state. Rajiv Gandhi and his ilk  forgot afterwards .<br/><br/>
In 80s, when Rajiv Farooq accord happen, Farooq on stage said  " Ek Musalaman ka Muhada Ek Hindu ke saath Hua hai" Rajiv Gandhi shot back " But I am not a Hindu" May be he had minority votes in mind hence felt ashamed to call himself Hindu... Farooq is still alive and this can be verified from him at any time.<br/><br/>

Man, go and get a life or get on with what you do, perhaps like Kher spreading lies and creating hate. That is what sanghis do. That is why Tharoor tweeted thinking Kher might come to sense.

                            Well Said Mr Tharoor !!<br/><br/>
Sanghis will push India to dark ages.<br/><br/>
No one ever felt scared of shouting - Hinduism in India post Independence.<br/><br/>
But for sure, due to sanghis soon the minority religion will feel the heat. <br/><br/>
The Truth will not be prevailed - Until India is in the hands of Facists

                            I am Proud of EVERYTHING from Hinduism, except from some of the man made practices.<br/><br/>

IF OUR RELIGION IS MYTHOLOGY, THEN WHO'S IS REALITY..

                            I am an Hindu but not the rss type :-). Why do you make such immature generalized substanceless comments and then spend weeks defending it.

                            Come on Shashi tharoor. You expose your double speak. First you describe the most liberal and intellect aspects Hinduism - what it really stands for. And then you claim such hinduism is a minority in Hinduism itslef? Come on you are no exception all of us are like that only. Sangh is no exception. For thousands of years Hindus have been like that will remain like that. You should not resort to fear mongering. In this world, true secularism stands only till Hindus are considerable to occupy the planet.

                            I watched the interview but the way Mr Kher said it was mere dramebaazi...didn't think much of it. I just thought of a 'Sridevi's rumoured twin sis' photoshoot he did on some film magazine cover for April 1 years ago.
