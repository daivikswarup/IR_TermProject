                            Every Paki wants Indian side to restrain, Go to any 3rd source and they will tell you, attacks in India are carried out by Paki terrorists, otherway round is not true. Infact, India should be much tougher on Pak than it really is. They can not hide behind non-state actors. State or non-state, if it is from Pak soil then Pa is responsible. Period.

                            Regarding Manohar Parrikar's statement, he did not take any names. Why can't we assume that his statement was only targeted against the perpetrators of the Pathankot attack whoever that might be. Where as Rehman Malik has directly attributed today's attack in Pakistan to RAW without any evidence which is political immaturity. So please don't compare the two.

                            Pakistan had declared the Ahmadis as non- Muslims. The Sunni Muslims have been harassing the Shias now. Its Hindu- Sikh population had been reduced by it from 27 to 4 %.. There is an insurgency movement in Baluchistan. There are mafias of disgruntled populations, smugglers, gun runners and drug traffickers in Pakistan. The ISI and the Army have an iron hand on the civil Power. ISI and many in Armed Forces have clandestine relations with all kinds of trouble makers. The PM of Pakistan can not implement his promise of curbing terrorism. In such a context, putting the blame on India is the best thing to do. It solves all problems for the Army and the ISI. The people will forget their miseries in their hatred to India. The Army's primary role in the Nation will continue unaffected The Policy of the Pak PM is derailed by such a claim. Also the terrorists under the Army's protection will not have any problems from public opinion. Well done.

                            Sow the wind and reap the whirlwind ! Pakistan an ideological failure has sought to intensify the islamic narrative which in essence is a fraudulent enterprise. The roots of pakistan's problems go back to its very inception when its founders' realised the error and instead of seeking to pragmatically rectify the historic mistake with a sincere interaction with men of the calibre of Nehru, they opted for an anti-India (Read anti-Hindu) islamic ideological project which will culminate in the destruction of the wretched country. The spread of the islamic poison goes too deep and wide in pakistani state institutions and society generally for it to survive. The Beduin hand seeking security through a mercenary army does not help.

                            The Pakistani Army set up Military Courts; essentially sham courts to kill whom they perceived as 'militants against Pakistan' and  ordered wholesale killings of people- including paraplegics and boys who were minors. The Army has used terror - whether against its enemies or its own people and it is obvious that they will hit back. Common Pakistanis, unfortunately, will bear the brunt of this foolish policy of the saviours of Pakistan, everytime.

                            Pakistan has become a snake pit of Islamic terrorism. Wherever you go and study the cause of terrorism in one instance or tge other....there is definitely a Ppakistan connection (and then a Saudi connection). So its natural that Pakistan would also get hit. So the Pakisrani Army and ISI should stop playing the good terrorist / bad terrorist. The only good terrorist is a dead terorist. Osama bin Laden killed in Pakistan Army top military Academy city - Good terrorist!!!

                            As the author rightly pointed out the terrorists are afraid of education and afraid of the power of knowledge.It is sad that the pakistani authorities didnt possess a strong political will to wipe out terror. How is it possible for a nation to tolerate cold blooded murder of innocent students? Pakistan government should attempt to control fundamentalism otherwise their future will be terribly bad.

                            Qaid-E-Azam must be rolling in his grave. He asked for a separate state for the Security and well being of the Muslim community.<br/>
In 1971 East Pakistan was formed because the Punjabi's and the Bengali's couldn't get along. What has the country achieved in the past 68 years. Even the nuclear knowledge was stolen from "the Hague". I worked for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and it was a very hot topic then.<br/>
Blaming external forces is out of question, so now even the Muslim's who were supposed to be safe in an Islamic state can see their children being killed right under the parents nose.<br/>
The terrorists trained by the Army and ISI have turned against their own masters.<br/>
People who are educated and have a say should put an end to the killing of innocent children without any rhyme or reason. The children had nothing to do with the "Dirty Politics".

After Peshawar, India kept its flag at half past. And now no condolence or sympathy for Pakistani's this time. In fact we Indians don't care about Pakistani's dying at the hands of their own dogs.<br/>
Second, Keep blaming India, still the fact is we don't care.<br/><br/>
As far as terrorist attacks in In India, we are done blaming Pakistan. If a terrorist attack happens in India, we will blame our political class and security agencies and we are going to hold them accountable. We will look inward and blame our 56 inch chest PM and ask him to flex his muscles and demand he keeps his promise. And if he don't we will elect a new PM next time who will.  <br/><br/>
So, Pakistani people can take their cries for sympathy somewhere else.

                            Of course , the write up so namby-pamby in opinion , would definitely find a place in NDTV , or perhaps any of FOX media publications.  An opportunist is one who mends fact in ways that suits his goals, in this case I cease to figure out one. The writer says nothing new, it is just a same old lullaby that every Pakistani antagonist is singing  be it in india or the west.  <br/>
Since the article is so redundant in nature that I find nothing much to comment on it but just a few thoughts are <br/>
1.	New York times, Washington post , think tanks US congressmen and global political commentators admit what the stats also verify, The operation Zarb-e-Azab has profound difference in the state of terrorism in Pakistan, yet the writer fails to acknowledge it. <br/>
2.	Secondly, terrorism attacks since 9/11, have taken over the globe, US, Europe, Asia, Gulf , the strongest of the intelligence and security setups have scum to the evil designs of terrorism. But the writer poses as if it all the only terrorism that exist is in Pakistan <br/>
3.	Fundamentalism has grown manifolds and is evident in the daily Indian lives. Minorities are not safe in India and the world knows it now. The writer apparently mentions statements , recorded on video, by Ajit Doval in which he literally admits to fund and finance Taliban for cross border terrorism in Pakistan, yet a Pakistani like him fails to address it as cross border effort and finds issues in the national action plan. <br/>
4.	For the record, Pakistan has been fighting terrorism for last 15 years, the days of patronizing are long gone, but of course if the writer won't mention it that we were the harbingers of terrorism in the world , then how will he find space in Indian journals.

                            Dear Ali,<br/><br/>
There voices of moderate Pakistanis who don't support terrorism are not strong enough.Their Military Bosses and agencies who openly support Terrorist activities in Af, Chin and Ind should think twice now. Instead of wasting their time in creating confusion in foreign soil, they should defend their own country and get rid of Terrorist Groups from Pak(both Good and Bad). If you breed Terrorist inside your own soil, obviously you are going to be its biggest victim. Hope your ISI, Military and Rulers will accept this reality.

As Hillary Clinton remarked , you cannot rear snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors ... Pakistan should stop hatred against India simply on communal lines and they should understand India has more muslim population than them ( even though some miscreants still look to Pakistan and think that is their homeland) ......Unless Pakis are genuine and stop telling lies , their fate will be only in the dustbin of History ..

At least in other Islamic countries the intellectuals are not in denial, they either support their conservtism or keep quiet in fear of reprisals.  Only in Pakistan they give India color to everything.  Why does the author have to mention Indian defense minister's statement in this story.  Just because he mentioned the stupid statement by one of their own.
