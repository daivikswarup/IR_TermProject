<p style="">Republican front runner Donald Trump has praised Pope Francis for "doing a great job" in a backtrack, hours after calling describing the Pontiff as <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-calls-pope-francis-disgraceful-and-says-vatican-will-be-attacked-by-isis-press-a6881926.html" target="_blank">'disgraceful'</a>.</p>
<p style="">During a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis had <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-is-not-christian-says-pope-francis-a6881846.html" target="_blank">responded</a> to Mr Trump's proposal for a wall along the US-Mexican border by saying: "A person who thinks only about building walls...and not of building bridges, is not Christian."</p>
<p>On the campaign trail in South Carolina, Mr Trump's initially had responded angrily to the Pope's comment, saying: "For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.</p>
<p>"I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President.</p>
<p>"No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith."</p>
<p>Later in the day at a televised town hall meeting in Greenville, South Carolina, Mr Trump made a more considered statement: "<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">I have a lot of respect for the Pope. He has a lot of personality and I think he's doing a very good job, he has a lot of energy."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">However, he did reiterate his belief the Pope had been ignorant of the drugs being smuggled into the US and other security issues before criticising his border wall proposal.</span></p>

<p>"I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me —and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."</p>
