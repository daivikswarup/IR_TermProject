<p style="">After a hiccup in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/iowa-caucus">Iowa</a>, Donald Trump looks to be back on course for the Republican nomination.</p>
<p style="">Having recovered with a big win in <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-hampshire-primary">New Hampshire</a> last week, Trump leads big in polls ahead of next week's South Carolina primary. </p>
<p>Betting markets now think it's about 50:50 whether he or someone else will win. And he ranks second to Clinton as America's most likely President.</p>
<p>How did he do it? Thankfully, he left a paper trail. His 1987 memoir, <em>The Art of the Deal</em>, offers a dozen pieces of priceless life advice. Here are Donald's Commandments.</p>
<p>“I don’t do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.</p>
<p>“Deal-making is an ability you’re born with. It’s in the genes. It’s not about being brilliant. It does take a certain intelligence, but mostly it’s about instincts. You can take the smartest kid… the one who gets straight A’s and has a 170 IQ, and if he doesn’t have the instincts, he’ll never be a successful entrepreneur.”</p>
<p>“My style of deal-making is simple. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I’m after.”</p>
<p>“To me it’s very simple: if you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big. Most people think small, because they’re afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of <em>winning</em>.”</p>
<p>"Some of the candidates, they went in and didn’t know the air conditioner didn’t work and sweated like dogs, and they didn’t know the room was too big because they didn’t have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS?"</p>

<p>"I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me —and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words."</p>

<p>"Free trade is terrible. Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people. But we have stupid people."</p>

<p>"When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re sending people that have lots of problems. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists."</p>

<p>"I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them?... I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower."</p>

<p>"If you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them. Instead make your work more pleasurable."</p>

<p>"What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate."</p>
<p>"Everything in life is luck."</p>

<p>"You have to think anyway, so why not think big?"</p>

<p>"Bush is totally in favour of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favour of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it."</p>

<p>"You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high. It's virtually useless. And remember the $5 billion web site?... I have so many web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a web site. It costs me $3."</p>

<p>"Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him. I have the best courses in the world. I have one right next to the White House."</p>

<p>"Love him or hate him, Trump is a man who is certain about what he wants and sets out to get it, no holds barred. Women find his power almost as much of a turn-on as his money."</p>

<p>"The American Dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before and we will make America great again."</p>

<p>“One of the keys to thinking big is total focus. I think of it almost as a controlled neurosis, a quality I’ve noticed in many highly successful entrepreneurs. They’re obsessive, driven and almost maniacal, but it’s all channeled into their work.”</p>
<p>“I don’t say this trait leads to a happier life, or a better life, but it’s great when it comes to getting what you want.”</p>
<p>“Most people are surprised by the way I work. I don’t carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. You can’t be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you’ve got too much structure. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops. There is no typical week in my life.”</p>
<p>“I usually arrive at my office by nine, and I get on the phone. There’s rarely a day with fewer than fifty calls, and often it runs to over a hundred. In between, I have at least a dozen meetings, but the majority occur on the spur of the moment, and few of them last longer than fifteen minutes.”</p>
<p>“People think I’m a gambler. I’ve never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines. I happen to be very conservative in business. I always go into the deal anticipating the worst. If you can live with the worst, the good will always take care of itself.”</p>
<p>“I don’t hire a lot of number-crunchers, and I don’t trust fancy marketing surveys. I do my own surveys and draw my own conclusions. When I’m in another city and I take a cab, I’ll always make a point to ask the cabdriver questions. I ask and I ask and I ask, until I begin to get a gut feeling.”</p>
<p>“The greatest of consulting firms charge you $100,000 for a lengthy study and in the end it has no conclusion and takes so long to complete that if the deal you were considering was a good one, it will be long gone.”</p>
<p>“The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you’re dead. The best thing you can do is deal from strength.</p>
<p>“Leverage is having something the other guy wants. Or better yet, needs. Or best of all, simply can’t do without. Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case, which is why leverage often requires imagination and salesmanship.”</p>
<p>“Much as it pays to emphasise the positive, there are times when the only choice is confrontation. I’m very good to people who are good to me. But when people treat me badly or try to take advantage of me, my general attitude has been to fight back very hard.”</p>
<p>“The risk is you’ll make a bad situation worse, but my experience is that if you’re fighting for something you believe in – even if it means alienating some people along the way – things usually work out for the best.”</p>
<p>“You can have the most wonderful product in the world, but if people don’t know about it, it’s not going to be worth much. You need to generate interest and create excitement.”</p>
<p>“The press is always hungry for a good story, and the more sensational the better. It’s in the nature of the job. If you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you.”</p>
<p>“If it can’t be fun, what’s the point? Life is very fragile, and success doesn’t change that. If anything, success makes it more fragile. Anything can change, without warning, and that’s why I try not to take any of what’s happened too seriously.”</p>
<p>“I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about what I should have done differently, or what’s going to happen next. What do my deals add up to? I’m not sure, except that I’ve had a very good time making them.”</p>
