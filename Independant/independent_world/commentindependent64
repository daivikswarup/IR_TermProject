On the contrary Papa, good walls make good neighbours, and, once built, let's hope they don't come tumbling down like those of Jericho!


That's rich coming from a jesuit and satanist and a paedophile.I think you need to go to prison for your crimes you scumbag


Try not to respond to the voices in your head saying all those terrible things about you.


I take it that the huge wall surrounding the Vatican is now going to be ripped down or is the Pope just being a hypocrite.Wouldn't it be 'Christian' of the Vatican if they helped to alleviate world poverty/hunger by using the vast millions they have and the property they own.


"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian', he said" - strange then that Vatican City is walled and so is the Vatican itself - with armed guards and locked doors.


You're not well informed at all Alison; this pope is fighting very hard cardinals and priest because of their lifestyle and unlike his predecessor he had a zero tollerance attitude about peadophile scandal in Europe and America.. 


Pope: Trump is not ChristianObama: ISIS is not MuslimMe: Religious people are not religious they only think they are.
