You like bether an half-blood, with the nobel peace prise, make 8 of war, and killing millions of people for freedom as he says, yes we can !


Irrelevant to the elections one way or another.


What me makes afraid, how bad lots of people are informed, about the history of the United states of North Amerika, how it started his history by butchering from new Amerikans by the British Hannovirian mercenarys, the slave trade wash in hands of the Khazars, the plantations as well.As you know the winners are writing the history, the whole thing is such a hotchpotch, you can feel where the power still lives, listen to the songs Johny Cash and others, its in the south where the lofe for the old land of the Free, the United states stil lives, not in the north, their its dead and burried!


HUHH?


Given the incredible levels of black criminality in the US, I think the crime of slavery has been repaid many times over. Let them fly their Confederate flag.


Your outfit makes your head look pointy.


The flag stands for the confederacy, and the confederacy stands for racism. Or more precisely, slavery of black people. It's why they formed, they were not in the least shy about it. 


Another embarassment for this once great country, but, alas, nevermore.


Well said indeed.


These nasty people really are beyond redemption. The rest of the world should be very afraid...


And just think, they run the planet.
