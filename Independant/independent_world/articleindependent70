<p style="">The missile system used to down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was transported into Ukraine by Russian soldiers with “high-level” authorisation, a new report has claimed.</p>
<p style="">An<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mh17-report-investigators-reconstruct-wreckage-to-show-how-boeing-777-was-downed-by-warhead-blast-a6692461.html"> investigation completed by the Dutch Safety Board </a>last year concluded that the plane was downed by a warhead fired by a Buk system that detonated a metre away from the cockpit and caused the aircraft to break up and crash, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board.</p>
<p>Those findings did not assign responsibility for the disaster, which is the subject of a separate criminal probe, but identified a 320 sq km area of eastern Ukraine from which the missile was fired.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bimwlr1pyyk9dvy/53rd-report-public.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">report </a>released today, a group of investigative citizen journalists have used social media posts, satellite images and video footage to trace the Buk missile system alleged to have downed MH17 from Russia into Ukraine.</p>
<p>The launcher, labelled Buk 3x2, can allegedly be traced in a convoy operated by Russia’s 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade from a base in Kursk, Russia, to the Ukrainian border near Millerovo.</p>
<p>Footage and images taken on 23 and 24 June 2014, less than a month before the crash, show the weapon being transported with several other rocket launchers, a command post and radar equipment.</p>
<p>“There is no direct evidence indicating if it was Russian or separatist soldiers who operated Buk 3×2 when it was in Ukraine,” Bellingcat researchers said. “However, considering the complexity of the Buk-M1 system, it is most likely that the Russian military did not transfer a Buk missile launcher to separatist commanders without some guidance or a Russian crew.”</p>
<p>Buk 3x2 was identified in rebel-held Ukrainian territory around Donetsk, Torez and Snizhne on the day MH17 crashed in nearby Hrabove.</p>

<p><em>Associated Press</em> journalists documented seeing the Buk being transported through the town of Snizhne on 17 July 2014, noting that the uniforms of some members of its crew differed from separatists and claiming they spoke with “a distinctive Russian accent”.</p>
<p>The account was supported by three eyewitnesses who told the BBC they saw a Buk launcher being unloaded by Russian soldiers in Snezhnoye, 10 miles from the crash site, hours before MH17 was hit.</p>
<p>In images taken on the following morning, the system appears to be missing one missile.</p>
<p>Shortly after MH17’s disappearance, a post attributed to separatist leader <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mh17-victims-families-sue-russian-rebel-leader-accused-of-shooting-down-plane-for-damages-10392367.html">Igor Girkin</a>, a Russian army veteran, claimed rebels had shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/prorussian-separatists-online-boasts-about-shooting-down-plane--lkdnz9MKbe">swiftly-deleted on Russian social network VKontakte </a>was accompanied by a video of rising smoke and said: “We warned them - don’t fly in our sky.”</p>
<p>Intercepted phone calls between rebels also appeared to show their involvement, with an alleged recording dated on 18 July 2014 showing a man saying the launcher had been brought from Russia by a contact code-named “the Librarian”.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-crash-pro-russian-separatists-discuss-downing-of-flight-mh17-in-leaked-audio-9613893.html">Conversations released by the Security Service of Ukraine</a> appeared to show a panicked militant telling a superior: “It was 100 per cent a passenger aircraft…there are civilian items, medicinal stuff, towels, toilet paper.”</p>
<p>Separatist groups have since denied any involvement in the disaster, while Russian officials have continually dismissed allegations of soldiers or equipment being deployed in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In its own investigation, Russian Buk manufacturer Almaz Antey <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-missile-maker-contradicts-dutch-mh17-crash-report-a6692071.html">claimed the deadly missile was fired from Zaroschenskoy</a>e and that Ukrainian forces were stationed there at the time.</p>
<p>The Joint Investigation Team conducting the criminal investigation into the crash issued footage of Buk 3x2 as part of a call for witnesses.</p>
<p>Its information matched Bellingcat’s analysis, showing the weapon being transported throughout the Donbass region and around Snizhne, although no verdict has yet been reached.</p>
<p>Bellingcat said it sent an extended and uncensored version of its report to investigators in December, including the full names and photographs of soldiers associated with the 2nd Battalion of the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">“Although it is likely that the head officials of Russia’s Ministry of Defence did not explicitly decide to send a Buk missile launcher to Ukraine, the decision to send military equipment (with or without crew) from the Air Defence Forces to Ukraine was likely made at a very high level and, therefore, the Russian Ministry of Defence bears the main responsibility for the downing of MH17,”the group’s report concluded.</span></p>
<p>“This responsibility is shared with separatist leaders of the Donetsk People’s Republic and (to a lesser extent) the Luhansk People’s Republic…ultimately, responsibility for the downing of MH17 from a weapon provided and possibly operated by the Russian military lies with its two head commanders: Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu and President Vladimir Putin.”</p>
<p>The conflict continues in Ukraine more than two years after a separatist insurgency started in the east following the toppling of President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of France and Germany expressed concern that the crisis could escalate once again during a visit to Kiev on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The two countries have been trying to help resolve the conflict that has killed more than 9,000 people since April 2014. </p>

<p>1. First there was the Ukranian SU-25 angle that couldn't work because the SU-25 is a ground attack aircraft that can't reach the altitude that the Boeing 777 was flying at. Then they do a bad job with Photoshop doctored satellite photo to prove it but the plane in the photo they submitted to prove that a Ukrainan SU-25 shot down MH17 was actually a SU-27 http://english.pravda.ru/hotspots/disasters/23-12-2014/129365-witness_malaysian_boeing_ukraine-0/</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>2. Then there was the older version of the BUK (SA-11 ) missile that the Russians said they no longer use but the Ukrainians still use that was supposed to be responsible for the shoot down. http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/flight-mh17-russian-arms-manufacturer-claims-ukraine-buk-missile-shot-down-passenger-plane-1504037</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>3. Then they went back to the Ukrainian SU-25 theory but this time it includes a Israeli Python air to air missile that the Russian claim "May" have shot down MH17. http://newswatchreport.com/item/164732_russian-aviation-experts-israeli-made-python-air-to-air-missile-fired-from-israeli-upgraded-su-25-scorpion-may-have-downed-mh17</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>4. And finally they come back to the Ukrainian BUK missile conspiracy theory again conveniently at the same time that Dutch report is released. This would be hilarious accept for the fact that 298 innocent people 90 whom where children were killed. They haven't tried the space alien angle yet but give them enough time and they'll probably get around to it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Keep trying to obfuscate the truth with a lie and see what it gets you. You only dig a deeper hole for your country than you have already done and while your at it, please explain why on the day after the atrocity was committed by Russian anti-aircraft missile crew from the Russian army’s 53rd Air Defense Missile Brigade with Russian BUK anti-aircraft missile system.TELAR 312. Russians in Moscow gathered in from of the Dutch embassy and laid flowers and toys and asked for FORGIVENESS</p>
<p>http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/21/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-moscow-embassy/</p>
<p><span>The Russian army’s 53rd Air Defence Missile Brigade (based out of Kursk) shot down Malaysian Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine using an SA-11 missile fired from TELAR 312. Australia got a hold of </span>the video shot by some of the first Russian rebels (local Rambowannabes) who arrived on the scene right after the shoot-down. That is whenthey told “DNR” commanders in real time that the plane thought to be aUkrainian transport was actually a civilian airliner. Next thing they did atthe crash site was to secure it by going through bags of the victims and takingout things like phones and other things of value. Looting scum.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Making things worse is the factthat Russia, which just a day after the shoot-down demanded in the UN SecurityCouncil that an international investigation be started at once, now isvehemently against one (because they know that the evidence that one of theirSA-11s did it is incontrovertible). In fact, if the issue is proposed and comesto a vote in the UNSC, Russia will veto it. That will just be the final confirmation that Russia was the guilty party, but sadly those responsible, upto Putin of course, will probably never be held responsible. However, theDutch, who have pieced together the wreckage, recovered numerous fragments fromit of the shrapnel from the SA-11 warhead, and have been able to identify thecourse of the oncoming missile, will probably be releasing their findings inthe coming months. Those findings will point to only one possibleculprit–Russia.<br/><br/>The anniversary was marked by a sick display at Hrabove Ukraine where thewreckage impacted, as “DNR” leader Zakharchenko arrived in uniform with hisheavily armed bodyguard of regular Russian Spetsnaz soldiers, and a number oflocals turned out with “DNR” flags. One sick banner said on it “They killed youand they continue killing us” (correct actually if the “they” is Russia).Others held the flags of the countries of the victims, though the Malaysianflag was put upside down making it into the Polish one. A sick little monumentwas dedicated, written in Russian, stating that 298 innocent victims of thecivil war died there. A “civil war” where most of the “pro-Russian” dead andwounded are repatriated to another country–Russia–is no civil war. It is a warof invasion, full stop.<br/><br/>In another hypocritical move, Russian Foreign Minister and supreme liar Lavrovbrought flowers to the Dutch embassy in Moscow. Somebody should have thrownthem in his face. In any case, the ceremony and Lavrov’s sick move were nothingbut pure cynicism.</span></p>

<p>1.MH17 was shot down by a BUK missile</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.The exact type of missile was a 9M38M1 carrying a 9N314 warhead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3.The 9M38M1 missile  is out of production since 99. Ukraine Armed Forces still had 991 of those missiles its arsenal in 2005, when it held talks with Almaz-Antey on prolonging their lifespan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4.The BUK 9M317 missile type employed by the Russian Armed Forces is out of the question here, as the shape of the fragments does not match the damage caused to the aircraft according to Mikhail Malyshevsky, head engineer of the manufacturer company, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>5.The Russian armed forces now mainly use a 9M317M warhead with the BUK system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6.The version of Buk used against MH17 out of production before company was founded in 2002. Using this as case against sanctions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>7.Snizhne could not be the launch location based on the damage observed</p>
<p> </p>
<p>8.The launch location must have been around the village of</p>
<p>Zaroschinskoe</p>
<p> </p>
<p>9.If it were fired from Sninzhne, “the entire front end of the cabin would have been blown off”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10.Ukraine is responsible for downing MH17. Although this was not said as clearly by the company.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Above all, the Russian side had no MOTIVE and/or BENEFIT to bring down a passenger jet. The only thing this would achieve, is to provide for more propaganda material to western media.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Let us, on the other hand, google for <span>"Operation Northwoods", i.e. CIA's proposal to Kennedy to shoot down a civilian jet over Cuba, so that they could accuse it of terrorism, so that they would have an excuse to invade.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, one can google for:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>consortiumnews com 2015 07 22 obama should release <span class="currentHitHighlight">mh</span>-17 intel </p>
<p> </p>
<p>and read how ex CIA personnel themselves describe their role in: a) The downing of Korean Airlines Flight 007 over Siberia on August 30, 1983, and b) The shot down of an Iranian civilian airliner over the Persian Gulf on July 3, 1988 by USS Vincennes, when 290 people were killed. An act which President Ronald Reagan dismissively explained as an “understandable accident” (??).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Who is that considers downing passenger jets a standard policy, is clear to everyone.</p>
