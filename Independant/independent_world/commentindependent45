Bernie is only unelectable if you and other people think like that. Have the courage of your convictions and vote BERNIE.


It will be blacks and Latinos that will make Clinton win.


She's actively lying to those groups to win their support, yes.


It is true that historically africans and native americans are easily herded and controlled.But I think many are getting smarter


Fingers crossed it helps. Clinton represents Monsanto, the banking cartels and the industrial war machine.Sanders actually cares about people. Good luck America. This is a big chance for a different course.If Clinton wins, she is president. Don't be fooled by the charade that is Trump. He'll likely win the nomination but he'll never win the general. In fact Trump is Clintons ace. He will guarantee her victory. 


two idiots


Well, that's the kiss of death for Bernie
