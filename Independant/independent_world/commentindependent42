inbreeding, not interbreeding


Correct: dynastic 'families' still rule Europe, & even the USA. They are the aristocratic mafia. The UK has the top capo, Big Betty. As Diana discovered, nobody messes with her.The top euro-banana used to be the Pope. Whenever the Hapsburgs got stroppy, popes would favor the rival Hohenlohe gang.Altho family fortunes & powers have shifted over the years, the old aristocratic mafia still rules. Today, its formal council is the Bilderberg Group, a body much more powerful than the UN, & far more secretive.Britain's pols are commanded to attend its conclaves, where they are told what their coming policies are to be.Pols who buck the aristos' commands can, ultimately, be 'offed'. That's what happened to JFK, Aldo Moro, & Olaf Palme.


Hanwell,indeed, yes; but at the Norman Conquest, the land & great estates just changed hands - from one bunch of mafisosi to another. There was not much egalitarian about the slave/serf-owning Saxon overlords.


This doesn't explain at all - which countries used to be in the Hapsburg Empire ?


And what is now modern Germany of course.


Too much cake was said to be the cause of their downfall


Don't you mean the Battenberg's
