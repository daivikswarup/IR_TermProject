And there are still Muslims fighting for their autonomy in the Phillipines after 100 years.So what is the 'Donald' taking about? :-)


Members of Islamic State believe they won't get into Islamic heaven if they're killed by a woman. Such is their misogyny. Given that they are motivated almost entirely by rewards in the afterlife, in line with their death cult, it's reasonable that preventing their entry to Islamic heaven would strike the ultimate fear into them.It's a fact that they run away from female warriors on the battlefield.It's also a fact that Islamic State do not make up rules as they go along. They follow the Koran literally by the letter. So this fear probably extends to all Muslims, at least those who observe their faith closely.


I dont think that the moderate muslims are the problem here but its the wacko extremist radical muslims that want global jihad are. I think Trump merely suggested that we need to be tougher to rid ourselves with this cancer


This comment has more truth in it than all of Trump's speeches combined.


Thank you. So the story he quoted is indeed based on true facts. Well done Indepedent, another lying headline.


Trump is a poison and it is for shame people here are attracted to his bile.


America needs a President to think beyond tomorrow and bring about a union with Mexico, then it can turn its attention properly to other problems.


You're suggesting that Mexico becomes the 51st State?LOL You've never actually spoken to a real American, have you?


"Real American," you mean on of the people at Trump's Rally? Then no. You are really conceited and narrow minded to make a statement like this that speak for all "Real Americans."


He appeals to cowards.


"OK," you are even speaking like him, and who says "dandy?"


No, he scares cowards and people too weak to defend themselves.


Ah, this must be what Trump was referring to when he extolled his own Christian values and beliefs.


TROLL
