<p style="">A Chinese guide dog stolen from a blind masseur has been returned by the dognappers with a note of apology that said: "Please forgive us."</p>
<p style=""><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Qiaoqiao, an seven-year-old black Labrador, was taken by a gang of men in a grey van while being taken on a walk outside Beijing.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">She was found on Tuesday with a letter in a plastic bag attached to her collar which said: "We were wrong...we beg pardon."</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Her blind owner, Tian Fengbo told the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/world/asia/china-guide-dog.html?_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a> after she returned home: "</span>She is doing well, last night she was a bit low spirited, but now she’s fine.</p>
<p>"She’s right beside me, bouncing and vivacious."</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Mr Fengbo said he could "barely eat or sleep" after her kidnapping, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-35647825?OCID=twitterasia" target="_blank">BBC</a> reports.</span></p>
<p>Qiaoqiao had been living with him for the last five years before the abduction.</p>
<p>It is not known who the dognappers are or what their motive was.</p>
<p>A common crime across China, dog theives sell the kidnapped animals to meat markets. </p>
