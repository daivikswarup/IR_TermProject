Trump's rise makes no political sense - it's because people across the USA are FED UP - and it will be the same reason many people in the UK will vote OUT in the EU referendum.


The Pope should stick to rooting out all the paedophiles in the Catholic church and the shocking corruption in the Vatican . Leave Trump alone . (I am a catholic ).


"This is not in the gospel."Nor is a contraception ban, pederasty or wearing red shoes. But that doesn't stop some people.As to Trump: he's an outrageous troll who's tearing the GOP apart. What's not to enjoy about that?


In an ideal world we would be free to ignore both Trump and the pope, but unfortunately we live in a world where such idiots have power.America is surely the only "first world" country where such a comment from the pope would have the potential to significantly harm a candidate's chances - indeed in many others being marked out as different to all the other fundie Christians vying for the Republican nomination would be a great boon to ones chances.


Judging by current example, the Americans are just too stupid and ill-informed to care about the Pope. The fact that Trump still leads the Republican race tells us all we need to know. All that remains now is to see how the GOP take him down before the electoral procedure ends...


Unfortunately, a large percentage of the evangelicals and even some mainline protestants believe the Catholic Church is the Antichrist, and a lot of American Catholics think the Pope is entirely too anticapitalist.


That is true.


So Trump thinks the Pope is ignorant? Well it takes one to know one!
