Clinton is a secret republican. She is funded by Wall St, the Koch bros, Adelson et al. If she wins, they win even more than if any other republican wins.

Google Cathy O'Brien and get her take on Hillary.


What could be worse than a lying female Obamah, kick her out forever.


US 'democracy'. lulz all roundwho has the deepest pocket again?


Clinton is one of the best politicians in the world, and should be a stunning President, hopefully with Sanders as veep. I see the exact opposite to you, and that's that Sanders doesn't have a chance against Trump.Equally, Clinton is the democrats best chance of taking the republicans that would like a more centrist government. This whole damned binary bull that everyone must be black or white needs to stop, and America is leading the charge for that.


Clinton was born 6 years after him.


The "gruelling duties" seem to be starting wars and interfering all over the place. Perhaps we'd be better of with less "gruelling duties" and a bit more sitting round doing nothing; Sanders might be quite good at that.


Did Reagan really say to his officials , 'Don't just do something, stand there'? A sound principle whether said or not, less government in the sense of doing less as well as fewer government employees would bring many benefits in any and every country. Especially not getting involved in conflicts overseas.


How does the wicked witch keep fooling people?


I don't know either. Ours had enough fooled for way too long.
