<p>A 14-year-old student has been arrested after she allegedly attacked nine people with knives at an Ontario high school in what appeared to be a “random attack”, police have said.</p>
<p>Six students and three members of staff were injured on Tuesday morning at <a href="http://www.ddsb.ca/school/dunbartonhs/Pages/default.aspx#8ea8e73a-6c52-4ec9-872f-8103ff95952c26" target="_blank">Dunbarton High School</a> in Pickering.</p>
<p>All of the victims sustained non-life threatening injuries. <a href="http://www.drps.ca/internet_explorer/whatsnew/whatsnew_view.asp?Related_With=Media_Release&amp;Scope=&amp;Scope_ID=&amp;ID=30929" target="_blank">Durham Regional Police</a> said four people were taken to hospital, while the others were treated at the school for minor injuries.</p>
<p>The girl was held by two teachers until police arrived at the school shortly after 8:30am. It followed a report about a female student with two knives who was attacking people in the hallways.</p>
<p>Sergeant Bill Calder said: “There are different areas of the school where the assaults took place. It seems to be a random attack.”</p>
<p>In a statement from the school, Principal Randy Tennant said: “At approximately 8:30am today, a student entered the school with two knives and was immediately detected by other students who began to alert others. We commend our students for their courage and leadership.”</p>
<p>Student Kristina Petrovska, 14, said she narrowly missed being injured.</p>
<p>“I just ran for my life. I just can’t believe it happened. She almost got me,” she said.</p>
<p>Following a lockdown on Tuesday in which police checked the premises, classes at the school were expected to resume fully on Wednesday morning. The school said counselling and support would be available for students and staff.</p>
<p>Police are continuing to investigate the incident.</p>
