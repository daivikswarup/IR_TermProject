This man has the appearance of the consummate conman. More seriously, gives the impression of a dead man walking.


clearly you know nothing about his history.


Hillary would be the ideal republican presidential candidate.


The final 'race' will be between Trump and Sanders. Place your bets please...


I got 16's but only stuck a tenner on haha!


My betting agency only has the final outcome:Clonton 1.91Trump 4.50Rubio 7.00Sanders 8.50Double to treble figures all the rest of them.


These numbers are a little bit off. Secretary Clinton is more odds-on than just 1.9. Trump has only 1/3 of Republicans voting for him, but it takes a majority to win the nomination (US is NOT like the UK where plurality wins).So Republican nominee will not be Trump, and Democratic nominee will not be Sanders (he'll lose today by a yuge [sic] margin).


And halfway into the article we're invited to read Donald Trump's Most Controversial Quotes.


It's as easy as ABC, Anyone But Clinton.


Not sure we ever 'feared socialism' - that's is just right wing BS


I know. What's to 'fear' about people caring for the well being of others? As opposed to capitalists, who just care about 'capital' (themselves and those others who have it). 


And, I was going to say the same thing. Very annoying habit - mirrored in the expression referring to Jeremy Corbyn as 'extreme left winger'.


For now Hillary still stands to win the nomination because of more support among the party establishment, through the mechanism of so-called superdelegates, mostly previous elected democratic officials. In the Ohio caucus Hillary lost the vote by 40:60 but still in the end carried away the same number of delegates as Bernie.
