One thing that amazes me about the pope is that says that a Presbyterian ain't a Christian but all those Pedophile priests and bishops from the Vatican and all over the place are consider good Christians


The new Hitler & the Pope, both a lot of hot air.

Paedophile protecting dress wearing virgins with imaginary friends should be disregarded on all fronts.


It's not IS that the Pope needs to worry about, it's the prospect of befalling the same fate as Archbishop Oscar Romero, murdered by a CIA backed death squad. History tells us that it doesn't pay to be a liberal, compassionate & honest religious leader within earshot of Right Wing, belligerent & corrupt US politicians. Btw, you know Americans have infected the Independent comments when blatantly racist 'wet back' doggerel is given a pass. 


Guess that the Pope has been convinced by the Mexican government to let the wet backs come across the Rio Grande..
