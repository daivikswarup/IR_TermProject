Great. Start emptying the prisons. 


OK, 'French Canadian born' so, what is the actual ethnicity and parents' country of origin? Could it be Iranian, by any chance?Was yours an arranged marriage?Since Canada seems to be falling over itself to take Syrian 'refugees', I wonder why the computer keeps screaming, "No!" in your case.


His country of origin and his parents is "Canada" and they are all French speakers not Iranian!And No! It was not an "arranged marriage".He came to Iran as a tourist and this is how we met each other.Do you think he stayed in Iran for 3 years just for an arrangement?!Ridiculous!And no chance of Iranian being "refugees".To inform you "Iran is not at war"I shared our story as an example of many others!


Interesting reply. So, he's a French Canadian national; that's a good start. Interesting, then, that he managed to stay in Iran for 3 years - that was some tourist visa he got there. Was that also at the time when the severest international sanctions were in place against Iran?Oh, and when did he convert to Islam?
