It baffles me completely that anyone can find Donald trump a legitimate candidate . Seriously its messed up, Yes he speaks logic and I find him hilarious but he is also so lost when it comes to the United States being part of the "world" . If he wins It's going to be a S#@T storm. Peace


Didn't he have four bankruptcies? That's losing his creditors' money four times over. And I believe the money he started with was from his dad. 


I think you are correct, but good on him for getting back up and in the end making good. What are you supposed to do if you go bankrupt, crawl into a corner and cry... Go Donald Go


Hillary is just plain frightening, not because she is a woman, but because her entire career is one long set of lies and pretending to be something she isn't.Trump has some pretty unpleasant aspects, but there is a kind of rude, very rude, honesty about him.It truly is sad the world's most powerful country has no more to offer in the way of leadership.


Were they that accurate?


No Indy has its agenda and it aint Trump


In Rubio, did the Republicans find the most effete Latino?
