" The truth is..." Lady Hillary takes lying "to the next level".


Trump is 3 to 1 and Clinton 4 to 5 but on the day?


The Nevada results are almost darkly comic.Here, in a state a good part of a continent away from New England, a man whose name has little national recognition, just about tied a woman with the name recognition of a McDonalds hamburger.That is not an achievement for Hillary, but one for Sanders.Add in the fact that some very questionable stuff - long lines of waiting, a shortage of paper ballots when those who waited got to the front - happened, it is at least likely Sanders actually won.


Hillary is history - like her record of incompetence and scandals.


Trump is there to scare enough Republicans into voting Clinton. These things are pre-arranged and Hillary is the Goldman Sachs choice.


The Media are all hoping for a Clinton win, apparently - sure, they're owned - and what else would we have expected.It would seal the New World Order as Clinton (like Cruz) is basically a 98% establishment bot, while Sanders is only 85% and Trump about 70% maybe... the question when exactly Full Spectrum Domination and Control (FSDC) is integrated however really depends on the Chinese, and if they dare to back up Russia to keep a multipolar world alive.


Yet you also carry an article that says Sanders is 'beating Hilliary Clinton in a US-wide poll.' Let's hope so.
