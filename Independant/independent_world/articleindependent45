<p style="">Spike Lee is the latest black celebrity to endorse Bernie Sanders for US president.</p>
<p style="">In a campaign radio advertisement released on Tuesday, Lee explains why he's feeling the Bern. </p>
<p>“This is your dude, Spike Lee. And you know that I know that you know that the system is rigged! For too long we've given our votes to corporate puppets. Sold the okie doke. Ninety-nine per cent of Americans were hurt by the Great Recession of 2008, and many are still recovering,” Lee says in the ad.</p>
<p>“That's why I am officially endorsing my brother, Bernie Sanders.”</p>

<p>Lee also references Mr Sanders' record of fighting for civil rights throughout the years.</p>
<p>“How can we be sure?” Lee asks. “Bernie was at the March on Washington with Dr King. He was arrested in Chicago for protesting segregation in public schools. He fought for wealth and education equality throughout his whole career.”</p>
<p>Sanders' camp likely hopes the endorsement increases support from black voters ahead of South Carolina's primary on Saturday.</p>
<p>His Democratic rival Hillary Clinton has 65 per cent of support from black voters, compared to 28 per cent for Mr Sanders, <span style="line-height: 20.8px;">according to a new <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/16/politics/south-carolina-poll-cnn-orc/index.html" target="_blank"><em>CNN/ORC</em> South Carolina poll</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">The ad ends with a swift jab at Ms Clinton: </span>“Paid for by Bernie 2016, not the billionaires.”</p>
