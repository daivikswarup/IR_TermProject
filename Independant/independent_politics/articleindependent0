<p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was left visibly angry after David Cameron invoked the memory of NHS founder Nye Bevan at Prime Minister’s Questions.</p>
<p>Asked about what the Government was doing to bring down NHS deficits, Mr Cameron said that under the Tories there were “1.9 million more people going to A&amp;E, 1.6 million more operations, 10,700 more doctors, 11,800 more nurses”.</p>
<p>“And I have to say, I think if Nye Bevan was here today he would want a seven-day NHS, because he knew the NHS was for patients up and down our country,” Mr Cameron said.</p>
<p>Raising his voice, Mr Corbyn responded: “Nye Bevan would be turning in his grave if he could see the Prime Minister’s attitude to the NHS.</p>
<p>“He was a man with vision, who wanted a health service for the good of all,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Corbyn went on with a question from a doctor named Ashraf, who asked about stretching all NHS staff to working across seven days a week, and asked: “Will the Prime Minister reveal how he is going to pay for a seven-day NHS, rather than picking a fight with the junior doctors who want to deliver it?”</p>
<p>During other exchanges at PMQs Mr Corbyn raised the issue of the junior doctors’ strike, accusing the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt of basing his arguments on incorrect figures.</p>
<p>A BBC investigation had found that the author of a study cited by Mr Hunt had accused the Health Secretary of using the figures in an “inaccurate” manner before they had been verified.</p>

<p>And in a bizarre series of jibes, the two leaders also traded blows over each other’s mothers.</p>
<p>Mr Corbyn make a joke referencing the fact Mr Cameron’s mother had signed a petition against cuts in her local area – despite the fact her son was implementing them.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister however hit back – claiming that his mother would tell the Labour leader to put on “a proper suit”, to do up his tie, and to “sing the national anthem”.</p>
<p>The put-down was a reference to an episode earlier in Mr Corbyn’s leadership in which he appeared not to sing the national anthem at a remembrance service.</p>
