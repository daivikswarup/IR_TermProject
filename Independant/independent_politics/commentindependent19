The Doctors are obviously not going to accept this and there is a limit to how much disruption the NHS can take. When the Govts own advisors tell them to apologies for destroying morale and any chance of a Quality service ; what next ?


It's about money. It's ALWAYS about money, no matter what sugary emoto-crap about patient safety gets painted on it.


Filthy cheating khunt........I really do hope the doctors and the BMA rip you to tiny pieces!


Why don't they just not sign the contract and open up their own private practice and set your own terms?Oh wait I forgot...MarxismWell I guess you better just beg your sugar daddy the government for better terms


What tripe.


Blimey you clearly understand neither Marxism not this dispute. Was that supposed to be an intelligent contribution go this space?


Hey, the truth has no place in these comments....watch your mouth


You keep drawing lines in the Grecian dust, Socrates. Sadly for you 98% of the public simply rub them out and continue to support the junior doctors.
