<p style="">Iain Duncan Smith’s claim that Britain is more vulnerable to terrorist attack within the European Union does not make sense, a Conservative grandee has said.</p>
<p style="">Ken Clarke, the Tories’ arch-pro-European, said Mr Duncan Smith’s view that the EU made Britain less safe was a “fringe argument” that few would support.</p>
<p>Mr Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader, had claimed that “the lack of any control of our borders” meant the UK was easier terrorist target.</p>
<p>But Mr Clarke argued that the security services and police benefited from crime information sharing within the EU.</p>
<p>“I don’t think Iain [Duncan Smith] was able to explain why on earth he said, presumably off-the-cuff, why we would be in more danger,” Mr Clarke told the BBC’s Newsnight programme.</p>
<p>“I just don’t understand that. The idea that we’re going to introduce a huge range of border checks and immigration checks on anybody flying here from Germany and – that makes us safer than the present arrangement which are very much supported by the people who have the job of protecting us day by day – is, I think, a slightly fringe argument. </p>
<p>“I don’t think you’ll find many eurosceptics pursuing that.”</p>
<p>Mr Clarke, a former Justice Secretary under the 2010 Coalition, went to accuse Mr Duncan Smith of having made the Tories “unelectable” during the last rebellion on Europe in the 1990s.</p>
<p>“Iain was, unofficially, the chief whip of the Maastricht rebels – and the tensions inside the party that were caused by the Maastricht rebellion damaged the electability of the Major government. It made us unelectable in 1997,” he told the same programme.</p>
<p>As a member of the EU, UK citizens benefit from freedom of movement across the continent. Considered one of the so-called four pillars of the European Union, this freedom allows all EU citizens to live, work and travel in other member states.</p>
<p>A report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, released in October 2015, suggested 3.1 million British jobs were linked to the UK’s exports to the EU.</p>
<p>Freedom to travel is one of the most exercised benefits of EU membership, with Britons having made 31 million visits to the EU in 2014 alone. But a lot of the benefits of being an EU citizen are either taken for granted or go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Consumer protection is a key benefit of the EU’s single market, and ensures members of the British public receive equal consumer rights when shopping anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p>Another example of a lesser-known advantage of EU membership is the benefit of cross-country coordination and cooperation in the fight against crime.</p>
<p>According to 71% of all members of the Confederation of British Influence (CBI), and 67 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the EU has had an overall positive impact on their business.</p>
<p>Robin Niblett, Director of think-tank Chatham House, stated in a report published last year: “For a mid-sized country like the UK, which will never again be economically dominant either globally or regionally, and whose diplomatic and military resources are declining in relative terms, being a major player in a strong regional institution can offer a critical lever for international influence.</p>
<p>The grandee however said the party had since then operated well and the he hoped the Europe Union referendum debate could be conducted amicably.</p>
<p>Mr Duncan Smith defended his claims about terrorist attacks on the same programme. He said the UK would be better able to stop people who appeared “suspicious” outside the EU.</p>
<p>“If we [were to] feel that someone is not what we consider to be a reasonable individual we can refuse entry. We can’t do that now,” he said.</p>
<p>This weekend Mr Cameron announced that Britain would hold its in-out referendum on membership of the European Union on 23 June of this year.</p>
<p>The vote follows a renegotiation of the terms of membership of the EU by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The PM has granted his Cabinet colleagues permission to campaign on opposite sides of the referendum – an unusual approach to government collective responsibility.</p>
