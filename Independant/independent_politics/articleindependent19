<p style="">Junior doctors have a launched a legal challenge to Jeremy Hunt’s decision to impose a new contract, and announced that three fresh strikes will hit the NHS in the spring.</p>
<p style="">Preparing the ground for a new phase in the bitter conflict between the British Medical Association and the Government, the medical union claimed that ministers had failed to assess whether the contract might discriminate against particular groups of junior doctors.</p>
<p>It also announced three 48-hour strikes affecting non-emergency services, to take place in March and April.</p>
<p>The decision came as a former Government advisor on patient safety called on ministers to apologise to junior doctors over their handling of the contract dispute, and to freeze its imposition for up to three years.</p>
<p>Don Berwick, a US expert who helped shape Barack Obama’s health policy and conducted a review of NHS patient safety under the Coalition, said the Government had made a “mistake” and needed to “find a way out”.</p>
<p>“You cannot achieve excellence in combat with your future workforce, it makes no sense at all,” he said at an event at the King’s Fund think-tank on 23 February.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hunt announced the imposition of the new junior doctor contract, which will cut weekend pay rates in exchange for an increase in basic pay, earlier this month, after being advised by his chief negotiator that talks with the BMA had reached a dead end.</p>
<p>The imposed contract, while providing better terms for junior doctors on pay and working hours than the Government’s previous offers, is still opposed by the BMA, who say that cuts to out-of-hours pay would heavily impact specialties that demand the most night and weekend shifts, such as A&amp;E, maternity and paediatrics.</p>
<p>Danny Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS Employers organisation, which has negotiated the new contract on behalf of the Government, said the disruption a new wave of strikes would cause was “unnecessary” and urged junior doctors to “look at the contract in detail”. </p>
<p>“I strongly believe that the final contract is safe, fair and reasonable,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Dr Johann Malawana, chair of the BMA’s junior doctor committee, said that junior doctors had “no confidence” in the new contract.</p>
<p>“In recent weeks I have heard from thousands of junior doctors across the country, and the resounding message is that they cannot and will not accept what the Government is trying to do,” he said.</p>
<p>“Imposing this contract will seriously undermine the ability of the NHS to recruit and retain junior doctors in areas of medicine with the most unsocial hours, where there are already staffing shortages.”</p>
<p>The contract imposed by the Government is intended to be cost-neutral, but the BMA says that if ministers want to deliver on a manifesto pledge of improving weekend services in hospitals, then more doctors, nurses, and support staff would be needed.</p>
<p>The BMA’s judicial review application will centre on whether the Government carried out an Equality Impact Assessment of the new contract before imposing it, and whether this met a legal requirement to pay “due regard” to eliminate discrimination.</p>
<p>It is thought that the BMA will argue that the new contract may discriminate against women, who are more likely to be part-time doctors, who the union says are more likely to lose out under the new contract. </p>
<p>A Department of Health spokesperson said the new wave of strike action was “completely unnecessary” and would lead to tens of thousands of cancelled operations.</p>
<p>“The new contract will mean an average 13.5 per cent basic pay rise, and will bring down the maximum number of hours doctors can work. We urge junior doctors to look at the detail of the contract and the clear benefits it brings,” the spokesperson said. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The BMA's position:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"The principal ground of challenge is the apparent failure(s) by the Secretary of State to have “due regard” to the Public Sector Equality Duty prior to making and announcing the Decision. The BMA has genuine concerns about the potential equalities issues which the new junior doctor contract poses.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"The deadline for the response to the Letter is 1 March 2016."</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My understanding of the law, which should not be taken as definitive, is:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Public service providers use Equality Impact Assessments (EIA) to comply with the Equality Act. They are not a requirement but are the best way to show that the provider has complied with the 'public service equality duty' required by law.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For example, protected characteristics under the public sector equality duty include pregnancy and maternity, and sex. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This would apply to women doctors who take maternity leave or train less than full-time to raise a family. 51% of doctors on the GMC registers are women.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It is a requirement under the law for a public service provider, such as the NHS, to show it has made “due regard” in all its decisions to eliminate unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The law requires the advancement of equal opportunities and the encouragement of good relations between both those who share a protected characteristic and those who don't. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"Due regard" simply means that a public authority has considered how the public sector equality duty will affect people protected by the Equality Act. If it hasn't properly considered it when making a decision, then that decision can be challenged in the courts.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For people with protected characteristics, public authorities must remove or reduce their disadvantages, meet their needs and encourage them to participate in public life.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In 2012 Cameron proposed that Equality Impact Assessments should not be used, claiming he wanted to reduce bureaucracy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>However in order for the NHS to demonstrate that it has had “due regard” to equality considerations it must show when the considerations were made, what those considerations were and how it reached its conclusions. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Regardless of what Cameron has said the best and simplest way for the NHS to prove compliance with its legal duty is to carry out an EIA.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission has given examples of court cases showing the link between 'due regard' and assessing the impact on equality:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"Assessing the impact on equality of proposed changes to policies, procedures and practices is one of the key ways in which public authorities can demonstrate that they have had 'due regard'."<br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>In an important clarification, in the case of Brown v DWP the court set out certain principles:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"• Those responsible for the duty to have due regard must consciously bring it to mind when considering the duty. If they don’t or if their appreciation of the duty is incomplete or mistaken, the courts will deem that due regard has not been applied. </p>
<p>• The due regard duty must be fulfilled before and at the time that a particular policy is being considered. Compliance with the duty should not be treated as a rearguard action after a decision to implement the policy in question. </p>
<p>• It must be exercised with rigour and with an open mind. Due regard involves more than a tick box exercise. The “substance and reasoning” of the decision must be examined. However, a failure to make explicit reference to the relevant positive equality duty will not, of itself, be fatal to a decision. </p>
<p>• It is good practice for public authorities to keep an adequate record showing that they had actually considered their equality duties and pondered relevant questions. </p>
<p>• The due regard duty cannot be delegated to a third party by the public authority charged with it.</p>
<p>• The duty is ongoing.</p>
<p>• When applying the “due regard” test, the public authority must take into account whatever countervailing factors are relevant in the circumstances."</p>

<p>Let me just get this straight. Doctors are going to work more hours to give 7 day coverage. <span> </span>Everyone is going to be paid more. Yet the overall package is cost neutral. It’s a miracle. Hunt is not Jesus Christ by any chance is he? </p>
