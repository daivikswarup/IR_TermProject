There never seems to be much enthusiasm for a reduction in Councillors jollies or pay and the traffic annoyance measures always seem to be free of cuts.


Write to your local council and ask them how much they have stashed away in their 'reserve' fund...some councils have enough money there to pay for council services for at least three years.
