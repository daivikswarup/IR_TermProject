If Scotland votes to leave the UK. I hope there is a proviso in that agreement that states if they go the money stops!!


when the UK leave the EU i wonder if the Scots will still want the money when they decide to leave the UK. If they want it they will have to leave the EYU too


There needs to be a box for us to lose the Sweaties as well as the EUSSR.
