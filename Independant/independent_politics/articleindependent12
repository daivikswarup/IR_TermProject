<p style="">British people prefer socialism to capitalism, a new survey has found. </p>
<p style=""><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/23/british-people-view-socialism-more-favourably-capi/" target="_blank">A study by YouGov</a> has found that British people are more likely to have an unfavourable view of capitalism than of socialism as an ideological concept. </p>
<p>Despite polling earlier this month showing <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scottish-parliament-election-poll-holyrood-tories-beating-labour-a6855721.html">Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party were ten points behind the Conservatives</a> the survey of nearly 4,000 British adults found a small majority of people have a positive view of socialism. </p>
<p>36 per cent of people said they view socialism favourably as opposed to 32 per cent who view it unfavourably. This gives <span style="line-height: 16.64px;">socialism</span> a favourability rating of +4, while capitalism achieved a favourability rating of  -3 (39 per cent unfavourably against 33 per cent favourably). </p>
<p>The survey found the only age group to view socialism unfavourably are the over 60s with 46 per cent having a negative view of it, compared to 30 per cent in favour. </p>
<p>The support for the ideology in the UK follows a similar trend in the US where socialism is growing in popularity after years of being treated with suspicion because of its connection to the Soviet Union and the Cold War.</p>
