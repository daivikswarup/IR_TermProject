<p style="">Here are the latest updates:</p>
<p style="">Ahead of Wednesday's PMQs, Michael Gove has claimed that David Cameron's deal changing Britain's relationship with the European Union is not legally binding and could be overturned by a prominent European court.</p>
<p>The Justice Secretary rejected the Prime Minister's claim that the package was irreversible, warning that the European Court of Justice is not bound by the settlement without treaty change.</p>
<p>Downing Street moved quickly to dismiss Mr Gove's claim with a statement insisting the agreement "has legal force" and must be taken into account by the court.</p>
<p>As Mr Gove made his first major intervention in the referendum campaign since backing Brexit, his wife told of the "agonising" struggle he faced as he put his Euroscepticism ahead of a close friendship with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The Cabinet minister insisted the EU has held Britain back and said the nation would recover its "mojo" outside the 28-member bloc.</p>
<p>He insisted the Prime Minister, who has claimed the deal is "already legally binding and irreversible", has not misled voters.</p>

<p>"Freemantle et al state “Our analysis of 2013-14 data suggests that around 11000 more people die each year within 30 days of admission to hospital on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday compared with other days of the week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)” which now seems perfectly obvious. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"They go on to say “It is not possible to ascertain the extent to which these excess deaths may be preventable; to assume that they are avoidable would be rash and misleading.” </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"But the term ‘excess deaths‘ is rash, misleading, and unjustifiable.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"Inspection of the data table below (see link) shows that the cohort of patients admitted on Saturday, or on Sunday, suffer FEWER deaths than patients admitted on Wednesday, but at a higher rate.. Roughly 11000 deaths occur in any day’s cohort. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>"Thus, in the FOUR days Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday there are 11000 more deaths than in the THREE days Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"These are NOT “EXCESS” deaths, but simply the consequence of counting an ‘EXTRA’ day … They are no more or less avoidable on Saturday, than they are on Wednesday."</p>

<p>The BMJ looked again at the study and published some interesting findings, which doctors have consistently been trying to make clear to the bone-headed Hunt ad nauseam:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span>"It is noted that not only were 50 per cent of Saturday admissions and 65 per cent of Sunday admissions found to be emergency cases, but also the “cohort admitted at weekends included a greater prevalence of patients with higher predicted mortality risk than those admitted during the week...</span><br/></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>The paper also "contends that there could be “potentially serious consequences across other services” if overall staffing levels are not increased.</span><br/></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>"Helen Crump from the Nuffield Trust has examined the evidence around the Secretary of State’s proposals...</span><br/></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>She concluded...that “ramping up weekend elective activity makes no sense if the funding is not available to increase total activity.”</span><span><br/></span></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>When Cameron claimed in the House of Commons today that "the true figure for excess deaths at the weekend is 11,000," he was wrong. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It is clear that the period during which the deaths occur is not for a 'weekend' as Cameron claimed, but from Friday to Monday. He mislead the House.<br/></p>
