<p style="">At some point over the next four months, David Cameron is likely to have to whip off his jacket, roll up his sleeves and exalt that the EU Referendum really pumps him up. </p>
<p style="">To the great relief of the hundreds of staff at o2 HQ in Slough early on 23 February, that point has not yet been reached. The jacket came off - it always does - but the cufflinks remained in place, serving their function as Prime Ministerial pump-up tachograph, limiting levels to moderate.</p>
<p>The people of o2, to their credit, nodded along quietly as the Prime Minister outlined what a success his renegotiation had been, only openly laughing when he claimed, “It’s great to be here in Slough.” Bullshit, like mobile data, comes with limits you shouldn’t try and exceed.</p>
<p>He even brought Karren Brady with him, the West Ham chairman whose employment by leading Tory party donors, elevation to the peerage and bargain basement tenancy of the taxpayer funded Olympic Stadium are all entirely unrelated. It might have felt a long way for her to travel to give a three sentence long introduction bigging up the “UK’s special status” as negotiated by Dave, but she made herself useful by holding the PM’s jacket - a courtesy as yet unextended to any Apprentice candidate.</p>
<p>David Cameron knows he only really has one message to sell. Why take the risk? “If you’re not certain, surely the best thing to do is to back the side that has the security and the safety of what we know,” he told them. It almost helps that as of now, the counterpoint is Boris Johnson. “Stick with what you know. Bojo might be the megalols option but there’ll be wiff waff induced nuclear holocaust by Christmas.”</p>
<p>There were words of conciliation for Boris. “ A great friend”, with “a bright future in British politics.” But for the meantime, a convenient foil for what’s become known as Project Fear.</p>
<p>That project was on full view again as the o2 staff sat diligently through the PM’s most well worn pro-Eu factoid. That it was only thanks to the European arrest warrant that one of the failed 21/7 bombers was able to be extradited, “and who’s now serving a 40 year prison sentence, here in the UK.” That’s reassuring, but a lingering doubt remains as to the actual security risk posed by a jihadist unable to blow himself up and who then flees to a country with a long established extradition arrangement with the UK. You could almost feel sorry for him. 40 years is a long time to sit and wonder why you didn’t just run to Julian Assange’s bedroom in the Ecuadorian embassy. Sure, it’s not much, not when you thought you were getting eternal life and 92 virgins, but at least there’s a balcony.</p>
<p>Being a Spanish owned telecommunications behemoth based in the UK and heavily linked with the recent reduction in data roaming charges - an EU-engineered victory for trans-European sexting that ranks right up there with its primary achievement of staving off World War Three - it’s not surprising Mr Cameron chose o2 as the latest stop on his “Why Risk It?” tour. Not that long ago, he was boring some German train parts manufacturers in Chippenham with the same material.</p>
<p>Who might be next? Belgian chocolateers based in Blackburn? Valerie from the Patisserie? Technically, the UK’s biggest export to Europe is tourism. The staff at Alton Towers could certainly do with a few choice words on risk aversion. What about Madame Tussauds? He could even get Margaret Thatcher to introduce him. He might even have to roll up his sleeves. We shall have to wait and see.</p>
