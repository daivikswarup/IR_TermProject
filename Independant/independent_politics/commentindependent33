As usual if the stats. start producing bad pr change them or abolish them. Perhaps some of these Tories should  do without money  for a while, after all its only those in poverty that don't need money. 


it would be fine if work actually WAS the best route out of poverty, but it is not true. There are not enough jobs; and certainly not enough that pay a living wage because housing costs far outstrip the average pay packet.That the Tories state with smug confidence that lack of money is not poverty is just about what I expect from this shower of social engineers. Upwards to near half a million children living in poverty by 2020? What kind of a future will these children have, what level of health and contributions to society and the country will they be able to make, growing up deprived, malnourished and without access to skills and tools.A recipe for disaster.
