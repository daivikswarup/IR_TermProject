<p style="">Conservative MPs lined up in the Commons to put themselves in the opposite camp from the leader in the four-month battle over Britain’s membership of the European Union.</p>
<p style="">As the Prime Minister insisted his deal in Brussels would mark a new relationship with the EU, a majority of Tory speakers argued that his agreement did little to return powers to the UK and signalled their determination to campaign for Brexit.</p>
<p>It was left to senior Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP figures to argue that it was in Britain’s interests to remain in the 28-nation bloc – although they could not resist accusing Mr Cameron of putting the country’s future at risk because of Tory divisions on Europe.</p>
<p>The Eurosceptic assault on the Prime Minister was led by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who challenged him to “explain to the House and to the country in exactly what way this deal returns sovereignty over any field of law-making to these Houses of Parliament”.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron responded: “This deal brings back some welfare powers, it brings back some immigration powers, it brings back some bail-out powers, but more than that, because it carves us forever out of ever-closer union, it means that the ratchet of the European court taking power away from this country cannot happen in future.” The veteran Tory, Sir Bill Cash, told him that laws affecting the UK were made by other countries, introduced by the European Commission and enforced by the European Court of Justice. “The only way to get out of that and return our democracy is to leave the European Union,” he said.</p>
<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg, the North East Somerset MP, gently mocked the Prime Minister for spending 40 hours in Brussels, getting through four clean shirts and a packet of Haribo sweets, implementing the promises on Europe set out in the Labour manifesto.</p>
<p>He said: “Is the government’s policy basically [to] always keep a hold of nurse, for fear of finding something worse?”</p>
<p>David Davis, the former Europe Minister, challenged the Prime Minister over how much plans for curbs on EU nationals receiving in-work benefits would reduce immigration.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron did not answer directly, but said the prospect of being entitled to up to £10,000 in benefits was a “big incentive to come to Britain”.</p>
<p>The former Cabinet minister, Peter Lilley, said that over the past two decades, Britain has voted against 72 measures in the European Council and been defeated 72 times. He said: “The pace of defeat is accelerating. If we make the mistake and take the risk of remaining in the EU, how many defeats do you expect in the next two decades?”</p>
<p>Kenneth Clarke, the former Chancellor, provided a rare Tory voice of support, saying: “Future generations will benefit from some of those concessions, particularly those on enlarging the single market, guaranteeing our access to parts of it, deregulating and engaging in major trade deals with outside.”</p>
<p>Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister, said: “This referendum is about the future of our country, it’s not about the future of a divided Conservative party.”</p>
<p>He said: “If Britain in the future wants to stand tall in New Delhi, in Beijing, in Washington, in other global capitals, Britain must continue to stand tall in our own European neighbourhood.”</p>
<p>Mr Cameron responded that the only person who might want the UK to leave the EU is Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, said that on all the major issues – such as trade, climate change, terrorism and security – Britain had more influence inside the bloc than outside it.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said: “The big picture is this – when it comes to getting things done in the world that can help keep people safe in our country, a bigger, better deal on climate change, do we get more because we are in the EU? Yes.”</p>
<p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said his party overwhelmingly supported EU membership because it provided jobs and protection for workers, investment and action on the environment. He dismissed the Prime Minister’s deal as “largely irrelevant” and said it would have no impact on the case to remain in the EU.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a member of the EU, UK citizens benefit from freedom of movement across the continent. Considered one of the so-called four pillars of the European Union, this freedom allows all EU citizens to live, work and travel in other member states.</p>
<p>A report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, released in October 2015, suggested 3.1 million British jobs were linked to the UK’s exports to the EU.</p>
<p>Freedom to travel is one of the most exercised benefits of EU membership, with Britons having made 31 million visits to the EU in 2014 alone. But a lot of the benefits of being an EU citizen are either taken for granted or go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Consumer protection is a key benefit of the EU’s single market, and ensures members of the British public receive equal consumer rights when shopping anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p>Another example of a lesser-known advantage of EU membership is the benefit of cross-country coordination and cooperation in the fight against crime.</p>
<p>According to 71% of all members of the Confederation of British Influence (CBI), and 67 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the EU has had an overall positive impact on their business.</p>
<p>Robin Niblett, Director of think-tank Chatham House, stated in a report published last year: “For a mid-sized country like the UK, which will never again be economically dominant either globally or regionally, and whose diplomatic and military resources are declining in relative terms, being a major player in a strong regional institution can offer a critical lever for international influence.</p>
<p>Angus Robertson, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, said he was certain that Scots would demand a fresh independence referendum if the UK was forced out of the EU against the will of Scotland.</p>
<p>He also warned against using so-called “project fear” tactics, which the SNP claims were used against it in the 2014 independence referendum.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron insisted he would make a positive case for remaining in the EU and insisted the vote was one for the whole of the UK.</p>

<p><span lang="EN">Boris looks after Boris, but how could he back OUT at the expense of London’s financial institutions? Unless he thinks revenge for the 200% bank bonus cap is good for Boris! Does this man understand that the bank bonus culture was a significant contributing factor in the financial crises which has Britain deep in debt? Sorry… maybe I didn’t makethat clear… does he understand that the TAX PAYER IS FITTING THE BILL FOR THE BANKS GAMBLING AND BONUSES!? </span><span lang="EN"><br/> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span lang="EN">MAYBE BORIS DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT WE DECIDE - NOT HIS CRONIES - WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM!</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><br/>Nonetheless Boris justifies his view around sovereignty, staying well clear of UKIP gassing on about immigration. Just so we are clear, here is a good article by the BBC on UK sovereignty (and you will note, that the UK is actually a member of the largest democratic single market on the planet). <br/> <br/>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendu... <br/> <br/>Now to put two popular UKIP lies to bed:</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span lang="EN">1. OUT: OUT is about getting control of our borders. </span><span lang="EN"><br/> <br/>The reality is that we are voting for OUT of the EU, not the Single Market. Just to clarify, the Single Market is the biggest single market on the planet. Hence we will still be bound to free movement of people, but we lose our voice in the EU. We also lose the emergency brake that Cameron has won. We also lose France’s interest in protecting our borders at Calais.  <br/> <br/>Still Farage claims“We can control the borders”. The pitiful Farage does not tell you that 50% of all immigrants are EU, while the other 50% WE CAN CONTROL, AND CLEARLY WE DO NOT! Both Norway and Switzerland are NOT in the EU, yet they both are bound by the laws of the Single Market, both have HIGHER levels of EU migration as apercentage of the population than the UK. <br/> <br/>Just to clarify, leaving the Single Market is not even being considered. We depend on it for a vast amount of trade, and leaving would severely jeopardise the UK economy.Every respected Economist says the UK risks very significant economic damage leaving the Single Market. <br/> <br/>Nonetheless, just the uncertainty around the EU and the Single Market has already caused the pound to slide against the dollar. Indeed many in the UK understand that leaving the EU is a risk to the economy and jobs, equally foreign investors invest a great deal in the UK, and they too will consider the risks of keeping their money in the UK. The Bank of England has warned that leaving the EU will likely cause uncertainty that could undermine our capacity to pay back on our debt. Remember that the UK has some of the highest debt in Europe, but with a AAA rating it keeps our repayments low, but losing that would force significantly greater austerity.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span lang="EN">2 OUT: The EU Single Market depends on the UK more than the UK depends on the EU Single Market. </span><span lang="EN"><br/> <br/>This is a bare faced lie! Currently we may import more than we export, however that is changing as EU countries recover. Nonetheless it is also factually wrong. We will still continue to import cars from Germany and Japan outside the EU, however it will be EASIER for EU countries to trade with EU countries over the UK, and we stand to lose those exports year on year.<br/> <br/>The EU Single Market is comparable in size to the markets of India, China and the US – and just toqualify, the UK is a very tiny market in comparison. All EU countries agree to the terms of free trade, in that they do not apply protectionism to their goods or labour market. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span lang="EN"><br/></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN">Farage seems to think the UK can apply protectionism to the UK labour market and still have access to an unprotected goods market. Let me clarify that if you cannot grasp the depth of Farage’s lie. A country like Germany produces excellent goods, and other EU countries expose their goods market to this significant competition, in return that Germany exposes its labour market. The net result is free trade, or free movement of goods and people.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>one good thing may come out of all this referendum debating.    Cameron &amp; Osbourne may engage in proper politics rather than PR . Mind you I am sure there must be a  EU Photo opportunity where Gideon  could get his hard hat &amp;  Hi vis jacket out again !!      Maybe in the commons when the mud slinging starts !</p>
