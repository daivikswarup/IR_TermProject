The Government needs the Daily Mail to get them out of this situation- please D'arcy help!


Is it possible that there may be a collapse of the Government? It is looking rather fragile.


I was there.... Nodding politely and whispering to each other..What a knob this guy is....


Project fear is going to fail. People are tired of being bullied and lied to. The people at O2 were polite does not mean they fell for that rubbish


Which side's project Fear?They both have one.


Is it possible that citizens of this country, having closely followed David Cameron's re-negotiation in Brussels, can give him any credibility?Yesterday Michael Fallon, defending his leader's position, said 'Isn't it better to still be there-however frustrating it is-at the table, shaping those regulations, leading Europe in the direction you want, protecting your national interests?' WHHAAAATT?They seem to think that we are all complete morons. If Cameron's message is 'why take the risk?' our answer is 'Because we would like to regain democratic control of our country and our economy'. If the 'ratchet' won't turn back we will unbolt it.'Bull$hit comes with limits you shouldn't try and exceed.'It certainly does.


Just ask yourself, If Corbyn had been PM and returned with that package of illusory reforms, would the Tory party now be supporting him? Like heck.


Just the right place for David Brent copy cat Cameron.
