more rubbish being spouted


all he got was some piece of paper with no legal significance making vague promises not to make it any worse for us. Its meaningless. we have no say, we vote against things in the EU parliament and the structure is such that they votes never count, no wonder lots of the Euro MPs never bother to turn top, its just a talking sop and rubber stamp for the unelected commission. Time to get out of this unelected dictatorship. Cameron brought his own version of "peace in our time" Its worthless.


I watched the entire debate, and no way that all or even most Tory MP's opposed the PM. There were plenty of them who supported Cameron and explicitly said that they supported staying in the UK. Ken Clarke was by far not the only one.


I'll be voting to stay in the EU over staying in the UK. Voted against independence last time, mostly due to the fear mongering of us losing EU membership. We'll just get closer ties to Ireland and Scandinavia if you leave the UK. Outside chance Wales could be next.


I would hazard a guess that Cameron spent a good deal of his time in Brussels lobbying for his own future.


They keep banging on about trade deals. There is only us and Germany with any money, so who will be buying the french wine, the polluting lying volkswagens, the tinny citroens, fiats, spanish fruit and vegetables ect. Trade blocked my ass. They would shoot themselves in the foot.


And "Arschloch" in German.
