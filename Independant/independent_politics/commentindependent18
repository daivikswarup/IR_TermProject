Cameron failed so any other plan to fix the Eu can only be better


Boris is a dangerous odious buffoon and will stop at nothing to achieve his sick ambitions even at the cost to general public. "Politicians" like him we can find dozen a penny in the history. Hope that British public will see through him even, if the good part of the population are hopeless misguided "patriots" and ignorants.


you seem to hate everyone - hopefully including yourself, where there would be a good foundation for that


Donald Trumpish?!


i think you have been on the weed - observations fine, conclusion beyond stupid


Dave versus Boris? Shame they cannot both lose.As for Boris working himself up into a frenzy with his made up Euro- phobic stories, where he "compromised his intellectual integrity" public school speak for telling lies. Still such was his conviction that he still has the scar where he snapped a biro, not exactly Churchillian is it?


All that matters is that Boris is totally correct, and Dave, pandering to his flash boy friends in the City, is wrong.LEAVE for LIBERTY


Boris is just as in thrall to the City as any Tory. Why do you think the City will lose its power if Britain leaves the EU? How will we be any more "free" after Brexit than now? Your ire is pointing in the wrong direction - all our problems are home grown.
