Who needs studies and statistics, and nerds arguing about how many doctors can dance on the head of a pin without patients dying? You only have to look at empty hospital staff car parks, or go visit a sick relative, at the weekend to know what's going on and that it is bad news and that it needs to change.


Always remember that in 2009 Hunt wrote that the NHS should be dismantled.


Health Minister?


Or to ask the public to get less drunk at weekends. 


And reducing them elsewhere..........?


So let me see, if there is no impact on the death rate when there are fewer doctors around at weekends then why not reduce the number of doctors working during the rest of the week. It will save money & give our doctors more free time to spend doing other things. I have been in hospital recently & did notice how things closed down over the weekend. This state of affairs is barmy. Could we please move on from increasingly sterile argument as it is becoming boring? It is obvious we need to run our health service 7 days a week since from long years of experience it is becoming increasingly obvious that sickness & injuries don't always occur during business hours. The world is not perfect.


The main point is that people admitted at the weekends are more likely to be emergency cases and rather more likely to die from their condition.
