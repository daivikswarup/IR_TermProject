so now the facts are clear that migrants do take a disproportionate share of benefits and many of them have not paid a cent for it and old people who have paid all their lives are cold in winter and we cant do anything about it. The so called deal changes nothing in that. 6% of the workforce taking 10% of the benefits and we pay 20000 migrants for 32000 children living in other countries!! Not sure how the government can look in the mirror if they think this so called brake is anything other than a sham. OUT!!


May a US citizen become PM? Boris IS a US Citizen and would his obligations as one debar him from becoming PM?


if the 'rebels' really want to make a point then they should break away and form a new party or schedule a vote of no confidence and dissolve parliament.that would be a good legacy for cameron alongside his failed wars.


No. They simply need to elect a new leader.


the PM has no agenda, really. everything he does is to serve himself, he's either been promised a few choice carrots like the lords or directorships and nice EU role suited to a failed politician.


No doubt the only real negotiation to have taken place related to his taking over the role of EU President once he finally delivered the UK irrevocably into the hands of the superstate.


Says the man who has royally shafted the UK with his lies and deceit.


You have spotted an ugly reality, M. The government uses welfare on purpose to attract migrants; they want them here. Unfortunately, they wish you would go away.


Absolutely right!!! and migrant families receiving 6000 to 10000 pa! Outrageous
