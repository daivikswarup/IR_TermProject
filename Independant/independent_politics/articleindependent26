<p style="">Labour risks offering voters “yesterday’s solutions for tomorrow’s problems” and must move beyond policies such as renationalisation if it wants to support workers in the modern economy, a senior MP is set to say.</p>
<p style="">Speaking in London on 23 February, the former Cabinet minister and leadership candidate Yvette Cooper will warn that the digital revolution is “leaving the labour movement behind” and that the party is failing to offer “hope” to workers seeking new opportunities.</p>
<p>Labour under Jeremy Corbyn has been accused by critics of harking back to traditional Labour positions on jobs and the economy, with the leadership advocating renationalisation of the railways and local council ownership of energy companies.</p>
<p>However, in a speech to launch a new jobs think tank, Ms Cooper will say the party must not “get drawn into touting” old solutions.</p>
<p>“Things like nationalising power companies don’t do anything to help young people trying to build a new app or older workers stuck in precarious temporary work,” she will say.</p>
<p>Mobile computing, social media, artificial intelligence and robotics are all “revolutionising” the world of work, but risk creating new layers of inequality she will say, highlighting the fact that more start-up businesses were launched in one London postcode in 2014/15 than in every town in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The ‘silicon roundabout’ London postcode, considered the UK’s tech hub, generated 10,280 start-ups in 2014/15, more in a single postcode than in any other city, barring Birmingham, and more than the 9,562 start-ups generated in the entire Yorkshire and Humberside region. </p>
<p>Referring to divisions within her party, Ms Cooper will say: “Much as we may argue amongst ourselves about whether we are too right wing or too left wing, the right question is whether our whole labour movement is being left behind.”</p>
<p>Ms Cooper is set to chair the new Centre for Changing Work, founded by the Fabian Society and the Community union, which will conduct research into the modern jobs market. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Cooper claims that nationalisation will not help people trying to build anapp, or, that older people in temporary jobs will not benefit, both of whichare completely misleading. Of course Nationalising would help; but hercomparison is doubly annoying because these are not matters that are oftenconsidered together. Nor should be. A nationalised power company wouldeliminate the profit motive and invest further in the industry, meaning lowerbills. <br/></p>

<p>This would help a young person building a new app., who would use powerin its development. It would also help older workers who are struggling to makeends meet for they would no longer be dependent of zero hour contracts but bebrought in-house with better living and regular wages, leaving them more tospend, increasing sales, business success and tax coming into Government. Ithink this would work much better than the Blairte watered down version of theThatcherite trickle down theory of economic growth and wealth that in herhidden way Cooper appears to be espousing. <br/></p>

<p>It is Cooper who is looking back, <span class="uficommentbody"><span>speakingto a middle class vote which she does not seem to realise is being hit heavilyalso! <span> </span>She is living in a WestminsterBubble and nostalgia for the past High Blair Years</span>. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>
