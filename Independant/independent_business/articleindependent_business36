<p style="">The pound was pummelled to a fresh seven-year low against the dollar yesterday, as surging fears of a possible “Brexit” prompted traders to dump the UK currency.</p>
<p style="">Sterling dipped below $1.39 in trading, its lowest level since 2009. This followed Monday’s brutal session, when the currency lost more value than on any single day since 2010.</p>
<p>Analysts from HSBC predicted the pound could fall by as much as 20 per cent if the UK does ultimately vote to leave the European Union on 23 June, while GDP growth could be cut in half. The next major landmark for sterling is $1.37. If the pound falls below that level, it will be at lows against the dollar not hit since 1986.</p>
<p>The currency turmoil came as a host of business leaders waded further into the Brexit debate, following the letter to The Times earlier this week from 200 of them warning that leaving the EU would deter investment and threaten jobs. </p>
<p>Tom Enders, the chief executive of Airbus, which employs 16,000 people in Britain, said: “If Britain leaves, I cannot imagine that this would have positive consequences for our competitiveness.” The manufacturer’s UK boss, Paul Kahn, added that Brexit could mean more, not less, red tape for EU states wanting to do business with the UK.</p>
<p>That negative view was echoed by Manny Roman, the chief executive of the London-listed hedge fund Man Group. “Whilst it is hard to say exactly what the impact would be, the uncertainty and potential negative consequences of Brexit for the UK’s economy should not be underestimated,” he said. </p>
<p>By contrast, some high-profile UK hedge fund managers such as Crispin Odey of Odey Asset Management have donated money to the “out” campaign. Fund manager Neil Woodford took the middle road in an interview yesterday: “There is no economic case either for the UK to stay in or leave the EU,” he said. “Ultimately the debate will come down to politics – it’s about sovereignty, political allegiances, ideology and immigration.”</p>
<p>There were different views expressed by businesses in the hospitality industry. The board of Whitbread, which owns the Costa Coffee brand, issued a statement warning that “the uncertainty arising from a vote to exit and the subsequent potentially lengthy negotiations could negatively affect consumer confidence and the general economic outlook in the UK, which would be both unwelcome and potentially damaging to our business.” </p>
<p>Tim Martin, founder of the Wetherspoons pub empire and a long-standing advocate of withdrawal, weighed in on the side of Brexit: “It makes no sense, in the UK, for sensitive issues to be decided on by faceless bureaucrats in Brussels, “ he said.</p>

<p>That’s just wishful thinking and self-delusion. Why would any EU nation agree to a treaty providing more favorable terms to us after leaving the EU? It would neither be in their political or financial self-interest to do so. Your opinion seems to be based on the belief that they need us more than we need them and that we are just not bullish enough negotiating with Europe.Evidence please. You also seem to have severely underestimated the amount of work negotiating 27 separate treaties would be, the massive additional spend we'd need on intelligence services given the loss of EU treaties, particularly with Non NATO Countries, the fact that vast tranches of our laws would need to be re-written as many of them directly refer to EC directives and treaties to which we would no longer be party. That is YEARS of work, with little but legal and financial uncertainty in the interim. </p>
