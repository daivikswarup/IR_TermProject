<p>Quindell was once a darling of AIM but its share price fell in April 2014 when its accounting practices were attacked in a stinging research note by US short seller Gotham City.

<p>City trader Tom Hayes, 35, has become the first person to be convicted of rigging Libor rates following a trial at London's Southwark Crown Court.
Hayes worked as a trader in yen derivatives at UBS before joining the American bank Citigroup in Tokyo. He was fired from Citigroup following an investigation into his trading methods. He returned to the UK in December 2012 and was arrested following a two-and-a-half year criminal investigation by the SFO.

<p>Fox claimed she used Baby Powder and Shower to Shower for feminine hygiene for more than 35 years before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer three years ago. She died in October aged 62.</p>
<p>Jere Beasley, a lawyer for Fox's family, told journalists that Johnson &amp; Johnson “knew as far back as the 1980s of the risk,” and yet resorted to “lying to the public, lying to the regulatory agencies.” </p>
<p>Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman, said <span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Johnson &amp; Johnson </span>were disappointed with the outcome of the trial.</p>
<p>“We sympathize with the plaintiff's family but firmly believe the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence," Goodrich said.</p>
<p>Trials in several other talc lawsuits have been set for later this year. </p>
