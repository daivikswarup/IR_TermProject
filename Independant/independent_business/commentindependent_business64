now everyone will buy mars in the hope of finding something inside..


These companies are disgraceful, they will cut costs even at the expense of hurting consumer health. The health and safety nut jobs meanwhile are busy telling some man to cut his hedge.


I wonder how many 'own label' chocolate products are actually made by Mars and not mentioned ?
