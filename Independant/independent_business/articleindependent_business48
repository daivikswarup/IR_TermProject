<p style="">The number of major weapons switching hands around the world was up 14 per cent in the last five years, compared to the five years before that.</p>
<p style="">The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent resource on global security, has released a study that shows that India is the world's largest importer of arms.</p>
<p>The chart shows that Asia was the main importer of weapons in the last five years, as the region races to arm itself ahead of its regional rivals: China and Pakistan. The high levels of Indian imports are also the result of its small domestic arms industry, which means it has to buy weapons from overseas.</p>
<p>Russia is the biggest supplier of arms to India, ahead of the US. But US imports there are growing. They were 11 times higher in 2011-2015 than 2006-2010.</p>
<p>SIPRI also identified eight rebel forces as importers of major weapons in 2011–15, but none of these forces accounted for more than 0.02 per cent of total deliveries.</p>

<p>The UK is the sixth largest exporter of arms in the world, with a 4.5 per cent share of the global market. Arms exports from the UK increased 26 per cent in the last five years. </p>
