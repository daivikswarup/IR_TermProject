George Osborne championed the deal as a “major success”.
But European MEPs have since called for the Chancellor  to appear in front of the committee on tax rulings to explain the tax deal.

<p>Quindell was once a darling of AIM but its share price fell in April 2014 when its accounting practices were attacked in a stinging research note by US short seller Gotham City.
In August the group was forced to disclose that the £107 million pre-tax profit it had reported for 2013 was incorrect, and it had in fact suffered a £64million loss. 
The investigation has prompted legal proceedings to be launched against the firm by a group of 342 retail investors who claim they were misled.
Quindell’s shares fell more than 85 percent.
In November the troubled company said it would change its name to Watchstone Groupas part of its efforts to draw a line under months of turmoil involving founder Robert Terry.
