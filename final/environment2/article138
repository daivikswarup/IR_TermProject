UK government told to take action on air pollution or face legal challenge




DateTime::::2016-03-01T09:57:38+0000



<p>The UKgovernment must take steps to tackle air pollution within days or face further legal action, it has been warned. </p>

<p>Environmental law firm ClientEarth has sent a final warning letter to environment secretary, Liz Truss, giving her 10 days to act or face action in the high court. </p>

<p>The group, which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan">won a ruling against the government in the supreme court</a> over its failures on air pollution last year, says the environment department’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years">recently published plans to cut pollutants</a> fall “woefully short” of what the court ordered. </p>

<p>The move comes after a report from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/22/indoor-and-outdoor-air-pollution-claiming-at-least-40000-uk-lives-a-year">warned an estimated 40,000 people die early each year in the UK because of air pollution</a>. </p>

<p>European rules set limits for key pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which should have been met by 2010, but ClientEarth said the plans which the government was ordered to produce by the supreme court do not see the UK meeting legal targets until 2025. </p>

<p>The “air quality plan” published late last year <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/illegal-air-pollution-will-blight-many-uk-cities-for-at-least-five-years">focused on bringing in clean air zones in five English cities by 2020</a>, in which the most polluting buses, taxis, coaches and lorries will be charged to enter the centre. But the move does not cover private cars, which ClientEarth said are one of the biggest sources of poor air quality in cities. </p>

<p>London, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/08/london-takes-just-one-week-to-breach-annual-air-pollution-limits">which breached its air pollution limits for NO2 for the whole of 2016 just a week into January</a>, is set to introduce a ultra-low emission zone in London by 2020 which will cover all vehicles, but is not expected to meet legal levels until 2025.</p>

<p>ClientEarth chief executive, James Thornton, said: “Despite an order from the UK’s highest court, despite tens of thousands of premature deaths in this country every year and despite clear evidence to show that air pollution has a terrible effect on the health of vulnerable groups like children, the government has consistently ducked its responsibility to ensure our right to clean air. </p>

<p>“We have had to issue this legal warning to the government because of its failure to produce a plan that would bring air pollution down as soon as possible.” </p>

<p>The law firm said it had asked the government to produce new plans with a list of measures that will bring air pollution down to within legal limits in the shortest time possible and put the proposals out to consultation. ClientEarth said that if it does not receive a satisfactory reply within 10 days, it will launch legal proceedings in the high court.</p>

The clean air act was introduced in 1956 as people could see the pollution in the air - the soot and 'pea soupers' . It was clearly unhealthy and after rallies and mass demonstrations the act was passed. Now we can't see the pollution in the air as it is fine particulate - which passes straight to your bloodstream and causes heart disease, respiratory problems, etc. This pollution is even more toxic but the majority of the public remain in blissful ignorance because it's invisible. Awareness about air pollution is at the same stage smoking was in the 70's - to many, they say 'we all have to die of something'. It's in everyone's best interest to get this resolved. We do all use transport, but not in the same way. I am mocked because I am a higher rate tax payer and walk, cycle or use public transport. One of the advantages of living in the city is excellent public transport - if you are able bodied, you don't 'need' a car.

Google 'induced demand' and 'traffic evaporation'. The data, going back to the 40's, demonstrates building more space for cars increases traffic. Similarly reducing road space reduces it. Freeways have also been successfully removed in Portland Oregon, Cheonggyecheon in Seoul and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and replaced with residential areas, without the threatened choking of traffic.

Your posts are welcome to me but I disagree that a majority of the electorate can decide to pollute the atmosphere we all have to breathe. My advice to a government that gave a damn would be to create a new national transportation infrastructure comprehensive, affordable, safe, frequent and easy to use. It's simple, not easy, and within the reasonable and responsible remit of government to do so.

What a stupid remark. Getting traffic moving encourages more driving? Well getting it all gridlocked isn't going to get many out of their cars, certainly not me, and the pollution created by standing traffic is far more than if it's moving. The goal should be cleaner more efficient engines in cars that can get where they're going as quickly and cleanly as possible, not filling the roads with lines and lines of traffic going nowhere.

Yes - I suspect that they might need limiting to just under 20mph, like electric bikes.

It's both, not just the taxis & buses but also private cars, delivery lorries and trucks motorbikes and any other source of air pollution and it is killing people and make many more ill with respiratory diseases like asthma.

Incorrect Andy. There are a lot of ways to break fossil fuel addiction. They have been implemented and are being implemented. If you don't know anything about them I'd suggest you do a little research around wind power, tidal power, solar power.

At least the issue of local air pollution is an easy one to fix (ban diesels). The issue of global climate change has very few viable solutions, one being: cut the population to a sustainable level.Another: everyone lives in poverty consuming nothing.My favourite being: fully develop Nuclear Fusion electricity generation.All other solutions I have heard are insignificant in the help they will provide in terms of global warming.

Hypocrisy is only a problem for people who don't know right from wrong. Is it right that the government should be required to work to the laws it signed up to? Yes. Is it right that people should take personal responsibility for pollution? Yes, so if you, me or Client Earth drive cars we should all try and drive them less.



Author::::misterbaxter
DateTime::::2016-03-02T07:33:39Z
Yes - I think the problem is that it's politically impossible because lots of people don't actually want it. I like democracy myself, but it does mean that we have to be honest and say that government is not the problem or the solution to air pollution; it's down to us as voters and consumers.In your case - folding bike? Cheap bike at each end of the journey? But yes, the trains are too damned expensive.

Other countries have much better public transport systems than the UK. In Swiss cities like Zurich and Basle, there are far lower densities of private cars because tram and bus services are so good. (It helps that about half the width of many streets is reserved for trams, further discouraging private cars.) Why can't London have public transport as good as that?

There are always other markets in business - look at the Chinese and their attitude to air pollution where they are a major exporter, of which is perhaps what Britain aspires to become where really taking the Chinese model the health of the populace doesn't matter as long as there are people clamouring for jobs to make stuff to export and increase the monetary and there political power of the country. Where of course who gets to act on air pollution, why the politicians of course of whom in not acting are increasing their political and monetary power and given the wealth they are creating for themselves by not inhibiting business over pollution issues they have the money to live somewhere cleaner.

Revised figures show domestic wood burning to be the UK’s largest single source of PM2.5 emissions, 2.4 times greater than all PM2.5 emissions from traffic.[1] The new information (33% of PM2.5 emissions in 2013-2014 from domestic wood burning, twice the previous estimate of 17%) highlights the extremely misguided nature of current policies. http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2757/rr-1

How about we ask you to pay for the true cost of the health impacting pollution created by the car you drive? I drive an extremely cheap to run (18300 miles in 2014 alone for £316 in electricity) & massively less polluting Nissan Leaf electric car with no street level air pollution emissions.

Kippers love getting smoked. They prefer exhaust fumes to fresh air and hanker after a constitutional walk in the health giving properties of a good old coal fired smog. Noxious fumes spewing out of chimneys, acid rain and bouts of bronchitis is what made Britain great, don't you know!

I don't think you've understood the story. The UK is legally bound to meet certain targets on air pollution. Client Earth are merely moving the issue through the courts so that the courts can consider whether the government is in breach of this legal duty. Client Earth didn't make the laws; we signed up to them via the EU. if we leave the EU we can opt out and stick with our primitive and polluting transport system, if that's what the people want, but as things stand, the government does not appear to be acting legally.

I live in Bristol, and I've commuted to work quickly and easily by bike on and off for about twenty-five years. During that time I've lived in various parts of the city wit commutes ranging from two miles to six miles each way, and I've worked in jobs ranging from workshops to smart-suit offices. Throughout the period I have had endless conversations with people who tell me that they'd love to cycle to work but can't, who turn out to live closer to their jobs than I do and are perfectly healthy people. Come to that, 11% of all car journeys are less than a mile; 29% are between a mile and two miles; and 60% of the remainder are less than five miles. Lots and lots of car journeys could be made by bike or on foot. People don't like the idea and they vote against anyone who tries to enforce it, as is their democratic right, but it's nevertheless silly to say that it's impossible to reduce the number of car journeys.

The point is not the organisation bringing the case, it's that the law actually requires the government to act on this and they are not. So lobby to change the law to allow more pollution, if you want, but don;t complain about laws being upheld by courts because that's pretty universally understood to be a good thing in a civilised country.



Author::::misterbaxter
DateTime::::2016-03-01T22:38:21Z
It's going to ask the court to consider whether the government is acting in accordance with the law; if not, the court will request that the government do so. We do actually have the rule of law in this country and the government is not above it.

My theory is that we're stuck in a faulty paradigm regarding vehicle options. We tend to think of the transport options as car; bike; train; bus; on foot; and then the various local tram / tube options specific to some cities. We can't move on from cars because electric versions of our current car models are slow and low-range compared to the fossil fuel versions; people don't like to pedal a bike up hills; it's too far to walk or they have baggage; the bus doesn't go where they want to go; and so we get in the car.But I'm just starting to see some new vehicle types emerging which might be a lot better. More and more people have electric bikes, which are great, but I'm also seeing a fair few people on electric trikes with a couple of children sitting on the rear seats and the shopping in a basket somewhere. Some of them look home-made, and some are custom built, but there seem to be a couple of brands emerging. I reckon that electric-assist cargo trikes ought to be huge. Mass produced, they could be under a thousand pounds new; they can go at 20mph which is as fast as cars get to go in the city anyway; parking is irrelevant and you don't need off-street parking to charge them, just a little bike space. Obviously the running cost is pennies. Loads of the groups of people whose cars are perceived to be a necessity (the elderly; people doing the weekly shop; people with children; tradesmen with tools; people with mobility problems) could actually get on just as well on one of these.The problem is British dignity, I guess, and a lack of investment. We need some good designers to find a way of making them look a bit more chunky and manly, or elegant and sleek, according to the various tastes of the public...
