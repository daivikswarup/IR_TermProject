Oil industry must thwart 'misguided' divestment campaign, says Saudi minister

<p>Big <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil">Oil</a> must thwart the movement to leave fossil fuels in the ground, the world’s most powerful oilman said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Addressing executives in Texas, Saudi oil minister Ali Al-Naimi said the industry had to shed its “Dark Side” image and show it was a “force for good”.</p>

<p>“As an industry, we should be celebrating that fact, and better explaining the vital importance of these precious natural resources,” he said, according to a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/1/482/482/NAIMI%20AT%20CERA%20WEEK.pdf">transcript</a> from an event in Houston.</p>

<p>“We should not be apologising. And we must not ignore the misguided campaign to ‘keep it in the ground’ and hope it will go away. For too long the oil industry has been portrayed as the Dark Side, but it is not. It is a force, yes, but a force for good.”</p>

<p>The growing divestment campaign bids to blacklist the industry as others shunned tobacco producers or Apartheid-era South Africa.</p>

<p>By last December, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/12/03/bill-mckibben-exxons-power-is-weakening-daily/">over 500 institutions</a> including large insurers, funds and banks managing US$3.4tn of assets pledged to move out of fossil fuels for climate reasons. That’s a 70-fold rise on September 2014.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fossil-fuels">Fossil fuels</a> were not the problem, but their “harmful emissions,” said Al-Naimi, who represents the hydrocarbon-rich Middle Eastern kingdom at UN climate talks and stepped down as chairman of national oil company Aramco in 2015.</p>

<p>The world must scale up technologies that capture carbon dioxide, instead of replacing the polluting fuels with renewable sources, he added.</p>

<p>The US now leads <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia">Saudi Arabia</a> as the world’s top oil producer following a revolution in techniques to extract it from shale rock, according to BP data.</p>

<p>Al-Naimi denied his country had declared war on US producers following oil cartel Opec’s decision not to limit production. Crude prices have plummeted more than 70% since June 2014, bankrupting shale drillers. </p>

<p>“We must continue to work together and we must stick together if we want to achieve our common goal of supplying energy for the betterment of the world and humankind,” he said.</p>

Don't believe that Environmentalism is having any effect on fossil-fuels being kept in the ground. It is not.

I am torn on this. The people leading this war on fossil fuels are the same thin line of humanity who rush to Africa when the droughts hit; campaign for debt relief and generally fight for justice for the poor. As Black African I feel i owe them some sort of debt, so to speak. I also know they are wrong and being completely selfish and hypocritical(they have fossil fuels running in heir veins) and unintentionally cruel to the poorest people in the world. My own country's people, lives, livelihoods and indeed environment can be saved by the use of a little fossil fuel. 'keeping it in the ground' means blindness and slow suffocation for our children as they 'read' on firewood glow with toxic smoke filling their malnourished lungs and eyes. 'Keeping it in the ground' means rapid desertification as whole desert country uses its few trees for fuel. This leads to hunger of nomads as their animals die who then come to towns to burn even more firewood. It is a veritable vortex of death and misery and environmental degradation that could be easily solved by the use of gas as fuel instead of trees and plants.

I just love this fantasising coming from brainwashed young people. Unfortunately for their high ideals, reality will hit them sooner or later. Eventually they will come to realise that fossil fuels are the mainstay of their luxurious lives. Because they were born into it, they take their lifestyle for granted and somehow imagine that it could continue more or less the same without fossil fuels. By all means go ahead and keep the fossil fuels in the ground if you are really prepared to face the consequences. The life you lead now is totally dependent on energy. Each day from when you get up to when you go to bed, you consume huge amounts of energy, cheap, reliable and boundless energy, and that is almost all supplied to you in your featherbedded existence by fossil fuels. Take that away, and you face poverty, disease, starvation, and war. Your world will be like that in the Mad Max movies. Go ahead and do it, because as you rightly say, my generation will be dead and gone by then, but never forget we told you so.Just a last reality check. We do not presently have any alternative source or sources of energy supply that could realistically replace fossil fuels. We have a few that are just capable of nibbling away at the edges a bit, and that's all.

The Saudis couldn't care less about feeble divestment campaigns. How can "divestment" possibly affect state-owned NOCs like ARAMCO (the world's largest oil company by the way - it dwarfs the usual love-to-hate-'em household name baddie "Majors"). In fact, if divestment has any effect at all (which is dubious) it'll be to strengthen the NOCs at the expense of the private-sector Majors. That's precisely why they're highlighting divestment with criticism, just as they pretended to be playing ball before COP21 and hopped the solar bandwagon, another distraction from the two real hopes: meaningful carbon pricing, especially carbon fee and dividend and next generation nuclear.

In fairness to Al-Naimi - his "country" does need money to keeping bombing the Yeminis out of existence - so it is very much drill-baby-drill and bomb baby bomb - & talk any sort of bollocks to keep the cash flowing. With a bit of luck, give it 30 years Al-Knobber & his mates will be riding their camels across the desert - again

nobody denies the energy from oil has helped economies. but the downside is pretty crap; wars in the middle east; pollution of the oceans; and of course the fact it's destroying our climate.

looks like there is a bit of desperation here. divesting is a movement and movements are very hard to stop because it is the ideals of the individuals and individuals are seeing past the carbon industry and looking towards the future which does not include the use of fossil fuels. the idea of fossil fuels are held with the older generation, the baby boomers. as these people die off, then their ideas go with them leaving only gen x and milennials to go forward with a fossil free mind. this is going to be a slow and painful death for fossil fuels and there is not a god damn thing that anyone can do about it...

For the world hydrocarbons are no longer viable as a primary fuel source. I would expect in the future to see an highly efficient fossil resource industry. The planets now somewhat scarce hydrocarbons resources do have good value, there are currently numerous uses for hydrocarbons other than fuel. And it is reasonable to expect that once the focus moves from using hydrocarbons as a primary fuel source other innovative and beneficial uses will be found. Who knows, someone make even invent a hydrocarbon fuel use that is totally planet friendly! Right now which fossil fuel industry players can survive a major shift in energy generation is hard to peg, there appears to be very little innovative innovation outside of burning in the sector. It may all go up in flames (metaphor).

Of course fossil fuels have been a force for good, just as they have also fueled war and oppression. But the Keep It In The Ground movement isn't about denial of fossil fuels' value in the past. It's about paying attention to new information about their downside. The minister is using an irrelevant strawman argument to distract us from looking at climate change.

They can't afford the solar and wind because they have a population that's quadrupled in the last 40 years or so and has grown accustomed to government funded lifestyles of studying the Koran and hanging out at the mall. It would take them some time to learn how to earn a living and time is short.

The oil companies could rebrand themselves as energy companies and buy some factories to manufacture solar panels and wind mills. Oh, wait a minute, they did that already, back in the 1970s....which means they've had plenty of time to make solar cheap and ubiquitous and use the energy from it to make carbon neutral fuels! Hey! Problem solved! So what's everyone worrying about?

If they had any sense and brains(forget morals), they would use their incredible profits to work towards alternative green energy because given their financial advantage they would outpace and beat the competition whilst they slowly transform the energy sources they'll use. Instead they just become more destructive and antagonise there rest of humanity. That's a lost battle. They'd still harvest energy as companies but form alternative sources. Would that reduce profits over 10-20yrs?, Sure but would setup the companies for the next 100

These fossil fuel interests have been misleading the public for decades, caring nothing for the damage they are doing to people's health, the environment and the long term viability of human civilisation. However it looks like the campaign "to keep it in the ground" is starting to have an effect. We need to redouble our efforts to move investment out of fossil fuels and into energy efficiency, renewable energy and other green technologies.

Oil is much geologically harder to find than 20 years ago, it is much more expensive to extract new fields. This reuqires investment that already has a geologic and market risk associated to it. Emphasizing the social and political risks of an industry with a bad reputation and CO2 limiting legislation plus the likely technological risks of new innovative technologies means they could struggle for capital for new oil. Saudi may not need to raise capital at the moment but that is not to say it will not in 10 years, nor to say that the campaign that helps move people from financially gaining from the industry will free them from being so concerned at its demise.
