Japan begins work on 'world's largest' floating solar farm




DateTime::::2016-01-27T16:40:41+0000



<p>The Japanese electronics multinational Kyocera has begun work on what it says will be the world’s biggest floating solar farm.</p>

<p>The power plant is being built on a reservoir in Japan’s Chiba prefecture and is anticipated to supply enough electricity for nearly 5,000 households when it is completed in early 2018.</p>

<p>Space-starved Japan has already seen several floating solar farms built as part of the country’s drive to exploit more renewable energy in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The shutdown of nuclear plants <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/oct/16/which-countries-are-doing-the-most-to-stop-dangerous-global-warming">has seen Japan increasingly reliant on fossil fuel imports that have hit its emissions-cutting ambitions</a>. </p>

<p>The Yamakura dam power plant will see more than 50,000 solar photovoltaic panels cover a 180,000 m sq area, but compared to other land-based plants it is relatively small. At 13.7MW when finished, it would not make the top 100 of the world’s largest solar photovoltaic farms.</p>

<p>In the UK, water company United Utilities <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-34637828">started work last year on a floating solar farm on a Greater Manchester reservoir</a>, which will be Europe’s largest once complete. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://global.kyocera.com/news/2016/0102_knds.html">Kyocera said</a> it was turning to water because of a scarcity of land for utility-scale solar in Japan.</p>

<p>Ray Noble, a solar adviser at the UK-based Renewable <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/energy">Energy</a> Association, said that the technology was relatively straightforward but the only reason to build floating farms would be if land was very tight.</p>

<p>“If you’re short on land like they are in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a>, you could build on water. But in the UK with plenty of industrialised areas, it’s cheaper to put solar on land than on water.”</p>

<p>The main challenge was to keep wiring away from the water and put the inverters - which convert the electricity generated into a usable form - on floating structures. But he added: “If anything goes wrong, I’ve always said electricity and water don’t mix.”</p>

<p>Kyocera has already built three floating solar farms, which are much smaller than the new one, which was first announced in October 2014.</p>

Could be, especially if you talk about the 'rated capacity'.But solar provides .2% of global energy and fossil fuels 86%.The increase in the global demand/consumption of energy each yearis more than the amount supplied by wind and solar combined.

It seems strange to me that in this country we have fields with solar panels in them when the majority of houses don't have them. Some trees or crops could be growing in those fields.

Think you are on the mark! Numerous comments here yet you are the first one to mention Fukushima. Totally ignored by the pro-nuclear dance in couple of comments. Can only believe that Japanese and U.S. public relations for the nuclear industry has been very successful.

There is an investment chart in the report. It is on slide 36 and looks at the investments made to construct the capacity. Solar has tailed off in recent years but is still higher than biomass and had a huge cost circa 2010.

According to the AGEE stat for 2014, solar was the largest single source of electricity in terms of installed capacity when we split out off shore and onshore wind in Germany.

I have to wonder if this sort of thing could be used in California. While we are not starved for space, we are actually floating plastic balls in reservoirs to prevent evaporation. One might surmise that you could accomplish both electric acquisition and water savings in one project. Not to mention the amount of water used in hydrocarbon fired electrical generation facilities. Two birds? Sounds like a subsidy worthy program to me

If solar performs poorly then why has it reached grid parity in Germany?



Author::::faiton77

And where it is not appropriate the going rate for fitting solar panels should be paid into a fund to support those people who want to fit panels on existing buildings.

Recently, there have been several countries that are now less impressed with current solar power technology. It is not providing the hoped for energyand is not lowering CO2 emissions. So, they have began to pull back onsubsidizing this industry.Companies like Panasonic in Japan, who recently had much to say aboutnew UK policy, are now looking at future unsold inventory. Getting rid of50,000 solar panels on this project would look like a good idea to them.

Riveness, Does a simple cover generate electricity as well? If solar performs poorly then why has it reached grid parity in Germany? Who says it is expensive? I doubt investors would finance a project that did not give a reasonable return. If a tsunami hits Japan again what do think the damage from solar panels would be in comparison to a nuclear power plant.

Remind us how solar works in the dark , remind us when demand is highest , when its warm in summer or cold in winter , now reminds us at what time of the year has the most sunlight . The inability to work because of the lack of source of energy supply , which you can 'nothing about ' is hardly a small problem .

Given virtual no one can relies just on solar , but remains on the grind , its unlike the 'plebs being energy self-sufficient' is going to be any real issue.

For the recipients of subsidies, yes. For the lobbyists (including those who write the press releases regurgitated by Gruan churnalists) who'd like us to forget Japan would need approx. 11% of its land area to get all its electricity from solar PV, yes; the "floating farm" meme is gold. For the LNG business supplying the fuel to replace Japanese nuclear, yes.

I think Mr Musk is about to prove you wrong about the batteries and the panel costs just get lower and lower as does the cost of an inverter.

"Take that in the context of how poorly solar performs in Germany of the UK, then there is no reason why you would do such a thing."Seems like a comment with very little, if any, facts behind it, Please give references backing up this statement preferably from Government or peer reviewed sources.

Oh, don't be such an alarmist! There's no possibility they could become self-sufficient through PV alone. Not even with (highly expensive) batteries. There are even less probabilities of people quitting from drinking.

Completely agree. I've always thought that making a solar panel mandatory on new houses (as long as the site was appropriate, of course) would be fantastic.

Due to evaporation the areas over water are cooler, this therefore means the panels are more efficient and generate higher amounts of electricity. There can also be higher irradiation over water areas due to reflection.

This seems like a good idea although I can't help thinking you should have a solar panel on the roof of every building in the country before starting this kind of project.

No, its far closer to around 1,500 houses on average. Probably less.



Author::::GrandMoffTanner

Author::::GrandMoffTanner

Most of Japan is slightly better located for solar than the UK so that 13.7MW will probably output 13GWh annually. At Japans average electriciy consumption of 8.3MWh that is 1,500 houses. A bit different to what the article claims. Also it probably will lose some output as its flat... solar panels are meant to be angled to better catch the sun at Japans latitude... you would seriously decrease your output by atleast 12% putting solar panels flat in the UK atleast.

We can't have the plebs being energy self-sufficient. They might suddenly realise that they don't need to work like slaves to pay the bills; then they might start thinking that they don't need to drown themselves in booze every weekend, just to blow out the stress. Then they might stop blaming some imaginary enemy for all their problems, and actually stop voting for the most effective fear-mongers in parliament.

Well of course you don't generally want to cover a reservoir to reduce evaporation: cost would outweigh benefit- its just a slightly beneficial by product of something you are going to do to provide power.

Covering reservoirs actually massively decreases evaporation losses and growth of algae and other water based organisms so it actually is a very practical thing to do for a water company. Water utilities also use large amounts of electricity to pump water around so again it is a no brainer to install solar PV.

I apologise then alanmarg. I was briefly in the anti-nuclear movement almost 40 years ago, but I quickly became disillusioned when I realised that the radiophobia was utterly extreme, and in many circumstances people would get upset about levels of radioactivity that were less than 1 millionth of background.Regrettably, there is this closed-minded dark green fringe who opposes nuclear energy. I don't see them as any different to climate-change-denialists; they both have their elaborate theories about UN conspiracies, related to either the IPCC reports or the Chernobyl Forum.
