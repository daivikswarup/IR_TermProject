The Guardian view on air pollution: breathe uneasy

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">E</span></span>very so often a statistic emerges to send shockwaves through the most innumerate skulls. One such figure, highlighted by the Royal College of Physicians in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/every-breath-we-take-lifelong-impact-air-pollution">a report</a> on Tuesday, is the annual toll of 40,000 premature deaths attributable to outdoor air pollution. It implies that the finger can be pointed at unclean air for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/death-reg-sum-tables/2014/sb-deaths-first-release--2014.html">about 8% of all of the half million or so deaths</a> recorded in the UK every year, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://cleanair.london/health/guide-to-health-impacts-invisible-air-pollution-is-the-biggest-public-health-failing-or-cover-up-for-decades/">a far higher proportion than is usually blamed on alcohol or obesity</a>, two public health problems that grab more attention. Factoring indoor pollution into the mix – familiar fiends such as secondhand tobacco smoke, and overlooked enemies like spray deodorants – only strengthens the link between the air we breathe and our last gasp.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/01/boris-johnson-and-london-toxic-air">Boris Johnson and London’s toxic air | Letters</a> </p>

<p>To acknowledge the importance of pollution should not amount to a counsel of despair. Britain led the world in dispelling the coal-caused smogs of the 1950s with the clean air acts, and a generation later called time on leaded petrol. Such progressive past steps have contributed to far longer average lives. With determination, the great culprits of our own time, nitrogen dioxide and diesel particulates, which between them contribute to wheezing, heart disease and cancer, might be tackled the same way. In many other European metropolises, and not least in German-speaking centres, which this week dominate the top flight in a global league table of good cities to live, all sorts of serious action is under way, ranging from pedestrianisation to outright bans on the dirtiest diesel cars.</p>

<p>But in the UK in general and London in particular, whose place in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/23/vienna-named-worlds-top-city-for-quality-of-life">the city rankings</a> was dragged down by its air, all urgency is lacking. Where Berlin banned the most polluting old diesel cars at the very start of the current decade, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28540259">London will not do so until its very end</a>. And – even then – Boris Johnson has announced <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/environment/ultra-low-emission-zone/user_uploads/ulez-supplementary-information---final-291014.pdf">exemptions for 300 of the Routemaster buses</a> that make up a costly part of his personal brand, and indeed for any other old smoke-box whose driver is willing and able to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/december/have-your-say-on-proposed-ultra-low-emission-zone">come up with £12.50 a day</a>. Across the UK, 38 out of 43 zones are in breach of EU standards on nitrogen dioxide, and the government has been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/environmental-audit/HC-212-for-web.pdf">hauled up over the lack of plans to comply in 16</a> of these. But it is London, which is not going to get there till at least 2025, that stands out in a singular shame, and Mr Johnson’s record has not helped at all.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.londonair.org.uk/london/asp/news.asp?NewsId=OxfordStHighNO2">A King’s College London note</a> suggests that many roads in central London will tend to have the highest nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the world. At one spot, in Putney, the annual quota of very high pollution hours, meant to last for all of 2016, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f7dbaa86-b617-11e5-b147-e5e5bba42e51.html#axzz4111H5fyQ">was exhausted on 8 January</a>. Private hire vehicles are mushrooming, not least due to Uber, but whereas one might still hope that the number of diesels among them would have started to fall, it too has risen. Running through it all is a lack of political will.</p>

<p>If you can’t measure it you can’t manage it, the consultants say, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-vw-scandal-punish-the-guilty">the VW scandal</a> revealed how the mismeasurement of pollution can make management impossible. A few years ago, London’s government was spraying a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_magnesium_acetate">de-icer</a> around to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/13/boris-johnson-sticky-pollution-failure">“glue” pollution</a> to the road, in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15762967">tiny areas sometimes right by EU air monitoring stations</a>, a process <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/24/boris-johnson-london-air-pollution">likened by one Labour MP</a> to strapping an oxygen mask on to the canary down the mine. Last month <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/london-breaches-air-pollution-limit-for-the-whole-of-2016-in-just-over-seven-days-a6811616.html">a monitor in polluted Oxford Street went offline</a>, and another – covered – device seized up from water damage shortly before the Olympics. No doubt accidents can explain these things, but does the prospect of European fines – which, as the mayor himself <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/britain-300m-fine-london-air-pollution">once acknowledged, could eventually total £300m</a>, for nitrogen dioxide and for particulates too – encourage an overly relaxed approach to getting them fixed? And have such fines fuelled the current heightening of Mr Johnson’s hostility towards the EU?</p>

<p>Every Briton, in the capital and beyond, should take a deep breath – and then ask themselves whether they would rather all control over its quality was passed from Brussels to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a>.</p>

Oh! The EU is responsible for the move from the position where we had floods every few years to the one where we flood, allegedly, every year? Yes, okay then.

Now this effort I can get behind. People need to understand that just because you cannot see it (and you often can see diesel particulates) this does not mean it cannot hurt you.

I looked at this: it's a cool, equitable, and practical idea (only non-polluting vehicles allowed when levels are harmful, to protect the public). It's common sense and obeys both "polluter pays" and the libertarianist free market principles (when you have costed up the 40,000 deaths plus the costs of morbidity; why should some privileged class get to piss in the drinking water just because they can afford the congestion charge?).

Its not conspirancy theory anymore. Start looking at the sky each day. Observe. It is easy to see.The UK is a key active member of Eiscat, the CURRENT ACTIVE major geo-engineering research project in Europe. There are multiple uses for high altitude aerial spraying, not just to weaponise the upper atmosphere, although that is certainly one. http://www.eiscat.rl.ac.uk/experiments/overview

The UK government has found a way to 'hide' current illegal air pollution, by removing the most important particulate public reporting on the Defra website, lead, carbon monoxide, benzene, butadene, deeming it now a redundant worthless resource of current information..

Pollution doesn't only affect London. This is an article in the environment section. By saying it was too London-centric I meant that they could have discussed pollution in other cities of the UK, not that they shouldn't write an article about London.

The Clean Air Act certainly had a major impact on reducing one type of pollution but there were far fewer cars and lorries in London in those days. They create a different kind of pollution, not always as obvious as smoke from coal fires, but I wonder if London's air is actually cleaner now that 50 years ago. After all, coal fires were not lit all through the year but traffic is a constant source of pollution.

A good post. Buses and taxis are nearly all diesel-powered and it should not be too difficult to install enough re-charging points to service electrically-powered replacements. Another suggestion would be hybrid HGVs that could only operate in town only under electric power.

There does seem to be some very strange traffic light phasing in London. There are times when nothing has a green light for ages, so all the vehicles just sit there.

You're so right, just look at a map and everything radiates out of London. I live in the SE and if I want to go to somewhere like Birmingham (OK, need rather than want), then I have to mess around getting across the centre of London if using public transport. If I'm driving there is at least the M25, but that snarls up on a regular basis, so you often have to cut through London in some way.

The congestion charge just generated a ring of pollution around its perimeter. The most polluted street is still Oxford St, which is closed to cars and within the charging zone.



Author::::eye360
DateTime::::2016-02-24T17:16:12Z
The power stations can generate the power more cleanly, such as wind farms or solar power. Its the battery technology that's holding things back, but buses and taxis can tolerate the limitations of batteries more than private transport can.

In the UK air quality is not taken seriously and needs to be nudged by the EU. I can foresee a day if there is Brexit when locations in Europe will market themselves on air quality and Eco friendliness compared to the UK!
