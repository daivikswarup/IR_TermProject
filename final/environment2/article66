EU open to increasing 2030 carbon target, says top climate negotiator




DateTime::::2016-03-07T13:51:01+0000



<p>Europe’s chief climate negotiator has said he is open to increasing the EU’s carbon target for 2030, in a backdown by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission">European commission</a>.</p>

<p>Last week, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-110-EN-F1-1.PDF">commission ruled out</a> any increase in the bloc’s target of cutting emissions by 40% by 2030 on 1990 levels, sparking an outcry from several countries and green groups.</p>

<p>Ministers and environmentalists said that Europe should be increasing its ambition in light of the Paris climate deal agreed in December, where <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points">nearly 200 countries pledged to pursue efforts to keep temperature rises to 1.5C</a>. That was a much tougher goal than the existing 2C goal which Europe’s 40% cut is based on.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>On Monday, the EUdirector of climate strategy, Artur Runge-Metzger, responded to the criticism: “The question of the level of ambition for 2030 is open, as long as it is a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.”</p>

<p>Brook Riley, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth, welcomed his comments. “It’s good to hear the commission saying that increased emission cuts are still on the table, even if this contradicts what it published last week. Without tougher targets <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> would be undermining and undoing the Paris agreement before it is even signed.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>Last Friday, the Austrian environment minister, Andrä Rupprechter, told a ministerial summit in Brussels: “We shouldn’t let our ambition droop. We should keep putting out strong signals.”</p>

<p>The German environment minister, Jochen Flasbarth, added: “Our decision did not say that we would stay at a 40% emissions cut. It said we will cut ‘at least 40%’. The commission was a member of the ‘high ambition coalition’ in Paris so we would like to know how they intend to stand by this commitment.”</p>

<p>No answer is likely before 2018. That is when the UN’s climate science panel, reports back to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees international climate negotiations, on the policy implications of faster and more far-reaching action.</p>

<p>The first in a five-yearly series of “global stock-takes” on emissions cuts follows in 2023, and this will be the first opportunity for the EU to increase its pledge of a 40% cut by 2030.</p>

<p>The EU is currently modelling the economic impacts of improved energy efficiency targets, after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/building-efficiency-sector-the-2030-debate-was-a-set-up/">criticism</a> of previous impact assessments used to set policy. </p>

<p>In a sign that Brussels lobbies are beginning to see signs of change, the head of the solar photovoltaic industry’s trade association today called on the EU to set a new target of members states sourcing 35% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030.</p>

<p>“More ambition is needed in Europe to reach the objective of limiting global warming to just 1.5C, which the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> signed up to in Paris,” said Oliver Schaefer, SolarPower Europe’s president. “The EU must review the targets suggested in 2014. It would be foolish to pretend that nothing has changed since COP21 [the Paris climate summit].”</p>

It doesn´t need to be like this - it is just that our Green Party are ideologically driven and this presents problems in implementation. Also Germany was/is on the cutting edge, much grunge work has been done - others can pick up on lessons learned.

Yes decoupled - as with countries like Denmark - Germany simply outsource their environmentally damaging processes to Asia, Latin America etc. In the end the Greens (and I think their goals are good ones and achieveable) have to actually do what they say, not some sort of conjuring trick. Instead of improving a process, the company simply moves their processing to another country that does not have such strict environmental regulations. Then the products are reimported "designed in Germany" "made in where-ever". Things like solar panels, computers, car components, Xmas decorations to name a few out of millions of examples - in their processing and disposal damage the environment. It doesn´t matter whether that damage is in Germany or in China - it still damages. Congratulating Germany because it has exported its heavy industry is simply bizarre.

What are you on about - other than egregious hair splitting and putting words in my mouth. I don't give a fuck how the emissions are reduced or who claims the credit for it. All that matters is that the emissions come down as fast as we can collectively reduce them - and my conclusions are wholly independent of your patronising remarks, thanks all the same.

You could start by considering the facts. Germany never claimed that 'ditching nuclear' was part of their strategy to reduce emissions. They planned a phase-out of nuclear power by 2021, a commitment made before Merkel's government took office

I agree the situation is critical, for me though any discussion about reducing CO2 emissions that doesn't include nuclear generation in some form (as baseload capacity) is flawed. James Lovelock (Revenge of Gaia) makes a straight forward case for this. This is how Germany have failed and the costs to their consumers are very high, whilst ensuring their failure to reduce CO2 emissions in a truly meaningful way.

Yes and Germany shows the way. Ditching nuclear while progressing renewables was supposed to reduce their CO2 emissions from the grid. It has not over the last 15 years. So what do you do?

You'll be glad to hear that German greenhouse gas emissions have gone down since 1999.



Author::::riveness

I agree that focusing on specific technologies is probably not the ideal strategy, but you cannot conclude that Germany has failed only by looking at current emissions.

"calling soccer football". Are you serious? Its called football, not soccer. American football should be called American handball. Fact. The whole world accept Canada and the US calls it football. Why? Because that is what the game is called, not soccer. The game of football is considerably older than American Hand Ball. Keep up.

A good analogy. Similar to Europeans calling soccer football.But I've noticed, over the past 24 years, that this issue has beendriven primarily by the EU.The problem is that as far as a global arrangement, the EU is ratherirrelevant. We saw at the recent COP that the only country that mattersis China. An agreement has to be acceptable to China because if Chinajoins the US in not ratifying, the UN threshold cannot be achieved andthere can be no agreement.There are a group of countries that do not ratify EU/UN treaties if there areany commitments in the treaty, including the US, China, Russia, India, Iranand Saudi Arabia. They will sign on to aspirational treaties with no commitments.This applies to all areas, not just climate treaties.None of them would accept a global government, it would not be allowed to exist.

The only 2030 target that appears to be in line with the physical constraints of the planet is zero emissions. Everything else is not in line with staying under 1.5C warming, so therefore not realistic. Most people refer to the economy and/or politics when using the term "realistic goals", but the reality it should refer to is the physical, chemical and biological reality.

You don't need things like 5000 acres and perfect climate to improve the energy efficiency of your property or the street. You can use solar panels for the roof or decorate the garden with small solar lights (fairly common where I live), you could get miniature wind turbines that can be sometimes seen on/beside static caravans and stick them somewhere where wind gathers like a driveway or beside the roof of your garage.

As long as it doesn't raise costs too much and cause fuel poverty and negatively impact our heavy industries I'm all for it. We must make sure we don't copy the German example though which is taking a heavy toll on consumers (highest energy prices in Europe) and indeed the environment with their increased usage of lignite coal!

Good point: there is an increasing movement towards zero energy usage home building.It starts with insulation I believe. Continues with changing habits and minimising consumption. And finishes with using solar and wind, mostly it seems.

The EU's targets are *not* based on the 2 degree goal as set out in the Paris agreement. This is because the Paris agreement talks about 'equity' i.e. that developing countries should get a bigger slice of the carbon cake than developed countries.

There are solutions concerning this "storage problem". They just tend to be drowned out in the debate because of the obvious cries "What about night?" and "what about no wind?" and so on.
