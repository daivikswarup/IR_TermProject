Decision to end funding of local environmental record centres attacked




DateTime::::2016-03-06T15:35:53+0000



<p>Conservationists have criticised the decision to withdraw funding from a network of tens of thousands of local wildlife volunteers who collect data on the health of a variety of species and act as the “eyes and ears” of the government’s nature watchdog.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.alerc.org.uk/">Local environmental record centres (Lercs</a>), which collect and collate records of everything from great crested newts to bats and are used to inform planning decisions on legally protected species, have been told that a four-year deal to collect data is to end just one year in.</p>

<p>Last year, Natural England began funding almost <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.alerc.org.uk/">40 Lercs</a>, which employ 128 staff across the UK, 500 volunteers in offices, and an estimated tens of thousands more who record insects, plants and habitats in their spare time. <br/></p>

<p>Stephen Trotter, the director of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife">Wildlife</a> Trusts, England, condemned the decision to end the contract early, saying: “Lercs are the basis for much of our knowledge about what’s happening in the natural world and, in a time of climate change and widespread declines of wildlife, now is not the time to be pulling the rug from under them.</p>

<p>“The government has said it wants open data – and so do we. But Natural England needs to value the role and function of these small organisations if it’s going to achieve this. In my view, it is playing a short-term game in which society and the government could live to regret the long-term consequences if the network is allowed to collapse like a set of dominoes.”</p>

<p>Graham Walley, chairman of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nfbr.org.uk/website2015/">National Forum for Biological Recording</a>, many of whose members submit records to the centres, said they were important local services and the funding cut could be a “matter of life or death for some”. <br/></p>

<p>Describing the Lercs as the watchdog’s “eyes and ears”, he added: “I think Natural England are in danger of becoming more isolated by not doing this routine funding of local record centres.”</p>

<p>Natural England said the move had been taken because the data - which is supplied with a licence on how it can be used – did not meet its commitment to an open data agenda.</p>

<p>But Tom Hunt, the national coordinator for the centres, which have had a formal relationship with Natural England for 15 years, said he could not understand the decision as he had had no contact with the watchdog since the current deal was agreed a year ago.</p>

<p>“Despite being the main contact between Natural England and Lercs, I am actually at a loss to understand how this decision has come about … To end this relationship without any consultation and without any clear reasoning or strategy for doing so is baffling,” he said.</p>

<p>The Natural England officer who emailed the Lercs the decision to end the contract conceded that the watchdog appreciated the “impact this news will have on you and your centres”.</p>

<p>Only three of 25 of the centres that responded to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.alerc.org.uk/news/alerc-members-consulted-on-the-loss-of-ne-moa">an internal poll</a> on the changes said the decision posed an existential threat. But many are run on a shoestring with staff working long hours and volunteers contributing time out of goodwill. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/publication/44010">A 2010 report by Natural England</a> cautioned that the centres “need a certain level of funding to retain a critical mass”. In 2014-15, Natural England paid the Lercs a total of £205,000; that funding will not be renewed after the end of March.</p>

<p>The agency, an arm of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, could not say what new source of data would replace that provided by the Lercs, though it does have other sources including the national biodiversity network and records from NGOs. </p>

<p>Some centres warned that the loss of the data from April would put at risk the government regulator’s ability to meets its statutory obligations to protect wildlife and habitats under UK and EU laws.</p>

<p>The association of local environment record centres (Alerc) <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.alerc.org.uk/news/alerc-position-statement-on-the-withdrawal-of-natural-england-moa-funding">said it supported open data</a> but some of its members had concerns over how the data they provided was used.</p>

<p>A Natural England spokeswoman said the watchdog was “focused on making data – whether that’s information on a protected species, or data on the rural economy – as open and easily accessible to the public as possible. </p>

<p>“We’re currently looking at ways we can better target our spending and resources, which is why we’re shifting our funding away from local environmental records centres, which provide us with data under a licence, towards investing in a more centralised system of data that will enable records and information to be as transparent and accessible as possible.”<br/></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Alerc has written to the head of Natural England and the environment secretary, Liz Truss, to protest against the ending of the funding and what it says was only two months’ notice when the partnership required three months’ notice.</p>

The law, and planning clearly states that ignorance of species on site is not an excuse, and they must be satisfied that the ecological constraints have been satisfied before work can begin.

 The given reason is that it "did not meet its commitment to an open data agenda". Again for those not in the now, many species records and distribution data are restricted. In other words, to get access to some of this data you need a reason. This is not unnecessary. Rare or endangered species can be targeted, either by collectors, those who illegally persecute birds of prey (and they are connected with rich and often titled landowners i.e. Tories) etc.

I doubt that this decision has the support of most Natural England staff who are dedicated to their job and protecting the natural world......The Chairman of Natural England appointed by this government has no background in conservation, and at least was a Tory donor.

My local LERC doesn't get any funding from their local Wildlife Trust at all.



Author::::JHighfield
DateTime::::2016-03-07T13:46:32Z
I don't think my local one does either - It was set up by the county Wildlife Trust and funded by them for many years. Local councils then started to contribute and when I last spoke to them about three weeks ago the councils were still funding them.



Author::::Bangorstu

Don't think our LERC gets any money from the NWWT - which itself gets a huge wedge of funding from NRW (which would be NE iacross the border).



Author::::JHighfield
DateTime::::2016-03-07T12:59:52Z
Given a choice between more in the pot for their salaries and funding somebody else I suspect Natural England have picked their salaries and are quietly confident that after the obligatory huffing and puffing the Wildlife Trusts will continue to fund the LERCs.

A thoughtless and utterly ridiculous decision by the blatently anti-environment Tory government. As a former Ecological Consultant, LERCs are massively important repositories of information, and always the first stop when conducting a preliminary desk study of a site. The huge amount of valuable work done by volunteers is nothing short of amazing, and I really hope they manage to secure a future funding source.

The story seems to have garnered some interest. We will post more information as and when we hear from NE and Defra.

Our conversations with the private sector over recent years have actually been very positive. In fact it is possible that they understand the service we are trying to deliver much better than NE, and appreciate it much more. The private sector seem mostly to be interested in complying with the existing environmental legislation in as clear and easy way as possible. They also seem concerned with their own environmental credentials, although I appreciate that can be very different from being fully environmentally concious.



Author::::TMKHunt
DateTime::::2016-03-07T10:25:20Z
Currently we don't expect to see many major price increases for private sector partners. The story for us is much less about the money and much more about the direction that NE may be heading in.

Given much of the time of these centre sis actually spent handing out information for planning applications, perhaps they could make up the shortfall by increasing charges?



Author::::JHighfield

The reason for the cut in funding is simply that HMG is spending more more than it earns.



Author::::SteB1
DateTime::::2016-03-07T09:43:58Z
Unfortunately this is typical of this government. They make what appears to be an arbitrary, and random destructive decision, and give a weak justification that lacks all credibility, and then refuse to discuss or explain it further. It is all very shyster lawyer, contrived legalism. They are aware that the more they explain, the more the inconsistencies will become apparent. So they just give very short vague answers which lack all credibility. It is possible to speculate what the reason is, but they hold the reins of power, and can just say prove it.

" secrecy at the top, and the failure to properly explain the rationale for this decision" This struck me, though I'm totally new to this area of expertise. Why was a decision to abandon previously agreed 4-year funding taken so suddenly and without consultation with the affected organisation? The "open info" reason is weak; if it was the central issue that should a) have been discussed a year ago when agreeing the contract, or b) discussed now. Just to terminate the contract without further discussion is odd, to say the least. Perhaps this was because, if what you say is correct, and it certainly rings true, they knew they could not put up a reasonable counter to that argument so refused to discuss.

So a four-year deal is agreed and then withdrawn after one year? Why? What gave rise to the sudden decision to go back on an agreed deal, and why was it implemented without further discussion and agreement with the parties involved? Natural England seem to be acting as the "Department for the Destruction of the Environment"; this is not the first such environmentally hostile act in the past few days. Adam Vaughan, did you try to question them on this, and what was their response?

This, along with cuts in NRW's monitoring budgets, are short sighted as they fail to recognise the need to monitor our increasingly destructive impact on the world we live on.

Yes, this is one of the likely reasons for attempting sabotaging this network. In reality the government should be creating more funding. This is a prime example of where work is done mainly by unpaid volunteers. But the data still needs to be collected and collated.

Most of this information and data is collected by volunteers. The RSPB is an NGO for birds, and there is much more biodiversity than this. We have 10,000s of species, from birds, mammals, through invertebrates, insects, plants, fungi, microscopic organisms. The identification of these species is often a very specialist task, and there are a limited amount of mainly amateur experts capable of collecting this data.
