Solar farms to create natural habitats for threatened British species




DateTime::::2016-03-07T10:49:52+0000



<p>Threatened wildlife including turtle doves and skylarks could benefit from a scheme which has been launched to create natural habitats at solar farm sites. </p>

<p>The project by wildlife charity <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/rspb">RSPB</a> and clean tech company Anesco aims to boost wildlife at the firm’s solar farms across England and Wales.</p>

<p>Wild flower meadow areas and seed-rich planting in the “unused” margins of the farms and where tracks go between the panels will help boost insects such as bees and butterflies and provide food and nesting areas for birds, the RSPB said. </p>

<p>The scheme will reinstate habitats which have been lost in the face of agricultural intensification, hitting farmland bird species. </p>

<p>It is hoped that struggling species such as tree sparrows, which have seen numbers fall by 94% in the last 40 years, turtle doves which have seen an 89% reduction in numbers, lapwing (58% fall) and skylarks (51% fall) will be helped by the project. </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/butterflies">Butterflies</a>, reptiles, mammals and amphibians could also be helped by the move.</p>

<p>The project will see the RSPB advising Anesco on providing for “priority” species - those in most need of help - at its existing solar farms, in places ranging from Cornwall to Suffolk, Yorkshire and the Isle of Anglesey, with the advice also helping to form plans at new sites. </p>

<p>Darren Moorcroft, RSPB head of species and habitats conservation, said: “It is an excellent opportunity to develop habitats for nature in need of our help, showcasing how a renewable energy business and wildlife conservation can be delivered in unison; whilst providing clean energy and sustainable development we can still continue to give nature a home.” </p>

<p>He added: “We’re interested in renewable energy because the threat of climate change is the biggest threat to nature and to people. </p>

<p>“The opportunity of this partnership is both mitigation and adaptation. The panels are helping us to reduce our carbon emissions and the habitat within the solar farms can create the places for priority species to live and survive and thrive.” </p>

<p>Adrian Pike, chief executive of Anesco, said: “Encouraging biodiversity has always been a priority for us and we’re thrilled to be working with such a respected and knowledgeable organisation as the RSPB to build on our existing commitment. </p>

<p>“We will be maximising the positive impact that our sites have for local wildlife, while focusing on supporting those species that really need it.”</p>

Pelty of plants grow in the shade. Even grasses. And light from the glare of adjoining solar panels would be significant on a bright day

If the sunlight is being 'gathered ' and therefore not reaching the plants or the ground or if the plants put the solar panels in the shade and therefore reduced the power they can produce .

This is a very good idea. There is potentially great benefit for biodiversity from vegetation around these solar farms, which can potentially be similar to species rich grass meadows of the past. By 1984 we'd lost an incredible 97% of our species rich grassland since the WW2 because of the intensification of agriculture. This meant massive declines in the birds, insects and plants which relied on these habitats. Most farmland is intensively farmed to produce as much yield and profit as possible, so we need to create as much of this type of habitat in the countryside as is possible.http://www.lancswt.org.uk/south-pennines-grasslands

In practice, there is a fair bit of space between the rows of panels, so that the ground beneath is in partial shade rather than total shade, on the whole. Some grass grows although not at anywhere near the same rate as in a open field. Grazing is ok to keep that grass down, but you'd have to stock at a hugely lower density, or just run the beasts through occasionally.Where this does have potential is in allowing some interesting marginal ecosystems to emerge - the kind of thing you'd get in woodland clearings or around traditional hedgerows. There are lots of species that have suffered hugely from loss of these kinds of habitats, and it would be great if this potential was used to help them to recover somewhat.

It's not a planning issue matter. There are plenty of solar parks on 3 & 2 land. It's a great waste. And none of them have any built-in provision for decommissioning.

Does this grading relate back to the sixties? Here in the south west, there seems to be a lot solar panel farming land that with improvements would be very productive.

You still use about half the land area and reduce the efficacy of the LULUCF of the terrain.

Many such projects are going ahead - in the far SW of England (Cornwall) there are ever growing amounts on commercial roof space. Unfortunately, building on roofs is much more expensive, especially if the electricity isn't being used on site.



Author::::Matthew2012
DateTime::::2016-03-07T14:24:15Z
Should be made compulsory with no need to rent out the land at all. The roof space is unused and as compensation you let them use the produced energy for free.

Some of the stats are truly astounding that they throw around. My favourite is the extrapolation of the worst wind turbine in the world. First they decide that there will have been more than half the killed birds will have been taken away by other creatures with absolutely no basis for their numbers.

Using elevated solar panel farms to accommodate grazing and meadow lands for the improvement to the entire eco-system is a obvious win win and should have been mandatory when the industrial sized solar farms were established previously.

Good idea as far as it goes, but couldn't huge commercial and manufacturing companies with vast south and south west facing roofs lease or lend them to solar farmers instead of using agricultural land? Supermarket and car manufacturing company roofs would be ideal, for example,

We're not talking about general farmers' sites here though- this is a scheme adopted by Anesco for their own sites. With a presumable agreed land-use charge between them and the landowner they can implement wild flower planting if they want and the landowner won't care as they still get their payment.It could set an example for other big schemes as well, which would be great.

Sheep can be grazed within a wildlife habitat. Not as intensively as grass of course. You need a shepherd and a couple of dogs.

Author::::Abusedbythestate

yes, there is - there are huge EU subsidies for landowners to turn their land back to natural wildlife habitats - you knew that really didn't you - you know there's no way a landowner would do anything that improves the environment unless there's some great big tax-payer funded subsidy from the EU. Anyway, at least the chance of sugar mountains and wine lakes for now are a thing of the past.

I understand that sheep will be grazing the solar panel paddocks, so will keep the grassland down.I see some solar panels as using up valuable productive arable land and really should stand in places that are poor farmland.

Hmmm. Intersting. Call me Mr Cynical but part of the sales pitch to landowners back in the day, apart from the obvious money, was that they could still claim SFP subsidy on the land occupied by the solar array because Sheep could still be grazed under them. A win win situation for them.

A transparent solar panel is by definition wasting incident energy.

Once these transparent solar panels are perfected, surely we have the chance to unload the Ark and reboot Nature. Same with wind farms, wildlife can live around them. Renewables by definition need open air and light to work and don't create pollution so there is no reason why wildlife can't find a home in the power stations of the future once we iron out any drawbacks. Brilliant.

I assume they are recently constructed? The grassland will be "churned up" as the government has changed the various support mechanisms, meaning that there is a "rush" to construct projects over the past winter. Over time the grass will grow back, and because of the way many such sites are managed the ecology will bounce back and ultimately improve.

Instead of solar "farms" we need decentralize solutions.They would prevent the wildlife far more than over sized projects where the energy has to travel .

I did some work on the planning policy angle of this a while back. Once the sites have been in place for a few years, the ground beneath can actually form some quite rich and interesting habitats. It's basically partial shade, similar to woodland margins, and if it's managed right it can support a lot of otherwise rare species. I really applaud this initiative, the potential is huge for some species that have been badly hit by contemporary farming practices.



Author::::RolloSnook

There are a quite a few between Bristol and Cheltenham. The ground is churned up and grassless underneath them, so I assume this is about dwelling the animals rather than feeding them. The main species I see around the farms are magpies and rabbits, a few gulls here and there.
