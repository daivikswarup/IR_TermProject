US 'likely culprit' of global spike in methane emissions over last decade




DateTime::::2016-02-17T13:35:19+0000



<p>There was a huge global spike in one of the most potent greenhouse gases driving climate change over the last decade, and the U.S. may be the biggest culprit, according a new Harvard University <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL067987/abstract">study</a>.</p>

<p>The United States alone could be responsible for between 30-60% of the global growth in human-caused atmospheric methane emissions since 2002 because of a 30% spike in methane emissions across the country, the study says.</p>

<p>The research shows that emissions increased the most in the middle of the country, but the authors said there is too little data to identify specific sources. However, the increase occurred at the same time as America’s shale oil and gas boom, which has been associated with large amounts of methane leaking from oil and gas wells and pipelines nationwide.</p>

<p>“I’d say the biggest takeaway is that there is more we — the US — could be doing to reduce our methane emissions to combat climate change,” said study lead author <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~aturner/contact.html">Alex Turner</a>, a Harvard University chemical engineering PhD candidate.</p>

<p>The Aliso Canyon gas leak in California, which was plugged last week after a nearly four-month effort to contain it, has brought new attention to methane. The gas is roughly 86 times as potent as carbon dioxide as a driver of climate change over a period of 20 years, or 35 times as potent over the span of a century. The Aliso leak spewed enough methane into the atmosphere to equal the greenhouse gases emitted by more than <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.latimes.com/science/la-me-porter-ranch-greenhouse-20160124-story.html">440,000 cars</a> in a year.</p>

<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency is trying to rein in methane emissions from oil and gas operations, and has proposed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/epa-regulate-oil-gas-methane-emissions-19347">new rules</a> to curb them from oil and gas wells. The Obama administration’s climate action plan seeks to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by up to 45% below 2012 levels by 2025.</p>

<p>Global methane emissions have risen and fallen several times since the 1980s, Turner said, but they’ve been rising continuously since 2007.</p>

<p>“The causes for this renewed growth are currently unknown,” he said,</p>

<p>In the US, the government tally of the country’s annual human-caused methane emissions between 2002 and 2012 shows that emissions have been about 29 million metric tons annually, without any significant trends up or down. Research by Turner’s team, however, showed that emissions ranged from about 39 million tons to about 52 million tons during that period. The team based its findings on satellite data.</p>

<p>The Harvard study, published last week in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, adds to mounting <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-methane-emissions-drastically-higher-than-thought-says-study-16777">research</a> that shows that the government’sdata on methane emissions is not consistent with observations made by universities and other institutions.</p>

<p>The official tally, taking what is known as a “bottom-up” approach, calculates methane emissions based on expected leak rates at oil and gas well sites, not actual measurements. The Harvard researchers used a “top-down” method, calculating emissions based on actual satellite measurements, showing that US methane emissions are far greater than those estimated by the government.</p>

<p>Turner said he and other researchers are working with the EPA to reconcile those differences.</p>

<p>“Both the bottom-up and top-down communities are trying to understand the sources of methane, but the different methods have different strengths, and we are working on making them more compatible,” he said.</p>

<p>EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones said the Harvard study adds to a wide body of new research about how to best quantify methane emissions. The EPA is reviewing those studies, she said.</p>

<p>With the US responsible for as much as 60% of global methane emissions growth, it’s critical that the country reduce natural gas use as quickly as possible, said <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu/people/faculty/robert-howarth.cfm">Robert Howarth</a>, a Cornell University ecologist and methane researcher who is unaffiliated with the Harvard study. Failing to do so could jeopardise commitments made as part of the Paris climate agreement’s goal of keeping global warming to below 2C.</p>

<p>“There is simply no way to do that by reducing carbon dioxide emissions alone because of lags in the climate system,” he said. “Even with major carbon dioxide emission reductions starting now, the planet would reach 1.5C in 12 years and 2C in 35 years. But the planet responds much more rapidly to methane, so a reduction in methane emissions now would slow the rate of global warming immediately.”</p>

<p>Howarth said the Turner team’s study is consistent with his own research.</p>

<p>“I believe the US probably is responsible for this much of an increase in global methane emissions,” Howarth said. “And, the increase almost certainly must be coming from the fracking and from the increase in use of natural gas.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/pierrehumbert">Raymond Pierrehumbert</a>, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Oxford who is unaffiliated with the Harvard study, said its findings are useful, but don’t mean much for climate change in the long run.</p>

<p>“It is always useful to know what the emissions of various greenhouse gases are, but methane is still just a sideshow, and relative to what the US. needs to do to fulfill its Paris commitments with regard to keeping the warming under 2C, even a substantial upward revision of methane leakage is almost completely irrelevant,” he said. “The warming due to steady methane emissions essentially stops increasing after just two decades, and is largely reversible once the leakage stops.” </p>

Sir_Charles, your second reference is not exactly an unbiased, objective source is it? The Howarth paper that originally raised this issue of gas leakage at fracking sites in the US causing gas CCGT to have the same or worse carbon footprint than thermal coal was very weak indeed - even the simple arithmetic was questionable.

"emission per $GDP" is just nonsense. The climate system doesn't care how many $ you produce. And BTW China. That's just an outsourcing of pollution. You can start complaining about China when you stop buying their products. Will become a hard life then. And China is probably introducing stricter regulations than US America.

Also shale gas emissions only become comparable to coal when the ridiculous level of 7% fugitive emissions of methane is applied.

Yes I am aware of the problem, which is why I get so pi******d off at people who claim they know what THE problem is. Phosphorous has been on the radar for at least 5 years to my knowledge, and I am famous for being slow on the uptake.What we clearly seem to be missing from the equation are the "Project Managers" who put all this stuff on a white board the size of Mont Blanc and get all the scientist beavers focused on the areas we still haven't thought about.We are beyond computer models and out the other side.Now we need good old deductive processes that only the human brain can provide.Where do we find these brains?Nowhere near the corridors of power of the halls of commerce that's for sure, we need problem solvers NOT problem creators

Reversible in terms of the direct radiative forcing effects. Though as you point out, not in terms of any tipping point effects but you rightly used the word 'if' as we probably won't know until too late if/when each tipping point is past.
