UK's wildlife crime unit wins late reprieve from closure




DateTime::::2016-03-01T11:43:08+0000



<p>The UK’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nwcu.police.uk/">national wildlife crime unit</a> (NWCU) has won a late reprieve from closure after the government announced new funding on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The specialist unit tackles wildlife crime from the killing of birds of prey and poaching of deer in the UK to the smuggling of endangered reptiles, birds and elephant ivory across the globe. It was set to close at the end of March, but environment minister <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-03-01/HCWS561/">Rory Stewart announced funding for four years</a> in a statement to parliament.</p>

<p>“In recognition of the important contribution the unit makes to tackling wildlife crime, both at home and abroad, I can confirm that Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) and Home Office ministers have agreed [to] each provide funding of £136,000 a year for the next four financial years,” said Stewart. “This will give the unit significant financial stability and enable their vital work to continue until at least 2020.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/18/national-wildlife-unit-to-close-within-weeks">National wildlife crime unit facing closure within weeks</a> </p>

<p>Stewart also said Defra would provide up to £29,000 a year for four years for specific work to tackle <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/25/wildlife-crime-study-sale-online">wildlife crime carried out online</a>, a growing area of activity. The overall funding of the unit will remain at the same level as before.</p>

<p>“It’s great - I got nearly all that I asked for,” said Ch Insp Martin Sims, who leads the unit, where most of the staff faced losing their jobs. “I am really please it is a longer term settlement, which gives us stability and allows us to continue to deliver the fight against wildlife crime.” The previous settlement only covered two years.</p>

<p>“Online wildlife crime is huge, and it was a question of having the resources to deal with it,” said Sims. “The extra funding is a step in the right direction.”</p>

<p>Interpol estimates the illegal wildlife trade to be worth $10-20bn a year, the fourth most lucrative black market after drugs, people and arms smuggling and it is often linked to organised crime. The NWCU provides expert intelligence and analysis and carries out about 200 investigations a year, based on 35,000 intelligence logs.</p>

<p> Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said: “The government have finally relented and seen sense. The work that the NWCU does combating these crimes is vital. But it should not have had to come to this. The government have promised to protect the police but this whole saga shows that their words and their deeds do not match up. They had to be pushed into funding the unit.”</p>

<p>Labour’s shadow environment minister, Alex Cunningham, said: “Like the [overall] police budget, funding for the NWCU has not been protected in real terms. With 18,000 police officers lost already under David Cameron, the growing complexity of international and domestic wildlife crime will put ever greater pressure on the resources and expertise of the NWCU.”<br/>“Wildlife crimes such as hare coursing, badger baiting and persecution of birds of prey, cause immense suffering and threaten some of our most treasured wild species,” said Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International/UK said. “The essential work of this unit deserves long-term, cross-party funding commitment, so that it does not labour under the threat of closure every few years.” </p>

<p>Dominic Dyer, policy adviser for the Born Free Foundation and CEO of the Badger Trust, said: “For the government to waste over £25m killing badgers but refuse to find less than £500,000 to fund the NWCU to tackle wildlife crime would have been a national disgrace.”</p>

<p>In addition to money from Defra and the Home Office, the NWCU also receives funds from the National Police Chiefs Council, the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland administration, almost all of which has been confirmed.</p>

That is good to hear...not the case where I live. I reported illegal poaching of deer and it was just brushed off as 'one of those things'.

The arguement remains the same-the value would still only be that of a couple of highly paid executives, and is not enough to fund any substantive work-especially given the level of specialism required for some of it

I met a couple of wildlife crime officers at a wildlife fair last year here in Norfolk and must say they were dedicated to the cause and very enthusiastic about their job had a long and interesting conversation with them.

You wonder why the government took so long to confirm what is fairly paltry funding in the overall scheme of things. I wonder if it was a message not to bite the hand that feeds it. Undoubtedly most of those behind the illegal killing of birds of prey like Hen Harriers, support the Conservative Party. In fact those behind it are the backbone of the Conservative Party, the wealthy and often titled landowners.

So you are saying that because foxes are not endangered so it is ok for them to be ripped to pieces by criminal sadists? If you do some serious research you`ll see that the local police record enforcing the hunting act is a national disgrace.Hunt sabs often risk their lives confronting the blood crazed hunters and cronies doing the `local police's job.

Good news but until the judiciary and plod start taking wildlife crime seriously at all levels then not much will change. Far too many landowners, gamekeepers, hunts etc are riding roughshod over legislation and getting away with it.

Actually, i am afraid your figures are entirely wrong, even though the point may not be invalid.Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) and Home Office ministers have agreed [to] each provide funding of £136,000 a year for the next four financial years. The important word is 'each' so the funding is at it's present level of around £500.000.

Actually it costs around 15 quid to kill 20 badgers.

Foxhunting is in no way anywhere near as important as tackling the trade in endangered species.

This is so true, a lot of humans still believe that all the animals and plant life on earth is there for them to do as they wish. Most humans don't even realise or believe that they themselves are animals.

Funding is terrible and why is it not a permanent unit ? why only four years ? As usual the tories do the bare minimum when it comes to wildlife protection and the environment in general.

This is because there are more conservative farmers who do not listen to scientific arguments but who do vote in the conservative government-thus only their vote matters, and badgers (especially dead ones) don't vote-and most free thinking people are unlikely to vote conservative (as the party currently stands) so anything to get voters will be approved.

Stop and look at the figures here-this is a symbolic gesture alone, the budget is too low for the unit to fulfill any useful functionYes, it is progress that the unit was not closed-but the annual funding is less than £136,000 annually-which is less than the salary of one high paid politician-now remember that wildlife trade is global criminal trade and is organised by criminal gangs and annually valued at US$300 billion globally,-this is not an insignificant issue, infact it’s the fourth Most Lucrative Illegal Trade in the World.

Great news. Now here's hoping that they actually tackle wildlife crime and don't leave the hard work to the RSPCA and League Against Cruel Sports. Too many hunt saboteurs and hunt monitors reporting wildlife crime by hunts killing foxes ( and other animals) are harassed by local forces protecting the illegal hunts.

No, it's there to stop crime committed by wildlife - except badgers who've had special arrangements made for them by the Government.

No - it's £136k per year from DEFRA and another £136k from the Home Office - ie, £272k. Here's the relevant quote:

That money doesn't go on wages. Officers are seconded to the NWU and still get paid by their original Constabulary. As far as i'm aware there isn't a civilian employee in the unit, it's all police officers.

It's a sad element of human nature that they cannot see other species as existing purely in their own right. Humans only see other species in relation to how they benefit humans.

Well said, just go to Facebook and look at the group "Ban hunt saboteurs" if you want to know what the true attitude of these people is stripped of the spin. They believe this country is theirs and the majority is only here to serve them. The killing of wildlife is a ritual of ownership along with trampling the peasants gardens whilst they whinny about property rights and the oiks who dare to try to uphold the law.

Read "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep", if you haven't already, one of the proven prophets of our time (by the extreme rate of recycling of his narratives into culture through film and TV), clearly identifying our alienation from and destruction of animals and their habitats as being the thing that will ultimately affect the psyche of the human race most of all. This (protection of what wildlife we have left and the rights of animals to life and habitat generally) is of paramount political importance and not a minor side issue. As far as we know this Earth, which is not just our home but the home of all life on this planet is the home of all life in this universe and we exploit (destroy) it for central heating and the right to 'prosperity'. I see Chinese people slamming dogs to the ground to kill them for a tasty soup, American setting traps and hunting wolves and game around the world (Cecil) a general lack of respect for animals. I see places I knew as a child teeming with life in my own beautiful Britain, dead and gone, and everybody shrugs their shoulders like it's inevitable, or makes a joke out of it, because they don't know what they and their offspring are about to lose.
