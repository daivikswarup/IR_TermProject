MIT researchers turn waste gas into liquid fuel




DateTime::::2016-03-07T20:00:01+0000



<p>Turning the emissions of power stations, steel mills and garbage dumps into liquid fuels has been demonstrated by MIT researchers using engineered microbes. </p>

<p>The process has been successfully trialled at a pilot plant in China and a much bigger facility is now planned.</p>

<p>Energy-dense liquids are vital to transport but are currently derived from oil, a fossil fuel, and transport produces about a quarter of the global carbon emissions driving climate change. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biofuels">Biofuels</a> have been seen as possible replacement, but current biofuels compete with food production and have been blamed for driving up food prices.</p>

<p>Using waste gases to create low-carbon liquid fuels would be a major advance in the battle against global warming if they could be made at low cost and large scale. Another company expects to be using different microbes to produce fuel from steel plants in Belgium and China in 2017.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) process uses bacteria to convert the waste gases into acetic acid - vinegar - then an engineered yeast to produce an oil. “It is quite an extraordinary story,” said Prof Gregory Stephanopoulos, an expert in chemical engineering and biotechnology at MIT in the US.</p>

<p>“It started just four to five years ago with a post-doctoral project funded by the US Energy Department. We are looking at a very fast timescale [of development],”, he said. “We have pieced the system together into an integrated system, where you put gas in one end and get a liquid fuel out of the other end.” The research was published on Monday in the journal <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1516867113">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>

<p>The patents for the process are owned by MIT and have been licensed to GTL Biofuel Inc. Its pilot plant outside Shanghai ran successfully from September 2015 and a larger “semi-commercial’ demonstration plant, 20 times the size, is set to begin construction.</p>

<p>This will test if the process can be scaled up and evaluate its costs and carbon footprint, said Prof Stephanopoulos: “It is one thing to do it on a scale of 1-2 litres in the lab, but a different story to move up 1,000 litres and then 20,000 litres in the demonstration plant.”</p>

<p>“The bottom line, if one is aiming at making fuels from renewable resources, is we need to look very carefully at low-cost feed stocks,” he said. Garbage, along with manure and farm waste, is a particularly promising source of the “syngas” required, he said: “The volumes are staggering.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, using the gas from municipal waste reduces the carbon footprint of the liquid fuel, compared to exhaust gases from fossil fuel plants. </p>

<p>Prof Stephanopoulos said there are already thousands of biogas sites across Europe, but he argues the current practice of burning this gas to produce electricity is wasteful: “It is very costly and can only survive due to subsidies.” Better, he said, is to use the gas to produce fuels that can replace gasoline or diesel.</p>

<p>The MIT team are not the only people developing biotechnologies to turn exhaust gases into fuels. Like MIT, the US company <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lanzatech.com/">Lanzatech</a> uses microbes that can ferment gases into more complex molecules, a skill originally evolved so the bacteria could thrive at bubbling, hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.</p>

<p>Lanzatech’s processes aim to produce either fuel or chemicals useful in industry. The company <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/13/worlds-largest-steel-company-to-use-rabbit-gut-microbe-to-cut-emissions">is currently building commercial units in Belgium</a> with ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker; in China with Capital Steel and in Taiwan with China Steel, with the first unit expected to enter service in 2017. Another US company, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://calysta.com/">Catalysta</a>, is working on converting methane into hydrocarbon fuels.</p>

There's no shortage of CO2, even in quite concentrated form

It sounds great but some care is needed: this demonstrates some good work on modifying bacteria to more efficiently recycle power station emissions.

Lazy science journalism: you just wait for press releases to come in from places like MIT, then you misinterpret them and transmit them to the public.

There's no shortage of CO2, even in quite concentrated form, from industrial processes that make it as a by-product. The question is, where does the ENERGY come from? There isn't any chemical energy left in waste gases from power stations, so you need to put energy in to make get fuel out. Waste heat is too low temperature, whilst if you use electricity you are losing energy making it back into fuel again, whilst most electricity is still being made by burning fuels.

Well thanks for the answer David, I'll reserve judgement:

No! They will follow profit rather than new technology.

Thanks for this, James; my view is that while this development might be a step towards sustainability, it is not *the* whole answer.

If fossil fuels emissions are creating so much uncertainty about the environment, then more research on alternative fuels is highly welcome!

Now that research is discovering new ways, will oil refineries invest in supporting this research in order to improve results and apply them to new technology?

All this sounds just great!. Technology can improve a lot our use of resources and protect the environment.

An easy misunderstanding - the technique is intended to turn those wastre gases into fuel. So - not as dirty, that's for sure.

Hey David thanks for the detailed response, I like long responses.Some comments:

These are basically oil refineries which aim to take in crude oil and output refined oil. During this process, some of the product vaporises. That makes it highly flammable and dangerous. It also occupies a lot of volume.

If you burn fossil fuels and get fuel from the exhaust using bacteria, all you do it slow the fossil fuel emission slightly:

What's in the waste gases? Are they as dirty as in the photo accompanying the article? Knowing the Guardian's (mis-)use of stock photos, I guess not. Does this process mainly convert CO2, or other gases?

If large plants are inefficient, can't you have many plants running in parallel?

There will always be gas flaring from rigs or platforms where oil or gas is being produced.In an emergency, or when a vessel or pipework becomes overpressured, the excess pressure from the gas has to be sent, via safety relief valves and pipework, to somewhere 'safe'. A cloud of gas suddenly venting to atmosphere would provide an explosive mixture that could ignite with devastating consequences, hence the need to burn it as it leaves the flare tower. A flame has to be continually maintained at the flare tower, usually from low pressure gas venting from other parts of the process.Most platforms use excess gas to power gas turbines and create their own electrical power. No need for the intermediate steam.

Good luck to them. It looks like a low likelihood that it will be a commercial success. But technology and our lives drive forward when such "moonshots" pay off.

It'll be interesting to see how this scales up. I've heard that there is a relatively small maximum size that you can get any single unit of this sort of to scale up to before you start to severely lose efficiency, anyone know if that would be the case with this particular process.

Expensive process.

I have always wondered why there are all these burn offs on oil rigs that could be turned into a source of fuel to power small steam generators to create electricity. Of course they would need to be isolated as there are a lot of inflammable materials around but if there are flames shooting out it cannot be that difficult.

Well, 20,000 litres (a day?) sounds like a lot, but that's just 125 barrels of oil. Multiply by 10,000 and you're still only at 1.3% of the daily oil consumption.

Hydrogen has a few problems in terms of fuel use.It's very explosive - remember the Hindenberg? Storage is a drama. Creating the hydrogen from feedstock requires a fair bit of energy. The distribution is tricky, and would entail another set of plugs for fueling and tanks for storage, multiplying the infrastructure requirements.

It was an honest comment so why your dismissive tone. What it does show is someone thinking, which is way more than I can say about the denialists. I think therefore I am. (Descartes)

Yes, Hydrogen works, but the problem is the efficency. You can't use electrolyses (sorry if spelled wrong, not native english speaker), because of the lacking efficency, if higher poweroutput is needed. Therfore you need to burn it, and since using electrolysis in large scale is not efficient (I think15-20), you are cooling the air, which uses also WAY to much energy (around 25-30% efficency). And since you are using again the process of buring the stuff, you get an overall efficiency of about 10-15%.

I could never understand the reasons for flaring off waste flammable gases at oil refineries either. That practice seems a terrible of energy and contribution to climate change.
