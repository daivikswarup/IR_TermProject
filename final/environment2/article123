<p>The glittering <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas">Las Vegas</a> strip is not an obvious model for energy conservation.<br/></p>

<p> Yet hidden above the glowing Eiffel Tower, neon resort awnings and a black pyramid that shines a beam of light into space, is one of the largest rooftop solar arrays in the country.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/solar-panel-energy-power-company-nevada">Nevada solar industry collapses after state lets power company raise fees</a> </p>

<p>Twenty acres of sun-catching glass sit atop the Mandalay Bay convention center, and when new installations are complete, it will become the<em> </em>biggest rooftop solar array in the US.</p>

<p>In recent months, three of Nevada’s largest casino companies – MGM Resorts, Wynn, and Las Vegas Sands – have announced plans to buy and produce more renewable energy for their hotels, a move driven both by increasing demand for responsible energy use from the companies that rent their conference halls, and a surplus of cheap power from solar farms in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nevada">Nevada</a> and California.</p>

<p> “It’s no accident that we put the array on top of a conference center. This is good business for us,” said Cindy Ortega, chief sustainability officer at MGM Resorts. “We are looking at leaving the power system, and one of the reasons for that is we can procure more renewable energy on the open market.”</p>

<p>But there is<strong> </strong>a big shadow lurking over a rapid greening of the Las Vegas strip. Regulators will not let casinos simply walk away from the state’s monopoly utility provider, NV <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a>.</p>

<p> Together, the casinos’ 15 properties account for 7% of NV Energy’s electricity sales, and if that income were lost, the utility says, its remaining customers would have to endure significant rate hikes. As a result, the public utility commission (PUC) of Nevada is demanding resorts pay tens of millions of dollars to leave NV Energy’s services, a December 2015 decision which one casino has appealed.</p>

<p> Las Vegas’s power drama captures <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/23/nevada-solar-power-industry-workers-customers-costs-solarcity-elon-musk">an ongoing dilemma</a> in the new energy economy. While corporations have been encouraged to go green, their efforts pass the burden of subsidizing old utility regimes on to retail consumers, which regulators cannot allow.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">It’s no accident that we put the [solar] array on top of a conference center. This is good business for us</p>

<p> “They need to maintain the grid. You cannot let these utilities go bankrupt or else every business in the city dies,” said Bill Ellard, an energy economist for the American Solar Energy Society. “What will happen if they don’t maintain the grid properly and the transformers blow?”</p>

<p> In December, Nevada’s three-member PUC <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/solar-panel-energy-power-company-nevada">effectively destroyed</a> a thriving rooftop solar industry by approving NV Energy’s request to drastically lower the rate at which solar users are compensated for excess energy they provide to the grid.</p>

<p> “This is what I call a death spiral for utilities,” said Ellard. “They make it hard to go solar because once you defect from them, that affects revenue. Then they increase rates on everybody else, forcing them to defect.”</p>

<p>MGM Resorts has already hurt utility profits though an ambitious energy conservation effort. In addition to building a solar array strong enough to power 1,000 homes for one year, the corporation is replacing 1.3m light bulbs in its properties with LEDs.</p>

<p> But to power multi-thousand-room resorts which house nightclubs, pools, theaters and slot machine-packed casinos would require more solar panels than the companies have rooftop space. They are consequently joining a trend in<strong> </strong>big energy consumers requesting to buy electricity outside the utility system.</p>

<p> “They are all very concerned with their bottom lines,” said Rebecca Wagner, a former member of Nevada’s PUC. “The energy market in the west is great right now, so they are seeking to curb costs by getting in that market.”</p>

<p> Cheap natural gas is probably driving the <strong>i</strong>nitiative more than anything else, Wagner says. But according to Ellard, the antipathy casinos have for NV Energy’s monopoly also previews the next phase in an energy economy where renewables are competitive with fossil fuel prices.</p>

<p> “It’s complex because it’s not just electricity,” he said. “It’s natural gas, wind, coal, smart grid, big data, oil – it’s all connected. We’re at this next change point where wind and solar [battery] storage and smart software are going to start to replace all those energy sources.”</p>

<p> If the resorts do decide to separate from NV Energy, it will still cost them a combined $126.5m, a price set by the PUC which they say is necessary to prevent broad consumer rate hikes and to compensate the utility provider for losses incurred on power plants and other assets purchased with casino demand in mind.</p>

<p> The resorts have complained that this “exit fee” is too high – and perhaps even illegal. “The PUC has simply made up rules as it goes along so as to discourage any applicants from exiting [NV Energy’s] service,” Wynn lawyers stated in a January judicial appeal. (MGM and the Las Vegas Sands are considering their options.)</p>

<p>Wynn’s president, Matthew Maddox, also noted in PUC testimony that NV Energy is owned by Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (based in Omaha, Nebraska), and is therefore, in his estimation, more concerned with maximizing profits than with maintaining Nevada’s grid. Maddox pointed out that their<strong> </strong>money doesn’t even stay in Nevada, saying: “it goes to Omaha”.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Nevadans are subsidizing NV Energy’s green investments while it lobbies against private rooftop solar installations</p>

<p> Data storage company Switch faced a similar situation last year when it announced plans to use 100% renewable energy to power its giant computer servers. NV Energy was not able to meet those energy demands, and the PUC said the company would have to pay $27m to break up with the utility provider since its large data centers amounted to nearly 3% of NV Energy’s electricity sales. As a compromise, Switch is paying the utility company to build a new solar array in North Las Vegas to meet their sustainability goals.</p>

<p> The city of Las Vegas, too, is planning to use 100% renewable energy to power its municipal buildings, fire stations, city parks and streetlights by 2017. That would make Las Vegas the largest US city to achieve such a goal. But to get PUC approval, it also had to promise to buy most of the power from an NV Energy solar plant in nearby Boulder City. Nevadans are thus subsidizing NV Energy’s green investments while it lobbies against private rooftop solar installations by their customers.</p>

<p> MGM Resorts’s sustainability chief, Ortega, would not comment on her company’s wrangling with NV Energy and the PUC. But she did endorse the broad push toward sustainability as a way to combat notions that Sin City lacks a conscience. “The more we can dispel the myths around Las Vegas the better destination it is,” Ortega said.</p>

<p> “We have the ability to educate a wide variety of stakeholders on how we can exponentially reduce environmental impacts,” she added. “Las Vegas is the perfect place to do that because we have 40 million people come here every single year, and so what better place to start telling that story.”</p>

You asked a good question. Depends on how much you are willing to invest. Like anything else, the better quality the batteries, the more they cost. Those better batteries won't have to be replaced for twenty years or more if maintained properly. As I said before, depends on your needs. My own are relatively small. I would consider the solar panels the least of the cost. A good MPPT charge controller can go from $230.00 to $700.00 or more. Again, depends on your needs. Golf cart style deep cycle batteries are the least expensive over all. I use them extensively so far with no problems. Keeping in mind that I live in the desert and the sun shines most of the time. Therefore they don't get fully cycled (sucked dry of power) very often. I could go on and on. You need to calculate your needs verses the infrastructure (solar system) that you will require to support it. Some people find out that their needs outrun the cost of investing in a stand alone solar system. There are still plenty of options. The key, like anything else in life, is to educate yourself. Otherwise, the so called know it all' will clean your clock, if you catch my drift. I am not a rocket scientist or even a college graduate, but I know what works and what does not. Sometimes self education goes a long way. When you educate yourself, there are no boundaries or rules to what you can learn and figure out. I would highly suggest everyone get started, if they have not already;)

Follow around some of their trucks, some of their admin and look at the billing waste that sucks money in from consumers without really creating electricity. They have had a monopoly for decades and have gotten bloated. Trim at the office before putting a stranglehold on eco-energy.

The tax payers are getting screwed by Warren Buffet. He is fueled by greed. He doesn't give a rats about the people his utility is squeezing cash out of. The casinos are the only ones with a enough cash to defend themselves and fight. In the end, the casinos and Buffets utility will settle, leaving the citizens of Nevada getting the shaft.

What NV Energy has is basically a monopoly and does not like seeing its influence eroded. Shouldn't forcing companies to pay exhorbitant fines for leaving be illegal?

Every company should be allowed to generate its electricity and the smaller customers should be served by numerous still smaller companies.The problem here is that one single energy company(NV energy service) is allowed to serve all big and small customers.So there is monopoly and there is chaos when some business houses like Casinos tries to go out of the grid.But there cannot be monopoly.At a time when the world have gone smaller in terms of consumer affairs particularly ,so how can you expect N V energy services to have a monopoly after all,and that too in the business of solar energy?? Every body should have a right to electricity because it is a fundamental property and there should be no monopoly.

This article amazed me, I worked for Pacific Gas and Electric out of California and there quite a huge utility. I know for a fact that they encourage solar energy for its clients. Here's the simple fact of this matter, they will continue to make money on exactly what was stated. The entire grid needs to be maintained. Here's a breakdown, clients need to be provided with customer service representatives, to explain their issue that customer service rep passes that on to the right department. Emergency dispatch for downed power lines, broken poles, blown transformers etc. Or new start of service or end of service. There are lineman who have to drive out and go underground, trenches the list goes on. Let me get to the point that is a business expense for LV Energy, they could have been investing into green energy such as PG&E with wind technology, wave technology (bouys in the ocean here's a link)http://scitechdaily.com/floating-power-buoy-creates-electricity-from-ocean-waves/They could have also invested in their own solar farm we always pass that new one on the way to Vegas from California. True to the fact stated earlier Warren Buffet is part owner and he sees no need to invest in something he won't be able to profit anymore from hence the high exit fees for the businesses trying to leave the grid. It's shamefully to extort the casino's based on the immense amount they have profited over how many decades? I honestly think that the exit costs should be put to a statewide vote. That's like saying we're going to charge you a tax if you buy and ride a bike instead of your car because we're losing on the income from your fuel purchases in the future even though it's better for the environment. Thanks for reading.

Solution: Levy a tax against sunshine. Nevada is mostly open space and the sun shines during 85% of daylight hours. The state of NV and NV Energy ought to be collaborating to stop burning hydrocarbons to generate electricity and build 1000 sq mi of solar arrays. BTW, is the electricity NV gets from the Hoover Dam (not mentioned above) considered 'green'?

Why didn't these energy companies develop plans ahead of this instead of reacting afterward. There's no problem with solar customers paying to support the grid. It's not fair to make them pay the cost of maintaining coal fired generating stations that should have been on the way to phase out. American businesses are pitiful. Instead of adapting they run whining to their bought and paid for politicians while mouthing platitudes about letting the market work.
