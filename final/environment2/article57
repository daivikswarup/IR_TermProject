Chile's salmon farms lose $800m as algal bloom kills millions of fish




DateTime::::2016-03-10T13:01:01+0000



<p>A deadly algal bloom has hit the world’s second biggest salmon exporter, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chile">Chile</a>, where nearly 23 million fish have already died and the economic impact from lost production has soared to $800m (£565m), industry and government sources told Reuters.</p>

<p>The dead fish could easily fill 14 Olympic-sized swimming pools, said Jose Miguel Burgos, the head of the government’s Sernapesca fisheries body. </p>

<p>Unusually high ocean temperatures, due in large part to the El Niño weather phenomenon, have fuelled the algal bloom that has affected 37 of the nearly 415 salmon farms operating in southern Chile. Most of the farms are in ocean enclosures or estuaries. </p>

<p>“Temperatures are 2 to 4C above average for this time of the year, there’s a lot of sunlight, a lack of rain and very mild winds, all of which are conditions for the micro algae to appear,” said Burgos. <br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/what-is-el-nino">El Niño leads to hotter sea temperatures in the west Pacific Ocean</a>, which means more rain falls on South America and less in Australia and south-east Asia. But for Liesbeth van der Meer, who heads the Oceana environmental group in Chile, run-off from neighbouring livestock creates concentrations of nitrogen that when mixed with the above-normal temperatures, create the ideal scenario for the algae to grow. </p>

<p>Salmon farms near the southern city of Puerto Montt and the Chiloé island have borne the brunt of the toxic algal bloom. </p>

<p>Producers Marine Harvest, Australis Seafoods, Compania Pesquera Camanchaca, Blumar, Multiexport Foods, Cermaq Group AS and Empresas AquaChile have all seen some of their salmon farms affected, according to data provided by the Economy Ministry and company filings with Chile’s SVS securities regulator. </p>

<p>“The loss is likely equivalent to somewhere between 15 and 20% of Chile’s total production for the year ... the forecast for 2016 was around 750,000 to 760,000 tonnes but now that’s reduced to around 650,000 tonnes,” said Burgos. </p>

<p>The 100,000 tonnes in lost production, which includes Atlantic salmon, Coho and trout, is equivalent to some $800m in exports, he added. </p>

<p>Chile, the second largest salmon producer after Norway, last year exported $4.5bn of farmed salmon, on 800,000 tonnes of shipments. </p>

<p>Additionally, the situation will likely lead to job losses in the sector, according to industry group SalmonChile. </p>

<p>Cutting their losses, producers convert fish that can be saved into fishmeal, while the fish killed by the algal bloom are not destined for human consumption, the group added. </p>

<p>The latest blow to the local industry comes as Chile’s salmon farmers are using record levels of antibiotics to treat a virulent and pervasive bacteria, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-salmon-antibiotics-feature-idUSKCN0PX1IG20150723">driving away some US retailers</a>.</p>

Fishing and fish farming are inhumane and environmentally reckless. Here is a much better way: stop eating fish. All of the nutrients we need to thrive can be obtained more healthfully, humanely, and environmentally responsibly from plant sources. These include marvelous vegan versions of virtually every type of seafood imaginable. They're better for us, for the other animals, and for the environment. They're also delicious! Google: vegan seafood resources.

They are not wild fish. Their survival in a predatory role on the natural prey of wild salmon would be unlikely. Their mass release could also impact wild fisheries. The article doesn't say if they are GM salmon, either.

These blooms must be fairly easy to predict as to where and when they will arrive. The Salmon should be released from their pens when it appears a bloom is imminent so they can at least have an opportunity to seek deeper waters.

It would be helpful to have been informed by the article as to whether the bloom was due to cyanophytes and/or rhodophytes.

You have to remember that BSE came about because fish became too expensive to feed cows so they were fed sheep instead. So fish is back on the menu for cows. This is for those who think cows eat grass!

Bacon and chicken can taste of fish.

It's more diluted in farm feeds than for aquaculture, but exporting it to China for use in piggeries would still be an issue, right?

Oh, if only there were ways to reduce antibiotic use, and also take pressure off wild stocks....

Fish meal is also used as fertilizer and as a protein ingredient in some livestock feeds.

This is a reminder that Chilean aquaculture has overtaxed the littoral ecosystem with this form of extraction which causes its own algal and dinoflagelate blooms with the fish swimming in a phosphate tide of their own excreta. Sadly, the monsters behind GMO salmon will use this as the basis for further GM salmon whose genomes have been altered with all sorts of stuff to better withstand global warming. Just give up eating fish, which should never be farmed. Cultivate and eat seaweed instead.

It would not surprise me if they intend to do so!
