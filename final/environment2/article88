Hollowed-out Defra leaves in doubt key functions, MPs say




DateTime::::2016-03-08T15:56:05+0000



<p>The gutting of the budget for the UK government’s already “hollowed-out” environment department has left in doubt key functions including flood protection, pollution, food production, farming and animal welfare, a committee of MPs has found.<br/></p>

<p>Funding for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is to be cut by 15% over the next four years. This comes on top of much deeper cuts - of about a quarter of its budget - under the previous coalition government. </p>

<p>The department, with a £2bn-a-year annual budget, is responsible for maintaining the UK’s flood defences, protecting farms against animal and plant diseases - including foot-and-mouth disease - and the UK’s waterways, seas, coast and fisheries.<br/></p>

<p>Parliament’s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmenvfru/894/894.pdf">issued a special note on Tuesday</a> questioning whether the government’s planned cuts to the department’s budget would allow it to operate effectively in the future.<br/></p>

<p>The influential committee of MPs said: “The challenges facing Defra are, first, whether the reduced budget available to it is sufficient for its task, and second how to make the correct policy choices so as to allocate smaller funds effectively.”<br/></p>

<p>They went on: “We have so far received only the barest details of how Defra intends to provide services against budget cuts over this parliament, and on whether it can find all the necessary savings from administrative efficiencies or if it will also need to alter the services it delivers or how it charges for them.”<br/></p>

<p>On key issues such as flood defences, the MPs raised concerns. For instance, the funding plan for Defra relies on the government securing £600m from external sources to meet the amounts judged necessary for putting in place new flood defences and maintaining existing ones.<br/></p>

<p>But the committee said that only £61m had been raised from private sector sources to meet these targets. Along with other sources, including local government, about £250m had been raised in total - far less than Defra’s budget allowed for.<br/></p>

<p>Commitments from the private sector, including insurers, to make up the shortfall in public sector budgets for flood defences had not been received, the committee said, leading to a worrying gap.</p>

<p>The MPs concluded: “We are concerned that Defra’s requirement to find reductions of 15% in resource budgets over the next four years may affect vital flood protection work. We recommend that Defra set out within the next three months the implications of the spending review settlement on resource budgets for maintaining flood capital assets and for undertaking routine maintenance work such as the dredging of rivers.”</p>

<p>The MPs also called for Defra to publish full results of its <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plans-to-eradicate-bovine-tb-in-england-unveiled">badger culling programme</a>, in order to establish whether it was effective in controlling the spread of bovine tuberculosis, a major problem on dairy farms.</p>

<p>The committee’s report found that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/18/badger-culls-uk-relaxes-restrictions-bovine-tb">bovine TB </a>required “a holistic approach”, including maintaining information on culling and other treatment methods, such as the vaccination strategy in effect in Northern Ireland. The MPs called for a “strong evidence base” for culling, and that Defra should take into account evidence from the devolved administrations in their management of bovine TB.</p>

But maybe England would be shamed into following Scotland's lead? Then having a Police wildlife crime unit might matter.

One observation on public vs. private sector. As far as I know anything which is not public sector is not subject to FoI legislation. The functions of what was FERA are already partly out of the public sector (a joint venture between DEFRA and a private sector supplier). I would not be totally sure what legislation would cover a partnership between the public sector and private sector, or indeed where the legislative lines are drawn in such arrangements.

Doubt landowners are that bothered, having a Police wildlife crime unit has had done very little to discourage shooting of birds of prey etc. The law doesn't tend to affect those sort of people

I think the first think we need to establish is the vacuous and shallow ultra-Thatcherite ideology of David Cameron's Conservative Party. Neither David Cameron or George Osborne are deep thinkers, and in reality they are both dangerous incompetents. Covertly Cameron and Osborne are implementing a grossly simplistic ultra-Thatcherite policy, which says government spending on anything is wrong and it should all be left to the private sector. The only reason they don't just slash the funding for the NHS or for say pensions, which is by far the biggest share of the welfare bill, is that it would make them very unpopular with Conservative voters and they'd soon get kicked out of office. If they could slash the budgets of the NHS and pensions, they'd do it tomorrow if they thought they could get away with it. But they know even for silver-tongued con-artists like them, it would be beyond their rhetorical abilities.

Hear, hear.More or less total abdication of responsibilities, thanks to over-assertive lobbying from the NFU, and clever legal minds in the City at work on keeping the agrichemical status quo, to be precise.

Yes, it has, thanks partly to the support of the petition. But we can be sure that some folk, naming no names but follow my eyes in the direction of the landowners, would prefer that the public forgets all about this Unit when its 4 year reprieve is up.

bring back the department of environment. farmers are just businesses like any other and i've no idea what 'rural affairs' are - something to do with who's screwing who in the chipping norton set maybe.

Very glad the MPs are demanding that DEFRA provides full and complete answers about its badger cull programme. Hopefully the Committee will have the clout to stop DEFRA ministers and officials evading questions, providing misinformation and simply delaying the provision of answers for as long as they can get away with it.

Thyssen Krupp, a Leeds based business, is closing down because it does not want to replace machinery ruined in the December floods when there is no guarantee of future funding for the flood defences that Leeds needs. There were flood defence plans in place for Leeds but these were cut in 2011 by the Coalition Government. That's the reality of the Northern Powerhousemyarse or, as it is now referred to in the North, Osborne's beard, to reflect that it is designed to cover up the massive transfer of public money from the North to the South.

Silly me! Just read elsewhere that funding for the unit has been secured for the next 4 years. Apologies.

Please email your MP in an attempt to save funding for the National Wildlife Crime Unit - see http://www.worldanimalprotection.org.uk/take-action-wildlife-crime-unit

Even without the Cuts that will overtake DEFRA- it has already amply demonstrated that it is not an effective organisation. But one which has clearly failed in the past and the present to serve the Interests of the electorate. It has been heavily engaged in serving its own and the vested interest politics of lobby organisations . Its political appointments and its political leadership has ensured its bypass of the necessary competency. The Badger killing exercise is a Prime example of its bypass of the available Science, and its failure to make verifiable progress towards the long term eradication of Bovine Tb in cattle. An expensive, Inhumane and ineffective exercise of Politics and its desire to serve those vested interests . It is only surprising that it it has taken Budget Cuts and this length of time for any part of Government to question its evidence base. The electorate and the experts of Science have in volume been questioning this for a considerable time. How many parts of DEFRA have remained silent , and in that silence allowed its Politics to command them . Time for a long hard look at the role of DEFRA and its many agencies and a leadership which falls well short of serving the Public requirement or its Interests. Look beyond the Badger Killing exercise to many of its other responsibilities , Flood protection , National Parks Animal Welfare and Live animal Exports to name just a few and you will find in my view similar serious failures.

Interesting that no one mentions the environment in all of this, it has sunk so low it has become the Ministry of Floods and Farmers.

Just scrap it and be done! Scrap every department of government and sell it off to ISIS or Saudi, is there a difference?Then little people will have to fend for themselves and that way they will learn how stupid they are!

Well how can they now explain the oncoming scapegoat badger cull which has already costs the country millions, all for nothing other to appease their badger hating NFU friends?

DEFRA, Truss and Cameron are puppets for the NFU. The sooner Cameron and gidieon goes the better, the two crooks have been terrible for our environment.
