British opposition to fracking still outstrips support, survey finds




DateTime::::2016-02-02T12:31:13+0000



<p>Opposition to fracking continues to outstrip support - particularly among those who know about the controversial process, a survey for the government shows. </p>

<p>More than half (53%) of those who said they knew a lot about fracking were against it, compared to a third (33%) who said they were in favour of it, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/496961/wave_16_Summary_of_key_findings.pdf">the latest poll tracking attitudes to energy policies</a> has revealed. </p>

<p>Among those who thought they knew a little about it, opposition outstripped support by 40% to 26%, the survey for the Department of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> and Climate Change found.</p>

<p>Opposition was also higher than support among all those who were quizzed for the survey, with 29% opposed and 23% backing extraction of shale gas through fracking. Women were more likely to be opposed to it than men, with only 17% backing fracking, compared to 28% of men. </p>

<p>The weak support for shale gas is in contrast to the backing the public shows for renewables, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government">which have faced cuts in government support</a>, with 78% in favour of technologies such as wind power, solar and biomass, and only 4% against. </p>

<p>The latest findings of the public attitudes tracker come as the government continues its push to develop a shale industry in the UK, with decisions on schemes being taking out of council hands in the face of strong local opposition. </p>

<p>For the first time, the 2,121 households were asked why they supported or opposed fracking. Of those who were against the process, the most common concern was the loss or destruction of the natural environment, with 61% giving it as a reason. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/uk-ministers-make-it-top-priority-to-ensure-nature-laws-do-not-hamper-fracking">UK ministers make it 'top priority' to ensure nature laws do not hamper fracking</a> </p>

<p>Among those supporting fracking, the main reasons cited were needing to use all available energy sources (35%), reducing dependence on conventional fossil fuels (34%), and reducing dependence on getting supplies from other countries (32%).</p>

<p>The survey also revealed that 36% of people support nuclear power, while 21% oppose the technology. <br/></p>

<p>Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it. </p>

<p>Greenpeace UK chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said: “If you take a UK ranking of energy sources by popularity and turn it upside down, you have a list of this government’s energy priorities. There’s a growing gulf between what the public wants for our energy future and what our ministers are imposing, and the cheaper clean technologies become, the wider the chasm will grow.”</p>

<p>A Decc spokesman said: “There is no question that we need natural gas in the UK, and this research shows that people do not want to rely on other countries for it. That is why we need to secure our own domestic gas supplies. If just 10% of the estimated gas in shale rock could be recovered, it would be enough to meet our energy demand for almost 40 years.”</p>

Semyorka has form for this type of activity. Even when you disagree with him showing him that the laws of physics and states of matter disagree with his stance, he will still revert to "denier". All you have to do is disagree.

You may be wrong.The only thing that has kept fracking at bay is public opposition. We do have a voice and we can demand alternatives and debate. Fracking is not a future. Fracking is yet another finite fossil fuel. Even the general public know we are proud of our green and pleasant land and can do so much better than introduce a new industry like fracking into our communities.

If there is a massive methane leak in the UK (Like the one currently in California) and this is near a major northern city how will the government deal with it? Say 1 million residents had to be evacuated - where would they go? Who would pay for it?

The reason why fracking is being imposed by the govt is because it is part of the nuclear agenda. The new nuclear agenda involves an investment of 40-50 Bn in power plants alone. Investment in Green Safe Renewables is a NEGILGANT 10-15% by comparison and as little as 5-10% when Nuclear Waste Disposal is factored in. The problem faced by the new nuclear agenda is NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL. Fracking boreholes are to be driiled by HALIBURTON favoured nuclear waste disposal company using DEPLETED URANIUM DRILLS. Fracking boreholes are to be used for nuclear waste storage. The reason why this is focused on LANCASHIRE is BAE SYSTEMS and the manufacture of NUCLEAR ORDINANTS (Munitions tipped with nuclear waste from new nuclear). The Govt FRACKING POLICY IS DIRECTLY A RESULT OF MILITARY COMMITMENT TO NATO. This is why the GOVT SEEKS TO BYPASS DEMOCRACY.

We are ignoring all the scientific evidence that fracking is harmful to the environment, but it will be at our kids cost, those who fully investigate this cannot be persuaded that fracking is safe, there are so many loopholes in the Fracking EU recommendations it shows that the corporate and gov't lobbying to water down regulation has worked. They are not protecting the public from the harmful chemicals or the risk to the water supply, they are protecting their interests only and for most people this is clear! Yesterdays vote in the European Parliament highlights this, the European Parliament is recommending that no more fracking projects should take place until the loopholes are closed... see link below. https://www.facebook.com/marianharkin/videos/10153378686912061/

Daveyhulme is primarily a municipal plant. It would not be used as a long term option for produced water. It is not set up for that."The investigation established a unit to treat ‘siloxanes’"This is generated due to the biogas element of the plant. No biogas would be generated AFAIK with fracked water treatment.
