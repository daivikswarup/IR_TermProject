UK ministers make it 'top priority' to ensure nature laws do not hamper fracking




DateTime::::2016-02-01T14:17:23+0000



<p>The government has made it a “top priority” to ensure protections for national parks and sites of special scientific interest do not obstruct fracking across the country, according to a leaked letter from ministers.</p>

<p>Fracking in both protected areas was ruled out by the government last year, in the Infrastructure Act, although <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/16/fracking-under-national-parks-approved-by-mps-amid-acrimony">campaigners pointed out</a> that companies could still drill vertically outside park boundaries and then horizontally beneath them.</p>

<p>But it appears ministers are working to ensure that even those limited protections do not get in the way of fracking companies.</p>

<p>“One of our top priorities will be to examine what work is required to ensure that the safeguarding provisions in the [Infrastructure] Act do not inadvertently create fresh barriers to exploration and to minimise the delays that the requirements in the act have introduced,” three ministers wrote to the chancellor, George Osborne.</p>

<p>The letter, dated 7 July 2015 and signed by Liz Truss, the environment secretary; Amber Rudd, the energy secretary; and Greg Clark, the communities secretary, was obtained by Friends of the Earth.</p>

<p>It shows that just days before the government laid draft regulations for the protections in parliament, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-defines-protected-areas-for-shale-developments">ministers on 16 July promising “world-class environmental protections”</a>, they were privately saying they would work to ensure they did not cause problems for industry. The regulations <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/16/fracking-under-national-parks-approved-by-mps-amid-acrimony">were later passed in December</a>.</p>

<p>Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Even before ministers had published the regulations supposedly protecting our most beautiful landscape and wildlife sites from fracking, they were writing that it was a priority to make sure this didn’t hamper or delay the industry. The government’s public line is very different to its private view.”</p>

<p>A Department of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> and Climate Change spokesman said: “We have the right protections in place to ensure that fracking can go ahead safely without risk to our most beautiful and important natural sites, while striking the necessary balance to ensure that this vital industry can develop.”</p>

<p>The letter also revealed that ministers are considering designating shale gas wells as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which would take planning decisions out of the hands of local authorities, to be made by officials at the Infrastructure Planning Commission instead.<br/></p>

<p>However, the three ministers admit that introducing such a change before exploratory wells are drilled and shown to be safe, could undermine public support for shale.</p>

<p>Shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: “These latest revelations show that ministers are intent on imposing fracking on communities against their will, regardless of the consequences for the environment. Government should act in the interests of the whole country, not just the fracking industry.”</p>

<p>Pat Davies, chair of the anti-fracking Preston New Road Action Group, said: “This latest travesty from Westminster seems to be an attempt to predetermine outcomes in relation to fracking, irrespective of local community wishes.”</p>

<p>Last year shale gas explorer Cuadrilla suffered a major blow when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/29/fracking-application-cuadrilla-rejected-lancashire-county-council">Lancashire county council rejected fracking</a> at Preston New Road and Roseacre Wood, near Blackpool, leading ministers to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/13/government-will-step-in-if-councils-dont-fast-track-fracking-applications">later promise they would “fast track” fracking applications</a>. Cuadrilla’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/cuadrilla-to-appeal-against-fracking-refusal-by-lancashire-county-council">subsequent appeal</a> will be heard next week.</p>

<p>A separate decision on <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://democracy.northyorks.gov.uk/committees.aspx?commid=12">a fracking application by Third Energy at Kirby Misperton</a>, a village in Ryedale, North Yorkshire, was due on 9 February but has been delayed until March at the earliest after North Yorkshire council asked the company for more information.</p>

<p>“We continue to endeavour to meet the earliest planning committee meeting we can for a determination,” the council said in a statement.</p>

<p>The government letter shows that ministers hope for exploratory fracking wells to be up and running by 2017, with production following by 2020 and a “maturing industry” established by 2025. Just one exploratory shale gas well has been fracked in the UK so far, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/19/uk-shale-gas-revolution-falls-flat-just-11-new-wells-planned-2015">at Preese Hall, Lancashire, in 2011</a>.</p>

Fraccing has been shown not to contaminate water supplies? Have you seen the videos on the subject? Or the huge tanks of water that fraccing companies in the USA are supplying to residents in some fraccing localities - without any admission of liability of course? Methinks you have a predisposition to support the industry, but not to find out the truth.

Pon them down and give them a glass of frac water. Uk energy history is disgusting. Look at sellifield and the nuc industry. Look at the mammoth destruction they left behind....��...next war we will for water. We well look back in 50 to 100 years and say wtf have we done. All the wind n ocean energy we could ever use and we destroy our groundwater for a bit of gas.....politics and budgets will never be sustainable!!!!!������������

The people who think there is nothing wrong here are not able to look at situations with an intelligent mind. For starters we are living under a dictatorship, the traitors in government are effectively taking PUBLIC assets and allowing big corporations to come in, make huge profits and then leave after they have destroyed them. These are the corporations that give the government huge donations and give large salary jobs to retiring MP's who have done them favours like this one reported. It's effectively TREASON.

I do mind the bollocksyoutalk . Try researching what has happened, actually happened. Yes researching for what has actually happened in the US AND in Australia rather than believing UK government constructs . For pursuit of actual, rather than what the government and its fracking friends want you to believe, go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJooOAm57Kw&feature=youtu.be&aContent re: Fracking Co. Rathlin Energy in £30million+ DEBT...& RISING - Update on Porter Ranch Methane & BTEX Catastrophe - Upton Camp Eviction : The Corporate Police State - Oil at less than $30 per Barrel = No Fracking Viability! . See http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/01/29/3744324/florida-fracking-bill-and-ban/ - Florida approved a bill to allow fracking to take place anywhere in the state, with NO REQUIREMENT of fracking companies TO INFORM WHAT CHEMICALS OR POTENTIAL CARCINOGENS ARE USED IN THE FRACKING, and bans local communities banning the practice entirely .Had you read that our government would allow companies to use the possible facility of dumping waste into the spaces created by drilling . WHAT WASTE? YOU MIGHT WELL ASK ! Look at the other you-tube links re Ian R Crane . NB All these permissions the UK government gives its ‘friends’/relatives are pushed through parliament at the very last sessions at the end of terms, eg just before Christmas; just before the May elections.

I can't really comment on that, but this does seem odd. I would think environmentalists would be the ones that would object to using that as an energy source.There are multitude of tidal capture and turbines schemes that could be used rather than an effing great barrage built by a corporation that takes most of the benefitsI used the word populated not polluted

We are a small highly populated country and these well heads drill 24/7 for months and then theres the massive amounts of water and waste often down narrow country lanes and villages. Its largely a monster and one that with current oil prices is a no go anyway

By that low pedantic standard gravity is hypothetical.

Porter Ranch is a storage facility, not a "fracking site". The leak there is from a 60 year old re-purposed oil production well.

There is no comparable fraccing in Australia, so very little can be learned looking that way.

Fracking is short term.No one wants growth at the expense of heath.There is zero trust in the Tory party dash for gas. Even less in the tax avoiding fossil fuel industry. Take a look at where these companies are registered.......Many of our universities have fossil fuel execs on their boards, influencing research and development and R&D is not going into future renewables or storage.We could be leaders showing the rest of the world what a first class country can do to protect its people and respond to investment in clean energy.......pipe dream.

And when the lagoons that hold all the toxic waste are hit by floods that we have just encountered. How are these ministers going to prevent the land and rivers from being severely polluted?



Author::::AfterOil
DateTime::::2016-02-02T08:43:41Z
A consent to go ahead requires a developer to state where and how its "waste" is to be managed. There is currently no treatment plant able or willing to take in fracking wastewater. It means that to avoid this impasse, treatment works need prior investment in dedicated process plant before being able to take in the flowback and produced water. Otherwise its current plant will be scaled up with toxic and in some cases radioactive deposits. The biggest problem is the total dissolved solids which lead to high salinities unable to be released into rivers or even estuaries. The treatment of which requires high energy use for evaporation and crystallisation, with additional expenditure for disposal of solids and filter aids in special landfill.
