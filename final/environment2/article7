US and Canada promise to lead world to low-carbon economy




DateTime::::2016-03-10T14:06:31+0000



<p>The US and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> declared they would help lead the transition to a low-carbon global economy on Thursday, in a dramatic role reversal for two countries once derided as climate change villains.<br/></p>

<p>The shared vision unveiled by Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau ahead of a meeting at the White House commits the two countries to a range of actions to shore up <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era">the historic climate agreement reached in Paris last December</a>.</p>

<p>The two leaders committed to rally G20 countries behind the accord, promote North American carbon markets, cap emissions from hundreds of thousands of existing oil and gas wells, and protect indigenous communities in a region which is warming beyond the point of no return, according to a statement from the White House.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/03/10/us-canada-joint-statement-climate-energy-and-arctic-leadership">The initiative</a> announced on Thursday brings the US a big step closer to meeting its own Paris target by committing for the first time to cut emissions of methane - a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for about a quarter of warming - from existing oil and gas wells.</p>

<p>The biggest news however might be the final break with the policies of their predecessors who obstructed global efforts to fight climate change. In his seven years in the White House, Barack Obama has steadily transformed the US into a climate leader on the international level.<br/></p>

<p>“The two leaders regard the Paris agreement as a turning point in global efforts to combat climate change and anchor economic growth in clean development,” the White House said in a statement. “They resolve that the United States and Canada must and will play a leadership role internationally in the low carbon global economy over the coming decades, including through science-based steps to protect the Arctic and its peoples.”<br/></p>

<p>With Thursday’s announcement, Obama appeared to be passing the baton of climate leadership to Trudeau. Trudeau, just months into his prime ministership, has made clear he wants Canada to play a similar leadership role at home and on the global stage, White House officials told a conference call with reporters on Thursday.</p>

<p>“President Obama sees prime minister Trudeau as a really strong partner on these issues,” the officials said. “This is a very important moment along the way and we expect that co-operation to continue in the future.”</p>

<p>Under the initiative, the US and Canada will work to ratify the Paris agreement as soon as possible, lending an important symbolic boost to prospects for bringing the Paris agreement into force as soon as possible after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/22/france-calls-world-leaders-paris-climate-deal-new-push-cop-21-international-law">the 22 April signing ceremony</a>. The agreement must be ratified by at least 55 countries representing 55% of global emissions. <br/></p>

<p>Obama and Trudeau also said the leaders would move quickly to finalise their long-term emissions reductions strategies discussed at Paris, unveiling a plan by the end of 2016, and that they would lobby other major G20 industrialised countries to do the same.</p>

<p>An early opportunity for such lobbying comes later this year when Canada and the US will bring in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico">Mexico</a> to the new North American partnership on climate.</p>

<p>The White House statement also suggested the two leaders would try to consolidate existing regional carbon markets, in line with other provisions in the Paris agreement for encouraging the transition to a clean energy economy.</p>

<p>Turning closer to home, the initiative also takes a big step to curbing a powerful climate pollutant in methane, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/17/us-likely-culprit-of-global-spike-in-methane-emissions-over-last-decade">whose emissions rose rapidly with the boom in oil and gas production across much of the US and Canada</a>.</p>

<p>The two countries committed to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% below 2012 levels by 2025 - in line with previous proposed rules from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Canada’s major energy-producing province of Alberta.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the EPA raised the bar even farther, pledging to draft rules to cut methane from existing oil and gas wells - which had been a key demand for campaign groups. </p>

<p>“We are going to have to tackle emissions from existing sources,” Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, told a conference call with reporters. “It has become clear that it is time for the EPA to regulate existing sources from the oil and gas sector.”</p>

<p>The commitment won widespread praise from environmental campaign groups who noted that tackling methane was one of the most effective ways of reducing US and Canadian emissions overall.</p>

<p>The US and Canada are both among the top five global emitters of methane.</p>

<p>“Acting fast to cut methane pollution from oil and gas operations is one of the single most important steps we can take to slow temperature rise and protect the climate,” Abigail Dillen, EarthJustice climate campaigner, said in a statement. “We applaud the president for redoubling his commitment to US climate action.”</p>

<p>On the Arctic, the two countries said they would convene a high-level summit next August to try and keep pace with the record temperatures, sea ice loss, permafrost thaws and wildfires, that are creating dangerous and irreversible impacts in the polar region - but also contributing to changing weather patterns and sea-level rise globally.</p>

<p>“There is a real need just to do more science about the speed with which the melting is occurring and what the modelling of the implications are for that,” said Angela Anderson, who directs the climate and energy programme for the Union of Concerned Scientists. “There is a lot of science to be done to really understand how what is happening in the Arctic is going to affect all of us.”</p>

<p>Environmentalists immediately demanded an end to Arctic drilling, and pressed Trudeau to declare a halt to pipeline projects from Alberta tar sands.</p>

<p>The US-Canada partnership came as data from the US science agency, Noaa, showed that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/co2-levels-make-largest-recorded-annual-leap-noaa-data-shows">atmospheric CO2 levels had jumped by the highest amount on record last year</a>.</p>

As a young elementary student in the 70s we were all taught global cooling was going to kill us all. When that didn't happen fast enough they changed it to global warming. When that was shown to have no data it was deemed climate change.

"We have unlimited land" is an attitude problem beautifully expressed. Being spread out is very inefficient from an energy point of view. I could give you a huge list of costs that dramatically go up with the kind of low density development highly characteristic of many areas in Canada - obviously not in major urban areas. Land use policy in some jurisdictions has been set up to favour profitable sell-offs of rural land for residential development which is a huge mistake.

Canada might well commit herself to reducing green house gasses. Trudeau has a majority in government and if he can carry his party along he has a chance. Obama hasn't enough time to do much more and he has an ignorant, obstructionist bunch of dim wits in both houses. The only chance is if Sanders is elected with a majority in both houses. Even then it will be an uphill battle. Many of the Democrat leaders are no better than their Republican counterparts.

The issue with subsidisation of the fossil fuel industry goes beyond direct spending and tax breaks. As Bush is famously quoted in the run-up to the Iraq war; America had become 'dangerously addicted to oil'. It is no secret that the war in Iraq was to secure low oil prices and maintain dollar hegemony. This war has cost by one official estimate $6 trillion. So if this is added to the cost of oil, in that this was the self-evident cause of the war (by many accounts), we see that fossil fuels when subject to transparent accountancy, and allowing for externalities, are much more expensive than they are generally regarded to be.

Reduce the mega-profits on speculations and rapid turnover trades on Wall Street. This can be easily done by placing a transaction tax on all sales of shares. This would make it no longer possible to "flip" shares at millisecond intervals without paying for this unstable practice. It would have the secondary effect of generating income to cushion the blows to the economy incurred by financial speculation. Foreign Exchange speculation should be stopped altogether, this wrecks currencies and destroys economies.

The logic is quite simple: pure altruism. I can explain you, shortly and clearly, why the Global Warming alarm is patented rubbish. But to be ale to understand you have to know something about physics. Which the vast majority of the "climate activists" don't.

It is such a shame that leading the world out of poverty comes with such a high price. Back in 1981, 44.3% of the world was in extreme poverty. Only 31, years later in 2012 that number was 12.73%.

I like this term 'low-carbon economy' because it is so undefined andmeaningless. Much more sensible than 'zero-carbon economy' whichis, for this century, a ridiculous concept.Presumably we will gradually decrease the amount of fossil fuels inour energy mix and if we can do this fast enough to make up for ourpopulation increase, our total emissions could go down.Canada-US are already lower than most for fossil fuels in our energy mixat 80%. The global average is about 87%, the UK is at 84%, Australia at 93%.Where we are most guilty is in our energy consumption and some of us do feel bad about this. We are handicapped in that we are well-off countrieswith low population densities. Our people have very high disposable incomesand much cheaper fuel costs than in other countries.This means that nothing much will be changing, at least not quickly.But we will talk more about this issue and say more of the correct things.

I think you underestimate the impacts; I think BILLIONS of people will die before we reach an equilibrium state where the world's resources can sustain the Homo Sapiens population in the long term. Climate change means serious disruption of food production which is already undergoing serious strains to keep up with population growth. Malthus will soon have his way and it ain't a pretty picture.
