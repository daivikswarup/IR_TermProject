Rare wildlife discovered in biggest nature survey along Britain's coast




DateTime::::2016-03-11T06:01:25+0000



<p>The biggest survey to date of nature along Britain’s coastline has uncovered a host of “wildlife firsts”.<br/></p>

<p>More than 3,400 species were recorded at 25 National Trust locations along the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/oct/20/50-years-british-coast-line-then-and-now">coastline of England, Wales and Northern Ireland</a> in the charity’s largest ever wildlife survey. A handful have either been seen in a new habitat for the first time or “rediscovered” after going unseen for many years. <br/></p>

<p>Results included the first ever recorded sighting of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/b/balearicshearwater/">Balearic shearwater</a> (<em>Puffinus mauretanicus</em>) at Blakeney on the Norfolk coast. This bird is normally seen far out to sea off the coast of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and west Wales, but a sighting off the east coast is more unusual, rangers said. </p>

<p>At Freshwater West in Pembrokeshire, west Wales, a slow worm (<em>Anguis fragilis</em>), was found for the first time since 1966 and a rare forest cockchafer beetle (<em>Melolontha hippocastani</em>), was found in the dunes of White Park Bay, Co Antrim for the first time in Northern Ireland in more than a century.<br/></p>

<p>Over six months last year, 4,000 people took part in “bio blitz” surveys, with the aim of recording as many species as possible over either 12 or 24 hours. <br/></p>

<p>Some 53 species <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/">“red listed” by the IUCN</a> were recorded, including the Dartford warbler, spotted on Brownsea Island in Dorset for only the second time since the 1980s. The surveys also recorded 95 of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-5717">UK’s most threatened species</a> – among them water vole, found at Dunwich Heath on the Suffolk coast for only the second time in more than 40 years, and the red-shanked carder bee (<em>Bombus ruderarius</em>), seen at Birling Gap in East Sussex for the first time.</p>

<p>Dr David Bullock, the trust’s head of conservation, said the results would help provide the trust with a greater understanding of the species that live along Britain’s coastline.</p>

<p>“The shifting nature of our shoreline means that we need to think ahead about what is happening to coastal habitats and how we might secure the future of the wildlife that lives by the sea,” he said.</p>

<p>The site with the most species recorded was Brancaster on the north Norfolk coast, with 1,018 species recorded on 20 June 2015. Blakeney Point, also in north Norfolk, came second, followed by Brownsea Island, Dorset; Dunwich Heath, Suffolk, and Cwm Ivy on Gower, south Wales.</p>

<p>Species recorded in the highest numbers were land-living invertebrates (1,511) such as the oil beetle (<em>Meloe proscarabaeus</em>), found at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/llanerchaeron/trails/cwm-tydu-to-cwm-soden-butterfly-walk">Cwm Tydu on the Ceredigion coast</a> in Wales for the first time since 1994. Second were flowering plants (899) and lower plants (mosses and lichens). Only four species of reptile and five marine mammals were recorded. <br/></p>

<p>Other findings included a jumping spider (<em>Phlegra fasciata</em>), recorded at East Head, West Sussex, for the first time. There are less than 10 sites for this spider in the UK. Otters were found at Murlough reserve in Co Down, Northern Ireland and at Cemlyn in Anglesey, north Wales. The UK’s only venomous snake, the adder (<em>Vipera berus</em>), was recorded at Ravenscar on the Yorkshire coast for the first time.<br/></p>

<p>The surveys were organised to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/oct/20/50-years-british-coast-line-then-and-now">National Trust’s Neptune Coastline Campaign</a>. The trust now owns more than 775 miles of coastline.</p>

Most struggle to recognise even common species, and this is true even of those brought up in the countryside.

Yes, birding is one area where there a lots of competent naturalists out identifying and recording species. The main problem is that this is only with birds, and there is no comparable other group of species which is so comprehensively recorded. My point is that we need this for all groups of species, not just birds. Believe me I am not criticising birders, the BTO etc, they are doing a great job. We just need more of this for other species.

Great piece of work , the more we can record nature the more info we can have to help protect what is rapidly declining

Though there are organisations actively surveying - the BTO has completed its latest Bird Atlas programme, which has had thousands of volunteers mapping bird species over as many of the OS grid squares in the UK and Eire as possible... and now has the online Bird Track site actively recording birds

So the cockchafer beetle (Melolontha hippocastani) has been in hiding for a hundred years. What's he been up to? Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me.

Whilst the knowledge of all "experts" is limited, your example provides no evidence of anything. Firstly you don't even appear to know if they were Newts, let alone what species. Secondly you don't really know if they have actually declined, only that you no longer found them under the stones you used to find them. Next you are claiming a causal relationship between the area fenced off and the decline, which is not certain at all. You don't even know if there has been a decline of this unknown species, let alone what caused it, because as you say you are such a none expert you weren't even sure if they were Newts, let alone what species of Newt.

Sorry to make fun of your name. What I should have politely said is that you're missing the point of how citizen science works. People moan about the RSPB's big garden birdwatch in the same way, not understanding how these events work. On your specific point, the survey doesn't say that slow worms are either rare or common at that site, just that they've been recorded (to be more accurate) for the first time for 50 years. Yours, hair-splittingly, Homo correctum. Note italics.

I wonder how many records were submitted from urban or industrial sites? If we really want to promote bio-diversity, it might be a good idea to take a closer look at what's going on in the human domain.

Hopefully the rise in awareness and our digital generation will log lots more species and provide habitat reference for further planning and protection ( unless Developers get there first ....)

I have seen Balearic Shearwater in the Firth of Forth and there have been 10+ records in Lothian. I would, therefore, be more than a little surprised if this was the first Puffinus mauretanicus recorded in Norfolk.

Britain has some of the oldest reliable natural history records in the world. In some way Britain is the home of natural history. Many of world's renowned naturalists came from Britain, and natural history was massive in the 19th Century.
