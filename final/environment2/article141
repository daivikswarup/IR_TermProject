Environment groups throw down the green gauntlet to London mayoral candidates




DateTime::::2016-02-29T12:52:20+0000



<p>A group of some of the country’s best-known environmental groups, including the National Trust, RSPB, WWF and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/greenpeace">Greenpeace</a>, are today calling on the next Mayor of London to commit to making the capital a greener, healthier city.</p>

<p>The NGOs have drawn together 20 policy suggestions to improve London’s environment and will publish them today to mark the start of Greener <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> Week. Suggestions include the introduction of policies to phase out all diesel black cabs and private taxis by 2020, the launch of an energy efficiency loan scheme for London’s small businesses, and the delivery of a 10-fold increase in solar capacity across the city’s rooftops.</p>

<p>John Sauven, executive director at Greenpeace UK, said London has some of the highest air pollution levels in the country and the lowest level of solar deployment per household.</p>

<p>“Any serious vision for a cleaner London must include a plan to swap these two records around,” he said in a statement. “From transport to energy, our dependence on dirty fossil fuels is holding London back. The capital has all the resources it needs to break free from it. It’s time for the next mayor to give this cutting edge city the cutting edge power and transport systems it deserves.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Matthew Spencer, director of environmental think tank Green Alliance, said London was at risk of becoming a victim of its own success. “London is a dynamic city, but if it’s to remain a healthy place to live and work it also has to become a greener city,” he said. “London is unusual in the UK in having most of the powers it needs to make itself greener without waiting for central government. We’ve suggested 20 practical ways the next mayor can use their power on behalf of London citizens seeking a more liveable city.”</p>

<p>Over the next five days the London mayoral campaigns will focus on green issues, culminating in a Greener London hustings on Friday where Labour candidate Sadiq Khan, Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith, Green Party candidate Sian Berry and Lib Dem candidate Caroline Pidgeon will present their solutions to London’s top environmental challenges.</p>

<p>The new package of green NGO-endorsed proposals also includes plans to increase minimum energy efficiency standards in the private rental sector to EPC level C or above by 2025, harmonise recycling and food waste schemes across London, and ban diesel vehicles in the city centre during peak times. </p>

As somebody overwhelmed by the horrors of what has been, and continues to be inflicted on planet Earth, and as a resident of London for some time now, I have decided to campaign more fully for cycling. Attenborough and Monbiot remain heroes, but I hope I can do my bit for : Climate Change, the environment, air quality, avoiding contributing to noise, stress and menace of excessive and inappropriate vehicle journeys, setting an example to others for taking personal responsibility for one's own health (heart, lung, mind etc), reducing the burden on the NHS in the process (as far as anyone can with illegal levels of filth supplied by petrol and diesel), reducing the burden to the economy through less ill health (you do feel better when you ride - honest!), getting to where I need to be - on time, and saving myself funds otherwise spent on transport.There's no doubt in my mind that, whilst I was devastated by the loss of the chance of Ken and Sian, ten years ago, but then more angry than anything when Boris got in for a second term, Boris has, if nothing else (and albeit often with need of a push), provided more infrastructure for the enablement of cycling as a normalised means of getting about (with far more needed to be done of course to bring this to fruition), than any other mayor (this of course was through the work of the organisation I am quite honoured to be assocaited with LCC, starting with the 'Love London Go Dutch' campaign).It is for that reason then, that this time, there is simply no contest.

Yes - Ken had a pretty good track record actually.

Representative democracy is not responsive to environmental matters.

What you clearly don't realize (or want to admit) is that Greepeace's popularity and profile in Europe gives it a tremendous amount of influence everywhere else.

You may reside in an EU country. What you don't seem to realizeis that Greenpeace has no influence or credibility anywhere else.The EU is probably the only place on the planet that doesn't needGreenpeace as the EU is as the front of climate change activity.

"They and their partner, the Guardian, remain very much against any kind of nuclear power to this day."

I don't so much dislike GP, it is just that I know them.They began in my town 1969-71. Just a few anti-war protestors,US draft dodgers and hippies. Their only purpose was to protestUS nuclear tests in Alaska. They and their partner, the Guardian,remain very much against any kind of nuclear power to this day.Their primary activity is silly stunts and fundraising which go together.They only get respect in the EU. Most of the world just ignores themwhile many of the more important countries are openly hostile to theiractivities, such as the US, Russia, India, Japan, China and Islamic countries.These countries have over 2/3 of the global CO2 emissions.

It's people like you, who seem to dislike Greenpeace so much, that convinces me that they're doing a pretty effective job as an environmental / conservation lobby and protest group.

Perhaps I was not clear with my comment.Obviously, some of the candidates would have some 'green' credentialsthat they can talk about.But what would this have to do with green NGOs such as Greenpeace?Do such groups have any standing in your electoral process? I am awarethat some groups like Greenpeace have some influence in EU commissionswhere they are even allowed to provide testimony. This kind of thing wouldnot happen anywhere else on the planet.

Do mayors of London pay attention to what is wished forby green NGOs? This must be one of those oddities thatwould only occur in the EU.

With Zac Goldsmith being the only conservative seemingly with remaining green credentials, I think that it is quite likely that London will be greener politically than our government until at least 2020. The worry though is that the rest of the conservatives appear to be becoming even more barking on this issue.
