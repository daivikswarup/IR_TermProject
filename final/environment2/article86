Six arrested in Spain on charges of illegal fishing of protected species




DateTime::::2016-03-09T13:58:22+0000



<p>Six people have been arrested on charges of illegal fishing of protected species in raids carried out jointly by Interpol and Spanish police in Galicia in northwest <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain">Spain</a>.<br/></p>

<p>The six include five members of the Vidal family who run Ribeiro Vidal Armadores, among them Antonio Vidal, the owner, and three of his children who are accused of illegally fishing Patagonian toothfish in Antarctic waters.</p>

<p>The fish, which is rich in allegedly health-enhancing Omega-3 fatty acids, is known as “white gold” in the industry as it can sell for as much as €130 (£100) a kilo. A large catch can be worth as much as €50m so poachers are willing to risk being fined for illegal fishing. </p>

<p>The Vidal family, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/26/spanish-fishermen-fines">which has a previous record of illegal fishing</a>, has a factory in the town of Boiro which for several years has been manufacturing products based on Omega-3. The factory was one of three premises searched during the raids and the presence of both Interpol and Europol agents suggests the investigation is international in scope and further arrests may follow.</p>

<p>“This is the first time that the Spanish Civil Guard, Interpol and Europol have joined forces against illegal fishing in a joint action,” said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of the NGO Oceana in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>. “This announcement is a watershed in the fight to eradicate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing of our oceans.”</p>

<p>“What’s different is that it isn’t just the ministry of agriculture that’s involved but the police, Interpol and above all the Audiencia Nacional (high court),” says Elvira Jiménez, head of Greenpeace Spain’s oceans campaign. “We haven’t seen the details of the charges but if the high court is involved these are now criminal proceedings and could lead to jail sentences, not just fines.”</p>

<p>Police sources allege that at the time of his arrest Antonio Vidal did not deny fishing in the Antarctic but said it was only illegal for countries that had signed the treaty to protect fish stocks. As his ship was flagged in Equatorial Guinea, which is not a signatory, he claimed he had done nothing wrong. </p>

<p>According to Jiménez, however, he would still need permission to fish in those waters, regardless of where his ship was flagged. Furthermore, she says, as Spain is a signatory to the European agreement to outlaw illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, Vidal’s activities amount to a serious infraction. </p>

<p>This is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/26/spanish-fishermen-fines">not the first time</a> the Vidals have been accused of illegal fishing and Antonio Vidal has already been convicted in the US for attempting to smuggle toothfish. His vessels have been blacklisted but the ships have been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.icij.org/project/looting-seas-ii/pirate-fleet-owner-convicted-fish-fraud">renamed and reflagged</a> in countries such as Equatorial Guinea, Mauretania and Panama as many as six times in order to evade the authorities. One of his ships was renamed three times in a year, Jiménez says.</p>

<p>In 2015 Spain’s agriculture ministry imposed fines of over €17m on three Galician-based vessels, all blacklisted and all linked to Vidal, for illegal fishing. The same three vessels <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/21/antarctic-toothfish-poaching-ships-shrug-off-new-zealand-navy">were pursued by the New Zealand navy in Antarctic waters last year for illegal fishing</a>. </p>

<p>These fines have been offset by the generous subsidies – as much as €16m, according to Greenpeace – that Vidal’s companies have received over the years from the Spanish government and the European Union.</p>

<p>The Patagonian toothfish is a species of cod icefish and that can weigh as much as 150kg and may live for up to 50 years. However, as it takes as long as 15 years to reach sexual maturity and has a low reproductive rate, it is particularly vulnerable. The Prince of Wales is among those <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-stranger-topics-badgers-patagonian-toothfish">who have campaigned for its protection</a>.</p>

Here in Spain people often say: "Rules are made to be broken". That reveals an attitude which is widespread. So often, in ordinary daily life, regulations are unheeded and there are no consequences.

without even reading the article, this is all to do with the work of sea shepherd. if they didn't go down there last year when japan suspended their whaling campaign, these 6 bandit vessel's will still be out their poaching away with governments, both foreign and domestic not giving a shit! Sea Shepherd are the real hero's here and deserve a hell of a lot more credit than what they receive...

This article says nothing about the pursuit, for a record length of time, by Sea Shepherd, and the eventual sinking of the ship off the coast of Africa. Nor about their work co-operating with law enforcement in Thailand, Mauritius and other countries, and the evidence they gathered to enable Interpol to close the noose on these bastards.

Spanish fisherman don't care. The pay the stupid fine and get on with it. They should be treated like drug smugglers. The oceans are vast and governments don't prioritise spending money on patrolling them.

Forget fines and bureaucratic penalties. All vessels fishing illegally should be boarded, evacuated and sunk, and their crews thrown in the can. That'd be the best way to stop 'em but, no doubt, their political contributions are all up-to-date.

I hope there will be more controls like these to stop illegal fishing.Fishing is probably the least worrying topic in Spain right now. I hope The Guardian highlights other issues too.

The Spanish authorities must have known for a long time where they were, as it's not a weeks fishing trip. The EU should have just refused them to unload their boats in EU ports if they fish in Antarctic waters.

At the moment you can ask your local MEP to raise these issues (if they are actually showing up in parliment). If they can get enough support perhaps action can be taken.

16 million Euros in subsidies from the Spanish govt and the EU makes a mockery of notions of social and environmental justice in Europe, as this family has been well known to engage in illegal fishing practices for years. Hopefully now, the tables have turned and they will do some serious porridge as well as forfeit the right to any future subsidies, which should be going to the small-scale, inshore, sustainable methods boats, like are found around the minor fishing ports of UK, and Greenpeace, Hugh F-W and others have been campaigning to support for the last couple of years.
