Sweet, murderous robins

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> fevered burst of birdsong drew more than one pair of eyes to the branch of a hedgerow tree. Fraught with seasonal urgency, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://sounds.bl.uk/Environment/British-wildlife-recordings/022M-W1CDR0001376-1100V0">robin’s song</a> was a liquid stream; not a gentle brook, but a gushing beck, some notes thrown high and uncontrollably as if dashed against a rock, others pitched down a waterfall, and all poured out in a tumbling, erratic, attention-seeking rush.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Another <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.garden-birds.co.uk/birds/robin.htm">robin</a> worked its way down the hedge towards it, then alighted on a near parallel perch about a metre away. The first bird threw out its chest, arched its back so that its head all but touched its shoulders and began to rear up and down in poised sweeps, a series of movements that – in human terms – would not look out of place on a yoga mat.</p>

<p>The scene was backlit by a low sun, so there were no distractions of colour and tone. All of my focus was on the physicality of stylised gestures that would have been clearly read and understood by the bird on the next branch.</p>

<p>We walked on beyond where the hedge ran out and along the track whose bordering ditches led up to a wood recorded in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/10/1">Domesday Book</a>. Yellows captured the corner of my eye; the first flush of dandelions, but also flowering <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/primrose.htm">primroses</a>, relics of hedges past. Some were flat rosettes of leaves and unfurling stems that promised more to come.</p>

<p>A patch of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.woodlands.co.uk/blog/flora-and-fauna/dogs-mercury/">dog’s mercury</a> held to a grass slope that had been scraped last winter to bare earth. These plants were raising their annual heads early and would subside before the blade of a summer tractor could bring them low.</p>

<p>At the wood’s edge, with its array of Private: Keep Out signs, we swivelled and returned downhill. When we reached the same spot in the hedge as before, the robins had progressed to a flying tandem, processing from tree to tree, perch to perch.</p>

<p>Should one bird catch the other, it would surely try to bash its little brains out. Sweet robins, with their sweet song and their <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bto.org/volunteer-surveys/gbw/gardens-wildlife/garden-birds/a-z-garden-birds/robin">murderous intent</a>.</p>

Humans consistently deplore these very rare acts of intra-specific mortal violence. Perhaps we don’t like to be reminded about ourselves, especially out of the blue, on a carefree sunny day and from such an unexpected direction.

It is a shame that the revelation that robins are territorial is leading to such strong reactions against them. I have never seen nor heard of a fight to the death though of course it may happen, but I believe this is extremely rare.

Why would such an apparently moving experience put you off them rather than warm to such a bird?

This is an extraordinary experience and hard to understand. I hope you can find out why it happened, or speculation about such behaviour. The only thing I can imagine is that the mouse disturbed the robin's nest.

I get robins in the garden - and my neighbour has great tits. Two different subjects but I just thought I'd mention it.

I think you will find an increasing number of cat owners (myself included) have 'indoor cats' simply because there are so many bloody maniacs outside, and yes, I amreferring to humans.

The tradition is that a robin tried to remove the crown of thorns from Jesus' head (as he was being crucified) to lessen Jesus' pain. In doing so, it injured itself and all robins since then have been coloured red to remind us of that robin's brave and selfless attempt, ca. 30 CE.

In his classic monograph, The Life of the Robin (1943), David Lack came across only eight cases of serious fighting between rival males during his four years of intensive study. Almost all the conflicts were harmless ‘bluff fights’. An exception was when one bird lost a lot of head feathers and started to succumb. It survived by retreating and giving up its territory and mate to the intruder.Lack concludes that, despite several recorded cases of fights to the death in the literature, such events are extremely rare.It is also important to recognise that the vast majority of territorial disputes are resolved by a ‘natural diplomacy’ using competitions of song and display, with never a claw or beak clashing in anger

Tiny velociraptor* descendants with the same vicious tendencies. But very cute, and definitely hardy and plucky souls - I love them in the Winter, when they're happy to tough it out.

The robin in my garden is a aggressive git. Attacks any other bird trying to snatch a bite to eat from my feeder. Even attacks wood pigeons. Entertaining for a while to watch, but means not much variety of birds in the garden.

When I had cats they had collars with bells on.Within a couple of weeks the cats had learned how to stalk without making the bell ring and then how to remove the collars.

The ones you see in summer are not necessarily the same ones you see in winter.

Can't leave you on a cliffhanger, spiralx. Robins (and blackbirds too) are known for defending small territories so fiercely that it sometimes leads to a fight to the death. It's not (as anyone who has seen it will testify) a pleasant sight. A sharp beak can do damage but it takes a long time to kill a rival. Normally, one of the two backs down pretty quickly, so it doesn't get that far, but if the intruder really fancies his chances, they'll fight in earnest.

Not about Robins but just wanted to say that after months of seeing nothing but Magpies and Pigeons in my garden, I actually saw a pair of Goldfinches. It fair made my day.

Neither - it's been watching The Donald and has taken to heart the message that there are only WINNERS and losers.

Isn't the red on their breast the blood of Jesus or something? It would explain the murderous intent.

In my garden in France two days ago a meadow mouse (jumping mouse) was scurrying about totally unafraid of me. As the mouse hopped over my feet a robin flew down and kept pecking at it. As the mouse cowered the robin kept pecking. As the mouse ran off the robin flew close to the ground pecking at it still . Eventually the mouse got into the laurel hedge and the robin began singing loudly. Was the robin trying to eat the mouse? or is a robin just violent?

The true murderers are the cats decimating our fledgling birds. The cats' owners can't be bothered to put bells round their necks or keep them inside when birds are fledging.

I've tried hand feeding a Robin. When I'm out in the garden one always comes very near and I drop worms for it next to my feet. It collects them but won't take one out of my hand. Maybe next time eh

Went off Robins a couple of years ago. I had a pair nesting in my garden and I purposely kept my distance so not to not disturb them. Was in my garden one morning, a few metres from the nest, and one of the Robins started attacking me. It then went into the nest, pulled out a chick and essentially threw it at me. Then went back in, got another, and did the same again!

My Cocker Spaniel enjoys a Robin or Blackbird punch up as he can get even closer to dismantling one of them.

These robins are so cute, but watch them. They often come in the garden at my parent's and make sure to make all the others species to go away, parading around like they are the boss.

They may be aggressive with their fellow robins but they are vicious assassins when it comes to catching a moth, attacking it with an incredible ferocity that utterly belies its rather benign appearance. That nice little singing robin hasn't seemed quite the same since witnessing this.
