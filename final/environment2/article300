The eco guide to outdoor wear

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he wilderness nuts of old headed off on Nordic skis in sagging woollen leggings and handknitted sweaters. Modern wilderness wear is different. It’s high performance, engineered to aid air flow around the body.</p>

<p>Some of this is clever design, but a lot is down to PFCs – perfluorinated chemicals. They repel grease and, crucially, water. It was a downer when we found out last year that fragments of plastic polymers from our clothes, especially active wear, end up as microplastic pollution in rivers and oceans.</p>

<p>It’s a headache when greener chemistry turns out not to be so green. Since a 2012 report, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/chemistry-for-any-weather/blog/47680/">“Chemistry for Any Weather</a><em>”</em>, Greenpeace has pursued the outdoor-wear industry as a major contributor to pollution. The charity says that since the marketing of outdoor wear leans heavily on pristine snow-capped mountains, its manufacturing should not endanger them.</p>

<p>Greenpeace’s latest testing of outdoor products was not encouraging. Eleven out of 40 contained persistent levels of these toxins. In only four items were no PFCs detected.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.paramo-clothing.com/en-gb/">Paramo-clothing.com</a> is the first outdoor brand to completely eliminate PFCs. Most other brands refuse to give up on PFCs entirely, transitioning to short-chain versions, considered less likely to hang around in the environment. Or at least they were until recently. Researchers have found evidence of these “greener” PFCs in trout in remote lakes of Canada.</p>

<p>Do we seek out textiles derived from pineapple enzymes? Should we only wear natural fibres in undyed colours? There’s no perfect solution (yet), but keep up to date at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://detox-outdoor.org/">detox-outdoor.org</a>. It seems a safe bet that if you’re an outdoorsy sort you’re also a big fan of nature – so give it some thought.</p>

<p>Five years on from the Fukushima nuclear disaster, award-winning Japanese photographer Kosuke Okahara’s new work, collected in his book <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://kosukeokahara.com/?pid=book_detail&amp;id=19">Fukushima Fragments</a>, shows what remains of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, and what happened to those left behind. His subjects include dairy farmers Mr and Mrs Sanpei (pictured), scratching a living and fearful for the future, and the mothers who are unable to shake off the shadow of a nuclear explosion. </p>

<p>Building on the idea that knowledge is power, when it comes to sustainable style I’ve become very fond of shopping with <em>Magnifeco, Your Head-to-Toe Guide to Ethical Fashion and Non-Toxic Beauty</em> by US author Kate Black. It’s good on what’s going wrong in our wardrobes and bathroom cabinets, but the weight of the book focuses on how to be a better fashion and beauty consumer. This means a mix of the practical – such as how to spot good-quality vintage – and the philosophical, with a brave defence of ethical price points. Beauty is definitely not skin deep in this book: one chapter covers the economics of perfume, for example – and Black’s not scared of covering subjects like eco feminine care. Overall, it will help you reframe the way you shop and ultimately ensure that you get more ethical bang for your buck.</p>

<p><em>Magnifeco</em> costs £13.78 in paperback, or £10.79 on Kindle via Amazon</p>

Every time you touch your tablet screen you release enough Lanthanides to knock any passing blue whale clean off his bicycle.

Just how toxic are the PFCs at the concentrations found ?

Our whole lifestyle, from the food we buy in the supermarket to our profligate flights to Holiday destinations, is completely toxic. Future générations will have to bear the conséquences and they will take a dim view of us. We know our lifestyle is harmful but we still carry on !!

Oh dear! As I sit here reading this article I begin to wonder what are the levels of toxins produced by my desire to read this article. I wonder whether the power used to recharge the battery on my notepad is produced by the coal fired power plant, worse still I'm sitting in the comfort of my air conditioned car, produced by my diesel engine. I was going to switch the car off and head inside when the headline caught my eye and I decided to stay in the cool of the car to read the article.Even worse is the fact that I not only read the article, but I then went on to post this comment, all this while the diesel engine is still pumping out these particles. I could go on and on and on, but then I'd have to head back out to refill the car with fuel and at the same time be eating into the battery of this unit which will require to be recharged soon with more energy. Lets not get started on the actual wear and tear on this tablet (caused partially from reading these type of articles) that will at some stage require replacement with hopefully a new one that is 100% green
