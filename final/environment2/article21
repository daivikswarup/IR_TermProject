Morocco to switch on first phase of world's largest solar plant




DateTime::::2016-02-04T11:47:58+0000



<p>Morocco’s king will switch on the first phase of a concentrated solar power plant on Thursday that will become the world’s largest when completed.</p>

<p>The power station on the edge of the Saharan desert will be the size of the country’s capital city by the time it is finished in 2018, and provide electricity for 1.1 million people.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Noor 1, the first section at the town of Ouarzazate, provides 160 megawatts (MW) of the ultimate 580MW capacity, helping <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/morocco">Morocco</a> to save hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions per year.</p>

<p>“At around 2pm, the king will press a button, the parabolic mirrors will start turning, the heat will begin to turn the turbines and the plant will come to life,” said Maha el-Kadiri, a spokeswoman for Masen, Morocco’s renewable energy agency. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/morocco-poised-to-become-a-solar-superpower-with-launch-of-desert-mega-project">Morocco poised to become a solar superpower with launch of desert mega-project</a> </p>

<p>King Mohammed VI will then lay the foundations for Noor 2, the next stage of the solar complex. Noor 1 had been due to open in December but was delayed by unspecified “agenda concerns,” el-Kadiri said.</p>

<p>After it is switched on, the plant will initially provide 650,000 local people with solar electricity from dawn until three hours after sunset. <br/></p>

<p>“It is a very, very significant project in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a>,” said Mafalda Duarte, the manager of Climate Investment Funds (CIF), which provided $435m (£300m) of the $9bn project’s funding. “Morocco is showing real leadership and bringing the cost of the technology down in the process.”</p>

<p>The north African country plans to generate 42% of its energy from renewables by 2020, with one-third of that total coming from solar, wind and hydropower apiece.</p>

<p>Morocco hopes to use the next UN climate change conference, which it hosts in November, as the springboard for an even more ambitious plan to source 52% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.</p>

<p>“Between now and [the next conference], many projects will have come to light and we will prove that we can match our energy demands with renewables,” the country’s energy minister, Abdelkader Amara, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/morocco-sets-target-for-50-per-cent-renewable-energy-by-2030">said </a><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/morocco-sets-target-for-50-per-cent-renewable-energy-by-2030">at a meeting during the Paris climate summit</a> in December. </p>

<p>Such a move would have regional implications. CIF estimates that if international banks and governments deployed another 5GW of solar energy, electricity production costs could fall by 14%. Scaling that up to 15GW would cut costs by 44%.</p>

<p>Some $3.9bn has been invested in the Ouarzazate solar complex, including $1bn from the German investment bank KfW, $596m from the European Investment Bank and $400m from the World Bank. </p>

<p>If the dreams of its architects are realised, the resulting energy will eventually be exported north to Europe, and eastwards to Mecca, as well as providing a secure source of energy at home.</p>

<p>“Morocco knew their demand for electricity was growing at 7% a year and that they were dependent on imports for 97% of that energy,” Duarte said. “They had a vision to promote renewables at a time when oil prices were high and they undertook regulatory reforms, put institutions in place, and they have done a great job.” </p>

Hi! As I understand it most of the funding comes from banks (please correct me if I am wrong). How does being in debt make one independent?

There is something known as 'molten salt' technology wherein the excess energy generated from sunlight (when available) in stored there. The molten salt slowly gives off the latent heat during the no-sun period thus making possible 24 x 7 power generation. Look up google for more info on 'molten salt'.

This is not photovoltaic. It's concentrated solar power. It redirects sunlight to a central core that heats up all day and stays hot, even when the sun is down. Right now, it stays hot for three hours after sunset, but, when it is complete, it is supposed to operate 20 hours per day.

I think the king of Morocco is a lot more intelligent than the PM of Italy, my country. Mr. Renzi decided to drill offshore in all the Italian seas and to prospect through air-gun the deep sea everywhere around the Italian seas, in the sea parks also. It's not enough for him. Fracking into the soil in addition is necessary. All the people know that Italy is a country under a high earthquake risk. An oil spilling could cause a catasthopical disaster. The Italian seas are some gulfs of a closed Mediterranean sea. It's completely foolish, and stupid too, because the Italian oil fields are poor and the oil has a very bad quality.

Peak energy consumption is not necessarily at night. Here in Switzerland power during the night is a lot cheaper since most businesses/factories are closed and there is more power available than needed. It may be different for countries where it is common to have 24/7 businesses.

Solar electric panels are more efficient at low temperature, but this is a solar thermal system - using solar to boil a liquid and drive turbines which doesn't really benefit.

Furthermore: The panels are FAR more efficient in the cold than in warm weather. With temps around 30 or 40 C the panels take a big performance hit, not so in the cold.

You would do yourself a big, big favour by investigating Integral Fast Reactors (IFRs). IFRs are next generation [Gen IV] reactors and can burn as fuel, what the ill-informed and duplicitous call 'nuclear waste'. I describe it as the UK's most precious energy resource and we have enough of it available now to provide ALL of the UK's energy needs for 500 years. That's energy security for many future generations of all of our families and is unrivalled by any other technology.

The mirrors heat the moltern salt. This then drives turbines though steam production. The storage of heat in the molten salt is therefore part of the normal operation of thermal solar.

Author::::EnviroCapitalist

No it doesn't. If you read through the report you identified, you'll see that solar thermal is listed as a non-despatchable technology. It also states:

PV doesn't use mirror. So how is your quote about PV at all relevant to this. The efficiency drop in PV is related to the narrow area of the NP junction which simple doesn't exist in thermal solar. Trust me your comment is completely irrelevant.



Author::::Tasslehoff

Bear in mind those costs for solar thermal won't include heat storage, which will add capital cost and lower efficiency.

"...You've forgotten to buy fuel for your nuclear plant...." More full time jobs/MWh on offshore wind farms - so labour more expensive. Nuclear fuel costs are such a pittance/MWh, my gut feeling is that oil changes and component failures on offshore turbines will cost more than nuclear fuel/MWh.
