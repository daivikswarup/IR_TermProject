Mark Ruffalo tells Cameron his UK fracking push is an 'enormous mistake'




DateTime::::2016-02-08T06:01:08+0000



<p>David Cameron is making an enormous “legacy mistake” by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/13/shale-gas-fracking-cameron-all-out">going all-out for fracking in the UK</a>, the actor and environmental activist Mark Ruffalo has warned.</p>

<p>The actor, who is famous for his role as the Hulk in the Avenger films and who stars in Spotlight about the Boston Globe’s investigation into Catholic child abuse, is a prominent anti-fracking campaigner who lobbied successfully for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/17/new-york-state-fracking-ban-two-years-public-health">a ban on the controversial technology in New York</a>.</p>

<p>“Mr Cameron, you’re making an enormous mistake, and it’s a legacy mistake. Because there’s no fracking that can be done safely,” he said on a recent visit to the UK.</p>

<p>Ruffalo also accused Cameron of going back on his word by saying he would respect public opinion on hydraulic fracturing, a method of extracting shale gas and oil that has boomed in the US over the last decade.</p>

<p>“Your people don’t want it. You’ve already told them once before that if they didn’t want it, you wouldn’t push them to take it, and you’re turning back on your word, sir. And what is a politician if he’s not credible,” he said in a filmed interview with green group, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/friends-of-the-earth">Friends of the Earth</a>.</p>

<p>More people in the UK oppose fracking than support it, compared to renewable energy which enjoys extremely high levels of public support, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/02/british-opposition-to-fracking-still-outstrips-support-survey-finds">government polling found last week</a>. It revealed that: “those who know more about fracking tend to be more likely to oppose it.”</p>

<p>Ruffalo said the prime minister should heed the implications of the Paris agreement, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era">a historic deal agreed last month at UN talks to curb carbon emissions</a>, and push instead for renewable energy.</p>

<p>“Today we are at the precipice of a renewable energy revolution. This is the new economy,” he said. “This is where all new wealth is going to be created. This is where new jobs are going to be created.”</p>

<p>Since taking power last May, the government has axed or watered down a swath of green measures, including cutting <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/uk-solar-panel-subsidies-slashed-paris-climate-change">solar</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/18/tories-end-onshore-windfarm-subsidies-2016">wind</a> subsidies, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/24/the-9-green-policies-killed-off-by-tory-government">ending favourable taxation for electric cars</a>, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/green-energy-sector-attacks-budget-climate-change-levy">putting a carbon tax on carbon-free electricity generation</a>.</p>

<p>Ruffalo, who <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/16/mark-ruffalo-obama-ban-fracking-shale-gas-un-summit">has made similar calls on Barack Obama to ban fracking in the US</a>, said that Cameron should honour the will of the British people. By doing so he would become a “true and honest” leader by leaving the fossil fuels in the ground, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says">as scientists have called for to avoid dangerous global warming</a>.</p>

<p>However, his plea is unlikely to move Cameron who <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/26/fracking-good-for-uk-cameron">has said</a> fracking is important for energy security and economic growth. His government has aggressively promoted the nascent shale industry and was shown last week <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/01/uk-ministers-make-it-top-priority-to-ensure-nature-laws-do-not-hamper-fracking">to be considering changing rules to take fracking planning applications out of local authorities’ hands</a>. </p>

<p>An appeal hearing begins next week for shale explorer Cuadrilla, over its applications for two fracking sites in Lancashire, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/29/fracking-application-cuadrilla-rejected-lancashire-county-council">which were rejected by the county council last summer</a>. The rejection was quickly followed by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/13/government-will-step-in-if-councils-dont-fast-track-fracking-applications">the government promising to “fast track” fracking applications</a>.</p>

<p>A separate planning decision on a fracking site in North Yorkshire, at Kirby Misperton, was expected this month by the county council but has been delayed to March at the earliest.</p>

<p>Donna Hume, senior campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The government admits that the more people know about fracking, the more they oppose it. That’s why <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-ruffalo">Mark Ruffalo</a>, who has seen the impacts of fracking first-hand, doesn’t want Lancashire to suffer the same impacts as so many states in the US.”</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Department of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> and Climate Change said: “We are backing shale because it’s good for our energy security and will help create jobs and growth.</p>

<p>“There is no question that we need natural gas in the UK and if just 10% of the estimated gas in shale rock could be recovered, it would be enough to meet our energy demand for almost 40 years. We are encouraging safe exploration so we can know for certain how much is there and how much we can get out of the ground.”</p>

Dave has no qualms about going back on his word. He's a professional liar, PR man, and simply says what he thinks is needed in any given situation. He doesn't give a shit except for his dreams of the lucrative conference circuit after 2020.

Yetypu, you often insult those who point out fracking's failings - and you consistently minimise risks. I guess this is linked to the role of a retired oil man.

Thank you for your replies. The responses to my post show how articles can be misconstrued and used - despite their provenance, to promote a certain bias. I still hold to my opinion, based on evidence. As a scientist, I find the fun of science is being proved wrong though! Any thoughts on the 'well' of methane held in clathrates under the permafrost may be released with increased temperature?

So which political party is Mark Ruffalo standing for? None. It's an illegitimate comparison with actual politicians who were actors. Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger or Clint Eastwood acted through democratic channels. Mark Ruffalo seems to be trying to short-circuit democracy.

He could stop being a movie actor. After all, he's campaigning for hundreds of thousands of people that work in the fracking business to stop doing their jobs because they damage the environment, right? So why's he so special?

'We are encouraging safe exploration??? Surely you should be DEMANDING it. Wake up and smell the methane! Fracking will pollute the air that we breathe and water that we drink - if fracking is so great why have many countries banned it - could it be that those governments care about the health and well being of their citizens, unlike here, where money is God.

I get so tired of you, among others, claiming that "fracking leaks methane". Anyone with half a brain can see that claim for the complete nonsense it is. How can hydraulic fracturing leak anything? It is a high pressure process (say 10,000 psi) - if there were any leak of anything, there could not be a high pressure system.

People want warm, pleasant homes. They do not really care whether that's done with passivehouse building physics or a big gas boiler, or some other tech. Although in fact nearly everyone who has tried both finds the former nicer, and likes the fact that it is also much cheaper.

People take notice of celebrities. They don't take much notice of scientists or other experts that they've never heard of. It's the way people work, so celebrities who 'get it'. have taken a genuine interest, and know what they are talking about, are very useful for getting more than just us nerds here to hear what the issues are.

It's awkward when it's your job. Should you chuck it in and retrain? What as? Yes, actors could and should do a whole lot less flying about the place, but they may find it difficult to refuse that travel and still get work for long. Bands that tour and some other musicians have a similar problem, and politicians, and sportspeople, and pilots - their professional carbon footprint is epic... It is true that the actors could simply stop appearing on interview shows in numerous countries - I think the world can live without that, or certainly lot less of it. Do the interviews locally and send the results round the world. But should bands have to stop touring? That's kind of what they exist for. Maybe people will have to just make do with the records and videos. Similarly international sport is very popular - are we prepared to accept that footprint for the collective entertainment value? Maybe restrict it to a couple of intercontinental events/year, as not too excessive. Until someone works out how to do low-carbon flying there are some big questions about how the heavy travellers should behave.

From a Environmental Defense Fund link, they have the "break even" for methane leakage at 3.2%. The US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2009 leakage rate was 2.4% (from well to city).

I suspect this American actor's opposition stems from his concerns that US gas companies were interested in his family's land. If they'd been wind farm corporations instead he'd probably be anti-renewables.
