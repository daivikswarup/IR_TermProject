The all-female patrol stopping South Africa's rhino poachers

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">“T</span></span>he Black Mambas are winning the war on poaching,” insists Siphiwe Sithole. “We have absolutely zero tolerance for rhino poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. The poachers will fall – but it will not be with guns and bullets.”</p>

<p>Sithole and Felicia Mogakane are members of South Africa’s Black Mambas, the world’s first all-female anti-poaching unit that has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/26/worlds-first-all-female-patrol-protecting-south-africas-rhinos">captured the public’s imagination</a>. But it’s their success in reducing rhino deaths and breaking down the barriers between poor communities and elite wildlife reserves that is their most powerful weapon in the war on poaching, and has seen them pick up their second international conservation award this week.</p>

<p>The two women have travelled to London to receive the inaugural Innovation in Conservation award from UK charity <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.helpingrhinos.org/">Helping Rhinos</a>. The award recognises projects “with an inspiring and innovative approach” that have shown positive results in protecting rhino populations. </p>

<p>Since forming in 2013, the Black Mambas have seen a 76% reduction in snaring and poaching incidents within their area of operation in Balule nature reserve in the country’s north-east. As well as the famous big five of rhino, lion, elephant, buffalo and leopard, the 40,000-hectare private reserve is home to zebra, antelope, wildebeest, cheetah, giraffe, hippos, crocodiles and hundreds of species of trees and birds.<br/></p>

<p>In the six months before the Mambas were set up, 16 rhinos were lost in Balule, one of several private reserves bordering Kruger national park. In the 12 months after, fatalities were reduced to just three rhinos.<br/></p>

<p>Thousands of snares to catch animals for bushmeat have been removed, 10 poacher camps destroyed, three bushmeat kitchens put out of action and six poachers arrested. Such is their success that South Africa’s national parks authority is looking at replicating the model, with plans for another team of six female rangers.<br/></p>

<p>Last year the Mambas won the Champions of the Earth prize, the UN’s highest environmental honour, awarded to those showing outstanding courage in fighting the illegal wildlife trade at community level.</p>

<p>“Winning these awards are good because it’s about knowing that people from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica">South Africa</a> love and appreciate what we are doing and they are so happy that there are Mambas,” says Mogakane, 28, who has been with the team from the start. “Unlike some years ago, when they used to say this job is for men, now there are women who are working to protect the wildlife. It means a lot to us and makes us continue to do our job because we know that people are behind us, supporting us.”</p>

<p>The Mambas were founded by Craig Spencer, head warden of Balule, to act as an unarmed but visible frontline presence in the ongoing battle against the poaching of rhino and other endangered species – like the idea of “bobbies on the beat”.<br/></p>

<p>“Craig saw there were men rangers carrying guns but still the rhinos were being killed and lots of animals were being poached,” said 32-year-old Sithole, who has travelled abroad for the first time. “I think he said ‘let me start something and put women on board and see what happen’, because women are more loyal to their jobs, they are passionate about what they do. I think the idea is very good, and it helps reduce the standard of poverty because those women that would be sitting at home will be having something to do.”<br/></p>

<p>The 26 Mambas, all from disadvantaged communities on the border of the park, have been given six weeks of paramilitary training and wildlife education and work alongside 29 armed guards and an intelligence team that seeks to stop the poachers before they can kill.</p>

<p>“When I go to work in the morning, I wonder if I [am] going to come back, because there are poachers in the bush and dangerous animals,” Mogakane says. “But, we are used to it, because we’re trained.”</p>

<p>Day-to-day duties include patrols of up to 20km a day on foot and by vehicle at night, pulling out snares, conducting roadblocks and assisting with tracking collars.<br/></p>

<p>A key area is the western boundary fence, which borders hundreds of thousands of impoverished villages and is a potential way into the protected parks network for poachers.<br/></p>

<p>Mogakane says: “Firstly, poaching was for bushmeat. People say ‘we don’t have jobs so we must go inside the reserve and poach some impala so that we can sell it and get some money to buy groceries for our family’. In most cases now, people come in for rhinos, because they want to get rich, drive some fancy cars and build a nice house.”<br/></p>

<p>South Africa has the largest population of rhinos in the world, estimated at 19,000. The country has seen a huge spike in the rate of rhino poaching in recent years, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/06/rhino-with-hacked-off-horn-filmed-in-south-african-safari-park">many of these incidents taking place</a> in protected national parks like Kruger. Last year <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/160121-rhino-poaching-statistics-South-Africa-trade-lawsuit/">1,175 rhinos were poached</a> – the first year that numbers had not risen since the alarming trend began after 2007, when just 13 were killed.<br/></p>

<p>Rhino horn has become so valuable the conservationists warn the species could become extinct in 10 years. </p>

<p>It is considered a status symbol in Vietnam and China, where the growth of the middle class has led to an explosion in demand for the horn, which is ground down and used as a traditional medicinal cure and recreational drug. International criminal syndicates are known to charge <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.earthtouchnews.com/environmental-crime/illegal-trade/top-10-shocking-figures-of-the-illegal-rhino-horn-trade">£60,000 a kilo</a> for an illegal substance that is worth more than gold but is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/13/richard-branson-fronts-nail-biting-campaign-against-rhino-poaching">no different from human fingernails</a>.<br/></p>

<p>Money is driving much of the poaching, the Mambas say. A night in a luxury suite in one of the local game reserves – seen as the preserve of rich tourists – can cost at least £250. In many cases, people living in the surrounding villages don’t have access to these reserves – or their profits. With more than 85% of the local population unemployed, some see it as more valuable to hunt the rhino rather than preserve it. <br/></p>

<p>Sithole said: “Some of the people who are doing these things went to school with us … you come to ask yourself why are they doing this? Why has this person turned his mind to become a killer? To destroy our nature? It feels very sad and what they are doing is very wrong.”<br/></p>

<p>It is hoped the Mambas can bridge this gap by showing that local black people from disadvantaged communities can get jobs and education in the reserves too. Being role models for “social upliftment”, and educating the local community is how the war on poaching will be won – not with guns and bullets, they say.<br/></p>

<p>Mogakane supports 10 family members with her salary, which enables her to buy groceries and pay for school fees for her two young boys. “If I weren’t doing this, I would be sitting at home without a job because jobs are scarce in South <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a>. So this is a big opportunity for me because I am able to take care of my family.”<br/></p>

<p>The Mambas have also started an outreach programme called Bush Babies with 10 local schools. “Before we started it people were not aware,” Sithole says. “But now we teach the kids and they go back home and send the messages to their parents. They might know now that if they continue to do this we might end up without any rhino.”</p>

This is outstanding work they're doing. Education is fundamental to end the demand in Asia. But its reassuring to know there's a resistance in place to delay their extinction until the root of the problem can be addressed.

The Black Mambas 'How to Donate' fundraising webpage has some errors. For one thing, "http://www.penniesforeles.com/" returns a server error, and for another, fundraising for the Mambas' Bush Baby education campaign closed on November 14 of last year. Also, the "Just Giving" link on the 'Helping Rhinos' section of the page is for charities, not donors.

Selected trophy hunting (not of rhinos) with a significant percentage of the fees going to the local villagers would involve the locals patrolling the parks and preventing rhino slaughter. Capture rhinos and replace their horns with a synthetic substitute. BTW I like the coy reference to traditional medicine. Rhino horn is marketed as an aphrodisiac. The blue pill people should set up a fact based advertising campaign proving how their product gives you more bangs for your buck.

The life cycle of the rhino. How long is it from birth until there is an adult with a horn?

It would, however, be much better if there were more high-level agreement, co-operation, international enforcement and support. Then perhaps women in Africa wouldn't need to put themselves in the gun sights of illegal traffickers. These are very, very brave women.

Farm the Rhinos!That would provide employment & meat for the locals. And sell the horn, at auction, to the super-rich.Win, win, win, that's three wins all round! Any problems?

You fail to stress the most salient point. It is a private initiative on a private game reserve. The Head Ranger Craig Spencer is to be commended. Out in the real world of South Africa corruption and collusion with the poachers is alive and well and already 178 Rhino have been killed this year.

Im say shoot the poachers, then use their "horns" to make afrodisiacs for rhinos. Might want to shoot zookeepers too, and then release the innocent animals into the wild, and start imprisoning a lot of human criminals out there on the loose.

It's really a shame that so many African leaders and their cronies steal all the country's wealth instead of investing in their people. Offering jobs, basic fundamental human rights and services such as health and education.

As do the private parks themselves, to ensure that local communities benefit from their tourist trade. Consider that just one of those women is supporting 10 relatives.

I did a safari tour in Zimbabwe a few years ago. Our guide was a former anti-poaching worker, but he told us that he had given it up to become a guide since it was too dangerous. The poachers are often armed and don't want to get caught, so both sides shoot to kill. I applaud the work these women are doing but I worry for their safety.More needs to be done to educate people in those Asian countries who believe that rhino horn has special properties. Until then, the horn will always be valuable and poaching will always be a danger, both to rhino and to these women.

Anti-poaching park rangers can be men or women of even 16 year old teenagers.All you need is a willingness to adopt a Shoot To Kill (no prisoners) policy against poachers. And arm each of them with high power assault rifles + 4 fully loaded magazines with live rounds.If the park rangers have no Stopping Ability against poachers and they are there just for show; then might as well not have them around.

I see the SA government (ANC) publicist has been putting out the 'good news' again. By all means, I wish these people all the best. However, the reason poaching has seen this massive soar since 2009 (does that year ring a bell?) is no doubt because officials are involved and getting backhanders for turning a blind eye. If the government really wanted to stamp out this vile trade, it has the resources and enough people who'd gladly volunteer to do so.

Some will be well of but most will be desperately poor with families with little access to health care and education. I can deplore their actions without losing my sense of shared humanity with them. Funnily enough in the UK we revere poachers of legend. Robin Hood was one.

I live in South America and am coming to the conclusion that if you need something done, actually done, executed, carried out, completed, then women are the key. I suspect that a similar macho mentality exists in their society and great to hear of a success story. The trick will be maintaining the momentum and ensuring this is not a flash in the pan. Very best of luck to them and well deserved on their awards.
