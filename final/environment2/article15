World's biggest floating solar farm powers up outside London




DateTime::::2016-02-29T11:44:26+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>n a vast manmade lake on the outskirts of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a>, work is nearing completion on what will soon be Europe’s largest floating solar power farm – and will briefly be the world’s biggest.</p>

<p>But few are likely to see the 23,000 solar panels on the Queen Elizabeth II reservoir at Walton-on-Thames, which is invisible to all but Heathrow passengers and a few flats in neighbouring estates.</p>

<p>“This will be the biggest floating solar farm in the world for a time - others are under construction,” said Angus Berry, energy manager for Thames <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/water">Water</a>, which owns the site. “We are leading the way, but we hope that others will follow, in the UK and abroad.”</p>

<p>Five years in planning and due to be finished in early March, the £6m project will generate enough electricity to power the utility’s local water treatment plants for decades. The energy will help provide clean drinking water to a populace of close to 10 million people in greater London and the south-east of England, a huge and often unrecognised drain on electricity, rather than nearby homes. </p>

<p>Why put solar panels on water? The answer, according to Berry, is that the water is there, and might as well be used for this purpose. Floating panels, covering only about 6% of the reservoir, will have no impact on the ecosystem, he says. </p>

<p>Though waterbirds, including moorhens and gulls, live on the margins, and a thin scum of litter is visible at the shore, the reservoir is not intended as a home to wildlife, and any fish living here are accidental visitors. Eighteen metres deep, it provides water for Londoners in a constantly churning stream. Although most of the population growth in London tends to be towards the east, most of the water still comes from reservoirs to the west of the city.</p>

<p>But future projects to make use of water companies’ reservoirs in order to provide solar power might be in doubt, Berry said. </p>

<p>The current government has slashed subsidies for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/uk-solar-panel-subsidies-slashed-paris-climate-change">solar</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/18/tories-end-onshore-windfarm-subsidies-2016">wind power</a>. Berry said that this would not affect the QEII project, but might have an effect on whether follow-up projects could go ahead. “We have had to look very closely at the economics of this, at all stages,” he said. “It is not clear what the future economics would be [for other potential projects].”</p>

<p>A similar floating solar farm with around half the capacity of the Thames Water project <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://corporate.unitedutilities.com/4053.aspx">is being built by water company United Utilities on a reservoir near Manchester</a>. Construction of an even bigger farm - at 13.7MW more than twice the QEII farm - <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/27/japan-begins-work-on-worlds-largest-floating-solar-farm">is underway on a reservoir in land-scarce Japan</a> and due to finish in 2018.</p>

<p>Putting solar panels on the water for the QEII scheme has not required planning permission, though big arrays of similar panels on land require official sanction. The government <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/17/ministers-claims-that-solar-panels-harm-uk-food-security-are-false">has decided</a> to ban farmers who put solar arrays on agricultural land from receiving EU subsidies for the land.</p>

<p>More than 23,000 solar panels will be floated by developer Lightsource Renewable <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> at the reservoir near Walton-on-Thames, representing 6.3MW of capacity, or enough to generate the equivalent electricity consumption of about 1,800 homes.</p>

<p>The reservoir was commissioned in 1962, and remains one of the biggest serving London. Thames Water said that plans for a “super-sewer” under London would not affect the solar power project.</p>

A little bit. In midsummer, I can get about 4% extra by spraying water on my solar panels. I lose over 50% if a cloud covers the panels.

Actually, the former. plus the minor fact that it's near Heathrow, so having 150 metre tall spinning devices would do no favours to things like ATC radar....

Plus they are cooled by the water which should help efficiency even further.

Maintenance, moving parts cost more, it's better to just have a static panel with high efficiency.

"boondoggles"?

Can you think of another power source that reduces carbon emissions and is not dependent upon weather or the time of day for its energy generation?

Author::::whateverpoiuyt
DateTime::::2016-03-02T11:26:44Z
These boondoggles always seem to appear on inshore bodies of water. Presumably because the sea is too harsh an environment for them (or at least, cheaply). Wave goodbye to many potential nature reserves, say hello to RSPB NIMBY against floating solar farms, and a new form of special pleading from the lobby about how reservoirs were "never natural in the first place" etc. etc. etc.



Author::::peccadillo
DateTime::::2016-03-02T11:26:02Z
Perhaps because digging foundations in a reservoir would cause it to leak, and the spoil during construction would render the water undrinkable.

Correction to typo, £0.005 per kWh per hour. Also you could effectively say that the cost will be £0.02 per kWh per hour if you assume 6hours of production per day (i.e. when the sun is out!)



Author::::James B Lofthouse
DateTime::::2016-03-01T20:05:51Z
You are correct, its just under £1000.00 per kWh, however you have failed to grasp that the panels will produce for around 20-25 years (albeit with diminishing capacity). So take that over 20 years that's then £47.62 per kWh per year, or £0.13 per kWh per day, therein it works out at £0.0005 per kWh per hour or 0.5 pence. so not so bad. This cost will increase due to operation and maintenance costs but its electricity for less than a penny per kWh for the capital expenditure.

Hang on! a £6 million project producing 6.3MW is that good value for money, I calculate that's just short of £1,000 per kW.

You'' usually see 16 panels max on a house, because they're 250W each, so 16 panels makes 4kW. That's the point at which FiTs payments used to make the most money for the householder - i.e., if you had 4.25kW, your payments went down into the next "band" of the payment regime, so you could end up buying more, and getting less income. Of course, that was before the Levy Control Framework limit was reached and FiTs rates dropped dramatically. You may start to see much bigger systems appearing on houses now as the 'cliff edge' of 4kW no longer exists.

DCLG and Defra won't allow ground mount pv to be built on high quality arable farmland. Our farmland is classified 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 4 and 5, with 1 being the highest quality. Planning guidance will only allow ground mount pv schemes to be built on 3b, 4 and 5.

Damn good question. There's a whole host of empty green space around the runways too. The planes don't need it - they'd be knackered if they ran off the runway anyway so why not install pv all over the grassy areas to the sides ??
