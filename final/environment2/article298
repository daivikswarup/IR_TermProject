Most electrical goods bought online have misleading energy labels, study finds




DateTime::::2016-03-02T05:01:16+0000



<p>Most electrical goods bought online have either been given a misleading energy label or none at all, according to a three-year survey across 11 European countries.</p>

<p>By law, energy performance energy labels for products such as dishwashers, ovens and fridges must be displayed as prominently on a website as they are in shops.</p>

<p> But a study by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.market-watch.eu/about-us/">MarketWatch</a>, a group of civil society organisations, found that 20% of online goods had no label, 1% had the wrong label, and 35% were displayed in outdated or inaccessible forms. </p>

<p>These included pop-up boxes that consumers could only find by scrolling down to poorly advertised links at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Up to 10% of Europe’s expected energy savings by 2020 could be lost as a result of non-compliant products, the paper says - as much as the current residential electricity consumption of central and east <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>.</p>

<p>Alun Jones, a researcher for the report said: “Energy labels could save households €465 on their energy bills each year but, with increasing numbers of consumers buying and researching their products online, the widespread mislabeling and no-labelling of products could lead many to miss out on their share of savings”.</p>

<p>Polls suggest that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2719087/ONS-Three-quarters-Britons-shop-online-half-use-internet-banking.html">three quarters of Britons</a> now buy goods online, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.brandview.com/2015/10/over-half-of-shoppers-research-white-goods-products-online/">more than a third</a> of UK shoppers taking to the web to find electronic homes appliances.<br/></p>

<p>Yet only a quarter of white goods sold online in the UK in last year’s MarketWatch inspections were correctly labelled. Half had no energy information at all.<br/></p>

<p>While all British wine storage appliances were correctly labelled across physical and online stores, the same was only true for 18% of dishwashers, 20% of washer-driers, and 32% of TVs. </p>

<p>Range hood extractor fans were the worst labelled British product with 74% receiving an inaccurate description.</p>

<p>The energy description of goods in UK high street stores is improving but 49% of home appliances sold there last year were still wrongly labelled, if at all.</p>

<p>Small retailers, independent shops and kitchen stores were particularly poor performers but websites emerged as “by far the biggest area of concern,” according to Jones, who is also a spokesman for the Coolproducts campaign.</p>

<p>Angeliki Malizou, an energy expert for the European consumers organisation BEUC said: “This study comes as no surprise. Consumer groups have repeatedly flagged problems with labels incorrectly displayed on websites. </p>

<p>“Online shopping is becoming consumers’ daily bread. That’s why it is key that information on energy consumption and efficiency is easily accessible before purchase. EU states need to step up their efforts to ensure that traders play by the rules in the online world.”</p>

<p>The Italian MEP Dario Tamburrano told the Guardian he was “astonished” that the situation had arisen at a time when online commerce was growing by 18% a year.<br/></p>

<p>“It should be easier for market surveillance authorities to check compliance in the online environment than in brick-and-mortar shops, but this is not happening,” he said. “We need to reinforce surveillance, to empower citizens with improved information and to better define [producer] roles and responsibilities.” </p>

<p>The results of the MarketWatch report, which surveyed more than 150,000 products <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.market-watch.eu/about-us/">retailing at 151 physical shops and 118 online vendors</a>, will be shared with national market surveillance authorities.</p>

<p>Industry lobbying in Brussels helped to create the current system in which products can be awarded A+, A++ or A+++ energy labels, which have caused some confusion to shoppers. The lowest grade for a washing machine energy label at present is A+.</p>

<p>The EU plans <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://euobserver.com/energy/129764">to return to a straight A-G scale</a> for energy labels in the near future.</p>

In Australia, all white goods must display a comprehensive energy rating and can't be imported unless they have a minimum efficiency. All the data is published on a government website so you can compare efficiency, annual running costs, etc. Don't they have this in the UK?

Oh man, the rest of the world will never get the significance of the UL label. In other words, an "independent" lab is compensated to certify the safety of electrically-powered consumer products. All is well in spite of consumers that feel compelled to iron clothes or blow-dry their hair in the midst of a bath.

You mean like Volkswagen? And the rest of the car industry making diesels that emit several times the NOx on the road that they claim on the government type approval? How about Which calculating their own refrigerator cost to run figures because labels can overestimate the capacity by 25%? http://www.which.co.uk/energy/saving-money/guides/energy-labels-explained/fridge-and-freezer-energy-labels/

Not a criticism, just an observation.

An outdated label is clearly misleading.

That's 25% more than the Wind Turbines and Solar Panels sold here on the Guardian.

I disagree. An outdated label is clearly misleading. If you cannot easily find the information then this is misleading customers by omission. It is effectively the same as not displaying the information, given that it will always be possible for someone to track down the information if they are determined to do so.

Weirdly, given your past commenting history, this appears to be intended as a criticism of government involvement.

You have to explain why the outdated or inaccessible form is factually wrong, which you don't do.

That's why the energy labels show an annualised figure.

Most buyers have no confidence in the labels anyway. The closer you look, the less they reflect how products are actually used. Where manufacturers do pay attention, they appear to game the system to the point of fraud. Volkswagen was only the tip of a large iceberg.

Has it occurred to you that your monitor might be fake, and did not originate from the manufacturer whose name it bears? What you can do is complain to the manufacturer, who will either replace the power unit or inform you if it is fake. There is a lot of fake stuff originating mainly from China, and even large retail chains sometimes get caught out inadvertently buying fakes while beleving them to be genuine.

But where did you buy it from? There is a lot of cheap far eastern rubbish out there. I do buy stuff off the web but I have got a darn site more careful about what I buy from where. Very minor but the batteries for my car key, bought some of them, all looked genuine but didn't last very long. Got them from RS this time. New vacuum, phoned Sebo and said, are these people an official supplier?

The labelling system is flawed anyway due to performance inflation.

You say this:



Author::::Anteaus
DateTime::::2016-03-02T08:09:34Z
A point to be aware of is that the ratings plates on appliances state the absolute max consumption, which might only occur in rare circumstances or for short periods. They should not be taken as an indication of running costs.



Author::::EnviroCapitalist

Don't worry. They can get an energy label and save €465 per year. (My energy label says "needs coffee").
