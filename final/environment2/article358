Smallest of giant flowers ‘accidentally’ discovered in the Philippines

<p>In the rainforests of southeastern Asia, a parasitic plant called <em>Rafflesia </em>produces the world’s largest flowers. Some <em>Rafflesia </em>flowers, for instance, can be a meter and a half in diameter, and can weigh up to 22 pounds (or 10 kilograms). These flowers, called “corpse flower” locally, often smell like rotting flesh.</p>

<p>Now, on Luzon Island in the Phillipines, a team of scientists have <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-02/pp-wso022316.php">discovered</a> the smallest of these giant flowers.</p>

<p>When fully expanded, this newly discovered flower has an average diameter of 9.73 cm, making it a “dwarf” among all known <em>Rafflesia </em>species, researchers write in a new study published in the journal <em><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.61.7295">PhytoKeys</a></em>. And unlike its larger cousins, this small flower smells like coconut, the New York Times <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/science/the-newest-and-smallest-biggest-flower.html">reports</a>.</p>

<p>The discovery was serendipitous, researchers say. Lead researcher Prof Perry S. Ong’s colleague was walking in a forest on Luzon Island when he accidentally tripped over a pile of forest litter, exposing a small decaying flower. This flower, the researchers found, belonged to a new <em>Rafflesia </em>species.</p>

<p>Ong, and his team, have named the new species <em>Rafflesia consueloae</em> in honor of Consuelo ‘Connie’ Rufino Lopez, lifelong partner of Filipino industrialist Oscar M. Lopez.</p>

<p><em>Rafflesia consueloae</em> may have set a new world record, but this dwarf is on the verge of extinction, researchers say.</p>

<p>Only two populations of <em>R. consueloae</em> are known from two mountain sites, Mt Balukbok and Mt Pantaburon. These mountain are about two kilometers (1.24 miles) apart, and occur within the Pantabangan-Carranglan Watershed. Severely threatened by deforestation, these mountain sites now have only remnants of tropical lowland evergreen rainforests, the authors write.</p>

<p>“Following the IUCN Categories and Criteria, we regard this species as Critically Endangered,” they add. “Continued protection of the <em>R. consueloae</em> populations and other biodiversity in the area needs to be ensured as some local people still hunt wildlife there and forest fires are likely in the dry season.”</p>

<p><em>R. consueloae</em> is the sixth species of <em>Rafflesia</em> to be discovered from Luzon Island, and the thirteenth from the entire Philippine archipelago. Like its giant cousins, <em>R. consueloae</em> has no distinct roots, stems or leaves of its own, and is a parasite. It depends on its host plants for water and nutrients.</p>

It's along the lines of "Pygmy hippopotamus" - imagine how excited we'd be if we found a living population of miniature elephants?

'Small giant flower discovered'. Is everyone sure that it's not just an ordenary flower?

Gosh that is quite exciting. People at Kew will be sweating with anticipation on getting their hands on some cells to propagate. Smaller versions of Rafflesia species will have a better chance of diversification and natural survival in any sort of future.

Yes, when something is discovered ‘accidentally’ it somehow raises my spirits, I don't know why.

I love it when new plants and animals are discovered. Makes me see how complex and wonderful our world is.
