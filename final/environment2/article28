Germany and Austria call for higher EU 2030 climate ambition

<p>Germany, Austria, Portugal and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> are leading calls for the EU to increase its 2030 climate targets in light of December’s Paris agreement.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>At a webcast meeting of environment ministers on Friday, they criticised the European commission for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/03/02/eu-plans-no-change-to-climate-target-before-2030/">advising</a> no change was needed.</p>

<p>Several others spoke of the need to fully participate in the five-yearly reviews of national climate plans set out in the UN text.</p>

<p>Officials’ response to the historic international pact lacked “oomph”, said Austria’s Andrä Rupprechter. “We would have expected more in the way of ambition.”</p>

<p>Back in October 2014, members of the 28-state bloc agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions “at least 40%” from 1990 levels by 2030.</p>

<p>That left the door open to increasing efforts, subject to a strong international deal.</p>

<p>The Paris pact set a tougher global goal than many observers expected, to hold temperature rise this century “well below” 2C and aim for 1.5C.</p>

<p>Yet Germany’s Jochen Flasbarth noted references to “at least” had disappeared, describing the communication as “very weak” on that point.</p>

<p>Carole Dieschbourg, Luxembourg minister and one of the EU’s lead negotiators in Paris, called for the 2030 framework to be updated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t waste time,” she said. “We might find that our credibility is undermined if we don’t do this.”</p>

<p>Other member states rejected the case for a higher target, however, with Hungary, Lithuania and Italy saying it was already hard to achieve.</p>

<p>“This is not a time for divisive issues such as raising ambition,” said Italy’s Gian Luca Galletti.</p>

<p>It comes as the EU embarks on reforms of its emissions trading scheme (ETS) and negotiations over effort-sharing between countries. Both are fiercely contentious.</p>

<p>On the ETS, environmentalists argue radical changes are needed to push the carbon price up from current lows of €5 (£3.9) a tonne and spur clean investment.</p>

<p>They face off with heavy industrial lobbies who complain this will make them uncompetitive, if not matched by similar measures overseas.</p>

<p>For emissions not covered by the carbon market, there will be tussles over how to allocate national responsibility for the 40% goal. Hungary argued that needed to be settled before countries could ratify the Paris deal.</p>

<p>Ségolène Royal, France’s environment minister and president of the climate talks since colleague Laurent Fabius <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/02/15/laurent-fabius-quits-as-un-climate-talks-president/">stepped down last month</a>, urged swift ratification.</p>

<p>France hopes to start its national process before a UN signing ceremony in New York next month and complete the formalities this summer.</p>

<p>It was important to reflect the 1.5C goal in revisions to the ETS, she added. “We have to ensure that we are very much at the forefront of low carbon economies.”</p>

<p>At the New York meeting, the World Bank will convene a high level panel on carbon pricing, Royal highlighted. By encouraging taxes and trading schemes worldwide, it could address some concerns about “carbon leakage”.</p>

If they can tighten the targets and move them forwards, then this is good news.

So a lot of hand-waving, what-ifs,..., but the truth remains that German emissions are still large and actually grew last year.

It is ok to have targets as you describe as long as there is no legal responsibility to achieve the targets.The UN sets aspirational targets all the time, in many areas,such as their Sustainability Goals or their target to keep warmingto under 1.5C. Since no country actually commits to achieve thesegoals, they are rather meaningless; but they have been writtendown in any case.

No a more realistic target is one that corresponds with the natural constraints of the physical world. A target that is distilled from economics and politics only is an unrealistic target. It's not a matter of what is politically or economically achievable, it's a matter of hands being forced by the natural response to these low targets.

Germany and Poland are free to lead by example and reduce their own carbon dioxide emissions, I wouldn't want to be hanging by my balls waiting for that to happen though.

A few parts per million carbon dioxide are swamped by water vapour and clouds created by deep cosmic radiation. The UN IPCC global quest for government just keeps on rolling on. Only the next ice age will stop them. By that time readers of the Guardian will be brainwashed to think that cold is hot. It's the sun stupid!

Your fantasies are probably one topic you know quite a lot about. Your problem is you cannot differentiate them from real life.

A realistic target would be one that has at leastsome hope of being achieved.The global goals are now that there will be more emissions in2030 than there is today, as outlined in each country's non- binding INDC. The hope is that these goals will be achieved.

Winfried Kretschmann (Greens) has governed Baden-Württemberg since May 2012 (in a coalition with the SPD). Apparently he did it so successfully that the citizens want more of it...

Yes, Europe's reduction targets for 2030 are too low to live up to the Paris15 commitment of keeping the temperature rise under 2C. Seeing that both January as well as February just gone have tracked well over 1C higher than average, a 2030 target of 0 emissions would be more realistic.

Germany has net exports of electricity to Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria and Luxembourg. Their exports of electricity have risen to 10% of their production. They could cut a significant amount of coal generation capacity and make a significant reduction in their CO2 output.

Germany and Austria want stronger targets, action taken.Others, perhaps including Poland, the UK, Hungary, Italy etc.,would like weaker targets or maybe no targets.They should and probably will discuss this over the next 10-15 years.The rest of the world recognizes that there are no commitments madein the aspirational Paris agreement but will likely watch, with some interest, what the EU comes up with.

There is no future for nuclear power. Neither is it save enough nor is it enviromentally friendly in the long run. Those who call nuclear power clean energy are deluded.

No. It is trying to block the state subsidy element.

I don't see why nuclear is even necessary. Southern Europe is blessed by sun most of the year, and the Atlantic Coast and North Sea with wind. It's just a matter of Europe acting as one rather than fragmented bits. We really need a 'concert of Europe' for the 21st century. Having an integrated transmission network can bring solar power up from Greece and Spain into Central and Western Europe, as well as offshore wind power.

Indeed it is (or maybe was - I thought that their objection had been overruled?) They are welcome not to use nuclear (they may well be able to do without it), but telling other countries in the EU to decarbonise without it really isn't helpful.

Isn't Austria trying to block our nuclear power station? That is hardly going to help achieve targets
