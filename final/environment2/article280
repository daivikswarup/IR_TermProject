Kids ask US presidential candidates to debate science




DateTime::::2016-01-14T11:00:22+0000



<p>Susanlyn Singroy thinks the candidates for US president should be debating science. The eighth-grader argues that the candidates are talking about money, religion and immigration, but rarely mentioning the science challenges impacting her future. Singroy says,</p>

<p><em>If they talk about the big science issues, maybe they’ll actually do something about them.</em></p>

<p>Her point is well taken. The Republican and Democratic candidates for president both held debates just days after the Paris climate summit, yet the debate moderators didn’t ask a single question about climate science—remarkable considering that climate change has emerged as a major global science, economic, environmental, tech, civil infrastructure, and foreign policy challenge. US journalists have similarly avoided asking the candidates about other major science, health, tech, and environmental issues.</p>

<p>So Susan, who wants to be a scientist, decided to volunteer with other kids to create what may be the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvTr9z9e3MA">most memorable political ad</a> you’ll see all year:</p>

<p>I’m chair of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://sciencedebate.org/">sciencedebate.org</a>, the volunteer-run nonprofit that produced the ad. We’re working with Susanlyn and other kids elevate these issues in the US political dialogue, because they disproportionately affect the next generation. <br/></p>

<p>Candidates for president attend debates dedicated to economics and foreign policy, but science issues now have an equal or greater impact. Voters—and their kids—deserve a nationally televised discussion dedicated to science, health, tech and the environment.</p>

<p>The public seems to agree. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ScienceDebate.org">ScienceDebate.org</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.researchamerica.org/">Research!America</a>, a nonprofit that advocates for medical research, recently commissioned a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://sciencedebate.org/Poll2015">national poll</a>. We found that 87% of likely voters think the candidates for president ought to be well versed on science issues. 91% of Democrats, 88% of Republicans and 78% of Independents also said the presidential candidates should participate in a debate to discuss key science-based challenges facing the US. </p>

<p>What would such a debate look like? The possibilities for questions are fascinating, and could fill hours of discussion. Here’s a small sample:</p>

<p>Americans deserve answers to these questions, and thinking about them now will make the candidates better qualified for the job they seek in November.</p>

Teaching a very complex issue like global temperature developments over two centuries to these young kids is a travesty. It is purely done to get "good" PR pronouncements from these Innocent kid's mouths. Teach it in College.

Yes, I see that now.In any case, this is a pathetic stunt.Unlike what it says in the headline, these kids are not actuallyasking these questions of candidates. They are not meetingthe candidates. This rubbish is merely being posted on someenvironmental blog.

Environmental activists provide questions to young kids to pose to candidates.Susanlyn (above) has been told that she would like to be a scientist,or at least that she should say that. She wouldn't know much about that or about environmental issues as of yet because she is only 8.She would probably know that it is hard to be green. Most kids herage would be fans of Kermit.

Try reading my comment more carefully, I didn't claim they were attributed to the kids. I pointed out they were questions children would not ask, unless they were brainwashed by adults.

The only insight they get is from the biased media, and alarmist adults.I am careful in pointing out how the media slants, and misrepresents events to my children.

A year or two ago it was trendy for the idiotic politicians Republican voters often choose as representatives to dodge questions about climate change by beginning their response, "I'm not a scientist..." followed by some pathetic reason for inaction.

Of course, in defense of some of us here in America, and one political party in particular, I must point out that the vast majority of Democrats support taking many kinds of steps and actions to combat climate change. In fact, the poll I've linked to below suggest that even many Republicans seem to now support taking action, which is a hopeful sign. The obvious problem is that the GOP at the national level largely represents the denier-side of the equation, and the GOP currently controls both the House and Senate and thus all new legislation. It stinks, but its true: even this warm winter, until the GOP departs from Cloud Cuckoo Land and returns to scientific reality, we're rather more likely to see more snowballs surface in Congress than a carbon tax bill.

"Science is always wrong." This was said by a scientist (can't remember who) But what he meant was that a single contradiction can destroy a theory, and as we pursue knowledge and find facts that are contrary to out expectations we need re-evaluate our theories and work out why the contrary exists and modify our theories to fit the observed facts. It's called Scientific Method. It's all we have through which we can understand reality. Of course, those who find this concept difficult will call on the power of God to explain the unexplainable, and commit the logic error of jumping from a singularity to a universal conclusion as one of our National Party ministers did one day in Canberra, (Look, today is freezing cold; that proves climate warming is rubbish.) Denial implies some sort of underlying rational as it's basis; rather I would call it stupidity.

What a mean thing to ask. These poor candidates have a bad enough time rehearsing their soundbites. To actually expect a real debate, and on science is as likely as a manned mission to Pluto taking off next week.

Internet-related questions are definitely technology (The issue was actually science and technology).The immigration thing threw me, but what they are getting at is how hard is it to get foreigners who know about particular tech into the country for specific jobs. The general process of making it very hard to get in is a huge drag on companies who want to bring smart people in for specific jobs (I see this all the time in my work). That is a science/tech related question.

Anyone can get such results on a poll with leading questions.More important are the surveys taken in the US and Canada beforeelections. They ask which issues are the voters considering beforemaking their choice.The general topic of 'the environment' comes in 7th place in both countries.This would be everything concerning the environment, not just climate change.

I think Dana is saying that the president of the USA should not be an ignoramus. He is not saying if he is not 'well versed in science' that makes him an ignoramus.
