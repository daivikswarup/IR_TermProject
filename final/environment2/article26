Why green groups have a right to be heard on the EU referendum




DateTime::::2016-03-07T15:37:40+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>n a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12184133/EU-referendum-Britains-biggest-environmental-charities-using-public-cash-to-call-for-In-vote.html">front-page story</a> in Monday’s Telegraph, Eurosceptic MPs and “charity transparency” campaigners have joined forces to fulminate against environmental groups for daring to express their view on the EU referendum.</p>

<p>This move, their argument runs, will “infuriate” the organisations’ supporters and may even be in breach of Charity Commission rules. A Telegraph <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/12185485/Charities-and-the-EU.html">editorial</a> goes as far as accusing “many charities” of wanting Britain to stay in the EU because they receive money from Brussels.</p>

<p>As it happens, Greenpeace doesn’t receive a penny from the EU, UK, or any other government. And the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35743285">new guidelines</a> published today by the charity watchdog stop well short of barring charities from joining the debate about the referendum.</p>

<p>So what is all the fuss about? This intervention bears all the hallmarks of an underhand attempt to silence civil society groups who don’t share the Brexit camp’s views. The same politicians who have clamoured to have an in-out referendum now want to decide who has a right to join the debate and who hasn’t. They don’t want to play the ball, so they play the person instead.<br/></p>

<p>People have been hearing about the pros and cons of a stay or leave vote from ministers, business leaders, foreign governments and even the bosses of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-referendum-bmw-warns-staff-at-uk-companies-owned-by-german-car-giant-of-brexit-risks-a6908676.html">German car maker</a>. Industry groups are telling us how they think the outcome of the referendum will affect UK businesses. </p>

<p>Why shouldn’t environmental groups be allowed to explain how that same decision will impact our environment and quality of life?<br/></p>

<p>Whatever you think of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a>, quitting it will have serious repercussions for the future of our environment. Many things we care about have been improved and protected by the EU. We have the EU to thank for higher standards on air and water pollution, waste and recycling, biodiversity conservation, regulation of chemicals, energy conservation and marine protection, to name just a few.</p>

<p>Whether you care about wildlife protection or sewage in our oceans and on our beaches, the EU has played a leading role in making sure that the UK keeps to a high standard of environmental protection.<br/></p>

<p>Challenges like air pollution and climate change don’t stop at borders, nor do the bees, birds, and marine creatures we want to protect. Whether we like it or not, we all have a shared environment in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>. It applies to the air we breathe and the seas we swim in, and we need to govern them together.<br/></p>

<p>Take bees for example. Across Europe, nearly one in 10 wild bee species are under threat of extinction and many species are in decline in the UK. The EU, in 2013, voted to restrict the use of three pesticides (called neonicotinoids) that are strongly linked to the decline of bees. The UK government <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/13/owen-paterson-ban-pesticides-bees">lobbied against the restrictions</a>. </p>

<p>So if the EU hadn’t stepped in, our bees would be in even more danger. Of course all EU standards aren’t perfect. The EU’s agriculture and fisheries policies have historically been poor for wildlife. But two things are for certain. First, we can only make standards better from the inside and, secondly, if we were not in the EU it is very unlikely UK standards would be any better.<br/></p>

<p>The UK being a player in both setting EU standards and in EU-led international negotiations also means that we, as a powerful group of countries with over 500 million people, can hold each other and multinational corporations to account. </p>

<p>A good example of this is air pollution. Recently a UK <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/29/supreme-court-orders-uk-to-draw-up-air-pollution-cleanup-plan">supreme court judgment </a>ordered our government to do more on air pollution to bring it into line with EU standards. Without that judgment - the direct result of EU legislation - we wouldn’t have had any recourse to challenge our government for breaching these standards. A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2448974/study-how-eu-air-quality-rules-are-helping-to-save-80-000-lives-a-year">recent study</a> of the bloc’s air quality regulations concluded that they are saving 80,000 lives per year thanks to the technological advances they have driven.</p>

<p>Cross-border cooperation will be crucial to tackling many of the challenges we face. If we can’t work together as Europeans to stop climate change, what does that say about our chances of working together globally? </p>

<p>As we turn away from the fossil fuel age and look to new and exciting innovations like electric vehicles, clean energy and a new circular economy that eliminates waste, only the EU’s size and scale can set the right framework. The EU is the world’s largest trading bloc. It drives these new opportunities for green investment by passing laws that create standards and a level playing field for all businesses. </p>

<p>We have a far better chance of tackling the environmental challenges we face by working from within the EU than by cutting ourselves off from it.</p>

Didn't Cameron suggest he would seek to be part of TTIP or of a similar deal if we left the EU? I know the US has suggested Britain leaving the EU would limit our trade relationship with them, but I'm not sure we'd be safe from the negative aspects of the TTIP if we left.

Every 5 years we get a chance to vote, and you are voting for a choice of 2, more or less, with first past the post. Not much of a choice there for holding to account on specific topics. The British people have said they want the Government to be better with the environment, and the Government have just got worse, why should we have to wait till 2020, on such vital topics, before we can even have a chance for change? How is that democracy? A great example of the lack of democracy in Britain, town demands council not to allow fracking in said town. Council reject fracking in town based on what the people wanted. The Government give themselves the power to override that council's decision on fracking.

Ultimately we depend entirely upon the environment for food, water, jobs, technology and civilisation. Greens just try to remind people of the importance of keeping it functioning.

Sorry but your post just highlights what I said, and that is the EU is toothless when it comes to environmental protection, yes it sets limits that can be freely ignored by EU states like the UK, so what is the point of being in the EU then ? is it so they can spend tax payers money creating regulations that no one listens too ? and are you seriously suggesting that we would not know how polluted our air and water is without the EU ? that my friend is absurd, do you not think we have scientists in the UK that measure these ? of course we would know. Your right we do nothing much now about it while in the EU and this might not change when where out of the EU but again what the fuck is the point of EU environmental protections regulations if it can actually do nothing to force governments to implement environmental protection regulations ? Go to Malta see how the EU birds directive protects birds, all you will see is a bird blood bath. Look at the number of british bird species in massive decline and tell me how the birds directive has helped birds in the UK. As for our rivers ask George Monbiot what the environment agency did when he reported a river being polluted. What was the point of the EU water directive if no one gives a shit about it ? Indeed what is the point of any EU directive if no one gives a shit about it ?http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story

I don't share your belief that we could control the Tories. I think that in many cases the EU is the only thing holding them back, which is of course a major reason why they dislike it so much. When they talk about the EU challenging our sovereignty what they are really talking about is stuff like human rights legislation, which stops them doing some of the terrible things they'd like to.

Totally agree with all that. But my feeling is that the pro-EU campaign has been very poor and in theory at least most of the good things about the EU we should be able to have even if we leave. I recall an article by George Monbiot here recently, which basically said he hates almost everything about the EU these days but will vote to stay because of what the Tories might do if we leave. I basically agree with that, but it seems the wrong conclusion because we can control what the Tories do after Brexit.

I think you have right wing populists on one side of the argument. The other side is made up of a sometimes-uneasy alliance left wingers, environmentalists and businesses.



Author::::ID718160

I will certainly read carefully what they have to say, but my feeling is that because the Brexit campaign is being led by right wing populists, the default position of left wing types (which would include these organisations) tends to be pro-EU. There are actually many good left wing progressive arguments for Brexit, which seem to be largely ignored in this debate. Take TTIP and the wider influence of corporations over policy – outside the EU we can influence what our politicians sign up to, inside the EU not so much. It is therefore far from clear cut, which is the right way to vote from an environmental viewpoint.

It is extraordinary that the Brexiters have fought to silence any experts who have knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of membership of the EU. Instead we are confronted with silly emotionalism with no sound basis at all. The more that independent charities give us their assessment of the benefits for the beneficiaries of their charity the better. There seems to be a growing movement that democracy is the expression of the gut reaction of almost wholly uninformed people. Ugh...

But your hypothetical argument is not hypothetical is it, because the UK while in the EU has been dumping radioactive waste into the Irish sea, in fact they have been doing this since the 1950s. Why have the EU allowed it to continue if it is so strong on protecting the environment. Furthermore, our water companies have been found to be systematically polluting our rivers and beaches and getting away with pittance for fines, all under the EU environmental protection. Then our air quality has been degrading for years with our government ignoring the EU's pathetic threats, indeed we have been lobbying to make the regulations weaker, highlighting just how weak EU environmental regulations are. Your argument seems to suggest that outside the EU our environment would be less protected. Please provide evidence ? All I read about is native species in massive decline, declines which have happened while being under the so called EU's environmental protection. Norway and Costa Rica are ranked in the top 5 environmentally friendly countries in the world and they are not in the EU but under your reckoning because they have no multinational environmental laws to protect them they should be toxic ecological disaster zones.

'As it happens, Greenpeace doesn’t receive a penny from the EU, UK, or any other government.' This also appears to be a lie: 'The European policy office of the World Wide Fund for Nature, also based in Brussels, has received £7.4 million, while Friends of the Earth Europe (FoEE), also based in Brussels, is the third highest recipient with £6.4 million.'

Gift aid is just a mechanism to make donations to charities tax free. When you give money to a charity, the charity can reclaim the income tax you paid on that money.

If you're not sure what would be best for the environment, there honestly might be a case for listening to what the experts have to say. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and others have come out strongly for staying in and presented loads of evidence to back up their position. I haven't seen anyone arguing that our environment would be better off if we left. To be honest there seems to be a strong correlation between Brexit campaigners and climate deniers, certainly on the right. Brexit campaigners aren't talking about the environment, perhaps because they don't care much about it.

Yep thats certainly the case for me. The dilemma is of course that the UK will be keen to sign a TTIP-style deal after Brexit anyway. I'm leaning towards voting leave because at least our government would be more accountable that way, but its not clear to me which way to vote if you are wanting whats best for the environment.

I think a big issue for many "green" folk regarding the in/out referendum is the TTIP. The EU recently (as reported by this paper...http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/22/eu-dropped-pesticide-laws-due-to-us-pressure-over-ttip-documents-reveal) failed to ban endocrine disrupting pesticides due to US pressure and the threat of the TTIP.

The issue is that green politics is still very much single issue politics. The Green Party tried to create the image that they were credible in areas beyond the environment in the run up to the general election in 2015 but failed miserably, hence their poor showing in the outcome. The public is in general suffering from 'green fatigue'. The consequences of the in/out referendum has consequences far beyond the environment and climate change. In order to gain some credibility the green movement needs to step beyond purely environmental issues and talk about the issues that the public actually care about.
