South Africa says shale gas exploration to begin in next 12 months




DateTime::::2016-03-08T15:32:36+0000



<p>The South African government said on Tuesday that exploration for shale gas will begin in the next 12 months, ending years of speculation over the project. <br/> <br/>South Africa’s semi-desert Karoo region is believed to hold at least 485 trillion cubic feet of shale gas, but drilling has been delayed by environmental and economic concerns. <br/> <br/>“One area of real opportunity for South Africa is the exploitation of shale gas,” the government <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.gov.za/speeches/economic-sectors-employment-and-infrastructure-development-eseid-cluster-media-briefing">said in a statement</a>. <br/> <br/>“Exploration activities are scheduled to commence in the next financial year.” <br/> <br/>The government has said that shale gas could be the answer to the country’s energy challenges, as coal-fired power stations battle to meet the rising demand for electricity. <br/> <br/>But the process of fracking used to capture the gas has been opposed by environmentalist who argue that it has the potential to poison the Karoo’s underground water supply. <br/> <br/>Fracking involves digging wells up to four kilometres (2.5 miles) deep, before pumping in a cocktail of water and chemicals to crack the shale rock and release the gas. <br/> <br/>In 2012, the government lifted an 18-month moratorium on hydraulic fracturing to weigh the environmental and economic implications of the process. <br/> <br/>Anglo-Dutch energy firm Shell is one of the companies that have shown interest in the gas exploration, and have expressed concern at the lack of progress in the project. <br/> <br/>The company had said it planned to spend $200m for the first exploration phase of six wells if granted a licence to drill.</p>

Here's another truth: When you burn methane, the combustion product is drinking water.

Two massive solar projects are being built in the Northern Cape near Upington with a deal made with a Spanish company I think. One is a huge tower thing that was an incredible sight when we were there in 2014. I think a third is also planned.

Everything you say is true. Here's another truth: When you have no drinking water, the energy mix becomes irrelevant.

SA's electricity is over 80% coal based - switching to fracced gas would lower CO2 emissions considerably.

fracking has been considered and banned by legislature after legislature all across the World. The Dutch have just banned it until 2023 being the latest nation/state/region to sensibly do so.

The South African government said exploiting shale gas, which is believed to lie below the Karoo region pictured, is an area of ‘real opportunity’ for the country.

Intersting study. However, people still think it's better tyat we should be using gas from Russia and Qatar - what emsisions controls do they have? - than gas from the UK.



Author::::EnviroCapitalist

Most likely because gas is cheaper and more reliable.

Rick, 80% of South Africa power is generated via coal. Pick a team fella?

JT Cambridgeshire. What is the alternative you suggest? A country that imports 95% of its crude, has crippling currency, no jobs, only coal fired power stations (with much higher emissions) and no power? Life must be good from your warm arm chair heated by gas fired power stations.

Rather have shale gas than Iranian crude, coal CO2s and jobs in South Africa (unemployment at 30%+).

"Some people would prefer SA to maintain its dependence on coal (in the absence of a near term affordable alternative), or for many of its already poor citizens to suffer from power cuts because the anti-fracking propaganda film Gasland showed a man setting light to his water tap (which the film maker well knew had nothing to do with fracking)."

Why don't they use solar and wind? It is a reliable cost effective source of energy,getting cheaper by the minute.

True for all gas, as long as precautions are taken to prevent methane escape. I have no idea whether South Africa is able to implement those precautions.

Even more true when the gas is fracced, as confirmed by measurements, rather than bought estimates.

True if the gas comes from a conventional play. Untrue if the gas comes from a shale formation requiring hydraulic fracking.

If they want more renewables, they will need to upgrade their fossil fuel power stations to improve flexibility. They might as well then upgrade to gas, rather than coal.

South Africa replacing coal with gas would help reduce emissions.

It would be such a shame to have use the natural resources that are in abundance in SA like sun and wind as they yield very little return for shareholders in the long run. What is required is the wasting of millions of gallons of water and the destabilizing of the sub-structure so that the likes of Shell can make a (dis)honest buck or two.
