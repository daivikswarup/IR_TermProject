A bird of prey soars where bronze-age farmers toiled

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>t Moscar Flats, I faced a dichotomy: to the north, icy blue skies; to the south, roiling black clouds. I chose south, following a rough track from Cutthroat Bridge before climbing the steep bank to Hordron Edge, all the while watching a raven hanging off the wind, acrobatically flipping onto its back and then flipping back again, before letting itself slide out of view as I reached the crest. The view from here is comfortably one of the best in the Peak: looking west is Win Hill and behind it Mam Tor, buried today in snow so deep that it seemed like the white head of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himavat">Himavant</a> himself. To the right, the broad, bleak weight of Kinder Scout; at my back, the crisp blocks of Crow Chin set against the gathering darkness.</p>

<p>On the “bench” of flat land behind the edge lies a stone circle. It’s known as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.stone-circles.org.uk/stone/hordron.htm">Seven Stones</a>, erroneously since there are more than a dozen. It’s reportedly bronze age in origin, and on the far side of Jarvis Brook are bronze age field systems lost beneath the modern grouse moor. It seems likely the circle served some calendrical function for the farmers who lived here. But in a sense, the circle is still in use; there are often small votive offerings here from people who recognise the powerful harmony of this perspective.</p>

<p>I continued south, pausing to look at tracks in the snow, and then distracted by a dark shape lifting from the moor, at the top of the brook 200 metres ahead of me. In a heartbeat I knew it: the owlish head, the lumpy wing-beats too cumbersome for the slighter body but angling back as she gained height into something more threatening. It was a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/h/henharrier/">hen harrier</a>, lured high so early by the warm winter. The long tail, that spreads so elegantly for hunting, was folded tight as the bird hurried away under Stanage before going to ground, swallowed by the moor.</p>

Stones and circles and lines. There are some things this nation does well at in the landscape. Your father’s theories on alignment and excarnation are interesting.

This is very interesting and beautifully described.

Thanks for this evocative piece and your description of the raven; do you think it was playing? Let’s hope so, despite the riskiness of such behaviour in a place like this. On the other hand, this highly intelligent bird must have quickly realised that you were unarmed and not a patroller of the grouse moor.
