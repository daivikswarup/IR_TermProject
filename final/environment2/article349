Leaked European commission plan would open gates to overfishing




DateTime::::2016-03-10T12:19:26+0000



<p>Fishermen could soon be given carte blanche to overfish without needing to worry about restoring fish populations to a healthy state under a leaked <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission">European commission</a> proposal seen by the Guardian.</p>

<p>If it is approved, the blueprint for the Baltic Sea could soon be applied to the North Sea too, potentially threatening the future of some cod species, MEPs say.</p>

<p>The plan would add exemptions to catch limits that are supposed to become mandatory by 2020 and practically remove a commitment to restoring fish stocks to healthy levels by the same year.</p>

<p>“With this proposal, overfishing will continue and, in a worst case scenario, [Baltic] cod will disappear. It is that serious,” Linnéa Engström, the vice-chair of the European parliament’s fisheries committee told the Guardian.</p>

<p>“We already know that the Baltic is a vulnerable sea. There are problems with salinity and oxygen levels and some fish stocks are doing very poorly. The scientists don’t know why they are not recovering as they should. They say that some fish stocks are in such a poor state that it is not possible to do a proper evaluation.”</p>

<p>The common fisheries policy, which began in 2014, sets the principle that overfishing must end by 2020, in order to restore and maintain fish stocks at healthy levels. But the new proposal would allow fishing above those levels, conservationists argue. </p>

<p>Catches of some fish in the Baltic Sea would increase well above levels recommended by scientists under the new plan, according to the Pew Charitable Trust.</p>

<p>Western Baltic cod catches would break the current sustainable fishing limit by 60%, while 63% more North Sea sole would be caught than current policy allows.</p>

<p>“This proposal would annihilate the common fisheries policy goal of ending overfishing by 2020,” said Markus Knigge, an advisor to the Pew Trust. “It is of tremendous importance. It is a real breaking point. The commission has already requested similar ranges for fish in the North Sea and northwest waters and if this text is accepted for the Baltic, proposals will follow there too.”</p>

<p>The Trust is calling on the Dutch fisheries minister, Martijn Van Dam, who is leading fisheries ministers on the issue, to secure a deal in line with the policy.</p>

<p>The new plan would replace a current “maximum sustainable yield” of fish that can be caught each year with a flexible formula containing upper and lower ranges. Exemptions to catch levels would be allowed where these could protect fish from harming themselves or each other, and also in “mixed fisheries”.</p>

<p>Lawyers say that the commission plan, which was shared with MEPs on the European parliament’s fisheries committee last Friday, would breach the EU’s current commitments on sustainable fishing.</p>

<p>“The proposal would create ranges for catch limits that put higher pressure on fish stocks than is legally allowed under the common fisheries policy,” said Sandy Luk, an attorney for the green law group ClientEarth.</p>

<p>The commission drew up the proposal after taking soundings from EU countries in the European council. But the European parliament is restive on the issue and has the power to block and amend legislation.</p>

<p>“It is almost at the stage of ‘no plan is better than a really bad plan’,” Engström said. “Of course, this proposal will serve as the blueprint for other plans and that’s why it is so important we get it right.”</p>

No parallels? What nonsense.We have lots of coast with vast amounts of it vastly underpopulated.As for your belief that is hardly proof of anything.It took foreign fleets with access to the UK Continental shelf to reduce cod sizes to near extinction in the UK. It wasn't UK boats hoovering them up.

I agree they could not give a toss, but who is to say the next government or whoever takes over from Cameron will be the same. It matters little anyway because as I argued, the EU directives mean shit if the government of the day does not want to follow them, and if a government does follow them like say Sweden, then I am sure they would have had strong environmental protection in their country even if they were not in the EU. Therefore what is the point of the EU directives ? Why do people argue that being in the EU is better for our environment when clearly when considering the negative effects of CAP and the weak effects of the directives (if a government does not want to follow them) it is not better in the EU ?

The same is true across the EU; where action is taken and is effective fish stocks can recover. Plenty of MEPs right across the EU get it, so contact your local MEP and ask them to vote to have these proposals amended. The European Parliament has a better record on this than the Council of Ministers because in the parliament MEPs from different nations can work together to do the right thing, while in the Council of Ministers it is just national ministers voting and they tend to be more interested in narrow national interests.

Well said. It is good to see that there are others who see how the EU works. Instead of whinging we should be finding the environmentally aware MEP in our region and encouraging them to join the right side on this issue when it comes before the European Parliament.

Wake up ! For all the good things the EU have done, who is to say that a British government would not have done outside the EU. In fact the EU environmental directives are so weak and unenforced that it really is upto EU governments to decide if they want to be a green environmentally friendly government or not. Therefore, what the hell is the point of the EU environmental directives ? They are a waste of tax payers money. The only EU policy that is taken seriously in the UK is CAP and that has had a devastating effect on our uplands, ensuring they remain lifeless green sheep and grouse wrecked deserts.

This case about fishing doesn't devalue all the good things they have done.Regardless of this plan, the EU is needed for cross border policies on environmentalism and habitat protection. The fact that things don't go perfect is no reason to throw everything else away.

Surely not in the EU, but our environmental groups tell us the EU protects our wildlife and environment ! As I have said the EU is run by special interests they could not give a fuck about the people or the environment. We are better off out, where at least we can put pressure on our government to change regulations and laws, and we can vote ungreen governments out like the current one.

If you think that if the UK was left to protect our own waters then we would, then you are massively mistaken. Just look the £8 million spend by the government on a consultation which concluded we should create 127 Marine Conservation Zones. How many did the government actually create? 50. What the hell is the point in commissioning something if you just disregard the results which you don't like.

No they wont but isolation will at least allow the UK to prevent French trawlers damaging the scallop beds, which is allowed under the current abortion which is the CFP.How is it that the French commissioner of economics blocks reform which even the Spanish had agreed to, it would have nothing to do with the fact the French fishermen would have to change would it.Which just goes to show how corrupt the EU is because commissioners sign a pledge when they take office to renounce all ties of national preference.

Don't be silly: everyone knows that, after Brexit, fish stocks will divide themselves spontaneously into british fish and continental fish and the former will benefit from the effects of the magic bubble of every-problem-solving isolation that will rise itself over the British isles, while the latter will wither and die, as it is proper to dirty continentals

The UK government has been one of the strongest advocates of setting quotas far in excess of those recommended by the Commission's scientific advisers and has usually been effective in doing so.

WE do not need to be in. Read this:-http://www.fisheries.no/resource_management/Area_management/economic_zone/#.VuGhZPmLTZ4Include in that UK waters and you have a massive zone which can be used productively and sustainably.Isn't it strange that Norwegian waters remain so relatively productive despite there being no fences to keep the fish inside their boundaries.The CFPS has been a nonsense and responsible for the decline of stocks. They've had to be dragged kicking and screaming into conservation policy. As soon as things are on the UP those in charge want to go in reverse.

Not true. It was the MEPs to voted for a much improved common fisheries policy and in this case are trying to ensure fishing in the Baltic is sustainable. It is our own domestic governments who cause the problems and hide by blaming the Commission.

UK does plenty of overfishing. Each year the minister responsible for fisheries returns to the UK after hours of wrangling celebrating what a great deal they got for our fishermen. This translates to how much quota they managed to negotiate for our own fishermen at the expense of setting quota at sustainable levels, as advised by scientists. check out this report http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/entry/landing-the-blame-overfishing-in-the-northeast-atlanticUK is one of the worst. Note the report is a best estimate as the decisions and discussions take place behind closed doors.
