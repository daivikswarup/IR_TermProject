<p>A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/socalgas-pleads-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges-in-massive-natural-gas-leak-case">natural gas leak in the mountains above Los Angeles</a> was one of the worst accidental discharges of greenhouse gases in US history. A new study shows the months-long disaster resulted in 97,100 metric tonnes of methane being dumped into the atmosphere.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/socalgas-pleads-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges-in-massive-natural-gas-leak-case">SoCalGas pleads not guilty to criminal charges in massive natural gas leak case</a> </p>

<p>The analysis shows that the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/04/california-natural-gas-leak-methane-climate-change-old-infrastructure">leak from the Aliso Canyon storage facility </a>spewed out 60 tonnes of natural gas an hour at its peak, creating enough methane each day to fill a balloon the size of the Rose Bowl, the 92,500-capacity stadium in Pasadena. A total of 5bn cubic ft of natural gas was released. </p>

<p>The methane emissions from the leak, caused by a ruptured pipe, effectively doubled the methane emissions of the entire <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> metropolitan area, creating enough pollution to match the annual output of nearly 600,000 cars.</p>

<p>The gas blow-out occurred near the Porter Ranch on 23 October last year, prompting the evacuation of more than 5,700 local families. The leak took 112 days to plug, highlighting concerns over the climate impact of failures in ageing gas infrastructure. </p>

<p>Methane is a particularly potent greenhouse gas, with a warming impact more than 25 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. The emissions from the Aliso Canyon leak were equivalent to the annual methane output of a medium-sized European Union country, according to the study, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/02/25/science.aaf2348">published in Science</a>.</p>

<p>Governor Jerry Brown of California took until January to declare a state of emergency over the leak, angering residents, who complained about the eggy smell, nosebleeds and headaches, and climate activists, who claim <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/04/california-natural-gas-leak-methane-climate-change-old-infrastructure">methane emissions should be taken far more seriously</a>.</p>

<p>Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and the University of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> measured the emissions from the leak using data gathered from 13 research flights that provided real-time measurements of methane and ethane, two components of natural gas.</p>

<p>Stephen Conley, co-lead scientist and pilot of the research flights, had to recheck his equipment to confirm the extraordinarily high readings of methane.</p>

<p>“It became obvious that there wasn’t anything wrong with the instruments,” he said. “This was just a huge event.”</p>

<p>Tom Ryerson, a Noaa scientist who was co-lead on the study, said: “Our finding means that the Aliso Canyon leak was the largest accidental release of methane in the history of the US.” </p>

<p>An accident in Texas in 2004 released more natural gas, but an explosion meant most of it did not reach the atmosphere. </p>

<p>The study states that the accident will “substantially impact the state of California greenhouse gas emission targets for the year” and the effects of the released methane will linger for many years.</p>

<p>The Aliso Canyon facility, one of the largest underground reservoirs of natural gas in the US, is owned by the Southern California <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gas">Gas</a> Company, which is a division of Sempra Energy.</p>

<p>The company, which announced the leak was sealed on 18 February, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.alisoupdates.com/1443738511730/press-release-doggr-confirms-en.pdf">said</a> it was committed to regaining the “trust and confidence” of the affected local community.</p>

To bad the public and the press were all deceived by SoCalGas and what might have been possible earlier on in this disaster. I hope the truth will soon be revealed, possibly by their insurance carriers, or as a result of one of those lawsuits. How the public could have been so easily deceived, I get. How the press now appears to be easily deceived by the very people and organizations that would stand to gain by doing so - I don't get. Isn't the press supposed to cut through all the B.S., evasion tactics and PR efforts of those under investigation and help the public to get at the truth, much more quickly? Why have they now become part of the 'problem'? Why do they mostly just repeat company propaganda and misinformation? Why have they now become pawns of the rich and powerful, too? Shame on the modern press. They're no longer doing their jobs.

We always will need reserve capacity for maintenance issue, repair work on a substation can take down an entire wind/solar farm. There are scheduled shutdowns of nuclear plants, reserve capacity must come online. This is an different issue.

In Nigeria some gas flares have been burning continuously for over half a century.Little wonder that our very precious atmosphere is in such a mess,remember we're now on 400ppm of Co2 and I believe our atmosphere has not had that content for at least 800,000 yrs.

No it won't, because SoCalGas has $1B worth of insurance. Their rates might go up but they won't be allowed to pass those on. The insurance companies are going to get burned on this one, though.

We'll probably end up getting more 'useful' information about the Porter Ranch disaster from America's gossip show TMZ than we will get from the MSM, that's for sure! TMZ should just start a new show focused on serious news. Could be a big hit and pretty much wipe out the MSM!

Yeah but the cows also take up the carbon (from grass or fodder, that got its carbon from the air). This carbon was from the solid earth and would/should have remained there for millions of years.

On damages to the environment (the atmosphere), the damages could be zero. Fining a company for dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere sets a dangerous precedent, we all could be in court for starting up our cars.

what most people wiĺ have missed by just reading the article, and glossing over the scientific study refferred to (and linked to in the article) is that even after the leak was plugged the acceptable leakage which is considered normal for an underground storage facility, which is what this actually was, is anything under 1 ton an hour (8,760 tons a year) so this was 8 years equivalent of "normal" leakage from a storage facility. How many storage facilities are there out there in the USA or even worldwide if this is normal industry practice? When a Solar plant or Wind turbine breaks down how much environmental damage does it do and how many lives are put in danger?

Yes, it's really that high. As I said above, the GHG total per year is 6,673 thousand million metric tons - 6,673,000,000,000 and the part of that which is Methane is 800 million metric tons - 800,000,000.



Author::::mrhodes
DateTime::::2016-02-27T10:11:43Z
I presume you mean 800 million metric tons of GHG released by the burning of natural gas. It couldn't possibly be fugitive release of the gas (methane) itself. Unless you include farm animal emissions too--and is it really that high?

The issue with your logic is that 'accidents do not happen' leads to a blame culture which then leads to a risk averse culture and that causes issues far bigger than you're trying to solve.

It does say "as much pollution as", which I take to mean CO2-e; ie. equivalence of GHG which is standardised on CO2.

I concur Professor Mod Mark, all gases should be standardised to the CFS or cow fart standard.OPS should be left for oil spills, lava flows and other liquids.

600,000 American cars IS a lot to someone in Europe.Its about 3,000,000 European cars in real terms, for North America is the home of the 8 MPG gas guzzlers. Factor in the Fuel price differentials :-http://www.statista.com/statistics/221368/gas-prices-around-the-world/and its easy to see why many other parts of the planet are not impressed by the way N. America squanders the resources of the planet, and fills the atmosphere with far more pollution than is necessary.With 267 Million cars in the US the resource drain must be phenomenal....well of course it is why does the US have to spark wars where oil is either found, or where there is a good route for a pipeline/harbour for shipping.....you know the story I am sure.A quick blat down the freeway and not only is a large quantity of fuel wasted, but a large volume of Oxygen is combusted too....before we even start talking about emissions.Mind you the mindless "who gives a shit" attitude of those that choose to run 5 or 7 litre Pick up trucks to go shopping at WalMart will soon stop when that Oxygen runs out.

here must, or should be, a better word than 'accident' to describe these occurrences



Author::::ungruntled
DateTime::::2016-02-27T05:30:29Z
The "Accidents do happen" argument is totally false. The nearest thing to an accident is being struck by lightning and even that is largely preventable. Most people that do die were under a tree, high up a mountain or in some other way presenting themselves to be struck.Screwing up a gas well is 99.9% somebodies fault and often is about cost savings. The Macondo incident was just such an example of risks being taken to try and cut cost. It went pear shaped and killed 11 men, but 99% of the media coverage was outrage at the spillage, dead fish and phytoplankton not the Human wastage.Accidents do NOT happen, they are manufactured by us, and when they are accidents in the Oil and Gas Industry are subject to being pushed as far under the carpet as possible, with the Press trotting out the same old company press release garbage instead of doing their bloody job and investigating what actually happened.
