100 years ago: Ruddy twilight spreads across the horizon

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he sun went down a huge ball almost blood-red in colour, and so vast that half the heaven in the west seemed to be covered. As it sank, all that remained of this ruddy twilight spread away more to the north, then extended along the whole of that part of the horizon in more shades of purple and half-translucent grey than one is able to describe. From end to end the sky was as if it was being warmed over a thousand dying fires. But the old farm hand, coming in, said, shaking his head, “’Tis full of frost in the air,” and an hour later, when the new moon rose white with light, the soil began to harden quicker than strong cement when it is mixed and laid down.</p>

<p>All through the night it froze; the spade was as useless for the garden until noon as the plough and harrow would be on the stretch of stubble that still has to be turned over. A little colony of rooks perched for a long while round their nests talking, condoling with each other probably on the lack of breakfast and shaking their feathers much as one shrugs and stamps and swings his arms to circulate warmth. Birds’ feathers - or those of the bigger birds - seem to settle back into a more compact or beautiful shape after these intermittent shakings and disarrangements; if you see a company of starlings together when they have, as it were, calmed themselves again, and a gleam of sunshine should happen to strike across them, your eye is at once held by the wonderful richness of the many tints that change in appearance as if by some continuous process, more rapid than any mechanism, exercised by the bird.</p>

What a treasure this feature is on the Guardian, the only publication I know which brings us back to the thoughts, feelings and observations of careful observers of nature, and from 100 years ago. Although all are so fine, this one is especially beautiful in its poignant observations of the natural world. (and the sage observation of the farmer who knew just what the night and next morning would hold)

You said just what I am thinking, how marvelous to read such intimate descriptions of nature, really seeing rather than obliquely observing.

What description of feathers: a true marvel of observation and writing.

How many of us can read their surroundings like the old farm hand in this short observation?

Searching for the right words to describe one's observations, truthfully, faithfully, accurately offering a visual in the mind of others seems lost in the anxious rush towards a current goal. What is the goal of life but learn how to see more clearly and love more dearly?
