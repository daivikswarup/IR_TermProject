African elephants 'killed faster than they are being born'




DateTime::::2016-03-03T08:00:57+0000



<p>More African elephants are being killed for ivory than are being born, despite poaching levels falling for the fourth year in a row in 2015.</p>

<p>The new data, released on <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wildlifeday.org/">UN world wildlife day</a> on Thursday, shows about 60% of elephant deaths are at the hands of poachers, meaning the overall population is most likely to be falling.</p>

<p>“African elephant populations <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/world-wildlife-day-animals-are-being-slaughtered-one-by-one-not-saved-two-by-two">continue to face an immediate threat</a> to their survival, especially in central and west Africa where high levels of poaching are still evident,” said John Scanlon, secretary-general of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.cites.org/">Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites), which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://cites.org/eng/prog/mike/index.php">collects the data</a>. At least <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bornfree.org.uk/index.php?id=34&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=1979&amp;cHash=ff6dc8a80ad85ea74af7213540ad6b8d">20,000 elephants were killed</a> for ivory in 2015.</p>

<p>But Scanlon said there were some encouraging signs, including in parts of eastern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a>, such as in Kenya, where the poaching trend has declined.</p>

<p>“This is showing us all what is possible through a sustained and collective effort with strong political support,” he said. “The momentum generated over the past few years is translating into deeper and stronger efforts to fight these crimes on the front line, where it is needed most – from the rangers in the field, to police and customs at ports and across illicit markets.”</p>

<p>Elephant poaching peaked in 2011, when it accounted for about 75% of all deaths. Poaching has gradually reduced since then but remains well above sustainable levels. Scanlon said even greater efforts were needed to fully reverse the trend.</p>

<p>The new report revealed that a “troubling” upward trend in elephant poaching was observed in the Kruger national park in South Africa for the first time in 2015. The proportion of elephants killed by poaching jumped from 17% in 2014 to 41% last year. “While [this] is still below the sustainability threshold, the substantial increase in what had been one of the most secure sites for elephants in Africa is a cause for concern,” said the report.</p>

<p>In January, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/31/tanzania-elephant-poacher-killers-british-pilot-roger-gower">poachers shot down a helicopter in Tanzania and killed its British pilot</a> during an operation to track down elephant killers while, in October last year, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/06/poachers-poison-14-elephants-zimbabwe-national-parks">14 elephants were poisoned by cyanide in Zimbabwe</a>.</p>

<p>As well as action to toughen law enforcement and increase the penalties for wildlife crime, publicity campaigns have attempted to deter people from buying illegal wildlife products. In October, just before China’s president visited the UK, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/19/prince-william-urges-chinese-to-stop-buying-ivory-and-rhino-horn">Prince William told Chinese citizens to stop buying illegally traded wildlife products</a>. Other campaigns have featured sports stars including Andy Murray, Rahul Dravid, Francois Pienaar and Yao Ming.</p>

<p>Interpol estimates the illegal wildlife trade is worth $10-20bn a year, the fourth most lucrative black market after drugs, people and arms smuggling and it is often linked to organised crime. The UN says it not only harms endangered wildlife but also fuels conflicts, feeds corruption and undermines poverty eradication efforts.</p>

The US is still one of the biggest offenders in the big game and illegal animal trade. We need more federal and international engagement to stop illegal markets and trafficking.

If poachers were shot on site, I think it would significantly disrupt the supply chain. China talks the talk but does not walk the walk, and even if they did, it is difficult to police poaching. I would ban all new ivory products, and criminalise possession except licence of those deemed vintage or antique.

You are living in your own virtual world: poachers often work thanks to corrupted guards, the UN are never heavily armed and mostly not even trained for fighting . They don't fight. They are placed in conflict areas to keep parties from fighting who have already reached some sort of cease fire but often they don't even succeed at that. Aren't we having already enough wars in the world thanks to outsiders who know it better ? Impose trade sanctions on China? China already owns a big part of the western world economy and debt. Nobody dares say anything to them anymore since they decided to let them take over.

Do you have any idea what you are talking about? WWF, along with many other conservation NGOs and government agencis, is talking (not screaming) to the Chinese government and public about reducing demand for ivory. The Chinese government has announced its intention to phase out all domestic use of ivory; although this will take time, it is an active step in the right direction.

Except that elephants in zoos are dying out faster than those in Africa and Asia. Captivity is not solution, AT ALL. Community-based natural resource management, along with action by governments in range states and ivory consuming nations IS the answer.

The poachers are generally poor rural people, although there are also career criminals and militias involved. Poaching the middlemen and traders along the supply chain, along with the consumers at the demand end, would be more effective. I assume you are talking about summary execution. So if you want to kill poachers, you should point your gun at everyone else as well.

The UN has started to take it seriously, with serious initiatives linking up their work on international wildlife crime with that on drugs, guns and human trafficking. Sorry but political correctness has nothing to do with it.

You cannot be serious. Obviously elephants do not do well in the conditions of captivity, and especially in cold northern climates. Zoos are like prison camps, and elephants are living beings, not tourist attractions.

What on earth do you know about "most African governments"? What is depressing is the way you are happy to throw out wild generalisations based on minimal information. Each country is different, and many countries have active civil societies pushing hard for reform of governance.

What utter rubbish. The semi-arid environment is not fragile, but highly resilient. Changes in vegetation cover from dense woody cover to open grassland and back to woodlands have occurred many times over the past centuries, as documented by pollen core studies. Natural predators are not needed to manage prey populations, which are self-regulated by food supply. Elephants are integral components of ecosystems, shaping their structure and diversity, and do not need to be culled by old-school managers.Do some reading and catch up with the real world.

This is something that haunts me every moment of every day. Right now in my town the local river banks have been desecrated, with beautiful willow trees cut down, reeds ripped out, all in the name of "CBD Enhancement" - ie, to bring more cash into town. So instead of nature as intended we'll have some nice concrete and some terrible overpriced public "art". When will this kind of thing stop? What can seriously be done about it, when those with the most money and influence don't give a damn, hidden away on their private islands? It seems humanity just can't leave it alone. We seem to have this insatiable desire to tamper with things, to dominate and control things, to have all things within our purview and under our oversight. It's absolutely devastating that some people just don't care at all, and desire no contact with nature in their lives at all. It's too "dirty" - too real - for them to handle, trapped unawares in their hyperreal bubbles of artificiality. What can be done, what can be done? How can we put a stop to this relentless machine?

That would involve some culling of humans. Won't happen. African birthrates are exploding and so are Asians. When climate change forces them our way, I think we'd better be ready as they'll be poaching our resources, having decimated theirs by fecundity.

Another excuse. There are millions of very poor Africans, often grandparents looking after numerous children, who would never kill an elephant or poach. So what is the difference between those who do and those who don't? Now the Chinese are involved directly in Africa, the poaching has increased because the gains are bigger. There is only one word for poachers - criminals, selfish, ignorant and greedy.

DateTime::::2016-03-03T23:28:06Z
Problem is, even then, the poachers would tranquilise elephants and not realise the dangers. The elephant can crush it's organs, tranquiliser amounts must be within limits, and even if they succeeded, do you not think they would drain the elephant of all it's blood, like vampires?

Sometimes when an individual elephant is incorrigible, then perhaps a rare licence can be granted, but I would prefer it being killed if necessary for non-profit. The messsage the former gives out is that if you have enough money you are above the laws of others.

The Chinese government could almost single handedly kill off the illegal trade in ivory as most of it goes to China, but the Chinese wont act and don’t give a toss unless they are shamed and have pressure put on them.

Many safari 'parks' were located in marginal areas that are not suitable for farming; their environment is fragile. You put into that environment an animal that 1) needs up to 300 kg of food a day 2) likes pushing over trees & 3) has no natural predators, and the result is the environment is quickly degraded & all animal suffer. Elephants in safari areas have always needed culling.

What chances have elephants really got, when the likes of Mugabe (the pathetic fetid little turd) feast on their flesh? When the poachers brought down that helicopter in Tanzania, the army should have been brought in to leave all of the poacher's heads left on stakes. As far as I can tell, it'll take a UN force to stop the poachers, heavily armed and trained, and permitted to take action despite the various African government's wishes. Every time a link between China (or any other Ivory hungry nation) and an act of poaching gets discovered, they need to be subject to fresh worldwide trade sanctions.

The only reason poachers poach is money. As usual, animals are an easy means for humans to use and abuse. They are the ones to suffer as always. I don't have to read books to educate myself to know that its about bloody time humans took responsibility for much of their own fate. How about not having child after child after child. That would be a start. Poachers often leave animals still alive after mutilation and in appalling agony. Couldn't give a stuff. Haven't you seen the photos? Who did you say was debased?

Elephants that are taken as part of a regulated wildlife management program are typically problem elephants that are destroying the locals' crops. The easiest way for the locals to prevent that is to poison the elephants with cyanide. The most profitable way, however, is to sell a hunting license for $100,000.
