Whitehaven under investigation over alleged Maules Creek illegal clearing




DateTime::::2016-03-02T00:26:28+0000



<p>Environmental authorities are investigating Whitehaven coal for possible illegal clearing of the Leard State Forest to make way for its Maules Creek coalmine, Guardian Australia can reveal.</p>

<p>There were earlier allegations that the miner had breached its biodiversity management plan again, by clearing trees when it was too hot for endangered animals to flee.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/20/coal-mining-begins-at-maules-creek-site-after-months-of-protests">Coal mining begins at Maules Creek site after months of protests</a> </p>

<p>The Leard State Forest in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales">New South Wales</a> is some of the last remaining native ecology of its kind on the huge Liverpool plains, and is home to a number of endangered animals.</p>

<p>In order to clear a large part of it, Whitehaven <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal">Coal</a> must follow a Biodiversity Management Plan, which includes only clearing between 15 February and April 30, and ceasing any clearing if temperatures rise above 35C. Above that temperature, studies showed animals would take refuge in tree hollows, and were less likely to survive the clearing.</p>

<p>Sue Higginson, principal solicitor at the Environmental Defenders Office NSW, said on 25 February locals measured temperatures just outside the forest above 35C at 11am and at another location from a property adjoining the forest at 1.40pm.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Meteorology recorded over 35C from the nearby Gunnedah weather station at 1.30 and Narrabri at 2pm.</p>

<p>Higginson said they wrote to the department on 26 February, asking them to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>The NSW Department of Planning and Environment told Guardian Australia that Whitehaven said it continued clearing until 2.15pm. But according to Whitehaven, it stopped as soon as temperatures reached 35C.</p>

<p>Whitehaven Coal denied the allegations of illegal clearing. “Onsite automatic weather stations send a series of automated text messages to the clearing team as the temperature approaches 35C,” said Jamie Frankcombe, the executive general manager of operations for the Maules Creek mine.</p>

<p>“When the temperature reaches 35C clearing ceases, and this is exactly what occurred.”</p>

<p>Frankcombe said the department advised locals that clearing ceased when temperatures reached 35C, which demonstrates “the efficient functioning of this system” and that the locals and activists fail “to understand how these systems work”.</p>

<p>But the department’s advice was only based on what it was told by Whitehaven. A spokeswoman for the department said it was now investigating the clearing campaign and “temperature monitoring concerns are a part of this”.</p>

<p>“The department can take a range of actions if a company is found to have breached conditions such as issuing a fine, imposing an order, issuing warning letters or prosecution for the most serious offences. The department can issue the highest fines in the country to companies found breaching approval conditions,” a spokeswoman for the Department of Planning and Environment said.</p>

<p>Frankcombe said that temperature readings varied across the area, even over very short distances, depending on a number of factors such as the height at which the reading was taken.</p>

<p>It is understood Whitehaven take temperature measurements at heights of 2m and 10m, although they refused to reveal where these temperatures were taken or how regularly they were measured. The department was also unable to clarify this.</p>

<p>Higginson said the issue highlighted the need for an independent regulator to monitor whether conditions of the biodiversity management plan were being followed. “Whitehaven is a corporate entity with certain clear objectives, and that’s to get coal out of the ground and profit on it. And they have compliance requirements impose on them. And those are regulating things that are in the public interest – and they’re not in Whitehaven’s private interest.”</p>

<p>Spark agreed: “We are calling for Whitehaven to disclose their on-site readings, and for independent monitoring of when clearing can occur.” <br/></p>

<p>So far almost 400 people have been arrested while protesting Whitehaven’s Maules Creek mine, with several more arrested and charged over the past week.</p>

Many marsupials are nocturnal and rest in tree hollows during daylight ... all year round. The idea that 35 degrees is significant is a furphy as the animals will be in their hollows at any temperature any day of the year. The whole exercise is ecocide.

Actually, their results for the first half of FY2016 were very good. They are making good cash margins (~$14/tonne) even at today's prices, whilst still ramping up production at Maules Creek. In fact, that puts them among a fairly small group of smaller coal mining companies globally (ie they are not a multinational giant) generating strongly positive operating cashflows in the current market. As I've said before, they will likely be giving you cause to wring your hands and gnash your teeth for many years to come.

In particular, Mark Vaile - ex NP Deputy PM, is chairman of the board. One wonders what area of expertise suggested that he would be best for that position. I doubt that its his experience in the coal mining industry.

Up 6.6% today but down they have lost 33% of their value over 2016 so far, and their 2015 results were even worse. Coal is a dying resource with a steadily declining market and no future. Coal as power generating resource is a walking corpse.

Your view smacks of blind pig ignorance. Of course animals don't have thermometers. However, observed behavior is that when the temperature hits 35 on our scale, animals are generally sheltering from the heat. I suggest you spend some time running around the forest during the heat of an Australian summer trying to avoid bulldozers and see how you fare. Don't forget that a lot of the animals in this environment are normally nocturnal as well. Whitehaven should be crucified for the environmental and cultural damage they have caused over the last five years.

This again highlights the extent of obligations and compliance imposed on mining companies compared to the almost complete absence of regulation of farmers working in the exact same areas.

perhaps they don't care and the reason is- they budget for the paying of penalties for such things because it takes time to mount a through investigation and prosecution.

Thank you: it is simply staggering to learn of the myriad links joining both main parties to the mining industry. Here in Queensland, unsurprisingly, we have the labor government entirely aligned with the colossal and dodgy Adani project.

What a load of rubbish. All those animals out there with inbuilt thermometers, "oops, just hit 35C must scurry off to a hollow now". NO, hollow dwellers dwell in hollows ALL THE TIME. And that's not even starting on the loss of these trees permanently. This is just the usual state sanctioned environmental terrorism and its about to get a whole lot worse.

Given how dangerous the ecological cliff is we're currently skirting, if (when) Whitehaven are found guilty the penalty laid on them needs to be nothing short of crippling.

You can't trust the miners nor the LNP. It's imperative the polluters and coal mines be phased out urgently. We won't have a liveable planet soon if it doesn't stop.

This rapacious foreign owned company is an environmental vandal of the first order.They are destroying habitat at an alarming rate and justify this carnage with the ridiculous bs of offset.Perhaps they should tell the homeless animals after they have chopped down the bush where they should go.If ever a company deserved to be prosecuted and delisted from the ASX this is it.

This whole pantomime is a sham. Whitehaven is simply destroying box-ironbark woodland and many of the organisms that live within it, regardless of well intentioned efforts to improve the odds for some animals that, fingers crossed, will successfully move and find a niche in adjoining woodland.

EIS based environmental reporting and monitoring is an absolute joke and the joke is on us - we as Australians are trashing our bush and our native animals by consistently voting in politicians that think and act like they are corporate managers. We must vote in a new future.Our governments - entrusted by us through our collective vote as a nation / state / community - hold legal responsibilities for the smart use of public resources (like toxic coal) and for the benefit of the public good ('sustainable' economies, industries and jobs; our biodiversity; our heritage; our future).But our governments insist on acting as though they are corporate entities operating in an exclusively private market.We must reassert our public space - our governments must promote and honour the public good.We can only do so by voting out the bastards whose addiction to the corporate tit results in the diarrhoea now smothering everything we hold dear.
