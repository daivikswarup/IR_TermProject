China coal consumption drops again




DateTime::::2016-02-29T11:10:43+0000



<p>China’s coal consumption fell for the second year in a row, government data showed Monday, as the world’s biggest polluter attempts to tackle chronic pollution that accompanied economic growth.<br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal">Coal</a> use fell 3.7% last year compared to 2014 levels, according to a report from China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The drop follows a 2.9% decrease in 2014.</p>

<p>China’s rise to the world’s second largest economy was largely powered by cheap, dirty coal. As growth slows, the country has had a difficult time weaning itself off the fuel, even as the pollution it causes wreaks havoc on the environment and public health.</p>

<p>China’s consumption of the fuel doubled in the decade to 2014, reaching more than four billion tonnes a year.</p>

<p>Monday’s figures did not give an absolute total.</p>

<p>It emerged in November that <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> had been under-reporting its consumption for years, after a different set of statistics were revised, with the figure for 2012 alone going up 17%, or 600 million tonnes.</p>

<p>There are widespread doubts over the accuracy of official statistics in China, which critics say can be subject to political manipulation.</p>

<p>Coal fell to 64% of the country’s energy sources last year, Monday’s NBS report said, down from 66% in 2014.</p>

<p>Observers reacted to the declines with tempered optimism.</p>

<p>“These statistics show that China is on track to far surpass its Paris climate targets, which is great news for everyone,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior global campaigner on coal for Greenpeace. “However, the trend is not moving as fast as it could.”</p>

<p>The government plans to lay off about 1.8 million workers in the steel and coal industries, a human resources and social security ministry official said at a press briefing on Monday. Both sectors have long been plagued by overcapacity.</p>

<p>China’s President Xi Jinping has said that the country’s CO2 emissions, to which coal is a major contributor, will peak “around 2030”, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era">as pledged in Paris last December</a>.</p>

<p>The State Council, China’s cabinet, has also announced plans to reduce by 60% the amount of “major pollutants” coming from its coal-fired power plants by 2020.</p>

<p>Despite the decrease in coal use, many Chinese cities are often blanketed with toxic smog, much of it the result of using the fuel in industries like power generation and steel. </p>

<p>Nearly 300 Chinese cities failed to meet national standards for air quality last year, according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/blog/China-pollution-2015/blog/55341/">a Greenpeace report</a>. </p>

<p>The green group said that in 2015 generating capacity grew by a “stunning” 34% for wind power and 74% for solar power.</p>

China has not only cut the coal usage at world record level but is expanding the diversity of electricity generation as well.

China has an effective government that can make decisions and activate them while the USA has four centers of power and they are all going in opposite directions.

On the contrary a corrupt dictatorship like China hates dissent, protesters, free parties, free unions.Then party members manage firms, municipalities, statistics, to please their party bosses and share the profits between themselvesJust wait a bit and you will enjoy the Chernobyl-Fukushima effect of dozens of nuclear plants built by firms belonging by the Party, controlled by the Party on pieces of land chosen by the Party and supplied by hundreds of trains and trailors carrying nuclear material in a mountainous country subject to lack of water, climate change, earthquakes and landslides

I'm not advocating a single party system or saying it doesn't have flaws! Just saying that when it comes to getting things done it can be an advantage. One of the main reasons you don't see any long term planning by our governments is because they are only looking for short term popularity. China doesn't have that problem.

A genuine suggestion - read the book. I found it insightful and thought-provoking.

Coal plant construction depends upon the decommissioning plans for existing plants as well though. You cannot immediately tell if it is about more efficient replacement or increased demand. you also don't know what the c.f. is intended to be.

Matthew vs. NASA, tough choice that one.Even if there is some minor absorption of incoming sunlight, this would tend to reduce the energy arriving at the surface

I think the West should get their own house in order before criticising China. With a single party system and long term planning China is much better placed to deal with environmental problems.

Result: a shrinking economy.



Author::::EGriff
DateTime::::2016-02-29T15:41:10Z
Yes, but we in theory should be seeing a drop in coal use beyond the level originating in lower output - a slow down or stop in coal plant construction...

No substance perfectly reflects and certainly not at all angles of incidence. this makes the claims in the article extremely loose. Even if they did (which they don't) the particle size would still interact with certain wavelengths increasing edge defraction.

Indeed. A victory would be China being able to safety reduce its coal use by half.

Three Gorges has been finished since 2012... its only the ship lift they were finishing off rather than turbine capacity.

Careful with this. The aerosols increase the lag on the warming, they don't decrease the equilibrium point.

And what do you mean people like me?



Author::::GrandMoffTanner
DateTime::::2016-02-29T14:30:04Z
It is obviously not going to be nothing but compared to the three gorges dam which showed up in the CO2 statistics when it changed from construction to operation.

I was restricting to stuff which is currently online since 2010, I think most of the reactors scheduled for 2014/15 are now going to be coming online this year.

And about 40GW of PV. Which is more than the UK's electricity consumption by some margin

Indeed, add to this, much of the coal usage was in things like steel production where the coal is burnt directly.
