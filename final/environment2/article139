Climate activists threaten to shut down world's major coal sites




DateTime::::2016-03-01T07:00:32+0000



<p>Climate activists will use direct action to try to shut down major fossil fuel sites across the world in May, including the UK’s largest opencast coal mine in south <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales">Wales</a>.</p>

<p>The dozen international sites facing civil disobedience from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://breakfree2016.org">Break Free 2016</a> campaign span the globe from the US to Australia and South Africa to Indonesia.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.millerargent.co.uk/projects/ffos-y-fran/">Ffos-y-fran opencast mine</a>, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, is about halfway through extracting 11m tonnes of coal. Ellie Groves, from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://reclaimthepower.org.uk/">Reclaim the Power</a> network, said: “The only way we can stop catastrophic climate change is taking action to keep fossil fuels in the ground.”</p>

<p>“The local community have battled Ffos-­y-­fran for nearly a decade and now face the threat of a new mine next door at Nant Llesg,” said Groves. “Enough is enough. We need a ban on opencast coal mining across Wales, and the rest of the UK.”</p>

<p>Coal is the most polluting fossil fuel and scientists estimate that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says">80% of current reserves must remain in the ground</a> in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The UK government intends to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/18/energy-policy-shift-climate-change-amber-rudd-backburner">phase out coal burning by 2025</a> but the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2015/december/global-coal-demand-stalls-after-more-than-a-decade-of-relentless-growth.html">International Energy Agency still forecasts</a> growth in the global demand for coal.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A statement from Reclaim the Power said: “Hundreds are expected to set up camp nearby and take part in a mass action to close the mine. The action will take place a few days before the Welsh assembly elections on May 5.”</p>

<p>The Reclaim the Power network has held annual camps since 2013 and has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://reclaimthepower.org.uk/2015-didcot-camp-2/">conducted a series of direct actions</a>, including blockading a World Coal Association conference and a fracking company. Ffos-y-fran supplies the Aberthaw power station, whose illegally high levels of pollution have led the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/26/uk-faces-european-court-over-coal-plant-emissions">EU to take the UK to court</a>. Miller Argent, the company running Ffos-y-fran, and the local Labour MP Gerald Jones both declined to comment on the planned protests.</p>

<p>Campaign group <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://350.org/">350.org</a>, which had led the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://gofossilfree.org/">fossil fuel divestment movement</a>, is helping to coordinate the international actions. “We’re mobilising to shut down the world’s most dangerous fossil fuel projects and support the most ambitious climate solutions,” says the Break Free 2016 website.</p>

<p>“We want to ensure there continues to be momentum to keep fossil fuels in the ground and to confront fossil fuel companies,” said Will Bates, global campaigns director for 350.org. </p>

<p>Bates emphasised that, while involving civil disobedience, the protests would be peaceful. “Our actions must reflect the scale and urgency of this crisis,” says the website. The protests are likely to emulate a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://garzweiler/">protest in Germany in August 2015</a> which shut down the large Garzweiler opencast coal mine for a day.</p>

<p>“We need to be disrupting business as usual if governments will not put in place the policies that will get the job done,” said Bates. “It is what is necessary. We think it is in everybody’s best interest.”</p>

<p>Benjamin Sporton, CEO of the World <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/coal">Coal</a> Association, said: “It is clear that coal will be a critical energy source for the long term. The coal industry is already investing to improve the environmental performance of coal. In our view the focus should be on speeding this deployment up.”</p>

<p>No details have been revealed about the targets of the international campaign which will take place from 4-15 May. The countries named are Germany, Spain, Turkey, Israel and Palestine, Indonesia, Phillipines, Nigeria, South Africa, Canada, US, Brazil and Australia.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

Learn some basic physicsLearn some basic geologyLearn some basic chemistryLearn some basic biologyLearn some basic ecologyLearn some basic meteorologyLearn some basic agronomyA small smidgen of economics has some use. Some maths is handy.(Learning to read maps, visualising and assessing landforms can be helpful in assessing climate change impacts as well).

You're being pathetic. You're saying that this:

Yes. The phrase can be used in a comparative manner. Ask an economist.



Author::::HelgiDu
DateTime::::2016-03-03T20:42:21Z
A point that you seem to (deliberately?) avoiding is that the definition you apply to the phrase is specifically mathematical. It is a little bit like trying to explain (but in the opposite direction) the chemical/scientific definition of acidifacation to someone refusing to see an alternate definition to the one they pluck out of their dictionary. The common parlance is "to turn more acid" (which possibly implies that the solution was already acid), whereas acidification can also mean (in scientific terms) a reduction in the pH of a solution, regardless of the original pH.

you should just accept (as bowsie should) that he screwed up and tried to talk about concepts he doesn't grasp. He got schooled, that's what happened.

That definition of order of magnitude is limited to mathematics.

And you seem to believe that "the impacts of global warming are (not) regularly and alarmingly outpacing previous consensus predictions," or at least that is one implication of your repeated attacks on people here. So, please clarify by stating your position and provide credible evidence that it is supported by the science. After all, that's what anyone interested in a real discussion would do. I'll happily state my own if I get even a glimmer that you are really interested in a discussion, and not just in a peacock-like display of ego.

So much many gigawatts of power have been generated by nuclear fusion so far then? None. How much money has been spent? Compare this with renewables, which are tried and tested. Fusion is a pipe dream.



Author::::alwilliamz
DateTime::::2016-03-02T09:29:16Z
I think you are underestimating the incredible disruptive effect that renewables have already had on energy production. Ultimately they will take over, it's just a matter of time. Fossil fuels are in limited supply, so their days are numbered anyway. We are already looking at a likely scenario of at least 3-4C warming - that's the predicted outcome for a planet that is already decarbonising its energy production. The effects of 3-4C warming on the planet are likely to be severe. We must move towards zero carbon. Once the price of solar and wind becomes cheaper than fossil fuels across the planet, market mechansims will kick in and the switch over will be inevitable. If you believe otherwise, then you're clearly not observing the trend that is unfolding.

A number of things. A consensus opinion of people that know what is happening.Current data and trends. A critical analysis, including anythingthat might interfere with what is expected.This is entirely different than what some would hope or wish would be happening.

What makes projections 'reliable'?



Author::::CanadaChuck
DateTime::::2016-03-02T05:21:53Z
Well yes, reliable projections suggest that global coal use willcontinue to increase until the early 2030s. By sometime 2050-2055 the use of coal may be down to the level of today.We must be a little careful as this kind of thinking (or reality)does interfere with the fantasies of most on these boards.

Where I live, there has been no warming from last night at 9:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. this morning. Clearly, global warming is a hoax.



Author::::Rick Shea
DateTime::::2016-03-02T03:00:32Z
And, before he jumps all over this one, that of course should be integer "exponent" of 10.



Author::::Rick Shea
DateTime::::2016-03-02T02:59:22Z
Given the current projections even right here on the Guardian that the U.S. will continue to rely heavily on coal until 2030 and beyond, I expect that there is no need to clean up those sites yet.



Author::::Rick Shea
DateTime::::2016-03-02T02:52:33Z
Although "order of magnitude" often implies an integer factor of 10, that is not always the case. So, exactly what definition of "order of magnitude" are you using here?



Author::::Zsioux
DateTime::::2016-03-02T02:40:07Z
