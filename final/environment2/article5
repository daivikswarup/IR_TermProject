A fossil fuels-arts world divorce is 'the way the world is moving'

<p>BP’s decision to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/11/bp-to-end-tate-sponsorship-climate-protests">pull the plug on their sponsorship of the Tate</a> is a milestone in the campaign to make fossil fuels a toxic brand, and not the first.</p>

<p>Last November, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/science-museum-ends-sponsorship-deal-with-shell">the Science Museum announced</a> that it would not renew an agreement with Shell, after revelations that the firm had <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/31/shell-sought-influence-direction-science-museum-climate-programme">tried to influence its presentation on climate change</a>.</p>

<p>Corporate sponsors have become more important for museums and arts institutes since the economic crisis began cutting off public funding sources.</p>

<p>Some £410m a year of museum funding <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sponsored-museums-annual-performance-indicators-2014-15/sponsored-museums-annual-performance-indicators-2014-15#chapter-3-dcms-sponsored-museums-self-generated-income-201415">now comes from wealthy patrons</a>, with the Tate gallery group alone taking a £180m slice of that pie in the UK.</p>

<p>Sources in the museum industry say that this can pose an ethical dilemma, especially when it is augmented by the more practical problem of ‘brownwash’. Fossil fuel firms may hope to gain an image boost from associating with the arts scene but this can all too easily come with a nosedive in reputation for the arts institutions themselves.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/11/bp-to-end-tate-sponsorship-climate-protests">BP to end Tate sponsorship after 26 years</a> </p>

<p>“The protests have gradually had a grinding-down effect on the Tate,” one source in the museums industry said. “The campaign was targeting the kinds of people who go to the museum – so-called ‘special audiences’ - and I would imagine that these protests will have got to them and thrown doubt into their minds.”</p>

<p>A fossil fuels-arts world divorce was “the way the world is moving,” the source said. </p>

<p>Although the decision to end the Tate’s sponsorship arrangement was reportedly taken by BP <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/bp-to-end-controversial-sponsorship-of-tate-in-2017-a6923471.html">because of an “extremely challenging business environment”</a>, campaigners and arts industry sources believe it was also influenced by war-weariness at the Tate.</p>

<p>BP’s donations to the gallery were “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jan/26/tate-reveal-bp-sponsorship-150000-330000-platform-information-tribunal">embarrassingly small</a>” – no more than £224,000 a year on average – and the Tate group may have felt that they no longer offset the baggage that came in tow. If so, the writing could be on the wall of other well-known tourist attractions. </p>

<p>Campaigners say that most big cultural institutions in London now take funding from fossil fuel firms and three big names – the British Museum, Royal Opera House and National Portrait Gallery – will be deciding whether to renew contracts with Shell and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/bp">BP</a> in the year ahead.<br/></p>

<p>In 2011, BP agreed to give these three institutions – and the Tate - <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://platformlondon.org/p-publications/artoilinfographic/">£10m over five years</a>. Anna Galkina, a campaigner with Platform London, said that the next protests would target the British Museum.</p>

<p>She told the Guardian: “There will be all sort of interventions there, and the campaign on the other two institutions will definitely ramp up too, now that we know that it is winnable.”</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.liberatetate.org.uk/">Liberate Tate campaign</a> is a model for these pushes, and was born out of a workshop that the arts activist John Jordan gave at the Tate called ‘Disobedience makes history’ in 2009. Folklore has it that he was told he could speak about anything except actions against the Tate’s sponsorship arrangements – and so turned the workshop into a discussion of whether to confront the Tate.</p>

<p>“There is always a turning point when a certain form of culture is seen as toxic and unacceptable,” Jordan told the Guardian. “At some point in the early 19th century the slave trade was no longer perceived as business as usual but a violent inhuman practice. Our cultural perception of the fossil fuel industry is now at a similar turning point - and not a minute too soon!”<br/></p>

Next move is to remove all oil paintings from the the gallery?Not allow anybody in if they travelled by anything other than electric cars, bicycle or on foot. As long as the vehicles were solar/wind charged and nobody is wearing or carrying anything plastic.

Doesn't seem like you are an environmentalist then. You could argue every small change is irrelevant. But it's part of a change which together can make an impact. And perhaps the subject of the article above will have influence on others to make similar, albeit small, changes.

Like most ordinary environmentalists I've humoured this fluff for a very long time. But to be honest, while obviously slightly positive, it is all largely irrelevant. Such things have token importance for a tiny handful of people. The environmental movement largely seems to consist of professional cadres of pretentious social-justice-warrior arts graduates talking a garbled mix of postmodern sociology and PR-language to one another.

It is very encouraging to see that the arts are distancing themselves from civilization's disastrous reliance on fossil fuels, now being rapidly outdated by competitive wind, water, and sunshine energy.

It doesn't actually matter what you think. It's happening, and it's going to continue happening, until fossil fuels are a thing of the past. Get used to it quickly or spend the rest of your life being part of an ever-dwindling minority of dinosaurs.

No, just her brain. Anyone who uses the word 'windmills' as a pejorative term for the renewables industry instantly identifies themselves as of low intelligence.

Don't patronise me with your moral compass malarkey! The two are totally separate. Tabaco is a choice. You want to die of lung cancer or heart disease, your choice. Oil, whether it is BP, Shell, any of the manufacturers, we need oil. It is essential for everyday life and will be until someone comes up with an alternative to replace it. There is absolutely no harm in them putting a little extra back into society for society's own enjoyment.

Just means that those destroying our future with their recklessness and greed will not be able to pay off the public with a few 100 thousand each year to the arts. And the campaigners arent against use of oil but against excessive use of oil and failure to find alternatives and to protect the Artic.

Ethically speaking, BP are no oil painting. More like obscene graffiti scrawlled in a slimy public loo. Well done to all those campaigning to end the BP Tate sponsorship. Brilliant.

Is 'baseless ad-hom' your new phrase for the day? It's getting boring. Anyway the comment might be insulting but it's not really ad hom. And Kim jongun does make a reasonable case which no-one has really addressed on this thread. Actually, thinking about it, they can't as they couldn't post without using fossil based fuels directly or indirectly.

No but Tate may have to. Even if its a couple of cleaners. So well done, you made a point, went back to work the next day with a warm, satisfying glow without giving consideration to the consequences of your actions. Bit like when Greenpeace damaged the Peruvian Heritage site. Crass and irresponsible.
