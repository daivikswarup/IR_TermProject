<p>Britain could save £8bn a year and slash its carbon footprint by using electricity better, a new report says. </p>

<p>The National Infrastructure Commission said a “smart power revolution” which improves the storage of power could transform the energy landscape. Its report, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/smart-power-a-national-infrastructure-commission-report">Smart Power</a>, looks into ways the UK can better balance supply and demand in the energy market. </p>

<p>It said Britain should connect more of its network to mainland Europe and store energy better. <br/></p>

<p>This would save consumers up to £8bn a year by 2030, help meet the UK’s 2050 carbon targets, and secure Britain’s energy supply for generations, the report finds. </p>

<p>It says Britain should become a world leader in storing electricity, and make full use of demand flexibility by improving regulation, and informing the public of its benefits, the report adds.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/from-liquid-air-to-supercapacitators-energy-storage-is-finally-poised-for-a-breakthrough">From liquid air to supercapacitors, energy storage is finally poised for a breakthrough</a> </p>

<p>Lord Adonis, chairman of the commission, said: “Our existing power stations are closing down and their replacements will be radically different as we decarbonise supply to reduce emissions.</p>

<p>“This represents an enormous challenge, but it also leaves the UK uniquely placed to benefit from three exciting innovations set to transform the global electricity market – interconnection, storage and demand flexibility. The UK can lead the world in harnessing these innovations, bringing jobs and investment into the country and cutting bills for consumers.” </p>

<p>He added: “If we get this right, a smart power revolution could save consumers £8bn a year.” </p>

You are correct in your analysis DerekColeman and it is much the same issue here in UK controlled Colony Brit - NZ where obscenely high paid arrogant risk averse Non Engineering - Non Physicist......Politicians, Accountants, Lawyers & Aussie, Bankers run the show and make the Critical Infrastructure & Future Power needs decisions. Same scenario is applied throughout the Commonwealth Countries if one cares to delve. You highlight a major problem which few in Governments anywhere will confront, meaning the key decision making for crucial projects which impact the environment often 9 out of 10 being made by the wealthy and pompously arrogant most of whom lack REAL expertise to deal with what are REAL technological issues regarding how to address reduction of fossil fuel usage and emissions reduction and other openly present urgent issues towards mitigation and cleaning up the mess modern civilisation has and continues to cause this ailing planet.

Some facts as opposed to assertions:

The basic physics does not support the catastrophic warming scenario. So far we are on course for a 1° C warming for a doubling of CO2. Starting with the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm of atmospheric CO2, it has to reach 560 ppm to add 1°, 1120 ppm to add 2°, 2240 ppm to reach 3°, and so on. At the current rate of increase it would take almost a millenium to reach 3°, and there is no reason to believe that 3° would be especially dangerous. We are unlikely to be burning fossil fuels for another millenium anyway, so that is hardly likely to happen. None of that takes into account that there will be a saturation point where additional CO2 ceases to have any effect. This is because IR at the frequencies that react with CO2 is a finite supply. Some scientists think we have already reached that saturation point and that explains the 18 plus years decelleration in rising temperature. So far the predicted 2° positive feedback from water vapour has not shown its face, and therefore probably does not existThe satellite record shows the expected rise in temperature from a powerful El Nino. As with previous El Ninos, the following La Nina is likely to pull the temperature down again. It remains to be seen if the hiatus will then continue or whether global warming will resume. BTW, I am using the conventional physics here, which I do not subscribe to as it ignores other factors like the overlap between water vapour and CO2 absorption, and changes in the Sun's magnetic field, and gravitational pull from the major planets.

You seem to be familiar with this process and couldpossibly judge how beneficial it would be.Some considerations would be:1. Does it change the source mix of UK electricity generationso that you emit less CO2?2. Does it improve UK energy security? You are currently producingless of your required fossil fuels each year and importing more of each every year. Will you import less?3. Does it lower the cost of electricity for citizens and all businesses?

For the nth time, its not about topography, its about economics. Dinorwig as a sunk cost built at the time of cegb gold plating is viable. New ones aren't, they are worse sites with worse economics. Hence to make it work, we need dinorwig clones, not what's available.

The report does indeed call for more storage. It doesnt specifically say pumped storage however, it talks alot about lithium batteries.



Author::::geofarce
DateTime::::2016-03-06T16:54:46Z
So we are back to the report that does call for more storage, in part through a change in the market regulation, levelling the playing field between generation and storage. The market can then sort out whether that is the potential pumped hydro, isentropic, liquid air, V2G, flow batteries, domestic powerwalls .....

Given that our dependence on foreign gas may mean significant price increases in the future (500% increase in price between 2000-2006) perhaps we should look at renewables & storage as being more of an insurance policy. Gas was subsidised by about £6 billion in 2014-15 compared to renewables at £3 billion, and the UK is the only G7 country to increase these subsidies.

The National Infrastructure Commission (for daft ideas?) is presumably yet another qwango, populated by the usual suspects. Its panel has 2 Lords and a Sir, an LSE economist, a bloke from Google (the tax avoiders) and two token females, one an architect involved with HS2 (another fiasco) and the other an economist, who surprisingly sounds like the only panel member actually qualified for the job. Their brief is to advise the government on infrastructure.Now coming to the topic, just exactly what do they mean by storage? To my knowledge there is no storage solution for renewable energy that does not add excruciating cost to the already expensive renewable energy. Their other idea appears to be to buy power from the Continent. Don't they realise that is a seller's market? The whole problem with these people on these advisory bodies, and indeed the decision makers who take that advice, is that they are all people to whom the electricity bill is about as much as they spend on lunch. They have no idea of, or care for the people with card meters, who often sit in the dark and cold because they don't have enough money to buy a card. These people collectively are designing a future of serfdom for your children and grandchildren, and you saps are accepting it without protest because you think they are saving the planet. How do you know they are saving the planet? Because they told you so? Yeah, right.

Of course I don't know what tariffs you are on, but I doubt that your electricity is five times as much as gas. In my case I am paying exactly three times as much per kWh equivalent for electricity as for gas. As there is little difference in efficiency between the two with a modern boiler, my current £660 a year for gas would become £1,980 if I swapped to electric heating. As I am only just clear of fuel poverty at present, that would mean I could no longer afford to heat my home. However, I believe that's only half the story. With the likelihood that electricity will double in price in real terms as more renewable energy comes on stream, and the plan to ban gas for home heating in 2030, I think that householders will be faced with paying 6 times as much in real terms for their home heating. That would mean maybe a third to a half of the population would no longer have home heating because they simply will not be able to afford it. However it is likely that people will do just what we did in the winter of 1947, when the snow was so deep that coal deliveries stopped. Where I lived all the able bodied men on the estate assembled in the woods with a variety of saws and cut up the trees for fuel. Luckily they were trees that had been felled by a gale, but if the powers that be take away the ablity to heat our homes, expect wholesale illegal clearing of trees and a black market in wood.

Nuclear powered Sweden and France have, by far, the lowest CO2 emissions in the electricity sector.

I prefer to look at yearly consumption source data, globally andfor a few important countries. This would be important for CO2.I see that for 2014, the UK had 8% wind, 7% biomass/waste, 2%hydro and negligible solar for your electricity sector.Looks like you will, over time, have more gas, some more nuclear and wind, and less coal.

Lets just build the 2 plans sitting on the shelves. They don't need new mountains.Then there were the Dinorwig sister sites from the '70s that never got built. Has the UK topography changed that much in 40 years?

Comments are interesting. Gas is the problem. We have to get rid of it for electrical power generation and heating our homes. In energy terms electricity is about five times the cost of gas. Presently my gas and electricity bills are each £650 so, I can expect to pay a total of £3900 per annum instead of my present £1300. This reflects the problem for many of us. Solution needed.

I think that after COP21 & the reaffirmed €100 billion in investment, it is simply fast and cheap to roll out renewable energy across the world. This is where the drop in co2 is needed, and also I'd like to note that after my thorough research I am not averse to thinking about nuclear as a substitute to baseload energy demands especially smaller scale thorium & spent-waste reactors but of course there are long lead times for these technologies.

You are very confused.The renewables that you are thinking of, wind and solar,provide 1% of total energy consumption.Electricity generation is a small part of the total, about 28-30%.Wind and solar are only involved in the electricity sector and have near 4%Normal people consider hydro power and biomass/waste power asrenewables. It is possible that all renewables could add up to near 30% ofthe electricity sector by 2030-2040. This will then be about 8% of total energy consumption

I already know where to find my own numbers. Germany now has over 80,000 Megawatts of solar and wind, yet its CO2 emissions are 2% up (from 2009 to 2015). 5 out of 6 EU countries show major CO2 emission reductions (e.g. Britain and France are both down by 16% over the same period).

We can already see, from the German evidence, that decarbonizing energy is not the purpose of renewables. Talk to Energiewende advocates and they'll explicitly say as much. Hiking up energy prices, introducing inefficiencies, and a general neo-Luddism is far closer to what you do.

It's amazing how selective reading of statistics can be used to make a case. Especially if you flood your argument with a raft of unnecessary junk. I would suggest that MarkPawelek strip away the detail and concentrate on the facts that matter. Decarbonising energy is an irrevesible trend. Nuclear power is eyewateringly expensive when the full life cycle costs include decomisioning. Energy conversion which is a necessity for all electricity production is expensive not just storage. Renewable costs are declining steeply whereas nuclear and most fossil costs are rising strongly. Storage is technologically in it's infancy and it's costs will tumble. With all this why are you farting against thunder?
