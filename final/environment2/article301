Electric cars 'will be cheaper than conventional vehicles by 2022'




DateTime::::2016-02-25T10:00:33+0000



<p>Electric cars will be cheaper to own than conventional cars by 2022, according to a new report. </p>

<p>The plummeting cost of batteries is key in leading to the tipping point, which would kickstart a mass market for electric vehicles, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://about.bnef.com/">Bloomberg New Energy Finance</a> (BNEF) analysts predict.</p>

<p>The large-scale roll-out of electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as vital in both cutting the carbon emissions that drive climate change and in dealing with urban air pollution, which leads to many premature deaths every year. But, despite subsidies in many countries, EVs remain more expensive than conventional cars and the limited range of battery-only cars is still a concern. Currently, just 1% of new cars sold are electric.</p>

<p>However, the analysis published by BNEF on Thursday predicts that the total cost of ownership – combining purchase price and running costs – of battery-only cars will dip below those with internal combustion engines in 2022, even if the conventional cars improve their fuel efficiency by 3.5% a year.</p>

<p>The analysis uses the US government’s projected oil price of $50-$70 (£36-£50) a barrel in the 2020s. If the price is $20, the tipping point is pushed back by between three and nine years.<br/></p>

<p>Salim Morsy, senior analyst at BNEF, said: “In the next few years, the cost-of-ownership advantage will continue to lie with conventional cars, and we therefore don’t expect EVs to exceed 5% of sales in most markets – except where subsidies make up the difference. However, that cost comparison is set to change radically in the 2020s.”<br/></p>

<p>Colin McKerracher, lead analyst at BNEF, added: “At the core of this forecast is the work we have done on EV battery prices. Lithium-ion battery costs have already dropped by 65% since 2010, reaching $350 per kWh in 2015. We expect EV battery costs to be well below $120 per kWh by 2030, and to fall further after that as new chemistries come in.”<br/></p>

<p>The report projects that 35% of global new car sales – 41m a year – will be EVs in 2040, with one in four of all cars being an EV by then. This would have a knock-on effect on global energy use, cutting oil consumption by 14% and using 8% of all electricity. New EV sales could be as high as 50% in 2040 if they become widespread in fleets and ride-sharing schemes or as low as 25% if oil prices remain very low for many years.</p>

<p>Previous predictions for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/01/are-we-on-the-brink-of-an-electric-car-revolution">EV sales have been overly optimistic</a>. President <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://time.com/money/3677021/obama-electric-cars-gas/">Barack Obama predicted 1m electric cars in the US</a> by 2015: in January that year the total was 280,000. But McKerracher said past predictions were based on very limited data on actual sales and on falling battery costs, while air pollution and fuel efficiency policies are getting tougher.</p>

<p>The best-selling battery-only EV since 2009 is the Nissan Leaf (186,000 sold) followed by the Tesla model S (79,000), according to BNEF. The best-selling plug-in hybrid EV – which has both electric and conventional engines – is the Chevrolet Volt (87,000). BNEF predict sales of plug-in hybrids will fall after 2030 as battery-only cars get cheaper and have longer range.</p>

<p>The UK’s government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, say <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/2014/11/11/going-electric/">60% of new car sales in the UK should be electric by 2030</a> to deliver the nation’s carbon cuts at the least cost.</p>

<p>That is “very aggressive”, according to McKerracher, but he said EV sales will rise faster in countries that invest early in charging infrastructure or crack down on air pollution in cities. Climate change policies also will be important, he said: “If anyone takes the commitments made at the UN summit in Paris with any degree of seriousness, you have to decarbonise transport.”</p>

<p>UK motorists appear to be warming to the idea of EVs, according to a new survey of 2000 drivers commissioned by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/">BMW</a>. It found 20% said their next new car would be electric, although 59% were unaware of the £5,000 subsidy currently on offer from the government. However, those wishing to take advantage will have to hurry, as the subsidy falls from April to £2,500-£4,500 depending on the model bought.</p>

Actually the concept of the GigaFactory is to massively drop the prices as the economies of manufacturing scale kicking. Also you need to bear in mind that as efficiencies are increasing several percent a year, the amount of Li required per kWh of storage is dropping.

Nonsense, charge efficiency is 50% ( for minimum charging time, and the heat is dissipated in the charger, discharge efficiency is better than 50%, unless you run it flat out. That's why chargers and batteries need fan assisted cooling.

If wishes were horses - beggars would ride! T does not help your case to ignore the fact that making each EV battery pack creates more air, water, and land pollution than that of making a whole ICE car. New ICE fuel economy continues to advance heading for 90 MPG with zero emissions by 2040. The world has discovered more oil on the planet than could be consumed in the next millennium. The price of refining will continue to drop by economy of scale keeping price per barrel below electric cost. EV battery life degrades rapidly from use which makes new EV car milage range lose about 20%+ each year. ICE car range degrades slowly to only about 2%+ in 10 years. This is but a sample of major flaws in the EV tech future. Sorry, but real facts are stubborn things. The old adage is still true - If wishes were horses - beggars would ride!

Travelling has an impact however we do it - even walking. Most importantly, we need to travel less, e.g. by getting more of what we need locally, or by using telecommunications. When we do travel, we need to do it in the most environmentally friendly way possible. In urban situations, a mix of cycling and electrified public transport would cope with most transport needs, though light commercial traffic is also highly significant. Electric transport can reduce local air pollution, but as has already been noted, it only helps with the global problem if the electricity comes from clean sources.

Even at 100% efficiency, the engineering calculations do not close for solar cars. I built my first solar car in the early 1990's and realized that the power generated by solar cells won't completely power the car for usage required. A car still needs the energy storage of a battery system.

Yup - this guy is a little misinformed. The batteries in conventional satellites, if put in EVs, would outlive the owners. A low-earth orbit satellite with Li-ion batteries puts about 75,000 charge/discharge cycles on a battery. If a car is driven every day, it takes about 365 cycles a year. That means the battery lasts approximately 225 years. Health care needs to catch up so the owner can buy another car before death.

The pollution on the carbon-based sources of electric power have easier pollution controls than on conventional automobiles. That is where the carbon footprint improves.

This is the first guy with a good argument to the article. The issue to market penetration of EVs has always been the range. Now with Li-ion batteries the crossover point has been reached (Tesla can do 400 miles, but at a premium). The trick is to improve the power density of Li-ion batteries and lower the costs. The "battery swapping" can go to near zero if the materials are made well. Current space Li-ion batteries run for 15-20 years with tens of thousands more cycles than car batteries. The good news is that more is being learned about cost reduction, recycling, and specific power improvement.

This is funny because the government corruption and carbon footprint/pollution arguments were used in the 1970's to try and stop solar as well. Solar insertion into consumer electronics was stifled by this, but people are a little smarter nowadays and can see that driving a gasoline-powered car at $.575 per mile is much more expensive than driving an electric at about $.07 per mile. And solar cars last longer than gasoline cars (only a few rotating parts in the electric motor as opposed to at least 400 in the internal combustion engine/transmission combination). The problem is not junking them. The problem is what to do with all of the cars that just won't die.

You are right - electric cars were the first vehicles in the late 1800's and were more prevalent than gasoline-powered cars until the early 1900's. But you are mistaken that the technology is not new. The controls technology that make the systems 97% efficient (as opposed to gas which is less than 50% efficient), the battery technology improvement by roughly 15 times the power density, and the fact that li-ion batteries are recyclable all are leading-edge. When fuel cells start to work economically, then they will be incorporated into the electric vehicles. But when will they start to work - its only been what, 50 years since we've been working on them?

Electric cars are available now for anyone who wants one, but apparently very few people do. Was it Nissan that cut back production a few weeks back because sales have not reached the expected levels? Hybrids have sold very well for the simple reason that you can't get stuck with a flat battery in a hybrid. Those people who travel long distances are not outliers, they are probably the majority. It is normal these days for people to live long distances from their family members and friends, and they want a car that will take them those distances without hassle, even if they make the long trip only once or twice a year. I read a story about an American who visits his daughter once a month, and it's normally a 12 hour trip including rest stops. He was persuaded to try out an electric car, and it took him 2 days to get there, including having to stay overnight in an upmarket hotel because that was the only one with a charging point. At one time he almost ran out of charge completely, but found a charging point at a marina just in time. Part of the reason it took so long was the extra mileage he had to do to find charging points, as well as the charging times. Electric cars are just not convenient for most people, and will only start to sell in large numbers when they are. That means much better ranges and shorter charging times.

They built a battery that was 25kg. It is not hypothetical. http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1083111_phinergy-1000-mile-aluminum-air-battery-on-the-road-in-2017Also it is a primary battery which means it will need to be replaced after it is used. If we bring the weight down to 10kg (which your grandma can carry)each then it will do 200 miles but you could carry many in your boot and replace them at a service station.

Naive solution that works great in Europe but has literally no chance in hell working in the US as the infrastructure costs to make that happen in an already sprawled system would be insurmountable. Long range EVs are the solution that works for everyone. And where there are cities that can benefit by promoting smarter cycling ways, they will do that. But that type of infrastructure cannot be mapped onto the entire globe.

Please stop with this "EV Modern Tech" there is nothing "modern" about them. They are ridiculous dinosaurs. Electric cars have been around longer than gasoline cars and for a short time were more popular in the early 20th and late 19th centuries than gasoline cars. If we want to talk about the future lets talk about fuel cells and or hydrogen or hybrid of both. Electric battery cars will create the greatest environmental disaster in the history of making. What...are they putting stupid pills in the water or is it the lead and arsenic that nobody is doing anything about?

Electric cars are the pinnacle of government corruption. They have a larger carbon footprint than a gasoline car because for the most part the electricity to charge them come from an electric plant burning fossil fuel less efficiently on a per vehicle basis. If we convert to 100% nuclear to make electricity that will take 30 years and these cars will be in a garbage dump polluting ground water for centuries. Lithium batteries are one on the most poisonous things with nowhere to dispose of it. Once we switch to nuclear were do we dispose of the nuclear fuel. Crooked people making billions off dollars off of uninformed taxpayers via a crooked government.

I think you will lose your bet by a country mile so maybe we are all doomed but not by 2035 I'd bet. Get on with reducing solar costs PDQ and proving economic Thorium power then maybe some progress will be possible. In the meantime get rid of coal and accept that changing the whole world is not going to happen quickly - certainly not while oil is cheap and that could last for a long time especially as more alternatives arrive to replace it. A gas bridge, cleaner air and less carbon, is available and should be welcomed - forcing the pace using uneconomic renewable technologies wastes money that could be better spent on R&D and stuff like implementing the Methanol economy.

Don't bank on the price of petrol pushing fossil fuel cars out - the less demand for petrol or the more successful EVs become the lower the oil price is likely to go. EVs economics will have to chase petrol down - and that could prove quite a challenge once taxes are applied to EVs and subsidies removed.

Ahh! Methanol! Now you're talking! Make it from cheap natural gas now and stop all that horrible gas flaring around the world then make it from renewable electricity longer run - great answer! Predictably cheap too as gas prices tend to follow oil prices so differentials stay roughly in line. Replace diesel and petrol with 10% lower carbon dioxide no particulate, near zero NOx methanol in the short medium term and convert the methanol to carbon free methanol in the longer term - it also works in fuel cells and acts as an energy store for renewable electricity too - as you noted. What is not to like? Please don't say it's toxic or you will need to say whether or not you ever drink petrol or diesel or have bleach or caustic soda under your sink.

Nearer 75% of the current petrol and diesel price is excise duty and Vat while the tax on electricity is insignificant. Add this to all the other incentives available to electric cars when DECC was forecasting oil prices as recently as last year around $100 bbl central case more or less forever and the cost of EVs to the rest of us is very high - derekcolman is much nearer the mark than you are I'm afraid.



Author::::alfubar

Sounds great- the rest of us are subsidising you as you don't pay excise duty on the electricity and presently you have had a £5000 gift from the government to buy the car. Once you do pay excise duty and the subsidy goes EV won't look so good. Also, in doing the sums, has anybody considered how much extra power gen capacity will be need to fuel all these new cars? As I understand it we in the UK are having trouble meeting current demand and struggling to see how to replace the coal stations we are obliged to close by 2025. Meanwhile India and China among others are still building coal stations in their hundreds. Has anybody factored in the fact that if oil demand does fall by 20% globally because of success with EVs that will shut down the most expensive oil - at today's demand level about $40-60bbl leaving much of Middle Eastern oil viable down to maybe sub $10bbl. Perhaps these forecasts, like past ones are still more wishful thinking than reality. Anyway I thought we were all supposed to driving hydrogen fuel cell cars by then?
