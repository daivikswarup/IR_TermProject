Air fresheners, joss sticks, deodorants – and other killers in our midst

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>emon and pine air fresheners. Solvents seeping slowly from plastics, paints and furnishings. Composite wood furniture and fittings, household cleaning products and DIY sealants and fillers. Foam insulation, insecticides, scanners, joss sticks, open fires, deodorants, dust mites, mould and dander from dogs and cats.</p>

<p>These are some of the bewildering range of apparently innocuous household objects – and animals – that may be killing us indoors, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/every-breath-we-take-lifelong-impact-air-pollution" title="">according to a new report</a> from the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Heath.</p>

<p>Most of us spend most of our lives indoors. So, how can we improve the air we breathe?</p>

<p>We should live more like our grandmothers and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/22/indoor-and-outdoor-air-pollution-claiming-at-least-40000-uk-lives-a-year" title="">throw open the windows of our homes for a few minutes every day</a>, says Professor Stephen Holgate, an asthma expert at the University of Southampton who led the report. Modern, energy-efficient homes may be less leaky, but that means it is vital to introduce fresh air to dilute chemical pollution and remove moisture, which encourages moulds. Of course, if the air isn’t fresh – if you live on a polluted main road, for instance – this may not be such a good solution.</p>

<p>Holgate believes there has been little scientific investigation of indoor air pollution in Britain because it is an unseen problem (unlike 1950s smog). He says there is a reluctance to “interfere with industry”, too.</p>

<p>Until there is more evidence, should we use fewer domestic chemicals? “Yes, we should. It has gone too far,” says Holgate. “There are 15,000 chemicals circulating in an average human. Many are in tiny quantities, but we need to find out more about how these mixtures interact when they get inside the human body – especially the foetus, which is very sensitive.”</p>

<p>Although pollen-producing cut flowers are mentioned as a potential problem in the report, pot plants may mitigate some indoor pollution. Chemicals in air fresheners and scented household products produce formaldehyde when they react with the air. Everyday exposure <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6377526" title="">can irritate the lungs</a> and may contribute to asthma, cancers and other illnesses. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/18/home-sweet-home-combat-indoor-pollution-scented-candles-cleaning-products" title="">A recent test for the BBC’s Trust Me, I’m a Doctor</a> suggested that house plants such as the humble spider plant can reduce levels of formaldehyde. (Formaldehyde is also emitted by furniture; the US has set legal limits for formaldehyde emissions from wood products such as MDF at 0.09 parts a million.)</p>

<p>“We can’t introduce laws to control what people do in their houses, but we can make people aware,” says Holgate. He hopes that more people will buy <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://our.clean.space/" title="">portable air-pollution monitors</a>, which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/10/lord-drayson-takes-on-uk-air-pollution-crisis-with-new-smart-sensor" title="">work with apps</a> to measure air quality – a bit like personal fitness-monitors. Once we can measure bad air, we can avoid it. “That’s real people power,” says Holgate. “That’s going to change things.”</p>

I hate having to constantly wipe that black, gritty dust you get everywhere from the traffic. I feel for you about the smoking too, where I used to live I had that problem, it was worst in my bedroom too, it's horrible when your bedsheets smell of it! Do air purifiers get rid of the smell? I rescued a cat and she has asthma so I can't even use essential oils anymore in oil burners, but I can't stand the stench that often permeates my flat.

Not difficult? Oh yes, it's dead easy living above a shop on a main road - our windows are thick with dirt from the traffic fumes and we've got shop owners below us going outside for cigarettes throughout the day. We also have lovely smells of rubbish from the bins, food smells from the five takeaways across the road, not to mention all the noise that comes with having the windows open... We've also got a neighbour who smokes inside the building and the smell gets in everywhere, all of our clothes and bedsheets stink of cigarette smoke. Our only solution was to buy an air purifier which not everyone can afford and it costs extra money to run it and replace the filters every so often. It is difficult.

Air fresheners should be banned in enclosed public spaces such as dress shops with changing cubicles. We can choose what we breathe in our own homes but not when we go out. Holiday cottages and other accommodation should also be banned from plugging in air fresheners unless stated in their property description.

Just a word of warning, some of them cause ozone build up (I'm guessing the cheap ones) but ozone can cause permanent physical lung scarring particularly in young and old.

So... Stop using aerosols indoors, stop buying air freshener and instead open the windows for half an hour a day.

Sick building syndrome. Exactly right, but quantify the degree to which the extent of Indoor Air Pollution exists, by collecting and then analyzing a sample of condensed water, as is produced by a domestic de-humidifier. These cost a pittance and if you operate a dehumidifier in tandem with a humidifier, this should reduce the level of indoor air pollution to quite minimal levels, and you won't have the need for any central heating either.

Agricultural spraying can be a problem in some areas no doubt. Again since adulthood I am lucky to have often lived in areas which were more given over to pastureland than heavily arable. But as a child I worked with my parents in agricultural labouring and I'm sure we inhaled more chemicals than is safe for anyone to inhale.

You might be right on the air purifier front but the NASA study was based on one plant per hundred square feet and I've definitely gone way further than that!

Cleaned out the one-bed flat of an alcoholic neighbour recently and found 8 cans of air freshener, which he'd used to cover the smell of the rotten food, faeces and other unsavoury things lying around. Six weeks and a thorough disinfection later, with windows and the door open continuously, the smell of air freshener still pervades - it seems to have been soaked up by the walls and furniture. The organic smells have long since dissipated (thankfully).

Look, if the pharmaceutical industry continually produces drugs that don't quite work in the way they thought they would, after all the research, development and testing. Side affects sometimes only becoming identified in the very late stage tests. How can anyone trust the chemical companies who produce toxins, that are little tested and put into plastic bottles for us to poison (sorry did I mean clean) our homes, and chemicals that are incorporated into sprays, waxes and gels to pollute the air we breath as they give off their smells (sorry air freshen). Don't buy this rubbish you know it makes sense.

Sometimes you can't wait that long, you just have to err on the side of caution and go with it! There's no reason to doubt slow leaks out of plastic bottles, oftentimes I have come across unused plastic bottles that were sticky to touch, the contents had sipped through the plastic over time ... manufacturers don't give a damn and don't test for long term effects of chemicals on people's health.

Did we really need a report to tell us this? I have tried to avoid air fresheners and cleaning products for years. Pests and weeds are removed or discouraged by physical rather than chemical means. This results in more exercise but you do lose a bit of time. I quite like the smells I create.

Well, air fresheners have been around as long as people have been bringing flowers indoors but I guess you mean the spray/plug-in type ones, or the, um, melts is the latest one. Any synthetic perfume is pretty suspect.

My mate has Glades and other freshners around the house, in the loo etc and whenever I stay there I get headaches and feel nauseous. I find it so overpowering. It's a relief when I get outside into the fresh air.

The thing is, you would literally need to fill your entire home with plants for it to make a substantial difference. Don't get me wrong, plants are lovely and sure, have some. But don't make the mistake of thinking "well I've got plants, there's that sorted then." If you have very many plants though though this can contribute to higher levels of humidity, putting you at risk of developing mold. Best bet? Buy good air purifiers - one for your main living space and one for each occupied bedroom (the places where you do the most breathing, in other words.)

We use a simple ioniser in my sons room - he smokes although not in the house and before his room used to stink. The ioniser ( about £24) cleared the smell in about 25 mins and we just leave it permanently on ... I've had 3 of these over the years to excellent effect - an inoized room feels like fresh mountain air ( and no, I don't sell them!)
