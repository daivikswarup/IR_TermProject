Yellowstone grizzly bears face end of endangered species protection




DateTime::::2016-03-03T22:25:04+0000



<p>The federal government is proposing to strip endangered species protections from Yellowstone’s famed grizzly bears, with officials claiming a “historic success” in the recovery of the bear population.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/10/yellowstone-grizzly-bear-hiker-killed">Rangers catch grizzly bear suspected in Yellowstone hiker death</a> </p>

<p>The US Fish and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/wildlife">Wildlife</a> Service (FWS) said it planned to delist one of the last remaining grizzly populations from the Endangered Species Act, which has protected them since 1975. In this time, the FWS said, the bear population around Yellowstone National Park has rebounded from 136 bears to more than 700.</p>

<p>This recovery has led to calls from Idaho, Montana and Wyoming – the states that contain and surround Yellowstone – to remove the bears from the act’s protection. The states have argued that selling licences for hunting would generate huge sums of revenue and help ranchers who lose livestock to bears.</p>

<p>The FWS has agreed to the delisting as long as a conservation plan is followed to ensure the grizzlies are not imperilled in the future. Currently, the animals cannot be shot or removed unless there are exceptional circumstances. </p>

<p>“The recovery of the Yellowstone grizzly bear represents a historic success for partnership-driven wildlife conservation under the Endangered Species Act,” said Dan Ashe, director of the FWS. </p>

<p>“Even with this proposed delisting, the service remains committed to the conservation of the Yellowstone grizzly bear, and will stay engaged to ensure that this incredible species remains recovered.”</p>

<p>The Yellowstone grizzlies now roam an area of more than 22,500 square miles, an area larger than the states of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island combined. But even this area is a sliver of the species’ former territory, which once stretched across the US west.</p>

<p>Historically, grizzly bears were found from Alaska to Mexico, numbering up to 50,000. European arrival was a low point for the bears, which were shot, poisoned and trapped to near extinction. Today, about 1,500 grizzly bears remain in a number of isolated populations in the lower 48 states, with the animals more abundant in Alaska.</p>

<p>Conservationists have opposed the delisting of the Yellowstone grizzlies, claiming that it was premature. </p>

<p> Andrea Santarsiere, a staff attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the organisation was disappointed in the Obama administration for removing the protections of the act.</p>

<p>“Yellowstone’s amazing grizzly bears are loved by people around the world, and they deserve a real shot at survival,” she said. </p>

<p>“It’s frustrating to see the Fish and Wildlife Service moving to strip protections for bears when these majestic creatures live in just a tiny fraction of their historic range and face a slew of ongoing threats. The science just doesn’t support removing protections for Yellowstone’s bears right now.”</p>

Absolutely with you there. I've hiked in Glacier and Yellowstone and you are in their territory. And that is what makes the beauty in these places even more remarkable - that somewhere out there, otherness and wildness is. We saw two young grizzlies from a distance. Unless they're older and have been repeatedly darted, or mothers with young, they're terrified and will not approach. But along with sightings of elk, moose and raptors, seeing them is an incredible privilege, and it is absolutely tragic that the ranchers who ring the parks - and idiot hunters eager to destroy megafauna from a safe distance for the 'thrill' - are allowed to kill them. At least EO Wilson and the conservationists attempting to put together huge wildlife corridors in the Americas understand what needs to be done to protect them. Now we need to learn to leave them alone.

Actually the bears reached agreed upon populations levels ten years ago, delisting has been held up due to litigation from animal rights groups. The bear has never been biologically endangered. The IUCN lists it as "least concern" similar to squirrels and blue birds. Way past time to fix the ESA, the problem is that instead of reforming it while adults are in charge it will be done with Trump and a reactionary Republican legislature.

Don't understand how 700 is a number that is considered sustainable. 136 is endangered but 700 isn't? Seems the grizzlies are one epidemic away from teetering on the edge again. The lust for humans to kill creatures endemic to their region is amazing.

Except of course the only reason they were endangered were that they were being shot out of existence. So allowing them to be shot willy nilly, just because they've recovered a bit isn't too clever. It can't be claimed they are now lacking a natural predator, and this justifies shooting them, because with the exception of humans they don't really have predators, and never needn't them to control their population.

Stop people hunting endangered species for no good reason. It's the same with wolves - there are programs that run for a few years to get a species up to a barely sustainable population, and then the species is delisted so that hunters can have a go at them.

Obama admin has been terrible about protecting USA's wildlife--delisting from Endangered Species Protection (the ESA established in 1972 under Nixon) wolves and now grizzlies. WTF. Everyone who has a brain knows that these species are beneficial to the ecosystem (as opposed to--cough--COWS) and bring in millions in terms of tourism, hiking, ecotourism, etc. (Check out Defenders of Wildlife for stats on this). Some many countries have destroyed their wildlife (or are in process of doing so). Mexico has only 25 Mexican grey wolves left!! Here is USA we still have the wildlife--but it is seriously imperilled and in danger of extinction. Take the amazing wolverine--the State of Michigan wildlife icon--very few remain. Sad and economically stupid as hell.

In the last 10 years I've come awfully darned close to two Grizzlies each in Yellowstone and neighboring Grand Teton national park and seen 4 others not far away. There are plenty of them to go around. Much as I love them, they may well have outgrown their endangered status.Truly magnificent creatures though. Just don't start running away when you see one up close.

They're mostly bureaucrats in a system that caters to the rich, powerful. and connected. FWS and BLM managers are notorious for ignoring their own field workers and scientists and being on the side of the bad guys.

The California state flag prominently features a grizzly bear. It's our grand state symbol, so we exterminated the last grizzly in California in 1922.I think we should replace the grizzly on the California flag with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, myself.
