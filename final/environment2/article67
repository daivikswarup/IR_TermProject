China's carbon emissions may have peaked already, says Lord Stern

<p>Carbon emissions may have peaked already in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>, years earlier than its leaders pledged, according to a study co-authored by the world-renowned economist Lord Stern.</p>

<p>The country’s emissions have fallen, partly as a result of its <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/china-economy-grows-at-slowest-pace-in-25-years-latest-gdp-figures-show">globally relevant economic slowdown</a>, and partly owing to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/19/chinas-coal-burning-in-significant-decline-figures-show">government policies to pursue a low-carbon path</a> and reduce the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/14/air-pollution-in-china-is-killing-4000-people-every-day-a-new-study-finds">rampant air pollution</a> in its major cities.</p>

<p>If this trend continues it would show that the country’s emissions have already peaked, said Fergus Green, lead author of the report from the LSE.</p>

<p>This would be a landmark in international efforts to tackle emissions and fight climate change, formalised in<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations"> last December’s breakthrough international accord on climate change signed in Paris</a>. At the summit China, the world’s second biggest economy and the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, agreed that its emissions should peak by 2030.</p>

<p>In the new report, Green and Stern argue that if China’s emissions have not already peaked, then they are very likely to do so within the next decade, bringing the world’s biggest emitter to its internationally agreed target years earlier than expected.</p>

<p>This is an important development, as it means that the world’s biggest emitter is likely to be finally on a downward path of carbon emissions. Although there is a possibility that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/07/global-emissions-to-fall-for-first-time-during-a-period-of-economic-growth">China’s emissions will pick up if its growth rate recovers</a>, the reduction in emissions is likely to continue, according to Green.</p>

<p>“We are seeing a larger infrastructural change in China,” Green told the Guardian. This was the result of policies and changing industrial conditions, he said. A fall in China’s coal consumption in 2014 accelerated in 2015, according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/29/china-coal-consumption-drops-again">government statistics published in February</a>.</p>

<p>Green also discounted the idea that a reduction in emissions in China, as it moves to a higher value economy rather than the low-wage, high-production model that has fuelled in its past two decades of high growth, would be wiped out by an increase in emissions in other developing economies that are following China’s example. </p>

<p>“It is almost inconceivable [that other countries would make up for these emissions], because China is so large,” he said.</p>

<p>Under <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points">the Paris agreement</a>, all countries - developed and developing - are called on to review their emissions targets every five years. Green said this could be key to reducing emissions further. “One of the virtues of the current agreement is the review mechanism, so China will be in a very strong position in 2020 to ratchet up its targets,” he said.</p>

<p>In Europe, however, green campaigners were disappointed last week by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-110-EN-F1-1.PDF">a report from the European commission</a> that focused on the core Paris commitment to cut emissions in line with a 2C rise in temperatures. Governments in Paris had also pledged to consider how to cut their carbon in order to limit temperature rises to no more than 1.5C , which would avoid more of the ravages of climate change, particularly on small islands at risk from rising sea levels, but which would be harder to meet.</p>

<p>Bram Claeys, EU climate and energy policy advisor for Greenpeace, said: “The Commission must stop pretending Paris didn’t happen. It has a responsibility to step up climate action to reflect the Paris deal in legislation on renewables and energy efficiency. People won’t trust the EU if it continues to play fast and loose with global warming and delays Europe’s shift to 100% renewable energy.”</p>

<p>On Friday, at a meeting of EU environment ministers, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/03/02/eu-plans-no-change-to-climate-target-before-2030/">several countries pushed for a stronger 2030 emissions target from the EU than the one agreed at Paris</a>. This was welcomed by green campaigners.</p>

<p>Genevieve Pons, director of the European policy office of WWF, said: “We have seen huge support from member states for increasing the EU’s 2030 climate and energy targets. Doing so is the only way of standing by our commitments in Paris, working to limit temperature rises to 1.5C. EU countries have injected a welcome dose of ambition into the climate discussion, after the Commission’s lacklustre input.”</p>

In my original comment I linked to this article of which Lomborg is the author. I mistakenly thought that comment was a reply to you, but it wasn't.http://nypost.com/2016/02/22/the-paris-climate-deal-wont-even-dent-global-warming/The site you link to, dedicated to Lomborg's errors, is not really helpful.

Lomborg does not deny climate science. Where did you get this guff? Have you any evidence toi substantiate your claim that Lomborg gets paid a million ? It can't be to deny climate science, because he does not deny it. He also can not get science wrong because he doesn't do science, only economics. His climate related work is entirely about the economics of climate change, and his calculations are based on IPCC science. Climate activists have set out to vilify him because they don't like what he says, particularly that renewable energy is unaffordable, and that current plans will not make much diffeence to climate. He weadles out facts like for instance that wind and solar only currently supply 0.4% of world energy consumption, and that government plans will only increase that to 2.2% by 2040. At no time has he ever argued against the science of the IPCC.

Nuclear is very low carbon - about the same as wind, which is also one of the lowest-carbon generation techs we have. It is also not particularly expensive. Many countries are building it at £70/MWh, which is much the same price as onshore wind, and unabated gas. Everything else is more expensive, although PV is heading for similar prices in sunny places already.

I presume you are being sarcastic because the NYP is a Murdoch tabloid. The source is irrelevant. I'm sure this would have been reported in other news media. The point is that it is a study by Bjorn Lomborg, a Swedish economist who takes a special interest in climate matters, and it is peer reviewed. This is not an opinion piece, it the result of calculations by a guy who is good at maths.

I got some science. The general opinion among climate scientists is that the Paris agreement is insufficient to limit warming to 2° C, but they are pleased the subject is being taken seriously. James Hansen, the warmist's guru, has labelled the agreement as worthless.http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-scientists-paris-1.3366751

James. China has also built a pile of nuclear power stations in the last decade (10?) and has 10 more under construction. So your claim that this proves it can be done without using nuclear looks rather thin to me.

But your data shows that the drop in coal was far greater than the makeup of nuclear and renewables.

China has has been on a building binge for over 15 years, and like in most binges, they did not stop in time. The result is a huge glut of flats, office space and shopping space that are unoccupied, and most likely most of it will never be occupied. There are probably enough empty flats in China to house 50 million people. The process to this state has been to produce mountains of steel and cement, both of which require large inputs of coal. This is now stopping, and probably will not be restarted. That is why China emissions are falling and coal consumption has collapsed. And it is also why the one-child policy has been officially repealed.

If I was as glib as you renewables lobbyists I'd point out that the only major world economy where emissions have peaked China* is also the only one where nuclear is growing in leaps and bounds.

1. Please stop repeating the myth nuclear isn't low carbon (no generating technology is "carbon free") contradicted by IPCC Working Group 3 (Decarbonizaton) which specifies a median lifecycle emissions figure for nuclear on par with wind energy.

The data is very clear and Haigh is very wrong to be euphoric. The 1.5C target was a fiction verging fraud because it depends on massive negative emissions technologies (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Sequestration [BECCS]) that don't exist and aren't being properly researched. Their contribution is simply assumed.

That has nothing whatsoever to do with Chinese domestic nuclear production though does it?



Author::::whateverpoiuyt
DateTime::::2016-03-08T08:02:24Z
And the usual dishonest illustration featuring wind turbines when by far the largest contributor to low carbon energy in China so far has been the Three Gorges Dam. The largest in the future will be nuclear. This is how the "environmental" movement is kept profoundly ignorant by its gatekeeping pro-renewable-only opinion formers like the Guardian.
