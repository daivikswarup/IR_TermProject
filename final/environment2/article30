UK energy policy is in disarray - but blackouts are unlikely




DateTime::::2016-03-01T16:26:33+0000



<p>“Keeping the lights on” is supposed to be the primary duty of energy policy: for good reason.</p>

<p>Blackouts are not just difficult for consumers, but dangerous. Our basic infrastructure, from streetlighting to communications and home appliances, is entirely reliant on a dependable electricity supply, and businesses from retailers and offices to steelworks and food processors would be useless without it.</p>

<p>That is why the idea of blackouts is so incendiary, and why the government chose to make its <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/01/uk-government-moves-to-ease-energy-supply-fears">“non-negotiable” commitment to keeping the lights on</a> today. It was reacting to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/sse-set-to-close-most-of-major-coal-power-plant">closure of two power stations </a>and the fears raised in some sections of the media that this could result in blackouts.</p>

<p>“The [regulated] capacity market [for electricity] has driven down costs and secured energy at the lowest possible price for billpayers, but I’m taking further action to tackle the legacy of under-investment and ensure our country’s long-term energy security,” said Amber Rudd, energy and climate change secretary. “By buying more capacity earlier we will protect consumers and businesses from avoidable spikes in energy costs.”</p>

<p>But a Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) spokeswoman confirmed to the Guardian that the department had no firm assessment of whether <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/will-the-lights-go-out-in-the-uk-this-winter">power cuts were likely</a> in the next five years.<br/></p>

<p>In reality, the danger of widespread or prolonged blackouts is remote. Some small blackouts happen every year for local reasons, such as roadworks, a temporary failure, or flooding. These are easily manageable, and have little impact.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/national-grid-spent-more-2-5m-prevent-power-shortages">systems in place to avoid bigger blackouts</a> include ramping up older and seldom-used generation capacity, called “supplemental balancing reserve”, managing power dynamically across the grid so that areas of generation are joined up with consumption, and - most of all - taking power away from big energy users.</p>

<p>Called “demand-side response”, this means energy-intensive companies, such as steelworks and factories, signing contracts with the National Grid that they will use less power at times of national need. It means that the lights are very unlikely to go out.</p>

<p>National Grid said: “For next winter, we’ll continue to work closely with industry, Decc and Ofgem and have already concluded successful tenders for an extra 3.6GW of supplemental balancing reserve [from seldom-used power plants] for the winter of 2016-17, as well as continuing to focus on growing demand-side response activities.”</p>

<p>For the businesses in question, however, this is another costly management headache.</p>

<p>Claire Jakobsson, head of energy and environment policy at the EEF organisation of manufacturers, told the Guardian: “Demand-side response can play its part in managing the grid, but it is imperative that any agreements made with industry are on a voluntary basis. Furthermore, it must not be in place of a credible strategy for delivering new [power] plants and security of supply should be a top priority.”</p>

<p>Keeping otherwise redundant power stations at the ready and compensating big energy users for the costs of being flexible is also an expensive way of managing energy. </p>

<p>Those costs raise consumer energy bills, and are likely to continue to do so. About £1.50 will be added to each consumer bill this year solely to maintain “last resort” power from plants that have been mothballed, National Grid said. Demand-side response adds several pounds more.</p>

<p>Even if blackouts are unlikely, the UK’s energy sector is in disarray. There’s the closure of power stations with contracts to generate energy.

The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/edf-extends-life-of-four-nuclear-reactors-hinkley-point-decision">extension of the life of existing nuclear power plants</a>, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/edf-struggling-to-fund-new-hinkley-point-nuclear-reactors">doubts over plans for two new reactors</a>.

The damages inflicted on the renewable energy sector by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/10/paris-climate-talks-uk-leadership-role-lost-due-axeing-green-policies-home">abrupt policy reversals</a>.</p>

<p>Some of these problems are economic in origin, such as shutting old coal-fired power stations which no longer make a profit, and the failure to build gas-fired power stations when the use of gas as stand-by generation makes its economics tricky. They are also in part created by government policy, however. No part of the energy system is unscathed. And these ructions follow on years of mis-selling scandals and alarm at profit-taking by the “ big six”, which have shaken consumer confidence.</p>

<p>The latest announcement of changes to the government’s flagship energy market reforms, which only became fully operational last year, illustrate how desperate matters have become, forcing ministerial reassurances to consumers and business. Rudd insisted: “Ensuring that our families and businesses have secure energy supplies they can rely on now and in the future is not negotiable and I’ll take no risks with this.”</p>

<p>Ofgem also moved to reassure consumers, but with a veiled warning to the industry. A spokesman told the Guardian: “National Grid has already procured 3.6GW of reserve for 2016-17, and the additional capacity market auction will provide further incentives for generators to be available to help secure supplies. However there is no room for complacency. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> companies must be vigilant this winter.”</p>

The UK energy market belongs to all intents and purposes to either foreign companies or foreign investors, who care little about the non existent "energy policy" of this excuse for a government.On a good day it resembles a cartel, on a bad day a shambles.As for getting a Nuclear power station built for us by a Sino~French consortium I suppose that's the bit about "the uk energy market", I fail to understand.In that event you are correct, for the rest of it, I understand it only too well.

making use of solar plus storage at homeYeah great idea if you have a spare £20k plus knocking around and sufficient roof space to support twice the number of panels of the average UK installation that is lucky if it generates half the energy needs of the average household. And then figure in the lifetime costs of the inverters that need replacing and the panels that degrade over time let alone the damage to roofs over than time, yet to be revealed.Domestic PV has always been a bad idea north of 50 degrees unless you are off grid.Do you know how much electricity you can buy for £20,000?

It conveniently puts the problem of obtaining adequate supply at arms length - of course, there's no guarantee of surplus generation for export at the far end of any given interconnector.

Where is the ' Carbon reduction strategy ' in all this? why are we not able to envisage an era of generating low-carbon produced electricity without having to use spare capacity which is either Co2 polluting or sacrificing industry of essential power? Why are we so inept at grasping the nettle to sort out where we are really going with all this?Co2 global levels are now in excess of 400ppm - time is running out!!!!!

Thanks for your reply. I clearly misunderstood what is implied by "Contributor" underneath your pen name.I used to be a scientist (professor of physical chemistry) before my retirement. I know a little about energy and thermodynamics and am interested in various subjects that are debated here. Personally I'm pretty favourable towards nuclear power stations, but I know that many others aren't. My problem with wind- and solar-produced electricity at present is that I don't see how it can be stored for use at times when the sun isn't shining or the wind blowing, unless one produces, say, hydrogen from water, and that's not all that easy to store either.

Unfortunately I can't find where the adressed the issue of heating going off for 12 hours in the winter given the state of the UK housing stock. You raised another country, not the UK which has its own specific issues. And in another post asked the question "surely having a blackout for, say, ten hours is not much of a burden is it?" to which I responded yes it is, with the reason.

Don't worry (and even be happy), your friends in France will be happy to make up any shortfall that might occur for British-produced electricity. Thanks to the wonders of the atom, supplies in France are both secure and cheap - we even have some available to sell to the UK.OK, end of sarcasm.

The policy for demand reduction has been a great success, numerous steel works, aluminium smelters and cement works have been closed down and the infrastructure shipped overseas.

Have you anything to say on the issue of the UK being without heating for 10 hours? Previously you didn't think a power cut of that duration would be a burden - is that still your view - you have stopped debating for some reason which is surprising off given your comment above:

JamesValencia - One article I like to quote on this: Naomi Oresked "A new form of climate denialism to look out for" - the title is slightly misleading, it covers renewable supply to take the place of fossil fuel.
