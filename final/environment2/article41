Five years on, cleanup of Fukushima's reactors remains a distant goal




DateTime::::2016-03-11T00:00:18+0000



<p>In the chaotic two years after its name became forever associated with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima">nuclear disaster</a>, the Fukushima Daiichi power plant “resembled a field hospital”, according to the man who is now in charge of the most daunting task the nuclear industry has ever faced: removing hundreds of tons of melted fuel from the plant’s stricken reactors.</p>

<p>“Now it really does feel like the situation is settling down and we can look ahead,” said Naohiro Masuda, head of decommissioning at the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco).</p>

<p>Five years after a magnitude nine earthquake triggered a giant <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan-earthquake-and-tsunami">tsunami</a> that killed almost 19,000 people along the north-east coast of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a> and caused a triple meltdown at Fukushima, the plant has been transformed from the scene of a major disaster into a sprawling building site.</p>

<p>Masuda can point to lower radiation levels in and around the plant, better conditions for its 1,200 Tepco staff and 6,000 other <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/06/fukushima-clean-up-radiation-public-criticism">workers</a> – including the recent provision of hot meals and a rest area – and progress in containing huge quantities of radioactive groundwater.</p>

<p>In late 2014, the utility overcame arguably the most dangerous challenge since the meltdown, with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/07/fukushima-nuclear-cleanup-spent-fuel">removal of hundreds of spent fuel rods</a> from a storage pool inside a damaged reactor building.</p>

<p>But work on removing the melted fuel – something no nuclear operator has ever attempted – has barely begun.</p>

<p>All that Tepco knows for certain – although it was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/29/former-tepco-bosses-charged-fukushima">slow to admit it</a> – is that fuel in three reactors melted down after the tsunami knocked out the plant’s cooling system on 11 March 2011.</p>

<p>Of greatest concern, though, is reactor 1, where the fuel may have burned through the pressure vessel, fallen to the bottom of the containment vessel and into the concrete pedestal below – perhaps even outside it – according to a report by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://irid.or.jp/en/topics/">International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning</a>. Reactors 2 and 3 are thought to have suffered partial meltdowns. </p>

<p>Masuda and Tepco engineers who spoke to the Guardian conceded that they still didn’t know where the fuel is located. “To be honest, we don’t know exactly where the fuel is and have to carry out more studies,” Masuda said at a recent briefing. “But we do know that the fuel is in a solid state of cold shutdown.</p>

<p>“No one has ever done what we’re doing, but 30 to 40 years is a target that we can work towards. There are so many people involved that it would be wrong to alter that deadline on a whim. We’ve established a goal and need to show ingenuity to reach it, not take the easy way out.”</p>

<p>The technology needed to send robots deep into the reactors’ bowels – where radiation levels are dangerously high – has yet to be developed. Two robots specially tailored to negotiate debris inside damaged tunnels and pipes <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/13/fukushima-robot-stalls-reactor-abandoned">stalled</a> last year when they closed in on the reactors’ highly radioactive innards.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/the-faces-of-japans-tsunami-disaster-survivors-five-years-on">After Fukushima: faces from Japan's tsunami tragedy, five years on</a> </p>

<p>Yet Tepco is persisting with the government’s roadmap for the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima">Fukushima</a> cleanup, which envisions fuel removal to begin in 2021 and end between 30 and 40 years later, at an estimated cost of almost $20bn (£14bn).</p>

<p>But Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist at Greenpeace Germany, said the decommissioning schedule was an attempt to convince the public that <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a> was recovering from a major nuclear disaster.</p>

<p>“The idea that fuel debris removal will begin in 2021 is not realistic – it’s just not going to happen,” he said. “The roadmap is based on political considerations, not technical ones.</p>

<p>“This applies to the government’s and industry’s approach to the whole Fukushima crisis – to give the impression that things are retuning to normal and to weaken public opposition to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/09/japan-split-restart-first-nuclear-reactor-since-fukushima-disaster">restart of nuclear reactors</a>.</p>

<p>“No one really knows how long it will take, but it will be decades and decades and decades.”</p>

<p>As the deadline for the start of fuel removal edges closer, even industry regulators are beginning to question the methods set out in the current decommissioning plan.</p>

<p>Last month, Toyoshi Fuketa, a nuclear regulatory authority commissioner, suggested removing all of the melted fuel could take much longer than four decades. “I wonder if it is desirable for work to extract fuel debris to still be going on 70 or 80 years from now,” Fuketa told reporters. “There are a number of other options, including removing as much fuel as possible and solidifying the rest.”</p>

<p>Fukushima Daiichi’s stability is wholly dependent on water constantly being directed into the reactor basements to prevent the fuel inside from heating up. While the method has proved effective, it has led to a buildup of enormous quantities of contaminated water – a mixture of the coolant and groundwater that becomes radioactive when it flows from hills behind the plant into the reactor buildings.</p>

<p>The contaminated water is then pumped out and stored in tanks that cover large areas of the Fukushima Daiichi site. Tepco is able to remove 62 radionuclides from contaminated water – but not <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritium">tritium</a> – and has so far been unable to get permission from local fishermen to release the treated water into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/the-faces-of-japans-tsunami-disaster-survivors-five-years-on">After Fukushima: faces from Japan's tsunami tragedy, five years on</a> </p>

<p>While pumping out groundwater upstream and redirecting it into the sea has reduced the amount flowing into the reactor basements from 400 tonnes to 150 tonnes a day, the technology that was supposed to deliver a coup de grace to Tepco’s perennial water problem has encountered problems.</p>

<p>The utility’s plans to activate a 32bn yen (£198m) impermeable <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/13/doubts-giant-ice-wall-fukushima-nuclear-reactors">frozen wall</a>, which was completed earlier this year, have been frustrated by delays and questions about its effectiveness. It hopes to start filling the underground wall’s maze of pipes with water later this year.</p>

<p>The site is nearing its current water storage capacity of 850,000 tonnes, and there are plans to add to the existing 1,000 tanks, bringing the amount of contaminated water at the plant close to one million tonnes.</p>

<p>Tepco expects to have collected and treated all contaminated water pooled around the reactors by 2020, and will need to continue processing only coolant water for the reactors, according to Sadanobu Kanno, a general manager in the firm’s nuclear power and plant siting division.</p>

<p>The slow progress at Fukushima is mirrored in the painstaking effort to make nearby towns and villages, abandoned five years ago, fit for human habitation.</p>

<p>The disaster forced 160,000 people to flee their homes, 100,000 of whom are still <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-japan-three-years-families-uprooted">displaced</a>. About 10,000 children whose families fled after the nuclear disaster have yet to return to Fukushima prefecture, amid parental concern over the possible <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/09/fukushima-children-debate-thyroid-cancer-japan-disaster-nuclear-radiation">health effects</a> of long-term exposure to relatively low doses of radiation.</p>

<p>Their former hometowns have since been turned into temporary dumping grounds for more than 10m black bags containing soil and other low level radioactive waste cleared from areas around homes, schools and other public buildings.</p>

<p>Here, too, progress is slow, with local authorities reporting that more than 40 communities have yet to be <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/jul/29/decontaminating-fukushima-japan-in-pictures">decontaminated</a>. The unprecedented cleanup, involving 26,000 workers, aims to reduce outdoor radiation exposure to one millisievert a year – a target Japan’s environment minister recently criticised as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/02/12/national/japans-environment-minister-withdraws-radiation-remarks/#.VuFFEpN96GQ">unrealistically low</a>.</p>

<p>But in a blow to the government’s push to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/12/safe-at-last-view-from-naraha-the-first-fukushima-community-declared-fit-for-humans">lift more evacuation orders in Fukushima</a> communities over the next 12 months, a poll published on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the disaster showed that two out of three nuclear evacuees had given up hope of ever returning to their homes.</p>

<p>“It is wrong for the central government to say return home and to lift evacuation orders, even though its own declaration of an emergency situation for the nuclear accident is still in place,” said <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ajw.asahi.com/article/0311disaster/fukushima/AJ201603030058">Miyako Kumamoto, a 73-year-old evacuee</a>, at a rally in Tokyo last week.<br/></p>

Thank you for your informative response.To save face, Japan may not have officially invited world experts in nuclear reactor to come forward to assist to arrest the radioactivity spread in the past 5 years. More and more huge water tanks are being built to store the contaminated leakage. A spokesman said it may take 40 years to "clean" the mess. That is a long time to wait. Meantime, most surviving victims just refuse to return while continue taking refuge a distance away.My main concern is could there be any better, more efficient and effective ways to solve this dragging nightmare. Such disaster can happen again in quake prone Japan anytime, anywhere. Or for that matter, the rest of the world.

Absolute pile of garbage. If you believe this crap you need to see a shrink. This site is pouring out lethal isotopes with no end in sight. If a robot can't last more than a few minutes do you really believe everything is returning to normal. All of the fuel pools were blown skyhigh. Thousands of tons of fuel with plutonium went everywhere. Wake up and do some real research it may surprise you.

A solution to the radioactive areas might be taken from Chernoble. The contaminated areas have become a de-facto nature reserve to the benefit of the whole area. It is a hard way to be forced into rewilding part of our occupied areas but one must make the best of a bad situation. The reactors still have to be made safe but the rest of the area could be simply left alone.

There have been lots of international scientists researching.

We know the vast majority of seafood is below Japanese strict standards aND that food is back to pre accident levels.We also know it's a very localized problem

I think you'll find everything has 'atoms in it'. Its the little matter of splitting and fusion that changes things. The Japanese PM at the time of Fukishima seems to share my concerns:I quote:'Nuclear power is unsafe and too expensive to justify building new plants anywhere in the world, according to the Japanese prime minister at the time of the Fukushima nuclear accident.'“Nuclear power is not safe. In the worst case scenario up to 50 million people inside a zone of 250km zone would have had to be evacuated. Nuclear power is not a suitable technology and renewable power is much better,” Kan told the Guardian.

With increasing frequency worldwide communities suffer heart rending loss caused by short sighted corporate greed. The scale of these events eliminate any possible humane compensation, there is no consideration or thought given to the 'soft' consequences. I am confused, it looks like corporations are killing all their customers. If they are not killed they lose all their assets so they are unable to participate in the economy. Is this in the business plan? Likely the only plan that matters is compensation for the executives but even that will be compromised eventually with no customers....well I didn't go to a fancy business school.

With the extremely high level of Japanese debt, and a shrinking population, someone else may have to help pay for most of the decontamination work.

It depends on how you define 'dangerous'. The visible impact of coal mining on the landscape, the pit accidents, workers health issues, pollution etc certainly do not make it a clean or safe energy source and we are right to move away from it. However, while nuclear might seem 'clean', I believe that is an illusion. Unlike coal however, most of the problems associated with nuclear are invisible-even down to the types of long term illnesses which might arise from radiation exposure which is itself invisible. Moreover, proving the link between the two after many years is difficult. Unlike big slag heaps, we do not see the mountains of extremely toxic nuclear waste. When a nuclear power station experiences a catastrophic accident as at Chernobyl we do not see the cloud of radioactive material drifting over our land but restrictions on livestock were in place for 26 years (!) in Wales after an accident which happened thousands of miles away.And while we are discussing 'safety', please bear in mind that even the most conservative estimates such as the lowest- from The Chernobyl Forum (including WHO, IAEA and United Nations representatives) which reported in 2005, gave a figure of around 4,000 deaths occurring in those affected by high levels of radiation contamination: evacuees and liquidators in the subsequent clean-up of the site. These of course are projected long term fatalities but note that the International Atomic Energy Authority was a party to the report.

Fukushima leaking radioactive materials directly into the oceanhttp://www.naturalnews.com/041217_Fukushima_radioactive_waste_ocean_contamination.html#Japan confirms that levels of cancer-causing cesium-134 are showing up in groundwater samples at rates 90- 110 times higher than all previous readings at the Fukushima disaster zone. The announcements are coming from the Tokyo Electric Power company (TEPCO) who has been monitoring the battered Fukushima nuclear power plant. Scientists believe it could take up to forty years to clean up the nuclear waste. The new high level readings of cesium-134 may mean that the destruction has just begun and that the Pacific ocean is set to become "the ultimate sponge" for this nuclear disaster.Fishing around the Fukushima plant was halted shortly after the crisis, and production of beef, milk, mushrooms and vegetables was banned in surrounding areas, crippling the prefecture’s thriving fishing and agriculture industries."We think that the volume of water is about 300 tons a day," said Yushi Yoneyama, an official with the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, which regulates Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO).

Sorry mate, turning the other nuke-plants on isn't the answer... Japan is earthquake prone, the technology is faulty, highly dangerous & extremely costly... Japan is better of going nuclear-free & instead put more efforts into installing safer technologies like wind, solar & tidal... This does mean ofcourse they'll have to for the time being continue to use oil, gas & coal, regardless of the associated CO2 emisions... Still, if more government funding would go towards an Japanese "Energywende", the sooner the reliance on nuclear power & other dirty technologies can be made a thing of the past...

The sources for claiming that wind power is 'the most dangerous' are extremely dubious. So one such source, gas/coal advocate R. Bradley, makes such a claim. In order to make it seem viable he claimed that 133 people had been killed in the wind power industry since the 70's. This number was reached by counting every single person who ever died while being in any way related to the industry -suicides, deaths during wind power protests, vagrants who died on wind farms.A more realistic estimate is around a dozen.

Claiming that Fukushima was no nuclear disaster is untrue and rubbish. The amount of radioactivity released and the melt down alone qualify the incident as disaster. He also said nobody died.I've cited a scientific peer reviewed review paper that gives an estimation of up to 10.000 deaths caused by the nuclear disaster. Some deaths are/will be caused by an increased number of cancer cases. Others by an increased rate of suicides. The increased rate of suicides are already there. The cancer cases will take some more time.
