Boris Johnson: 'I wish I'd built more segregated cycling routes for London'




DateTime::::2016-03-08T11:54:40+0000



<p>Standing next to what he calls the “billiard table-smooth” surface of the new <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35745404">segregated bike route along the Embankment in central London</a>, Boris Johnson is paying tribute to the Transport for London team that helped create it, and the other mixed bag of cycling infrastructure he will leave behind after eight years as mayor.</p>

<p>“They’ve done an amazing job, considering how difficult it is in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> to take road space and give it to cycling,” he says. “It’s very, very politically difficult. But it’s the right thing to do.”</p>

<p>With less than two months to go before he steps down, and conducting interviews to announce the 30 April official opening of the first stretch of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/cycle-superhighway-east-west">planned 18-mile east-west separated bike superhighway</a>, Johnson is thinking about his legacy.</p>

<p>Whatever his next steps in national politics, it’s arguably fair to say that along with a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ng-interactive/2014/mar/london-skyline-changing-now-future-pictures">series of high-rise buildings</a> and some Olympics-linked structures, the bike lanes will be the most tangible signs of Johnson’s time running Britain’s capital.</p>

<p>These began with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2013/nov/15/cyclist-london-cycle-superhighway-2-video">the original “superhighways”</a>, marked in the main only by strips of blue paint and arguably far better as a symbol of the rising numbers of cyclists than actually <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24625018">doing anything to protect them</a>.</p>

<p>But the new generation of superhighways – a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/cycle-superhighway-north-south">smaller north-south one</a> is scheduled to open in the summer – are very different, with full separation and protected junctions.</p>

<p>While still defending the original superhighways (“We tried a compromise approach with the paint, and that’s much better than nothing”) Johnson says that in retrospect he wishes he had gone for the separated lanes straight away.<br/></p>

<p>“Absolutely,” he says. “Looking back on it, yes. If I had my time again, and if I knew then what I know now, I would have gone straight in with a massive programme of segregated cycle superhighways. I probably wouldn’t have been re-elected, unfortunately. That’s one thing to consider. But that would have been the right thing to do.”</p>

<p>Johnson has faced considerable political and public opposition to the idea of taking road space away from cars. At one point just before our chat a taxi driver honks his horn on seeing the mayor’s blond mop, and gestures rudely through the window.</p>

<p>Johnson says there’s no question which is the more fractious debate, the EU or cycling: “Oh God, cycling. Unquestionably. The public hostility about the cycle superhighways has been much worse.”</p>

<p>This has, he adds, included hostility from many of his fellow MPs: “You’ve got no idea. When we started in Parliament Square, people went crazy. But it will all be over soon.”</p>

<p>Whatever Johnson’s overall record as mayor, and his <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/oct/04/boris-johnson-cycling-accident-statistics-wrong">occasionally hazy attitude to cycling facts and figures</a>, he’s always given the impression of being one of the very few UK politicians, and perhaps the only one of real national prominence, who really understands how mass cycling can transform cities.</p>

<p>That’s why his work on cycling in the city is arguably of importance beyond London: assuming the separated lanes can be shown to work in the capital, it could act as a catalyst for other cities.</p>

<p>“These are truly fantastic,” Johnson says, indicating the lane he confesses to using regularly even though it’s not yet officially open and remains blocked off just before Parliament Square. </p>

<p>“I think it will make a huge difference to public attitudes, to public understanding about why London values cycling, and what it means for us as a city. This is a city where we really want to encourage environmentally friendly transport of all kinds.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>“Look at our obesity crisis, look at the issues we’ve got as a city, the air quality issues...”</p>

<p>Even as his prospective Conservative successor, Zac Goldsmith, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/zac-goldsmith-ill-rip-up-londons-cycle-superhighways-if-they-dont-work-211121">takes a decidedly sceptical view of the new bike lanes</a>, Johnson says he is convinced a future mayor, whichever party they are from, will end up building more: “I think that the logic of this is now irresistible, and the programme will go on, will be protracted for many years to come. There’s a series of cycle superhighways still to be constructed and I think they’ll make a big difference to London.”</p>

<p>While bikes now make up a fairly high proportion of vehicles in central London – 24%, according to Andrew Gilligan, Johnson’s cycling commissioner, who is standing next to him – only about 3% of trips in the centre of the city are made by bike.</p>

<p>What, I ask Johnson, does he think this could reach? After some thought, he goes for 20%. “Yes, it’s a big ask. But it was 20% in 1904. What’s the point of being a Conservative if you can’t turn the clock back to 1904, that’s what I want to know.”</p>

It doesn't matter how good the signage if it doesn't match the desire lines of cyclists.Copenhagen's success (I know, I'm a Londoner that lives here) is based on all the main arteries having segregated cycling. They're the main arteries for a reason - because they're the shortest routes for the highest number of journeys. That's the same if you're on a bike or in a car.

I voted for Boris both times, because of his cycling policies. I will not vote for Zac, because of his cycling policies. Boris is right that he should have acted sooner and more decisively to promote cycling - partly for the benefit of cycling but mainly because London will be a very much nicer city when it is quieter and has fresher air.

I don't really get what the size of cities has got to do with anything. Surely population density is more relevant. In the UK over half of car trips are an easily cycled five miles.

In Germany there is a government shift towards putting bikes back on the road with autos. This means separate bike lights and right of way changes in favour of bikes. Electric bikes are also changing things.

Amsterdam and Copenhagen are much smaller than London and people have shorter distances to travel. Can you imagine biking in to London from Brighton every morning? Any serious attempt to reconstruct transport in London would have to include a combined rail/bike system or bike-park houses.

I like that concept "segregated bike routes". One for the master, one for dame, one for the little boy that cries down the lane. It could be worse I suppose. Whites only bike lanes?

I don't have the figures for serious injuries to hand, but going by the fatality rate, London was much safer in 2015 for cyclists (8 deaths) than each of the previous seven years (10 in 2010 to a high of 16 in 2011). Again without hard data, I also suspect there are many more people on bikes year on year, and in particular since the bike hire scheme was launched in July 2010.

You should see this joke in Wigan. And I've been through there with a concrete lorry on my outside. This is directly outside the Bus station as well. I know precisely how many buses could fit through that lane without impinging on either the cycle lane or the oncoming bus lane.

That's potentially the cheapest way to stay in London. It's only about £35 to apply for a licence to put a skip in the road for up to 14 days. Hire a nice closed skip, furnish it well, enjoy the space normally taken up by private motor vehicles.

the reason why cyclists in Amsterdam cycle more slowly is all about demographics. Unfortunately UK road conditions mean that cycling is viewed as something of an extreme sport, rather than an everyday method of transportation for all those from aged 8 to 80.

24% of vehicles on the road at peak time are cycles, yet because of the extensive public transport network, cycling only accounts for 2% of all journeys. I believe around 35% is rail and tube, and 35% is bus. Because of the volumes of people on public transport, it will be hard for London to match Amsterdam or Copenhagen for total mode share, but easier for the total number of cyclists

I blame him for sitting on his hands for six of those eight years. For scrapping the Western congestion charge. For claiming that the Elephant roundabout was "fine if you keep your wits about you". For absolving himself of responsibility for the death of cyclists on his sub standard superhighways by blaming the cyclists themselves, despite all the evidence to the contrary.Former Mayor Bloomberg of New York is a conservative politician who can be justifiably proud of his cycling legacy. Boris was a disastrous missed opportunity.

So if you are saying that ''cyclists'' are going to choke to death, you must also reach the conclusion that all people in motor vehicles will also choke to death. Considering the former doesn't contribute to the pollution, it's a pretty silly position.

sadly in their traffic modelling software, a bicycle journey only counts as 0.2 of a PCU whereas a car journey counts as 1... which explains the bias they give to motor cars...

'Physical lane segregation is divisive, ill-though-out and wasteful'I disagree with the above comment. On the divisive note - well that is the actual intention - the word segregated offers a clue here. Apologies for the sarcasm but that is the point of them. On major routes and in certain other instances they make complete and utter sense. A painted line is better than nothing but is simply a painted line. I cycle on such routes all the time and continually experience motor vehicles moving across the lines and often parking on them. In some areas of my city (Brighton & Hove) there is almost permanent parking in certain sections so in effect they are no longer cycle lanes. Consideration needs to be given to those less able, the younger and older cyclists and those with less experience. If we want to give everyone the chance to cycle safely in their city I think separating the cyclist from the cars, buses and lorries is an intelligent concept.

Certainly not. With presumed liability, if there is evidence that the other party caused the accident the driver will not be held liable. The default, where there is no evidence either way, is that the driver's insurance will pay compensation. That's what insurance is for. At present where there is no evidence, there may be no compensation for someone who has been seriously injured.

I cycled everywhere I went in London 30 odd years ago, and now, as a mature student have returned to cycling in London. It is busier, though not, at least in my impression, more dangerous, cycling around the Elephant and Castle could always be a harrowing affair and there have always been a small proportion of seriously deranged motorists. Possibly the biggest negative is the noticeably worse air pollution in the City, and the huge increase in evening traffic in central London.

From the words you used and the order in which you used them and the context of your comment, I formed the impression that you thought there was no need for a presumed liability law because bike accidents could be prevented just by penalising the riders. I see I was mistaken.

He showed no ambition whatsoever. A very belated convert to the cause of protected bike lanes. He was dragged licking & screaming to this point in the face of mass protests & a rising death toll. The first half way decent infrastructure is only being built now, deep into his second term, leaving us still decades behind most of our European neighbours.
