University of East Anglia abandons ambitious biomass scheme




DateTime::::2016-03-03T11:55:37+0000



<p>One of the UK’s largest and most ambitious biomass schemes, built with a £1m government grant, has been quietly abandoned.</p>

<p>The £10.5m plant was intended to burn woodchip to power much of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofeastanglia">University of East Anglia</a> (UEA), which has been hailed for its environmental credentials.</p>

<p>But a source inside the university said that the biomass unit has never run for more than 30 minutes, while students and staff told the Guardian that the plant’s wood storage area is now being used to store Christmas decorations.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>The power station, which was meant to cut the university’s carbon emissions by one-third when announced in 2007, was built using a £1m grant from the environment department in addition to renewable energy subsidies, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="https://portal.uea.ac.uk/finance/financial-accounts">according to UEA’s accounts</a>. </p>

<p>Suzanne Jones, a local campaigner on environmental issues said: “UEA has established an international reputation for its leadership in environmental technology, so it’s extremely disappointing that they have tried to hide the failure of their biomass project. There has been a complete lack of transparency here.”</p>

<p>The university has refused several Freedom of Information Act requests from local activist group <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://thenorwichradical.com/">The Norwich Radical</a> in the past six months, saying releasing the information “would have a chilling effect on the development of new low-carbon energy projects in future” and a negative impact on the economic interests of the university and commercial partners. </p>

<p>A UEA spokesman said that the unit had provided energy, but using gas rather than woodchip. </p>

<p>“It has not been possible to commission the woodchip/gasification component of UEA’s new CHP [combined heat and power] unit. However, the unit has been supplying both heat and power to the campus since 2008, using natural gas, and the university continues to make a return on its investment. </p>

<p>“Upgrading of old pipework and replacement of existing engines last year meant that the unit was the university’s sole source of heat and electricity generation for several months. <br/> <br/>“There is a real need for new technologies to secure a low-carbon future and as a university we have a part to play in exploring those potential solutions. That process of exploration is never without some risk.”</p>

Depends what happens to partially combusted hydrocarbons and contaminants within the fuel.

UEA not only wasted taxpayers money on its own failed biomass scheme; it wasted additional £millions on another failed biomass scheme & property redevelopment.

It's not known locally as the "University of Easy Access" for nothing.

The University of East Anglia certainly has filthy environmental credentials. Forests should not be chopped down until we achieve carbon zero and gas should be left in the ground for thousands of years. I live in a much colder climate than East Anglia and use no fossil fuels. Granted, my apartment got down to 9C during a few days this winter, but I have survived despite being 70 years old. Wind energy electricity runs my car, cooks my food, and warms my blanket. I don't use hot water, but my renter upstairs uses the electric water heater.

I always though biomass to electricity would be far inferior to biomass to chemicals. The latter though I know can be very problematic.

Feeling a bit smug up here at Lancaster University, with our 2.3 MW wind turbine, CHP unit of 2MW heat and 2MW electricity, and 1 MW biomass boiler. Additionally, three gas boilers of 5MW each, one of which sustained central heating in some residences on campus during a 3 day power cut courtesy of Storm Desmond last December. Intrigued to know where it all went a bit off-kilter at UEA, a university with a similar environmental ethos to this one.

You ought to read The Norwich Radical article they tried to get info out of the UEA who repeatedly turned down FoI requests. It's the UEA who won't release the details.

Whilst I'm not a fan of woodburning (best leave the carbon in the trees), at least industrial scale plants can recover the emissions to the toxins and particulate pollution in removed (unlike the lethal domestic woodburners having a devastating impact on health of e.g. neighbours).

Glad that the Guardian have taken the time to cover it because often it feels like institutions outside of London can get away with anything they want, just because there aren't as many journalists around in locations away from the capital.

Wood gasification - is it common? Many have tried to build them but failed to get past a pilot scale installation, lots of investors have lost money. Does that count? Here's the true facts - http://www.biofuelwatch.org.uk/2015/biomass-gasification-and-pyrolysis/.As with all bioenergy, gasification is a dangerous distraction from what we really need to be doing- which is to reduce energy dependence and consumption. Not pursue ridiculous notions that we can make wood burning power our energy-profligate society and magic away the carbon emission by a trick of accounting.

I am merely surprised this has come out , I thought their standard position was the very anti-science stance of not releasing data 'in case people find something wrong with it '

Next brainiac UAE project, funded by government grant of £10m is to condense European air in tankers, shipping them to UAE and releasing it in Dubai to help improve air quality!Phase 2 of this development, due in 2020 would allow release of the air in Abu Dhabi!UAE are open to investors for the "why?" phase of this initiative!

No idea, given how little detail of technology is given on that website; basically, Orthios seems to be a proposal to use power station waste heat to keep greenhouses warm.

not at this scale - they're almost invariably single household or even vehicle.

If it's burning scrap wood that may have been treated with preservatives, for certain. And even when it's not, there can be unacceptable concentrations in ash of toxic metals

More good news.



Author::::riveness
DateTime::::2016-03-03T13:14:06Z
Is it anything similar to the orthios proposals? I believe that is pyrolysis which I also believe has few large scale demostrations?



Author::::Oldgroaner

Yes, in ships that burn the dirtiest and most polluting fuel.

For 'government gerant' read 'taxpayers' money'.



Author::::riveness
DateTime::::2016-03-03T13:01:39Z
Probably due to the trace amounts of heavy metals that some biomass contain. It does tend to get concentrated. I would question the toxicity but if you are getting incomplete combustion and you have soot fallout.....



Author::::PatLogan
DateTime::::2016-03-03T13:00:10Z
Not at significant scale. It's a technology more usually used at the level of an individual household or vehicle.

Author::::Promitheus

Several miles away from an urban area is probably "OK" for biomass burning (which I think is what ST Andrews wants to do). Essentially it's a solid fuel combustion power station. It emits roughly as coal - not great!

Author::::James Griffith
DateTime::::2016-03-03T12:26:30Z
The good news is that most of the hard infrastructure is there. Once we start getting limits put on gas burning while still having to back up wind this could easily be turned back on.

Ironic, given UEA offers a specific energy engineering course with a distinctly Green bent...



Author::::Ubergeekian

I wonder if this has any implications for St Andrews University, which is starting to build a biomass heating plant in Guardbridge, several miles from the town.
