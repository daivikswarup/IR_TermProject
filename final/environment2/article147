'We are on the verge of a litter crisis' - British 'grotspots' cleaned for the Queen




DateTime::::2016-02-25T07:00:26+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he canal bank beside Northbrook Street near Birmingham city centre looks and smells like a tip. The grass is strewn with plastic cups, fag packets, cans, tins, wraps, cloth, papers, peel, binliners, bags, butts and bottles. Builders have come in vans and flytipped waste, kids have graffitied the brickwork.<br/></p>

<p>The canalside has been nominated by the public as one of the worst “grotspots” in British cities and an army of volunteer litter pickers will descend on it and hundreds of other places in March in an attempt to tackle what has become known as the “blight of Britain”. </p>

<p>For Chris, a retiree living in the nearby north Summerfield, the litter is offensive, depressing and incomprehensible. “I have challenged people. You watch them eat their sandwiches and then chuck the packaging away. ‘Hang on,’ I say. ‘I live here.’‘Oh I am sorry,’ they say. People know what they are doing is wrong but they think someone else pays the bills,” she says.</p>

<p>Chris, who asked not to give her full name, says she doesn’t blame the council, which she says has good people trying to clean up Birmingham’s mess. But she says 40% austerity cuts have made a bad littering problem worse across the whole city. </p>

<p>“There’s just no money now to clean it up. It’s alright in the city centre but everywhere else it’s terrible and getting worse. They’ve cut billions from the budget. They do online consultations and say ‘do we clean up the litter or cut children’s services?’ Of course people say ‘we can’t cut the childrens’ budget’.<br/></p>

<p>“I just don’t understand people who litter. I have seen cars stop at traffic lights, a door open and a used takeaway bag put on the road. What do you do? It’s a culture. Perhaps it starts in schools.”</p>

<p>The government-backed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cleanforthequeen.co.uk/home/2365#home">“Clean for the Queen” event</a> on 4-6 March is billed as the largest ever clean-up of the British environment. Schools, community groups, individuals, charities, companies, local authorities and parish councils are expected to clean up litter-blighted areas ahead of the Queen’s 90th birthday in June.</p>

<p>The stark fact is that Britain is one of the most litter-blighted countries in Europe, says Adrian Evans, who oversaw the festivities on the river Thames that marked the Queen’s diamond jubilee in 2012. He now heads the government-backed Clean for the Queen campaign, which brings together all of Britain’s litter groups for the first time.<br/></p>

<p>“Our ambition is to create a community-inspired, grassroots mass action event – one that will become a recurring annual initiative. We feel that marking the Queen’s 90th birthday with the inaugural clean-up is a wonderful way to kickstart it.</p>

<p>“We want to show that millions of people in this country care passionately about the litter affecting the nation and are prepared to get out and do something about it. Everyone in this country will reap the benefits.” <br/></p>

<p>Litter is widely seen as a British problem, says <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/british-litter-worst-in-world-david-sedaris-tells-mps">US writer David Sedaris</a> who lives in Kent and picks litter from the hedgerows. “You have to go deep into eastern Europe to find it so bad. I have never seen anything like this in Japan or France. It’s obviously a cultural problem,” he told <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/communities-and-local-government-committee/news/litter-ev-2/">a committee of MPs</a> last year. </p>

<p> A<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://blueandgreentomorrow.com/features/public-anger-over-governments-lack-of-action-on-britains-litter-epidemic/"> recent Populus survey </a>found that 90% of respondents consider litter to be a massive issue, with 81% saying that seeing litter makes them angry and frustrated. </p>

<p> It also found that 82% thought having litter on the streets encouraged other people to drop litter, and 93% said that littering shows a lack of respect for the environment. However, 61% of people said they would be afraid to confront people who drop litter.</p>

<p>“Rates of fast food littering and flytipping are on the rise and people find this really offensive. We are now on the verge of a crisis,” said Richard McIlwain, operations director of Keep Britain Tidy. </p>

<p>“We seem to have more litter than anywhere else in the world. The risk is that over the next five years local authorities will come under even more financial pressure and will have to cut back on services further. If so, we will see environmental degradation across large areas of Britain and people’s sense of wellbeing will decline.” </p>

<p>Around 2.25m pieces of litter are dropped on the streets of the UK every day. Thirty million tonnes of rubbish are collected from England’s streets each year and it costs councils more than £1bn a year to clean up.</p>

<p>Hotspots include canals and verges but also motorways. The Highways Agency clears about 180,000 sacks of litter from motorways and A-roads alone. In 2013-14, local authorities dealt with 852,000 flytipping incidents in England and Wales. These cost roughly £45m to clear up.</p>

<p>Government figures show that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/20/flytipping-in-england-rises-for-second-year-running">the number of flytipping incidents increased for the second year running in 2014-15</a> and council funding for street cleaning has fallen for the fourth year running.</p>

For as long as we make one-use, disposable items out of a product with life span of centuries there will be problems. We have created everlasting litter which even when put in the bin, costs a huge amount to dispose of properly. When it escapes into the environment it is there for decades if not forever. Hardly surprising then that littler is increasing exponentially. One solution would be for individuals to boycott trashy plastic. If you think that can't be done check out this list of plastic free alternatives http://plasticisrubbish.com/a-z-plastic-free/

Try China. And Hong Kong, though there, while they do employ minimum wage elderly post-retirees to sweep up it is the plastic and fast food waste that blights the country parks, verges and other vaguely out of town areas, including frequent human excrement. One of the richest places on the planet, so it's not just down to lack of money.

I believe the poo-bagging is being done by people who think they are "responsible dog owners" - they see dogshit (not from their dog) and pick it up. I don't know who started the trend but it's meant to wake the irresposible dog owner from their slumber and learn to do the right thing.

If people want a litter-free country enough, they will pay to have it. Otherwise they will just whine and complain (or on odd occasions, pick it up themselves).



Author::::ID2463357

It's all very well, but it's not practical. The public taxpayer (you, I take it) has to pay someone to clean the streets, lanes, parks and beaches. Otherwise it won't get done.

Perhaps they should pay people to pick up litter, professionally, instead of being supported by the state or using food banks.

Dolt. We're not blaming the queen for the state of the place. But it might have escaped your notice that councils are using austerity to cut everything in sight. And there's always money to spunk on the bunfights for the establishment, knowing all too well it'll lapse back into a shithole once the jamboree is over.

Graffiti, while linked to increased litter, is not litter and should not be viewed in this way. It's art and expression. ......................................

Bring back the stocks and put the littering louts and the fly tippers in them, then allow the people who have to clean up after them to pelt them with all the thrown-away fast food leftovers, the used condoms and dirty baby's nappies, and pretty well anything else that they have to pick up and dispose of. Afterward the litter pigs should be washed down with a fire hose at full pressure and then paraded through the streets of their hometown, in a cage, on the back of a lorry. The following week should be spent picking up other people's litter with their bare hands.

I loved your highlighting of the plastic bag charge as a means of reducing rubbish and I think that the principle could be more widelyapplied. I'd be happy to see the charge rise too, and in Germany (who are generally years ahead of the UK when it comes to environmental concerns), people have been taking their own bags to superfor decades - Just to save the environment. It seems that Germans are far more environmentally aware than we are.

How many people still drive their cars to the progressive corporation? Yes fumes are intangible but is alternative transport use part of your company's venture apart from any fledgling cycle to work scheme? Doubt it. Therefore it's still a big part of the cultural problem.

It would be nice to think that people would not drop their rubbish, but we know from experience that many do. Could there be a way to identify who has dropped the rubbish, and if so, would it work. With dog poo now, some authorities are doing a dna test and matching it against "chipped" dogs details. Could we have a credit or Debit card No or other identifier printed onto paper or plastic bags, cans or bottles etc., and goods only sold with that proviso. I am informed that in some countries, penalties for littering can be very high. Is that a solution? Anyone caught littering maybe sentenced to a 14 day penalty of picking up rubbish and a fine in addition? Another solution could be for purchasers to have to provide a suitable bag to put their purchases in. Most would say these solutions are too draconian. The 5p charge for a carrier bag has been successful and introduced recently to England too. That was a start, maybe we have to take some next step. If there was a programme of progressively stricter penalties, might it be that after a time, we did not have to invoke it. Whichever system might be chosen, it would have to be enforced for it to work, probably including some surveillance system.
