Report calls for lower stamp duty on UK's energy-efficient homes




DateTime::::2016-03-02T06:30:18+0000



<p>The stamp duty paid on energy efficient homes should be up to £5,000 less than on leaky, hard-to-heat homes, according to a new report that says the government is doing far too little to cut energy waste.</p>

<p>The report is from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications">thinktank Policy Exchange</a>, which is close to the government, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/energy/12108756/Ministers-consider-stamp-duty-discounts-for-home-insulation.html">ministers are considering the idea</a>. It estimates the stamp duty change would lead to 270,000 households a year improving their energy efficiency. </p>

<p>“Improving home energy efficiency can save households money, as well as substantially reducing their carbon emissions,” said Richard Howard, author of the report, and a former chief economist for the crown estate. “Policies which link property values more closely to energy performance could kickstart an energy efficiency revolution in this country.”</p>

<p>The report heavily criticises ministers, who have cut back energy efficiency programmes which are widely seen as the cheapest way to cut energy bills and meet carbon targets. “The UK still has amongst the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2013/nov/29/uk-homes-most-expensive-heat-eu-fuel-poverty">least efficient housing stock and highest rates of fuel poverty</a> in Europe,” it states.</p>

<p>The government aims to improve the insulation of 1m homes this parliament, far fewer than the 4.5m in the last parliament. It has also abandoned the failed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-deal">green deal programme</a>, which was meant to reach millions of homes with unique loans but only taken up by 16,000 households. “This leaves a major policy gap,” says the report.</p>

<p>The Policy Exchange proposal is to lower the stamp duty on energy efficiency homes while increasing it by the same amount on inefficient homes, meaning the tax taken by the government remains the same overall.</p>

<p>For example, someone buying a house worth £220,000 - the average UK house price - would see a £500 reduction for a well-insulated property, but £500 more for a draughty one, a difference of £1,000. Policy Exchange says the difference in stamp duty should be capped at £5,000 for multi-million pound properties. People buying the lowest cost homes would not be affected as stamp duty is not paid on properties under £125,000.</p>

<p>“The government could nudge people into making improvements to the efficiency of their home, which would not only add a premium to their property but would also reduce their energy bills,” said Howard.</p>

<p>The report also suggests affordability calculations made by mortgage lenders should include how much a property will cost to heat, meaning more efficient properties would be eligible for bigger loans.</p>

<p>“We think stamp duty differentials would be effective,” said Garry Felgate, at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ukace.org/">Association for the Conservation of Energy</a>. “It is particularly powerful as it establishes a link at purchase between energy efficiency and value. We believe that a viable alternative is a similar system of differentials for council tax: the more efficient you make you home the lower your council tax bill.”</p>

<p>The report says: “There is huge potential to improve domestic energy efficiency. Research shows that a more ambitious approach to energy efficiency could deliver carbon savings of 24m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030 – equivalent to taking more than 10 million cars off the road – and save households of £8.6bn a year in energy costs.”</p>

<p>A government spokesperson said: “This government is serious about helping vulnerable people heat their homes and keeping energy bills low – that is why we are requiring energy companies to improve the energy efficiency of over 200,000 homes per year, helping to tackle the root cause of fuel poverty while delivering on the government’s pledge to insulate 1m homes over the parliament.”</p>

<p>Another report published on Wednesday indicates that a roll-out of energy storage technology could save energy customers £50 a year, as well as cutting emissions on improving energy security. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/from-liquid-air-to-supercapacitators-energy-storage-is-finally-poised-for-a-breakthrough">Energy storage technologies, from liquid air to big batteries, are developing rapidly</a> and can store excess renewable energy and cut the need to build new power stations and lines.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.carbontrust.com/energystorage">report was written by the Carbon Trust and Imperial College London</a> and commissioned by Decc and three of the UK’s big six energy energy companies. A spokesman for one, SSE, said: “The report shows that, with the correct market structures, price signals and policy certainty, projects such as SSE’s proposed pumped storage scheme at Coire Glas can make a valuable contribution to society.”</p>

Well it would seem to me that "incentivising" based on total energy used taking into account finical circumstances would mean it would be more likely that poor families get the break. In this scheme, richer families spewing out loads more CO2 get the help.

No incentive is ever perfect- The similar car tax I would prefer to have all fuel duty rather than tax bands [although my cars are all tax free], you could buy a very efficient car and drive it about like a boy racer doubling fuel consumption.

My knowledge of the EPC rules is that a ASHP gets a plus point- so if the system of counting plus vs minus is a dumb as I think it is then you will get a few more stars.

I Do not disagree but even an efficiency house can be using a ton more energy than an inefficiency one. Here we are proposing to give a tax break with no concern on actual energy use.

Thanks. At the moment the gas heating is very unresponsive, and I think a bigger boiler will need bigger radiators and pipes, so a very expensive job.

depends on the boiler- gas would be a waste, oil or lpg would be worth looking at the system.

Wel at least that's an incentive to the builders of new homes make them energy-efficient, albeit not much of one.There needs to be something more done in that direction.

Yes, council tax banding would be a better incentive than stamp duty.

EPCs are indeed simplistic. Because they are cheap, and not based on actual measurements of anything. The basis is rdSAP, which is 'reduced' SAP. And even full SAP has it's own problems. You can build a passivehouse and still get a 'C' grade quite easily.

logic is not your strong point- the market especially the lower your income favours wasting money in the short term rather than investing in the long term- rich people spend less on shoes in a life time because they can afford the up front cost of investing in quality- poor people stay poor because they constantly buy poor quality.

Grade II listing has different meaning in different counties- Gloucestershire is very good and encourage eco retrofits including interior and exterior cladding- other counties may have officers who are jobs worthies- in Powys [yes you you fascist!] it was acceptable to put the new insulation material : sheep's wool - because it sounded old fashioned rather than fibreglass which was present in the 80s when the building was listed.

This is a slightly perverse aspect of the rating that scores a combi condensing boiler over electric heating- given an eco home will not need gas and will use passive - heat pumps or mvhr it is something that needs sorting.

I would agree but you can improve your own EPC by keeping a photo record of improvements.

To ensure all your hard insulation work is recognised make sure there is comprehensive photo record [add a ruler to photos like CSI].

An eco house that used the same amount of energy as a standard house would be huge- currently the average energy cost is £1300 - and similar eco home will reduce that down to between £200- 400.

If homes were rated like cars for CO2 emission- then A+ homes would pay no duty and the price would go up as the rating went down. This would be a huge incentive to bring the UK housing stock into the 21st century.

How a house is used has far more effect than any notional rating. Heating a modern "energy efficient" house to the level where it's uncomfortable to wear more than a t shirt in any room will use far more energy than an older property heated to the level it was historically (wear a pullover) in the rooms you actually use as you use them.

If it's due to the size, they'd be penalised by the stamp duty anyway - as they'd cost more.

It would fine if they made new homes efficient and with rooms big enough to life in, but new homes are tiny and no better, sort out the new stock not the old!

And what about those that use less energy? The guardian did an article some time ago that was very efficiency house but was using far, far more energy than my household due tot he size.

our 1900 house is well built- most old houses are ...our improvements have ensured that it doesn't lose heat

Yeah sounds great I'll spend £3000 on improvements to save £1000. Lucky I can do the work myself as the labour is 70% of the cost,but the government does not like that as I am not spending my money and so does not look good on their stats.

beg to differ.... our 1900 house is well built- most old houses are ...our improvements have ensured that it doesn't lose heat..... most new homes are not bigger... and in my opinion, definitely not better. It is accepted that all houses shouldn't be sealed, they need to be able to breathe... and so all houses have to have some form of ventilation; trickle vents etc.. because otherwise they would be too well insulated and they sweat/cant diffuse build up of fumes etcTo be honest it feels a flawed environmentally and sustainably to argue that old should be knocked down rather than brought up to spec /maintained.... and personally I shudder at the thought of seeing row after row of American style new build estates.

The logic is that it makes economic sense in most places and, if people are willing to waste money, that's not the governments problem.

Rather than messing with taxes, the average year round heating bill should be calculated and then legally required to be displayed alongside the price or rent. This not only gives a better incentive for homeowners to improve their house but means that landlords aren't penalized for upgrading their stock and trying to recoup the investment back via rent.

Stamp duty is one of the most pernicious of taxes, since it penalises those who are prepared to relocate to find work. The dole freak who stays in the same house at public expense, does not pay it.

Nice idea, as long as it can be kept simple. How about subtract 1% for an A rated, and add 1% for D and below.

The way energy efficiency is measured is flawed.... and negatively impacts on old houses.... we have a 1900s house, we have gutted it, so it now has insulation underneath the concrete floors, insulation boards on the walls, double glazing, combi boiler etc .... everything that brings it up to the spec of an energy efficiency that is current standards, yet when we had it assessed prior to having solar panels installed it came out as a D. I queried this with the assessor but was informed that the tick list they follow means that, regardless of what we had done, the age of the home dictated the result.A friend who already had solar panels and an even more energy efficient house than ours (polystyrene type bricks - sorry can think what they're called) had had her boiler removed, because she had no need for it - her solar panels heated her hot water - underwent a second rating when she wanted more solar panels adding to her roof, and because she had taken out her boiler, her rating had fallen from a C to a D.The current "help to buy" scheme has already made older houses less desirable to first time buyers, all this will do is make them even less desirable.... It seems to be going against any environmentally friendly common sense by suggesting that houses are disposable items that should be knocked down when they're 20 years old.

What a economically stupid idea. Why tax even higher the transfer of those homes to deter them getting new owners who invariably make then improvements to them such as energy efficient new windows and boilers?If you want to hike taxes to encourage energy efficiency improvements you have to increase tax on the energy itself and if you choose use that money to subsidise qualified improvements.But of course that isnt politically popular so let's propse a tax destined to deter the behaviour we want instead. "Think tank"?
