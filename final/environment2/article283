Record hot years near impossible without manmade climate change – study




DateTime::::2016-01-25T10:00:02+0000



<p>The world’s run of record-breaking hottest years is extremely unlikely to have happened without the global warming caused by human activities, according to new calculations.</p>

<p>Thirteen of the 15 hottest years in the 150-year-long record occurred between 2000-14 and the researchers found there is a just a 0.01% chance that this happened due to natural variations in the planet’s climate.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/20/2015-smashes-record-for-hottest-year-final-figures-confirm">2015 was revealed to have smashed all earlier records</a> on Wednesday, after the new study had been completed, meaning the odds that the record run of heat is a fluke are now even lower.</p>

<p>“Natural climate variations just can’t explain the observed recent global heat records, but manmade global warming can,” said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the research team.</p>

<p>He said the record heat brought substantial impacts: “It has led to unprecedented local heatwaves across the world, sadly resulting in loss of life and aggravating droughts and wildfires. The risk of heat extremes has been multiplied due to our interference with the Earth system, as our analysis shows.”</p>

<p>The UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed on Monday that the global average surface temperature in 2015 shattered all previous records and said 15 of the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 2000. “We have reached for the first time the threshold of 1C above pre-industrial temperatures. It is a sobering moment in the history of our planet,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas. </p>

<p>The new research by Rahmstorf and colleagues, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831">published in the journal Scientific Reports</a>, is based on a statistical analysis that combines real-world measurements with comprehensive computer simulations of the climate system. This allowed natural climate variability to be better separated from human-caused climate change. The results did not vary significantly when UK Met Office temperature data was used instead of Nasa data.</p>

<p>The research was prompted by earlier claims that the run of record-breaking years was vanishing unlikely, a one in 650m shot, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/heat-noaa-nasa-say-2014-warmest-year-record">according to one report</a>.</p>

<p>However, the average global surface temperature of the planet each year is influenced by the warmth of the previous year, meaning that a record broken one year is not independent of the year before. The UK <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/2016-set-to-be-hottest-year-on-record-globally">Met Office expects 2016 to break the record set in 2015</a>, partly because of the continuing El Niño weather phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Natural climate variability causes temperatures to wax and wane over a period of several years, rather than varying erratically from one year to the next,” said Prof Michael Mann at Penn State university in the US, who led the new study. “That makes it more challenging to accurately assess the likelihood of temperature records. Given the press interest, it seemed important to do this right, and address the interesting and worthwhile question of how unlikely it is that the recent run of record temperatures might have arisen by chance alone.”</p>

<p>The study concludes: “While considerably greater than cited in some media reports, the odds are low enough to suggest that recent observed runs of record temperatures are extremely unlikely to have occurred in the absence of human-caused global warming.”</p>

<p>In 2013, the UN’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/27/global-warming-ipcc-report-humans">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded with 95% certainty</a> that humans are the main cause of global warming.</p>

Unfortunately you don't have data from 1945 to 1980 on the hydrosphere the place where more than 90% of the warming occurs. Aerosols are a reality when the degree of bombing, particularly incendiary, carried out particularly during the second world war and the Indochina war.

You claim that we do know how long the Earth's systems take to reach global greenhouse warming climate sensitivity equilibrium in response to increased levels of atmospheric CO2. Provide a proper reference to a peer reviewed scientific paper in a proper scientific journal that tells you how the Earth's systems take to reach global greenhouse warming climate sensitivity equilibrium in to increased levels of atmospheric CO2.

When I asked you to provide a reference to a peer reviewed scientific paper published in a proper scientific journal that substantiates the reasons for your dispute with the scientific community, you said "I've provided you with a graph. You can look for yourself"; but a graph by itself, without an explanation of how the data displayed in the graph has been collected as would be found in a proper peer reviewed scientific paper, is useless and tells me nothing substantial. So to substantiate your reasons for your dispute with the scientific community you will have to provide a reference to a peer reviewed scientific paper published in a proper scientific journal. So far you have not done that and hence have failed to substantiate your reasons.

The confirming of the hypothesis now theory that increased net CO2 emissions leads to warming, in total, of the hydrosphere, the atmosphere and the cryosphere has led to new hypotheses about how this warming or extra heat is divvied up between the three spheres and what the effect of these spheres is of the amounts of heat they absorb or lose. These are a whole nest of hypotheses. The reference you make above to "temperatures were below predicted below predicted" also begs the questions of what it was the temperature of that was predicted. It was the temperature of the Earth's climate. The temperature of the Earth's climate was not below the temperature projected or predicted by global greenhouse warming climate models.

In respect to the hypothesis that increased net emissions of CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels leads to increased warming, all together, of the hydrosphere atmosphere and cryosphere, you say "To make that prediction scientists have created models that they use to predict the earth's response to increased CO2, solar radiation, volcanic activity etc."

You say "The hypothesis is that CO2 leads to increased warming." That hypothesis is not good enough for the situation we (the scientific community) are investigating.

He is right as far as it goes. Suppose for the sake of argument that four fifths of the warming was due to natural variation and the remaining one fifth was cause by human generated CO2. The statement "The world’s run of record-breaking hottest years is extremely unlikely to have happened without the global warming caused by human activities" would still be right. I don't read WUWT except articles I get linked to from elsewhere.

It is a game when more than 60 scientists come up with different explanations for the pause and they all get published. Since when did guesswork become science? To cap it all NASA rushed out a paper claiming there was no pause, which is so bad, even some of their fellow concensus scientiists have criticised it. The name of the game is of course politics. I am not disputing the standard of measuring a climate trend over 30 years. That should not stop me from pointing out that the trend over the last 18 years is close to zero. Inevitably that has lowered the 30 year trend that contains that 18 years, and that 30 year trend is way below the climate model projections.

The meanders of the high latitude northern hemisphere jet stream weakened by the reduced Arctic temperature gradient due to greenhouse warming. After two weeks of single figure maximums in England I once flew to Paris and was able to discard the thermals and enjoy being pelted with liquid water for a change outside the Louvre. We were on the other side of the sine curve. I don't know how many sinusoidal loops there are currently between Hamburg and Taipei, but your one's going the other way to Bluecloud's.

If you increase the net carbon emissions from humans burning fossil fuel and no warming of the hydrosphere and atmosphere occurs this would be proof that the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration from the increase in net carbon emissions is not causing the atmosphere, and the hydrosphere to warm.

"So back to 1945-1980. Temperatures fell, CO2 rose. That falsifies the null hypothesis."What else happened in the world between 1940 and 1975? In scientific experimental tests you must control for all variables and consider all known possibilities. Especially the one's right in front of your eyes. None so blind as those who will not see.

The hypothesis is that increased C02 leads to increased warming. To make that prediction, scientists have created models that they use to predict the earths response to increased C02, solar radiation, volcanic activity etc.

On the eve of the 2007 Australian federal election both major parties (Labor and Liberal) and the two minor parties (National and Greens) supported action to mitigate global warming. Opening a Labor Climate Change Summit in the August before the November election, Kevin Rudd, described climate change as the great moral, economic and social challenge of our generation. He also claimed it should be above politics. During the election campaign Labor a 20% emissions reduction using renewable energy by 2020 and a 60% reduction by 2015. The Liberal National coalitions 2020 target was less and involved the use of clean coal technology.
