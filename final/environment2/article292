Liz Truss urges farmers to stay within the EU




DateTime::::2016-02-23T12:16:04+0000



<p>The UK environment secretary, Liz Truss, launched an impassioned plea to farmers on Tuesday to vote to stay within the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a>, but may face a greater struggle than expected.</p>

<p>Truss told delegates at the National Farmers’ Union annual conference that leaving the EU would be a “leap into the dark”.</p>

<p>She said: “I believe that by voting to remain we can work within a reformed EU to reduce bureaucracy and secure further reform while still enjoying the significant benefits of the single market, which gives us access to 500m consumers. We are able to export our high quality products freely, without the trade barriers we deal with elsewhere and with a say in the rules.”</p>

<p>“I believe we would be stronger, safer, and better off in a reformed <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>,” she said.</p>

<p>Farmers have traditionally been in favour of membership of the EU, which offers them a free market for their produce, without tariffs or trade barriers, as well as subsidies amounting to about £3bn a year. Workers from other member states also make up a substantial portion of seasonal workers.</p>

<p>However, according to attendees at the NFU conference, a significant number are now doubting the benefits of remaining within the bloc.</p>

<p>Tom White, a livestock farmer from the south-east of England, said: “I don’t there’s any question - we are going out. And I very much support that. It will be good for farming, and will take out the inefficiencies of a subsidised industry.”</p>

<p>He added: “I think I am in a minority, but more young farmers are coming to this view.”</p>

<p>Nick Johnson agreed. “I am definitely an outer, as I don’t think we have any influence any more in Europe. We used to, but now we are one of 28 [member states], we don’t any more.”</p>

<p>Several other farmers, who preferred not to be named, also told the Guardian they supported a Brexit, citing EU regulation and a perceived lack of support for farming.</p>

<p>But Simon Bainbridge, a Northumberland sheep farmer, who sells many of his lambs to the continent, called for the UK to stay in. “There is such volatility in prices, it would be wrong to leave a free market. It’s bad enough without that hanging over us.”</p>

<p>Under the EU’s common agricultural policy, farmers receive payments based on the land they farm and the efforts they make to improve the environment, for instance by providing habitats for wildlife in field margins.</p>

<p>The subsidy can mean the difference between profit and loss as farming is coming under increasing pressure from price falls in international commodity markets. </p>

<p>However, many farmers argue that they see little of the subsidy. That is because supermarket buyers know how much they are likely to receive, and factor that into their calculations on the price they offer farmers for their goods. This means the benefits of the EU payments often accrue more to big retailers than to the farms.</p>

<p>Supermarkets have been criticised by farmers for putting pressure on their suppliers. Earlier this year, the supermarket ombudsman found that Tesco had used poor practices in its dealings with suppliers.</p>

<p>Meurig Raymond, president of the NFU, said farmers were caught in a “vicious price war” as leading supermarkets struggled to compete against discounters. “The supermarkets may say one thing publicly, but we know that they will push the pain down on to their suppliers and they’ll do it because they think they can. That ends up with the ridiculously low prices for vegetables that we saw in some stores over Christmas. It was crazy that the carrots and sprouts for Christmas dinner cost less than a can of coke.”</p>

<p>Farmgate prices have also fallen sharply under pressure from international markets, with a slowing Chinese economy depressing exports and a continuing import ban from Russia. </p>

<p>The NFU said average December 2015 prices for milk, wheat and pigs were down more than 30% from the same period two years ago, while prices for spring lamb last year were down 11% on the 5-year average. Farmers are now in record levels of debt, having borrowed £17.8bn from banks last year.</p>

<p>Raymond said: “British farming has felt blow after blow in recent years. One thing I know for sure is there is no possible way that any sector can carry on in the same vein.”</p>

<p>Truss used this as an argument for persuading farmers to stay within the EU. “Farmers in Britain have faced a tough year,” she said. “Farmers’ incomes have been squeezed. They are expected to be down by half in dairy.”</p>

<p>“At a time of severe price volatility and global market uncertainty, I believe it would be wrong to take a leap into the dark. The years of complication and risk caused by negotiating withdrawal would be a distraction from our efforts to build a world-leading food and farming industry that brings jobs and growth to Britain,” she said.</p>

<p>For others, the fact that farmgate prices have fallen despite the UK’s membership of the EU is an argument for leaving. Andrew Branton told the Guardian: “We have had umpteen years of this. Why not try something different? Why not get out?”</p>

<p>The food industry, which includes farming, is the UK’s biggest manufacturing industry, employing 3.8m people and exporting 60% of its products to the EU, worth about £11bn a year. </p>

<p>The NFU, the UK’s largest farming organisation, attracting a record 1,400 delegates to this year’s conference, has not taken a public stance on whether the UK should vote to stay in or leave the EU in June’s referendum. The organisation has commissioned a report from a Dutch university how membership of the bloc affects the economics of farming in the UK. That report will be published in late March, and in early April the NFU’s council will make a decision on whether to take a public view, and if so which side to recommend.</p>

<p>Green campaigners urged voters to oppose Brexit, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/03/brexit-would-return-britain-to-being-dirty-man-of-europe">which they are concerned would weaken environmental protections</a>. </p>

<p>Sam Low, campaigner at Friends of the Earth, noted that Truss had told farmers she would press for more decisions such as pesticide rules and environmental stewardship to be made in the UK rather than Brussels. “One of the best things about UK membership of the EU has been the positive impact it has had on our natural environment. If it wasn’t for the EU, bee-harming neonicotinoid pesticides would still be widely used.”</p>

<p>Farmers make up a significant part of the Conservative party’s power base in rural constituencies, which rarely vote Labour, so the plea by Truss was an important step in trying to prevent a damaging split within the party. </p>

I take it you in America as the UK has a fantastic climate for growing grass and here on the side of dartmoor it's about all it will grow bar the odd field of barley !

Actually the world produces more than enough crops to feed the human population, the problem is most of the crops that are grown go to feed livestock. So if prices do go up then it might make people think more about what they are eating and the effect it is having on our environment and change peoples diet to reduce the amount of meat and dairy they eat significantly.

Food is the same numerical price in the UK as in France. The difference is that the prices are stated in Pounds not Euros.

The UK is running a huge deficit. It is not the "biggest customer". This is nowt to boast about, it is a huge problem which will be amplified by not having agreements in place should Brexit happen.

We all know Defra is in bed with the NFU, the badger cull is a good example of this. A proven waste of time, life and money just to please a minority.Truss is nothing more than a mouthpiece for Cameron and does what she is told.This is nothing more than politics and promising more pesticides is nothing less than immoral.

The National Trust own vast areas of land that is in terrible ecological condition with poor biodiversity so I will not care one iota if they lose subsides as they do very little for our woodland and wildlife, the RSBP will I am sure be fine without an EU subside, anyway without CAP the cash cow EU gravy train stops for large land owners, so hopefully the ones that are in it for the free money will sell up and hopefully nature can move back in there.

The EU heavily subsidizes European Farmers. Some UK Farmers get a small benefit but will always be outpriced by European Farms.

Let the new entrants to the EU increase production at our expense and sell to us while we fund them ....obvious we should get out or prices will fall due to our contributions to the other states.The imports will also come irrespective of our contribution to them.Lets continue and shoot ourselves in the foot.

Irony is, that it was introduced to protect the small farmer. This has not happened and now large farmers including the queen get over£1m subsidies each year. This is what needs reform. Perhaps there should be a cap on CAP subsidies, so that small farmers get more and the queen gets less.

No it doesn't. It told them not to catch small fish, so as to allow the stock to be rebuilt. They decided to catch them anyway, keep them on the boat until they were dead, throw them back in and then tell the world the evil EU forced them to do it. The fishing industry has refused all attempts at conservation.

And see Shanajackson's post if you think there'd be any public support for diverting UK public funds to support agriculture.

£8000 a year ! I wish someone would give me £8000 a year to help my business. The market will find the subsidy free value of food once it goes, then the tax payer will be free from this terrible unjust unfair use of tax payer money.

Yes it could be argued, a lot of other industries are subsidised as well as agriculture, your food is currently as cheap as it was in the 90's and 16% cheaper than on the continent.

Sounds good, but unfortunately we have a supermarket dominated food supply that manipulate their imports to keep a lid on domestic farm price. If we didn't export lamb to France, Belgium and Spain our home market and price would collapse !

Best thing possible for agriculture to leave EU and give up all those lovely subsidies. IT would have to stand on its own two feet like other industries. The reorganisation following this might lead to better and more varied outputs, more people working on the land and be better for wildlife. It might be the reason I will vote to leave - to get rid of CAP.
