CO2 levels make largest recorded annual leap, Noaa data shows




DateTime::::2016-03-10T16:34:48+0000



<p>Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide last year rose by the biggest margin since records began, according to a US federal science agency.</p>

<p>Fossil fuel burning and a strong El Niño weather pattern pushed CO2 levels 3.05 parts per million (ppm) on a year earlier to 402.6 ppm, as measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.noaa.gov/record-annual-increase-carbon-dioxide-observed-mauna-loa-2015">said</a> on Wednesday.</p>

<p>“<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/us-canada-promise-lead-world-low-carbon-economy-obama-trudeau">Carbon dioxide levels</a> are increasing faster than they have in hundreds of thousands of years,” said Pieter Tans, lead scientist at Noaa’s Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. “It’s explosive compared to natural processes.”</p>

<p>The big jump in CO2 broke a record held since 1998, also a powerful El Niño year.</p>

<p>Drought and erratic rainfall caused less carbon to be stored by parched forests and drylands, on top of the effect of fossil fuel emissions, Noaa said.</p>

<p>CO2 levels in the air have increased over 40% since 1880, as industry ramped up emissions. The build-up of those gases traps heat, which warm the planet and stoke extreme weather. Last year was the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/20/2015-smashes-record-for-hottest-year-final-figures-confirm">hottest year on record</a>, according to multiple weather agencies.</p>

<p>The last time the Earth experienced such a sustained CO2 rise was between 11,000 and 17,000 years ago, in which period CO2 jumped by 80ppm. Today’s rate is 200 times faster, said Tans.</p>

<p>Scientists at the remote Hawaii site have plotted global CO2 levels since 1958, in what is known as the Keeling Curve.</p>

"Your price escalator and taxing suggestions would bust the world's economy, and eventually lead to billions dying of starvation"That is debatable and the 'business and regulation as usual' will eventually and all too soon, cause the collapse of modern civilization may well lead to an extinction level event. There cannot be a higher price to pay for not 'putting a price on carbon'.

There is a way, Power Satellites, to stop the rise in CO2, while providing the people of Earth with lots of inexpensive energy. It uses a resource, sunlight that misses the earth, we have hardly tapped. Sunlight in space supports the $300 B dollar satellite business.

Why is that - is it because some systems become saturated (such as the ocean surface) or things like drought? I can see deforestation as an obvious problem but clearly there are other contributors I'm not aware of. Much talk of feedback loops also.

Nobody is distracting from the increase. CO2 has gone up 50 ppm just since 1987, but the number of "carbon feet" responsible for that increase has risen by two billion. The point I tried to make was, that the usual way to view a year-over-year increase is to use the calendar year. The result is very different from what is presented here. That's misleading.

No, I know he doesn't deny the rise in CO2, but my post was intended to be a light-hearted reference to the usual deniers who pop up in this forum. Most of them aren't stupid enough to deny at least some of the facts, but they spout an awful lot of GWPF progaganda.

So what percent of total demand for hydrocarbons is for vehicle use, and how much do you think that can be reduced?

According to a new Bloomberg report electric vehicles will cost less than traditional cars by 2022. Toyota has made a commitment to run 95% of its cars on hydrogen/battery power within 35 years, and many other auto companies are following a similar path. If and when this hydrogen is produced renewably, which means that we are equating the cost of renewables storage (a necessary component of an expedited energy transition) with the total cost of getting gasoline from the middle east to the pump (investment, subsidies, extraction, refinery, transport from extraction location, defense of extraction location, tertiary industries etc) - if all this is accounted for transparently I find it difficult not to compare hydrogen favorably in price to oil as the infrastructure is developed. This hydrogen infrastructure, by the way, being an electrolyser at the renewables site and a truck to drive it to a filling station where it is kept in another container. Not such big deal, and renewables are then storing as much energy as can be provided.

Many consider that an option. It requires investment in bicycle lanes and paths as well as mass transport and even combinations of bike and rail. The idea of subsidizing oil companies through capital expeniture write-downs should be discontinued. The same goes for company cars and allowing gas-guzzlers to be accepted as tax-reductions should stop. Auto companies are at present making a move towards autonomous vehicles that can chaufeur people around and park themselves. If such schemes are realized they should be restricted to small engined vehicles and even better to no carbon emission vehicles. Otherwise some joker will start his own parade of gas guzzlers with only one person at the head of a line of 20 "followers" just to show how much money he has.

We are not all responsible for the massive increases in fuel consumption and the inefficient methods of getting it out of the ground. Yes we are all in this world together, but some are making massive profits from fossil fuels and waste. 



Author::::Daniels78

We have had to depend on oil and gas for many years and have recently come close to the financial institutions shutting down as a direct result of this dependency. I think it is wilfully negligent to dismiss the current path of energy transition as either a passing phase or something unnecessary. Whether you have investments in assets that are soon to become worthless, or are contemplating such issues generally as a result of some personal stake, I find it unfair and wholly destructive to cast aside the mounting weight of evidence in order to defend whatever miopic, grubby lie you feel content to dress up in faux-sympathy when everyone knows for a fact that as time goes by those coal stations will kill this entire planet.

To reduce demand for hydrocarbons it is only necessary to to significantly reduce vehicle use. Unfortunately none of us consider that an option. Keep some in the ground but keep enough available to fill all our fuel tanks.

Perhaps because we are being sidetracked by co2 its the sun that provides heat , I wonder if its more a case of the antarctic being at a shallower angle to the sun as it moved into place which started the glaciation, co2 having a tiny part to play in that.

Chuck... It should be no surprise because the correlation between atmospheric CO2 and the people adding to it is almost perfect...99.85. CO2 will reach ~450 ppm when the global population reaches nine billion. CO2 is up almost 50 ppm just since 1987...when the population was "only" five billion. Until "we" get some grip on population growth it will continue to rise. Drastic cutting back on emissions will do nothing if the number of "carbon feet" keeps growing.



Author::::Broadlands
DateTime::::2016-03-11T15:20:08Z
Misleading information?It is important to note that the values are NOT calendar year values. 1997 to 1998 increased by 2.94 ppm. 2014-2015 only 2.22 ppm. Even the 2012-2013 was higher... up 2.66 ppm.

Strong El Nino events cause wide swaths of the world's tropical forests and equatorial land areas to experience drought conditions, which slows their ability to take up carbon, which would thus mean more carbon remains in the atmosphere. While El Nino increases rainfall across limited areas of land, the main increase in precipitation during an El Nino is over the open waters of the tropical Pacific.
