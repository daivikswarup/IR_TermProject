<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>anted: a new generation of feminist super heroes to stave off ecological catastrophe. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://guardianprincesses.com/staff/setsu-shigematsu/">Setsu Shigematsu</a>, a California-based academic, has created the “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://guardianprincesses.com/">Guardian Princesses</a>” – seven female Disney-style cartoon characters, which she hopes will inspire enthusiasm for non-violent collective eco-action in the younger generation.</p>

<p>There is a rich history of eco-feminism, starting from the coining of the term by French feminist Françoise d’Eaubonne in 1974 in her essay <em>Feminism or Death</em>. This launched a wave of women linking feminist viewpoints with earth-saving, which built on Rachel Carson’s work in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/silent-spring-2.html"><em>Silent Spring</em></a>. And in <em>Rape of the Wild </em>(1989), the authors take issue with “Man’s” violence against animals and earth.</p>

<p>Also in the 1980s came the first organised groups, like<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.womensearthalliance.org/">WomanEarth. Womensearthalliance.org</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://wecaninternational.org/">wecaninternational.org</a>, are the modern incarnations: eco-feminism has become closely aligned to the climate crisis.</p>

<p>One of the world’s greatest environmental activists, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/vandana-shiva">Vandana Shiva</a>, cut her teeth in the Chipko movement in India in the 1970s, against deforestation. The women wrapped their arms around trees while men tried to chop them down. And women in the developing world are likely to bear the brunt of environmental disaster. Shiva has referred to women as the “canaries in the coalmine”.</p>

<p>The new incarnation of the movement has less truck with Mother Earth ideals, or the hackneyed conceit of women’s “affinity” with nature. Instead, it demands to know why women are still often absent from the top table of environmental debate, shut out by the same heteronormative males we took issue with in the first place.</p>

<p>Stuart Haygarth spent New Year’s Day 2000 combing London’s Bankside for spent fireworks and party poppers from the previous night. Then he worked them into a spectacular millennium chandelier. Since then, he has continued to turn ‘rubbish’ into art. Brought together in a new book, Strand, his work shows the painfully slow degradation of oil-based products, in particular plastic toys and shoes. <br/>Strand<em> is published in April, priced £28 (</em><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.artbookspublishing.co.uk/"><em>artbookspublishing.co.uk</em></a><em>)</em></p>

<p>Ethical fashion stalwart (and long-time Ethical Awards judge) Livia Firth began working with Marks &amp; Spencer last year, curating a collection of the retailer’s most ethical garments. This month she designs her first capsule collection. “The exciting thing,” she says, “has been having the chance to design as many sustainability features as possible into a mainstream collection.” The collection includes two dresses, accessories (from a sustainable leather supply chain in Brazil) and the Athena culottes and Gia top shown here, inspired by the laid-back off-duty chic of her style heroes, Jackie O and Grace Kelly. She stresses that the pieces are designed to last a lifetime, and form the basis of a truly sustainable wardrobe. When ethical fashion infiltrates the high street in this way, it’s a big moment. Prices start at £49.50.</p>

You have got to be kidding. Vandana Shiva is responsible for many, many people falsely believing that farmers were being harmed by "terminator" seeds, which were never produced. She has generated so much misinformation on GMOs that she's responsible for Indian farmers not having access to things like Bt eggplant that would actually reduce the amount of pesticides that poor farmers with little protective gear have to use.

That's a massive overstatement. I don't agree with Greenpeace in its opposition to GM and nuclear, but I fear their impact is pretty limited compared with the resources of the fossil fuel lobby.

Tree planting happened in Kenya thanks to the inspirational work of Wangari Maathai. Read about it in her autobiography UNBOWED. There is also a children’s book about her by Franck Prévot and entitled WANGARI MAATHAI: THE WOMAN WHO PLANTED MILLIONS OF TREES.

Yes, just because someone says they're an environmentalist or other form of activist, doesn't prevent them from being wrong about things. Pseudo-environmentalist groups like Greenpeace with their opposition to GMOs & nuclear energy bear significant responsibility for the potential catastrophe of Global Warming.

Vandana Shiva. I don't know what her record is on other environmental issues, but I know that her pronouncements on GM crops are never based on reality, just anti-GM retoric. Especially the myth that GM cotton has caused widespread suicide in India. This has been disproven by several academic reserachers, but she continues to spout this nonsense. I don't think that she should be a role model for anybody.
