Thousands to march against coal plant threat to Bangladesh's Sundarbans forest




DateTime::::2016-03-02T10:00:01+0000



<p>Thousands of Bangladeshis will march from the country’s capital, Dhaka, to the world’s biggest mangrove forest next week in protest at plans to build two coal-power plants on the edge of the World Heritage-listed forest.</p>

<p>The organisers of the so-called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://campaigns.350.org/petitions/stop-coal-based-rampal-power-plant-and-save-sundarban">long march on 10 March</a> hope to persuade the Bangladeshi government to drop its backing for construction of the plants near the Sundarbans, an area of rice paddies, shrimp farms and vast mangrove forests.</p>

<p>“No sensible person will deny that there are many alternative ways for electricity generation,” said Anu Muhammad an economist with Jahangirnagar University, and head of the march organisers, the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports. “But there is no alternative for [the] Sundarbans.” </p>

<p>Both the proposed 1,320 MW Rampal coal plant and the 565 MW Orion coal plant will sit within 14km of the Sundarbans, a 10,000 sq km (3,860 sq miles) forest listed as both a Unesco World Heritage site and a Ramsar-protected wetland. The great forest is split between <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and India, but the bulk of its lies in the former.</p>

<p>Activists fear that the coal plants will slowly destroy the Sundarbans – already under threat from forest fragmentation and overpopulation – due to air and water pollution, changes in water quality and increased boat traffic. The Rampal coal plant alone will take 219,600 cubic metres of water every day from the Passur river, potentially changing the salinity and temperature of the water on which mangroves depend. </p>

<p>The government estimates that the Rampal coal plant will require approximately a shipment of coal every day through the ecosystem’s winding, shallow rivers. Critics say this could increase chances of a catastrophic spill, a concern brought home in 2014 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/11/bangladesh-oil-spill-threatens-rare-dolphins">when an oil tanker spilled 75,000 gallons into the fragile ecosystem</a>. For days, locals were left to fight the toxic spill with little more than pots, pans, spoons and sponges. </p>

<p>The government contends that the coal plants will have little to no impact on the forest, saying they will use the latest technology to mitigate pollution. </p>

<p>“We see no reason why this project would destroy the Sundarbans, as alleged,” said Ujjwal Bhattacharya, managing director of the Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company (BIFPC), which is running the Rampal coal plant. The BIFPC is a joint company between India and Bangladesh’s national power companies. </p>

<p>Bhattacharya added that the new coal plant is based on “stringent” environmental guidelines and follows Bangladeshi law. </p>

<p>The Bangladeshi government also argues that the coal plants are necessary to reduce poverty in a country where around a third of the population lacks power. </p>

<p>“This project will usher in economic prosperity in the Rampal area … which will reduce dependency of the local population on [the Sundarbans],” said Bhattacharya. “This will rather help the government … to save the Sundarbans.” </p>

<p>While most officials are sticking to the government line, Bangladesh’s finance minister, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, admitted last month to reporters that the coal plant would have “some impacts obviously,” adding that the boats carrying coal on a daily basis will “substantially affect the flora and fauna there”. </p>

<p>Activists note that this is a coal plant that could never be built in neighbouring India, which has a law on the books that coal plants must be at least 25km from the edge of any forest. </p>

<p>Miha Mizra, a local researcher and activist, said that these projects are indicative of the Bangladesh government’s “one track obsession over high GDP growth as the standard of progress”. She calls this “a very shallow idea of development which is merely growth based, consumption driven, and energy obsessed” and accuses the government of viewing Bangladesh’s poor and its forests as just “collateral damage that is expected to be sacrificed”. </p>

<p>The collateral damage could also include Bangladesh’s last population of tigers, which are found in the Sundarbans. A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/27/only-100-tigers-left-in-bangladeshs-famed-sundarbans-forest">recent survey</a> found only 106 tigers surviving in Bangladesh’s side of the forest, far fewer than expected. Bangladesh was one of 13 tiger-range countries that pledged in 2010 to double the world’s population of tigers within 20 years, but so far its own population has continued to fall. </p>

<p>Other threatened species in the Sundarbans include two river dolphins and an endemic bird, the masked finfoot. Overall, researchers have documented more than 1,000 species in the Sundarbans – and that’s not including insects. </p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis depend directly on the Sundarbans forest and its waterways for their livelihood, from fisheries to honey production. The forest also provides a vital buffer against the cyclones that routinely hit this part of the world. Muhammad calls it a “natural safeguard … for nearly 40 million people.” </p>

<p>Despite its vocal stance on the international stage on tackling climate change, Bangladesh is aggressively turning towards coal. The Rampal and Orion coal plants are just two of at least a dozen planned coal plant projects around the country. </p>

<p>Hasina has pledged to increase Bangladesh’s coal power by 15,000 MW by 2030, raising Bangladesh’s percentage of coal power from 1% in 2010 to 50% by 2030. Currently, the country gets the bulk of its energy from natural gas. <br/> <br/>Activists like Mizra have an uphill battle ahead of them. A long march against the Rampal coal plant three years ago – which attracted some 20,000 people – failed to dissuade the government. Construction on that project is expected to begin this year. <br/> <br/></p>

Yes, you will be waiting around for that.It is not that sovereignty is 'important' it is onlythat it is a fact and it will not be changing.Sovereign countries will remain in control of theirown energy and taxation policies.I am familiar with the Montreal Protocol and many bring itup as a model of UN success. Kofi said it was the best thingthe UN ever did.It was an initiative of US-Canada which guaranteed its success.Most UN projects are initiatives of the EU and are not agreed toby important countries.There were some 46 countries represented in Montreal The replacementchemicals/processes had already been discovered and were in use beforethe convention was called.It was a matter of saying 'we are now using this, we are no longer using that.'The US could have just sent all countries a memo to that effect.No country had to sign on to not using any refrigeration, freezing, air conditioningfor a decade or two while new technologies were developed.The other +/- 150 countries had a copy sent to them which they signedand returned.If you give a useful, effective climate treaty a difficulty rating of 100, theMontreal agreement had a difficulty of less than 2.

I'm not sure who these westerners are that are lecturing Bangladeshis about morality, but the folks protesting this coal plant appear to be Bangladeshis directly impacted by it. Let's talk realistic, cheap, 24-hour dispatchable power. It's not coal or nuke. Nuke in particular is not dispatchable as it is difficult and slow to turn up or down. Coal plant operators hate to turn their plants off and on as it is very expensive and leads to a lot of wear and tear. The reliability of both those sources is considerably lower than solar pv. LCOE? According to the Indian energy minister, solar PV is now cheaper than imported coal-fired plants. Recent unsubsidized solar PV plants in India have come in at less than 5cents a kWh. In a country like Bangladesh, where electricity usage is very low and the grid is underdeveloped and unreliable, distributed solar is the best solution. You don't need 24 hour power to run irrigation pumps. Batteries and LED lights powered by solar PV are becoming the go-to solution across the developing world. Just as mobile phones leapfrogged centralized land-line systems in these underdeveloped countries to provide affordable communications, distributed solar and microgrids are getting cheap electricity to underserved folks quickly and in small, affordable increments while enormous, billion dollar coal plants and their centrally planned electric grids will take at least a decade to put into place.

According to studies, this latest claim that coal will provide electricity to poor villages is a myth. (phurphy, in Australia). Apparently, if your village is more than 5 km from the grid, you'll be unlikely to get connected. The majority of increased generation will supply the growing middle class to have more aircon , and western lifestyle. while the rest miss out. (ok, we're lucky, and we don't realise it}. Forget 24/7 power. It's not the main issue for people with none. Most of these people will be helped more by a solar lantern for their children to read and do homework after dark, cook dinner, and save a heap on their household budget on kerosine. (let alone the reduced fire risk. ) Decentralised small scale local power generation from renewable energy will transform the lives of the people you apparently care about.

Actually, I am not wrong. Anything Bangladesh is likely to do with coal pales into insignificance compared to the amount of new coal capacity under construction in India. Solar in India is in addition to, and not instead of coal. India plans to double domestic coal production by 2020.

Actually you are wrong. Look at India's own development of Solar. Its is now rapidly competing with fossil fuels. They have achieved cost parity and storage is now far more possible. In India it has allowed communities to form their own grid and be less dependent on the state. The reality is that the Sundarbans are also going under water.. so what happens then.. we have waves of Bangladeshi 'coolies' rowing coal out to the plants. Its absurd. The protest is the choice of the people..and is being led by scientsist and engineers, not green fanatics... respect their choice to differ from white fella stuff.

OK, I suppose that's "biblical." I wasn't aware of this 1970s Banqiao dam disaster. I'm unable to recall any major "hydro plant failures" in the US (where I've lived) during my lifetime, but then there are rigorous construction standards here and inspections. Your 'wiki' link specifically mentions that Banqiao was built below normal Chinese standards; whereas, yes, we've had nuclear plant "failures," if you want to recommend that route. I don't, and I doubt acres & acres of solar panel farms will help much given the lengthy monsoon season. I don't know if windmill farms are feasible in Bangladesh, but they have a lot of people without access to electrical power and need to get some projects going. I simply would hope they have more sense than to proceed with coal-fired electrical plants.

I like your comment Epic. so true in regards to environmental damage has not boundaries. such as air pollution from China affecting citizens in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Radiation from Fukushima affecting tuna that end up on people's dinner plates in California. the UN is absolutely critical. they are the "one" organization that keeps registered countries in check and try's to keep order. without them, this world would be in a far worst state than it already is...

Two 1200 MWe Russian VVERs will be built at Rooppur with construction to start in 2017 and 2018 and expected completion in 2022 and 2023. These will be mostly financed by Russia at low interest rate. Projected nuclear capacity by 2030 is 5000 MWe.

One would have thought the Paris COP 21 conference would have come up with some kind of formula /policy / a trouble shooting advice committee for developing countries to help avoid this kind of madness. Of all the absurd places to build a coal burning power station next to a World heritage site with the extinction looming Tiger. All over the World there are governments who are completely and bizarrely going against commonsense and unequivocal evidence that climate change, rising temps and rising sea levels are happening now and will accelerate. Why would developing countries be so blind to these events- dirty money? - its very good at ignoring the truth.

Thanks to Mr Hance and The Guardian for reporting this. While Prime Minister Hasina and Finance Minister Muhith desperately need to increase the capacity of the Bangladesh electrical output and expand the grid in rural areas of the nation so that inexpensive electrical power is available to more of its population, the damage to atmosphere and risks of other environmental damage inherent in burning hydrocarbon to do so would seem to make the Rampal/Orion projects an ill-advised option.

If Bangladesh pulled its thumb out they could easily have sufficient gas resources to power their country cleanly. Unfortunately their energy industry is plagued by inefficiency, bureaucracy and corruption, end result is that international companies don't see any reason to explore and local companies cant afford to. Coal power stations also secure contract kickbacks across a long supply chain. Shame for the Sundarbans, a very unique place.
