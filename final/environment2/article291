UK environment ministers at odds over Brexit impact on farming

<p>Leaving the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> would pay an £18bn a year “Brexit dividend” which would allow the UK to spend £2bn on farming and the environment, farming minister, George Eustice, has said.</p>

<p>Eustice sought to reassure farmers at the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) annual conference that “without a shadow of doubt” they would continue to receive the subsidies for farming and environmental measures from an independent UK as they are currently paid through the EU’s agriculture policy. </p>

<p>The EU referendum has split the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/23/leaving-eu-would-put-uk-food-and-farming-exports-at-risk-says-liz-truss">environment secretary, Liz Truss, backing the campaign to remain</a>, but her junior minister for food, farming and the marine environment declaring support for leaving the bloc.</p>

<p>The NFU conference had heard from Truss that it would be wrong to take “a leap into the dark” at a time of volatile prices and global market uncertainty, putting the £11bn food and farming export trade to the EU at risk. <br/></p>

<p>Farmers have voiced concerns that Brexit would prevent them having access to the single market and the Treasury would not match the £2.4bn of support they get through <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>, which accounts for an average 53% of farm incomes.</p>

<p>But Eustice has told farmers at the conference the UK would do “far better” outside the EU, able to design and implement its own policies to support food and farming. </p>

<p>“I have taken a view, having wrestled with all sorts of EU regulation over the last two and a half years, that we would do far better as a country if we ended the supremacy of Europe and shaped new fresh thinking policies that really deliver for our agriculture. </p>

<p>“The truth of the matter is if we left the EU there would be an £18bn a year Brexit dividend, so could we find the money to spend £2bn a year on farming and the environment? Of course we could,” he said. “Would we? Without a shadow of a doubt.”</p>

<p>He insisted a reinvigorated national parliament would demand the Treasury spent money on farming and environmental land management, and that bilateral agreements between the UK and EU would allow Britain more influence over the kind of regulations that farmers say they are hampered by. </p>

<p>Challenged to lay out what a post-Brexit policy for the countryside would look like, he said it would take away the split between payments for productive land and for environmentally friendly farming, streamline the environmental protection rules farmers must meet to get any payments and invest more in science and technology.</p>

<p>He also said payments for wildlife friendly farming schemes would continue, but the application system for them could be improved, and there could be payments to reward high animal welfare as well as for environmental measures. “All of this would be possible if we took back control and had the ability to design and implement policies properly,” he said.<br/></p>

for a start, under World Trade Organization rules, the UK will have to subsidise farmers, just as they did before we joined the EU.It must be at the same level to enhance competetiveness with other countries.WTO rulings will make the UK cover the SFP and ewe headage payment too, the organic 25% premium & hill farm subsidies, whilst removing stupid rules such as cross compliance, set aside, rotation, EID for sheep, etc etc...British farms are already losing 10-13% of their subsidies as farmers are paid in Euros, so will then be paid in pounds sterling.Beef and Egg production is on the cards to get a hammering from the EU soon, as well as Organic farmers.We have seen the stupidity of regulations so far, straight cucumbers being one of them, the list, as we know, is endless...We need to get OUT

Nor is it an argument that we would have a windfall. We would simply have control over what we spend our money on, which is how a democratic nation should function.

Yeah, silly me, producing stupidly cheap food for you to stuff your face with. You know what, stop the subsidy schemes right now, but don't whine like a bitch when you have to pay the true cost of what you eat. When that happens the queues for the food banks will stretch over the horizon.

We're well aware we will be shafted, but a lot of us still intend to vote leave! Besides, how long will the remaining EU go on being able to subsidise their inefficient farming without our contributions. Roll on the world that has no subsidy and a fair price for food!

I think we can say with quite a large amount of certainty, that the EU will trade with us if we leave. After all they have a very large vested interest in trading with us. We are a nation of 65 million consumers and we buy far more from the other countries of EU land than they do from us. Why wouldn't they want to carry on such a lucrative market? Will they be able to afford to cut off their own nose to spite their face? Will there even be an EU to deal with or will the whole project collapse in the fallout of a Brexit?  Arguments on how safe Europe will be after we leave the EU carry more weight than this bickering about trade, but even they are futile since history shows that locking countries in to unhappy unions only serves to stoke the boilers of resentment and eventually leads to cataclysmic explosions when the pressure gets too much. If Brexit is more like Jackanory, then Bremain is more like Tales of the Unexpected.

I'm a farmer whose voting out even though it will totally scupper my already failing business.Why? You might ask.Because even when we are in the EU they do their level best to scupper our industry. Are the rest of my colleagues so blinkered that they can't remember how quickly the countries of Europe slapped import bans on our cattle during the BSE debacle, can't you remember how slow they were to lift those bans and the foot and mouth bans? TB will be their next excuse and they will use it whether we are in the EU or out of it. Europe see us as a service nation and will do all in their power to remove every last trace of industry and agriculture from our shores. At least if we get out of the EU machine we can maybe get rid of the curse of subsidy once and for all. For the first few years it will be tough as we will have to compete with heavily subsidised imports, that our government will jump at in order to keep inflation down. But it won't take too long for the financially bereft EU to decide that it can't keep on chucking money it hasn't got at unviable French farmers. Either that or the whole EU boat will capsize after the massive weight shift from our jumping off.  The way forward when we leave is uncertain and not without its own risks. The way forward if we remain in is the certain death of British agriculture and British industry and far more risky in my opinion.

Given the freedom , farmers will grow whatever makes a profit. We are in the end just small businesses. I have a family to feed, bills to pay, just like anyone else. There are a few wealthy enough to engage in "hobby farming", unfortunately I am not one of those.Farmers will still be supported post BREXIT but almost certainly at a lower level.So I am the proverbial Turkey voting for Christmas but I am a bit old Skool and put the future of my country first.

How much do you get in taxpayer subsidies. ? How much do Aussie / Canadian farmers get. ? Sweet F.A. If you cannot compete, do what they did to shipbuilders, steelworkers, mill workers, coal miners. apply for the dole. We can afford it, after all we only owe £ 5 trillion. how much of this goes to Tory voting farmers, ?

Well ###### said mate, Farmers, Tories to a man, Subsidized up to the eyeballs. If you cannot compete, close down, the world is awash with food at half the price British farmers are paid. Aussie farmers get NO subsidies at all. And they get floods, droughts. If you can't cut it, get a proper job, Oh you cannot, Thanks to Thatcher.

I would ask all farmers , If Given initial set up support to grow a much wider range of crops on your land could you do it and make a living from it ? Would you do it ?



Author::::Alan Thruston
DateTime::::2016-02-25T11:01:19Z
The Original decision to look at GM produced food was as i understand it ,because we have now reached a critical ere of contaminated production through the use of Chemicals, such as carcinogenic Glyphosate which although ever increasing in farming production is still not allowing us to produce the quality Europe thinks we need. I think our farmers could match any farmer in Europe in effort and production ,if given the basics in equipment and support to do so. This would mean a much better vegetable for all of us and a reduction in chemical additives, which are now cultivating children and adults with ever increasing Allergies , whilst damaging our soil beyond repair. An 18 Billion fund would set this up permanently and give the farmer back his sense of contribution in real terms.

The most durable gripe the British public have had about the EU and its predecessors is the CAP. Agricultural subsidies and the resulting waste, high food prices and intensive farming are massively unpopular in the UK, which unlike almost any other EU member has few people with any link to the land. Scrapping such subsidies would be done with relish by any government as practically the first "Brexit dividend". Even though farmers are dyed in the wool Tories, are they really gullible enough to believe that post-Brexit their subsidies would be preserved or even increased?

"streamline the environmental protection rules" is one thing they can promise, because they have form over nicotinoids as well as other substances banned by many EU countries, and intend to remove many subsidies and protections guaranteed by the EU. There is also the big business lurking in the wings like Monsanto, the scourge of India.BREXIT could mean the collapse of farming, amongst other effects.

The south east we are told subsidizes the rest of the UK by one pound in every five paid in taxes. Out of the EU we could spend on Farmer Giles, it will not be that sort of pile he gets. Your fault for living in the sticks now so what chance with Brexit?
