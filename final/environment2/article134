If we could only prevent smog episodes then it was thought that the air would be safe. A<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199312093292401"> study</a> in the 1990s changed this view. Thousands of people living in six US cities were tracked over 14 years. Having allowed for smoking and other factors, people lived shorter lives in the most polluted cities, showing, for the first time, that the particle pollution that we experience every day affects our health.</p>

<p>In a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_8-2-2016-16-20-31">new study</a> scientists at Imperial College London have now looked at people over four decades. 368,000 people (1% of English population) were selected from the 1971 census. The researchers then looked at the next three censuses to check if the 1971 people were still alive. Survival was associated with their local pollution in the decade that they died, but it was also linked to the air pollution that they breathed up to three decades earlier. The effects of air pollution in 1971, 1981 and 1991 could still be detected in the death rates of people in 2001.</p>

Harm can start before birth and continue through childhood to leave us weaker for our old age.</p>

<p>The message is clear. Investing in improving the air that all of us, especially our children, breathe today would help us to have better health later in life.</p>

If people would stop acting like clones of the government and cut off the respect they have for tax collectors doing a anti-crime crusade, I could say that people have become finally humans again. How can you all complain about pollution when you have not asked for taxes against factories that pollute food, drinks or the environment? You have turned the government into a cult that destroys the planet and they you want them to fix environmental disasters. They are a big witch right now and you pay respect to a witch. There are satanic cults that come up because of this issue. The witch brings bad luck and disasters, constantly, simply because they can't stop polluting. If you would have asked the government for proper taxes now the government would be very busy cleaning up the environment and there would be plenty of money to do so. They would stop doing abuses against freedom into the jail system as well. Many criminals fight the government more than you all do and they get into jail. What does it take for you to come out of this mind control and infatuation with a witch?

This think piece misses an important opportunity.

I am unsure of the priorities, but we might include in our demands some unadulterated water and clean produce from our farming sector while we gasp for some fresh air. Worldwide surveys indicate massive pollution with pesticides and herbicides of our waterways. The oceans are polluted with all manner of poisons gradually being assimilated into the food chains. Our food supplies are contaminated by industrial fertilisers and the long term unproven genetic manipulation..... Russia has just banned the import of GMO cropsYes we could and should demand the availability of fresh unpolluted air, but the fractious and illogical response and rejection of the pollution with green houses gas by the culprits indicates our demands will fall on deaf ears and the money grubbing interest will prevail without direct action and offending product embargoes by the community

living in sydney, all you can smell is the fumes from diesel powered buses and the methane from gas powered taxis. include a lot of SUV's as well and you get a nice toxic concoction of breathable poison. with tree's disappearing and phytoplankton counts dropping, there is not going to be much air left to breath for anyone. electric buses can already out range their diesel counterparts where the push to go electric is critical. for all modes of transportation.
