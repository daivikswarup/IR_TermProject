During the most important year for climate news, TV coverage fell




DateTime::::2016-03-07T11:00:02+0000



<p>Media Matters for America has publishe<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://mediamatters.org/research/208881">d a report detailing US broadcast news coverage of climate change in 2015</a>, and their findings are stunning.</p>

<p>2015 was a banner year for climate news. February, June, October, November, and December were each their respective hottest months on record, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/25/record-hot-2015-gave-us-a-glimpse-at-the-future-of-global-warming">2015 shattered the record for hottest year</a>. The pope delivered a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/guardian-view-on-laudato-si-pope-francis-cultural-revolution">climate encyclical</a>. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken">Investigative journalists at Inside Climate News</a> discovered that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/25/two-faced-exxon-the-misinformation-campaign-against-its-own-scientists">Exxon knew</a> about the dangers of human-caused global warming while it funded a climate misinformation campaign, and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/05/exxonmobil-investigation-climate-change-peabody">New York attorney general launched an investigation</a> into the company’s behavior. President Obama’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/03/obamas-clean-power-plan-hailed-as-strongest-ever-climate-action-by-a-us-president">Clean Power Plan went into effect</a>, and he <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/09/by-rejecting-keystone-president-obama-cements-his-climate-legacy">rejected the Keystone XL pipeline</a>. And most importantly, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/dec/14/the-paris-agreement-signals-that-deniers-have-lost-the-climate-wars">195 countries agreed to cut carbon pollution as much as possible</a> to stem global warming.</p>

<p>Despite all these critically important stories, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/14/kids-ask-us-presidential-candidates-to-debate-science">as in the presidential debates</a>, climate change was largely absent from US broadcast news. Climate coverage <em>fell</em> in 2015. <br/></p>

<p>Most of the decline was due to ABC, which only spent 13 minutes in 2015 covering climate change – three times less than even <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/fox">Fox</a>. While Fox’s coverage increased, most of the network’s climate segments featured interviews with guests who criticized efforts to address global warming.</p>

<p>The Sunday shows (ABC’s <em>This Week</em>, CBS’ <em>Face the Nation</em>, NBC’s <em>Meet the Press</em>, and Fox Broadcasting Co.’s <em>Fox News Sunday)</em> and the network nightly news programs (ABC’s <em>World News Tonight</em>, <em>CBS Evening News</em>, and <em>NBC Nightly News)</em> each aired a combined 73 minutes of climate coverage in 2015, down a total of 8 minutes (a 5% decline) from 2014. The Public Broadcasting System (PBS) <em>NewsHour </em>program aired more segments addressing climate change (58) than the other nightly news shows combined (48).<br/></p>

<p>In particular, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://insideclimatenews.org/news/26022016/icn%E2%80%99s-exxon-series-awarded-izzy-outstanding-achievement-independent-media">award-winning Inside Climate News Exxon investigation</a> and the launch of the Clean Power Plan were largely overlooked by the news networks. <br/></p>

<p>When it came to interviewing or quoting scientists and doing segments about climate science research, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/pbs">PBS</a> <em>NewsHour</em> again rose above its peers, while ABC’s <em>World News Tonight</em> flunked science class.</p>

<p>Climate scientists were entirely absent from the Sunday news shows, with one exception. On CBS’ <em>Face the Nation</em> in December, anchor John Dickerson interviewed Dr. Marshall Shepherd, meteorologist and director of University of Georgia’s Atmospheric Sciences Program, to discuss the importance of the UN summit’s goal of limiting global warming to two degrees Celsius. This was a sharp decline from 2014, in which climate scientists were interviewed or quoted on seven Sunday news shows.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/scienceofclimatechange">Climate change</a> affects some of the most critical components of our society: food security, national defense, extreme weather, the economy, public health, the environment, and so on. The broadcast networks touched on some of these, like extreme weather, but largely missed others.<br/></p>

<p>Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) reacted to the Media Matters report:<br/></p>

<p><em>As the co-founder of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, I read Media Matters’ new study and it’s a wake up call to the news networks. The most important long term global and national issue shouldn’t be getting short-thrift. People need more information, not less. </em><br/></p>

<p>These findings may help explain why <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.mrctv.org/blog/poll-americans-not-concerned-about-climate-change">Americans aren’t concerned about climate change</a>. We rely on the media to inform the public, and on the most important issue of our time, the US broadcast news media are failing to adequately inform Americans. As Rep. Israel notes, they’re moving in the wrong direction and need to do much better.<br/></p>

Fyfe et at is not about long term global warming but instead about ENSO and IPO effects on long term weather patterns and the associated budgeting of the extra heat between the atmosphere and the oceans, all things that those who follow the science are well aware of.

I'll be sure to let you know if I want to discuss substantive issues with someone who fails to understand them and then berates me for it. Or if I want a chatter with someone who argues my points for me (though it turns out they're nothing like what I've actually said). Other than that, I'll give you a wide berth. But I'll be sure to point out to others what you're like (if there's anyone left who hasn't figured you out already). All the best.

CP, I don't think "Keep it in the ground" means "shut everything down right now." It's just another way of saying we need to get off of fossil fuels as quickly as we possibly can.

In your ideal world Robhon would such communication be banned?



Author::::chrismclaughlin
DateTime::::2016-03-11T21:22:48Z
That is so true. And I'll illustrate it here. I wrote "in your ideal world Robhon would such communication be banned." Now I think the point I'm making is that Robhon has some unusual notions of what an ideal world will look like. But as an Olympian, he will simply reply: "So you admit that you are a person who completely rejects the position of every prestigious scientific institution" even though I clearly did not state that nor do I believe it.



Author::::Bored1796
DateTime::::2016-03-11T21:11:02Z
It's simpler just to ask robhon or one of the Olympians what my point is...or else I might miss it, as Paul did on that other thread. Missing your own point is easily done when you're not on the plane...

Obviously Bassireland can not "show", "make", "admit", or "concede" any of those points. He apparently even lacks the self awareness to realize your last response to him was a word for word parody of what he had just written. I think when these folks forget to go back and read what they wrote they get confused as to what the original point was and have to make up a new one and claim you are the one who made it. As I recall it, this all started when pinkrobbo falsely claimed that Paul Cooper stated "that all the scientists (indeed just about everyone) promoting action on AGW, or even upholding it as a fact, are lying to line their own pockets." And when challenged to support that assertion pinkrobbo decided to go into full "defense/attack" mode rather than admit his mistake. It's almost as if there is some underlying fear on their side that the conceding any point, even when demonstrably false, will subject them to excommunication by their elders. They will even risk their honor and credibility just to avoid having to admit to a "denier" that they were wrong. How does one reason with such a religiously orthodox mindset?

China's Taishan reactor - (Same French designed EPR as Flamanville) is completing this year. That is on schedule for 4½ years for £4.9bn pounds (US$7.5 billion) [50.2 billion yuan] That's a cheaper and faster rollout (per MW) than any RE project ever.

I didn't mention anti-science, but surely you agree that the important issue in tackling AGW is to lower emissions as soon as possible. I KNOW that you know that emissions are cumulative. Please tell me you understand the implications of waiting a generation before lowering emissions.

So how much do you think you would you have to pay a motivated climate scientist or environmentalist to say that Germany burning lignite until at least 2050 due to dropping clean safe nuclear is a good thing for the climate?

Some nations will choose a more nuclear intensive pathway. Some nations are going to choose one that is more reliant on RE. There's nothing anti-science about that.
