Planting more trees can reduce UK's flood risk, research shows




DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:42:21+0000



<p>Natural defences, including planting more trees, could be a solution to the country’s flooding problems, according to new research.</p>

<p>In a study led by the Universities of Birmingham and Southampton, scientists found that planting trees could reduce the height of flooding in towns by up to 20%. <br/>They found strategic planting on flood plains could help towns downstream reduce the “peak height” of floods. </p>

<p>But the scientists warned that natural flood defences would need to be combined with conventional prevention techniques. The researchers studied a 100km river catchment in the New Forest, upstream of the town of Brockenhurst. </p>

<p>In a bid to better understand natural flood defences such as tree planting, river restoration and logjams - man-made dams - the researchers used a digital model of the terrain. </p>

<p>Planting trees on the flood plain and increasing the number of logjams across just 10-5% of the total river length was found to be able to reduce the peak height of a potential flood in the town by 6% once the trees had grown for 25 years. More extensive river restoration, for example in 20-25% of the total river length, resulted in a reduction in flood peak height of up to 20%. </p>

<p>Dr Simon Dixon, the study’s lead author from the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Forest Research, said: “We believe that tree planting can make a big contribution to reducing flood risk, and should be part of a wider flood risk management approach, including conventional flood defences.</p>

<p>“Tree planting would represent an extra element that helps to slow down the arrival of rain water to vulnerable locations.” </p>

<p>The research, funded by the Environment Agency, is published in the journal <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1096-9837;jsessionid=35124DF1897C30842A8F8CC956D071DE.f04t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+for+up+to+3+hours+on+Saturday+19th+March+2016+from++11%3A00-14%3A00+GMT+%2F+07%3A00-10%3A00+EDT+%2F+19%3A00-22%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience.">Earth Surface Processes and Landforms</a>. </p>

<p>Ben Lukey, flood risk manager at the Environment Agency, said natural flood defences also improved water quality but was not suitable everywhere. He said: “The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment-agency">Environment Agency</a> is already working with partners to use natural flood management measures - such as tree planting - in our flood defence work and have found that they can make an effective contribution when used alongside other, more traditional, flood defences.”</p>

"Leading the way" ? - woodland cover in Wales is less than 1/3 of the EU average - over 18,000 Hectare of productive forest have been converted into scrub and open ground - you've planted almost no new timber producing woodland in the last 6 years - who do you think you are leading?

Problems can have more than one cause but most of those upland areas, floodplains and riverbank areas have been cleared for a very long time. However removal of hedgerows and expansion of the size of fields is more recent.

The core reason why this winters floods were so terrible was due to the fact that 3 or so storms hit the same area of the country. One of these storms was perpendicular to the country and sliced right across Cumbria while leaving the midlands and Scotland dry.

The price of having a desert of a landscape is of course consequences that are difficult to manage, Its not just forests that help water retention , they have so many other attributes to help the environment, that is why they were there naturally in the first place before man came along with big ideas of making money.They are invaluable in so many ways , a carbon sink , the land filters and cleans the water, the micro flora, insects , fungi and small animals all add to the cleaning of the atmosphere and in addition adding more Oxygen to the atmosphere whist locking up the CO2, There is of course all the extra activities of woodland management and timber that is then used for buildings and further locking up CO2 for long periods. Further still , this sort of change could if done properly enhance the possibilities of more access into the countryside and increase tourism and making the whole project far more resilient for future generations.  Making a decision based on just one aspect of why trees are good is absurd, we need to start thinking in a far more holistic way and to promote long-term regeneration of the landscapes.

Well, its difficult to know what aspect of Ennerdale Monbiot thinks has anything to do with flooding. Many areas of conifer trees have been removed alongside the river along the valley bottom, to be replaced by a few chewed native tree plantings, with the view that this will be pasture for cattle. He implied that “engineering works” had been removed from the River Liza in the valley. An “Ireland” bridge was removed from Woundell Beck that drains into the Liza, and which is then canalised until it reaches the lake. He then said the Liza was “allowed to braid, meander” giving a reference to a Leeds MSc student thesis, and which actually says:“Within the present analysis it is impossible to determine whether there has been any change in the River Liza as a result of the Wild Ennerdale project initiation in 2003, although considering the small changes in land-use and the fact that the valley has only been subject to low-intensity land-use since the Bronze Age means significant changes are not anticipated”

Yes - it's a fascinating thing....our outdated 1 in 100 year event always meant 1 in 100 years in each catchment, so over the whole country, something major was likely at least once a decade. Now that means somewhere in the country, once every 2 or 3 years there will be a major inundation - just can't say exactly where!

Thanks for your reply.However, although flooding has become more of an issue in recent years it is not the case that there was no controversy earlier than this. Indeed, for example, I was involved with a flooding issue in the Scottish Highlands 25 years ago where the issue was very much of a flashy river with a large catchment that was heavily overgrazed by excessive deer number, and there have been other similar examples, (Eg Walshaw Moor) and in each case there has been very little acknowledgement by Government, and certainly no action in recognition, of the part that grouse moor and deer stalking estates play in exacerbating flooding. Indeed, trying to get governmental recognition of the part that upland land management plays in flooding has been a fruitless battle for decades. So, the fact that your study was commissioned several years ago I find irrelevant.It remains the case that such land uses - sporting estates and hill farms - have not been adequately scrutinised by studies with respect to their flooding impact, and I am not aware of any acknowledgement from Government that the recent flooding in Cumbria and Scotland was contributed to by those land uses.

Trees are the most important component in maintaining the balance of any ecosystem. The last five decades have seen the disappearance of vast tracks of the native tree cover along the coasts of several countries and along the river banks. The deep palmyra tree lines along the coasts of tropical countries were acting as a buffer against the seasonal cyclones / typhoons. They prevented soil, especially topsoil, erosion so critical to preservation of soil fertility. The indiscriminate felling of trees to yield space to urban expansion and urbanisation of rural spaces have adversely affected the nature's precious gifts to all forms of life. To raise tree lines along the coasts and steps to the regrowth of topsoil formations may take years but there is no gain saying the effort should start here and now with the participation of everyone.

Unfortunately not so. Alders in the Scottish Highlands (and perhaps elsewhere) have in places been dying of a disease that no-one seems to know the name of for decades - though admittedly they are also still thriving in many places.There is a huge dearth of plant pathologists in Britain.

We don't burn moorland for grouse shooting, much of the time moorland is burnt to reduce fire hazards. Having been almost trapped by an upland self-starting fire I tend to think a little differently about Moorland burning now. During spring early summer and sometimes into early autumn depending on the circumstances a lot of the plant life can turn exceedingly dry and it's like kindling. With the right level of sunlight and natural heat traps it doesn't take much to spark a fire and a whole hill can go up in flames. (6/10 started by vandals though...).

Sadly not true. Nice theory though!The research was commissioned in c.2007 as part of funding for a PhD studentship at University of Southampton which I was fortunate to get, starting in 2008. The modelling was done up to ~2011. So it actually pre-dates a lot of the controversy and the rewilding debate which really ramped up around 2011-2012.The work is looking at flash floods, and in that respect the study catchment being underlain by Barton Clay geology means it is ideal, the catchment is actually highly flashy and highly susceptible to flash flooding. I think where your misunderstanding comes from is that we were using all the data collected over decades on the catchment in order to build our computer model, and then using that computer model in an exploratory way. What that means is that we weren't looking at whether a given road or house would be flooded given certain changes. We were actually taking a reference point on the river for peak height and then running thousands of land use scenarios to see what the differences in peak height were between them. That enables us to say given X landuse pattern flooding height is increased/decreased relative to our baseline.In that respect because we are looking at relative effects in flash floods the findings are highly transferable to other similar sized catchments.Our findings and recommendations are actually counter to current policy so I'm not sure where you got the idea that this is white wash!

I think there needs to be a debate, both locally and nationally.We can only do one thing with the landscape, either grow food, manage for floodrisk, or manage in such a way the land delivers other (perhaps cultural) benefits. I'm thinking the iconic Lake District fells, yes they aren't everyone's cup of tea, but they are a famous landscape and we may decide we'd rather live with flooding there and maintain it as it is, rather than afforest areas of it.I don't think there is fundamentally a right or wrong decision here, but the decision(s) have to be informed by evidence. Hopefully that's where we can make a difference, with the study showing that these sorts of measures, if done over large areas, can be part of flood mitigation. Now it would be up to local/national policy makers to consider this and decide if afforesting is desirable in some locations.I think the evidence is clear. However it doesn't necessarily mean that directly translates into a policy.Dr S Dixon

It's an interesting idea, but ultimately beavers are effectively a "vector" for getting wood into the stream. The study shows that where there are logjams in the river, but not forested floodplains, then the logjams push water onto the floodplain, but it still moves quickly downstream.If we had beavers then they would create more, larger logjams and this would have an effect. However we have to have the forests on the floodplain in the first place in order for the beaver to make logjams, and to make logjams which can have a predictable effect on flooding.In short, bringing back beaver is a good idea (and a fun one!) but it would need to be done alongside afforestation in order to have an appreciable effect. (But where there are already forests, but heavily managed/cleared channels, we could potentially see a rapid improvement in flood mitigation)
