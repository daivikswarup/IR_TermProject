Joint low-carbon declaration sees climate baton pass from Obama to Trudeau




DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:00:29+0000



<p>A joint US-Canadian declaration to help spur the transition to a low carbon economy passed the baton of global climate action from Barack Obama to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> on Thursday – and brightened prospects for the Paris agreement.<br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/us-canada-promise-lead-world-low-carbon-economy-obama-trudeau">The initiative</a>, which roams from Arctic protection to plugging methane emissions from oil wells and pipelines to decarbonisation of the US and Canadian economies in the second half of this century, cements a new climate change partnership between neighbours after 15 years of pulling in opposite directions.<br/></p>

<p>It signals once again that Obama intends to keep pushing hard on climate change in what was supposed to be the lame duck phase of his presidency.</p>

<p>And it improves the prospects of rallying countries to ratify <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era">the Paris climate agreement</a> when it opens for signing on 22 April. The agreement needs to be signed by 55 countries responsible for 55% of global emissions to come into force.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/10/justin-trudeau-barack-obama-us-visit-white-house-north-america">‘A friend to count on’: Trudeau may be Obama's successor on the global stage</a> </p>

<p>“The United States and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> are fully united in combatting climate change,” Obama told a press conference at the White House on Thursday. “We are focusing on making sure the Paris agreement is fully implemented.”<br/></p>

<p>Trudeau agreed, describing the Paris agreement as an action plan, and the US and Canadian leaders as key players in ensuring its success.</p>

<p>“That agreement is both a symbolic declaration of global cooperation on climate change as well a practical guide for growing our economies in a responsible and sustainable way,” he told the press conference. “We know that our international partners expect and, indeed, need leadership from us on this issue.”</p>

<p>The US and Canada were committed to signing the Paris agreement as soon as possible, Trudeau went on, a move which could help the United Nations reach its goal of ratifying the agreement in 2016, before Obama leaves the White House.</p>

<p>Thursday’s declaration marks the first time in 15 years that US and Canadian leaders have been in sync on climate change.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>George Bush pulled the US out of the Kyoto climate accords when he came to the White House in 2001. Stephen Harper, the Canadian prime minister, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/13/canada-withdrawal-kyoto-protocol">also withdrew from the agreement</a> and pushed aggressively the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would have ramped up production from the carbon-heavy Alberta tar sands.</p>

<p>The two leaders began their relationship with some friction, with Obama <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/06/obama-rejects-keystone-xl-pipeline">cancelling the Keystone XL project </a> last November, days after Trudeau took office. The Canadian leader did not protest, however.</p>

<p>But with the declaration of a shared vision on climate change, Trudeau is now cast as Obama’s heir – in terms of pressing for global actions.</p>

<p> Once Obama leaves the White House, it will fall to Trudeau to maintain continuity of a North American climate plan should a Democrat takes the White House, or to help to keep the flame alive in the event a Republican wins the election and follows through on threats to overturn Obama’s policies. </p>

<p>The concern for Obama’s long-term climate legacy was inherent in Thursday’s declaration, with the US and Canada pledging to deliver plans for decarbonising the post-2050 economy by the end of 2016. </p>

<p>The neighbours also pledged to lobby other G20 countries to produce their long-term climate plans – a move which could boost international confidence that the Paris agreement is indeed putting the global economy on a low-carbon trajectory.</p>

<p>That could help box in Obama’s successor – from either party – making it difficult to overturn the Paris agreement without the risk of antagonising an important ally and neighbour.</p>

<p>The joint commitment to reduce methane emissions by up to 45% from 2012 by 2025 will have the most immediate impact in helping the US and Canada to hit the emissions reductions targets they offered at Paris.<br/></p>

<p>Emissions from methane – a far more powerful climate pollutant than carbon dioxide – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/17/us-likely-culprit-of-global-spike-in-methane-emissions-over-last-decade">rose rapidly with the boom in fracking</a>.<br/></p>

<p>Campaigners had been pressing Obama to cut methane from existing oil and gas wells – not just future projects, warning the US had no chance of hitting its Paris targets without such measures.<br/></p>

<p>Gina McCarthy, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, agreed, telling a White House conference call with reporters: “We are going to have to tackle emissions from existing sources.”<br/></p>

<p>The campaign group Earthworks, which has used infrared imaging to map methane leaks, said the new methane initiative was a significant step-up in Obama’s efforts to cap emissions from oil and gas wells. “With today’s announcement, President Obama starts to get serious,” the organisation said in a statement.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>But it was on the global arena, where Obama played a critical role in nudging countries towards the Paris agreement, where the renewed US-Canadian partnership on climate change could have the most impact.<br/></p>

<p>“On the big looming issues on the horizon, it is vital for us to work together because the more aligned we are, the more we can shape the international agenda to meet these challenges,” Obama said. “Climate change is such an example.”<br/></p>

<p>He suggested that having Trudeau on side with the two leaders’ shared liberal values would help drive solutions to help poor countries deal with climate change. </p>

<p>“If we don’t agree, if we’re not aggressive, if we’re not far-sighted, if we don’t pool our resources around the research and development and clean energy agenda that’s required to solve this problem, then other countries won’t step up and it won’t get solved,” Obama said. “That’s a really important effort.” </p>

<p>The two leaders also pledged to secure a deal cutting emissions from commercial air planes through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is based in Montreal. </p>

<p>They committed to raise fuel economy standards for delivery trucks and buses, and to work to get more solar and wind power on the US and Canadian electrical grids.</p>

<p>On the Arctic, the two leaders pledged to take “science-based standards” into account for any future oil and gas drilling. </p>

<p>Noting the rapid disappearance of the sea ice cover, the US and Canada also committed to reduce the use of heavy fuel oil, set up low-impact shipping lanes, and work for sustainable commercial fishing. <br/></p>

<p>Obama and Trudeau will have another chance to work on Arctic protections at a White House summit in the autumn and, as officials made clear in a conference call, he has no intention of reining back on climate activism any time soon. </p>

<p>The president will seek out climate partnerships with other countries in the remaining months, John Morton, an adviser, told reporters. “I can tell you we are working actively on ensuring that in final year of the administration we see continued progress bilaterally and multilaterally,” he told a conference call.</p>

Wouldn't this be a good time to bring up how Nancy Reagan became the U.S.'s "accidental president" because Ron Reagan had Alzheimer's during a big chunk of his administration? I guess they didn't want to let the world -- and the Democrats -- know that the president was not fit to work. Let's clear this bugaboo up one way or another, people. Just ask Glenn Greenwald what he knows about it. Hold him upside down by his ankles and let the truth tumble from his pockets.

Isn't it interesting how a few power hungry politicians try to convince us that man can play God and control the climate? God must be thinking how stupid we are. The climate has been changing in cycles for thousands of years on its own. By the way, Al Gore's moronic prophesy, that the world would be flooded this year, never happened. It is interesting that global warming seems to be an obsession almost exclusively of the Left". Liberals live in perpetual, utopian dream world where everything is in perpetual crisis.

You'll be happy to hear that I was one of the tens of millions who marched in an effort to prevent the invasion of Iraq. Now, Clinton's Republican plan doesn't help the poor get solar panels; quite the opposed. As the whiny, piteous billionaires of the GOP like to remind us, 47% of Americans pay no federal income tax. So how exactly is tax subsidies supposed to help them? Answer: it doesn't. It's just a classic Republican way of screwing the poor while pretending to be addressing a social problem. Clinton might as well run as a GOP candidate.

In my area we have suffered through pine beetle infestations and spruce budworm that are killing off vast acres of trees faster than they can reproduce.Add to that the intensity of the forest fires, and the more extreme weather in winter and summer, and yes we can see a huge change in our climate.

No we don't. There are some things that the market controls quite well and food production is a prime example. When Beef is plentiful then it is cheap, if it costs more to produce beef then it earns the producer then the production goes down, we eat the beef and the price goes up. we sop eating so much and the price drops a bit till a balance is reached. If grain crops fail beef could be cheaper to get rid of it or if the producers are paying attention the supply will be close to the demand for grain and the price will rise with the price of grain. This is capitalism at its very best and is a terrific way to run an economy.However there are always those who want a free ride. Enter the futures market and find capitalism at its worst with manipulation and fraud. A fair but strict system of regulation is necessary to remove the parasites and leeches. Socialism does not enter into it. That is for organizational efforts like a happy and productive, well educated workforce.

Clinton's plan manages to be grandiose and inadequate, all at once. Half a BILLION solar panels in four years, but the government will underwrite it with tax subsidies--which means that for 70% of Americans, the government will be of no meaningful help.

Considering that Obama has never spent anytime working with the House or the Senate but actively ignoring and working around them through executive orders (which will be cancelled if a GOP is elected), the only way he can get any of his agenda through in the next 8 months will be through executive orders.

really - explain what Harper vandalized? I recall that he streamlined approval processes so that the same project didn't require 8 or 9 approvals using the same information but under different jurisdictions. Something that the current Liberals will abandon so that no new infrastructure projects will be approved but lots of lawyers will be paid using taxpayer monies - that sounds productive.
