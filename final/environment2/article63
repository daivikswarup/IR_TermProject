Obama administration pays out $500m to climate change project




DateTime::::2016-03-08T03:15:18+0000



<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/obama-administration">Obama administration</a> has made a first installment on its $3bn pledge to help poor countries fight climate change – defying Republican opposition to the president’s environmental plan.</p>

<p>The $500m payment to the Green Climate Fund was seen as critical to shoring up international confidence in Barack Obama’s ability to deliver on the pledges made at the United Nations’ climate change conference in Paris in late 2015.</p>

<p>Obama is expected to announce a number of joint climate initiatives when the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, visits Washington this week, sources familiar with the plans said.</p>

<p>The White House is also working with United Nations officials to encourage countries to formally approve the Paris climate agreement ahead of a signing ceremony on 22 April. </p>

<p>At least 55 countries, representing at least 55% of global climate emissions, must ratify the agreement before it takes effect. </p>

<p>Administration officials said the initial $500m payment to the Green Climate Fund demonstrated that Obama would follow through on the promises of last December’s Paris climate agreement – despite February’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/10/us-clean-power-plan-setback-will-not-affect-paris-climate-change-deal">setback at the supreme court</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/climate-change-paris-deal-cop21-obama-administration-congress-republicans-environment">threats by Republican presidential candidates</a> to dismantle Obama’s agenda.</p>

<p> “Today, the United States provided a $500m grant to the Green Climate Fund,” a State Department official said. “This grant is the first step toward meeting the president’s commitment of $3bn to the GCF, and shows that the United States stands squarely behind our international climate commitments.”<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Administration officials described the payment as an important signal to the international community that Obama was pressing ahead on his climate agenda in his remaining months in the White House.</p>

<p>Obama has faced a number of recent setbacks to his climate agenda.</p>

<p>The supreme court last month agreed to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/climate-change-supreme-court-barack-obama-plan">block the centerpiece of Obama’s climate plan</a> – new rules cutting emissions from power plants – until lower courts rule on legal challenges from 29 states and dozens of industry groups. The ruling created immediate uncertainty about the fate of the power plant rules and the Paris agreement.</p>

<p>Obama’s climate plan is also under political attack from Republican presidential contenders who say they will scrap the rules and dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency if they take the White House next November. </p>

<p>Republicans in Congress have also threatened to scrap the power plant rules and block any US contributions to the Green Climate Fund, which was set up in 2009 to help poor and vulnerable countries adopt cleaner energy technologies and protect their peoples from rising seas, droughts and other impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>At one point Republicans insisted that the Paris agreement be submitted to the Senate for approval before any funds were released – before quietly relenting during budget negotiations last December.</p>

I wonder if we can have a serious discussion about Climate Change. I want to raise couple of points that are in my opinion absolutely essential to first understand this issue and then provide solutions:1. Although current scientific community, together with many celebrities and politicians , convincing us that Climate Change is “man made” phenomena there are clearly indications that this may not be the case. The fact that climate change is a “natural” process that occurred on our planet thousands of times in the past, in fact as recently as 10,000 years ago (ice age melting that usher our civilization) without any human intervention, indicates that there are other “natural” process that can trigger these monumental changes (sun activity, cloud composition, winds, ocean currents, flora and fauna growth/decline, ect ) 2. The current level of our technological civilization require a certain level of energy to sustain it, in fact this need for energy is growing exponentially. When you add the population growth we can clearly agree that this will be a continues trend. With that in mind you have to evaluate current EROI measure for all sources of energy that our civilization is using and what you going to find out that ONLY fossil fuels can sustained us on the current level. 3. And here is the kicker, based on number of research/papers is extremely clear the transition period from fossil fuels to renewables will be the most challenging, in fact all the research is showing that to maintain our civilization on the current sustainable level we need to INCREAS usage of fossil fuels for some foreseeable future (complementing it with the growth, usage and development, of renewables) until renewable energy sources can efficiently sustained 10 billion people on the current technological level, this transition is more in the range of 30-50 years. This is simple math/science that can’t be overrun by best wishes, climate change “commitments” and “pledges” from industrial nations to cut emission levels. Obviously this creates a serious issue since according to climatologist we are already leaving on the borrow time and need to cut carbon emissions….NOW…and DRASTICALY

This is every good article on the suggested topic….unfortunately it clearly indicates that in the transition period we need to intensify our usage of EROI efficient energy sources (fossil fuels)…hence the question of raising energy output and lowering carbon emissions is not …answered

Where did the money come from?Is this new money or redirected from other foreign aid budgets.Even you should know that the goals/targets of the Obama coalplant EPA proposals will be achieved if anything of that plansurvives or not. Implementation of that is to begin in 2022 and befinally implemented in 2030.Every year the coal in your electricity mix drops and the share of gasincreases.You should look at the effectiveness of actions that have been takenrather than announcements of things that might happen.Perhaps your interest in this is more political than environmental.

'Steps' is an interesting concept.You first have to distinguish between that which is announced,hoped for, wished for with that which actually materialises.Then you have to judge the impact of anything that actually happens,is implemented, and compare it with previous announcements.The message is always of greater importance than the results.
