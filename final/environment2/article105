New Leadbeater possum colonies don't impact on 'endangered' status: advocates

<p>Reports that more than 200 new colonies of Leadbeater’s possum have been recorded in Victoria have been played down by conservationists, who say the sightings “don’t change anything on the ground” for the critically endangered species.</p>

<p>The wild population of the tiny possum has contracted to an estimated 1,500 individuals, driven by the loss of its habitat of old growth mountain ash forests in Victoria’s central highlands by bushfire and logging.</p>

<p>The new colonies have been identified in a push by the Victorian government to locate and protect known possum sites, after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/15/leadbeaters-possum-habitat-will-remain-under-threat-conservationists">recommendations from the Leadbeater’s Possum Advisory Group in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The species, which is also the state’s faunal emblem, was listed as critically endangered last year, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/23/leadbeaters-possum-victorias-state-emblem-one-step-away-from-extinction">experts saying the animal’s population had declined 80% since the 1980s and was expected to decline a further 80% by 2031</a>.</p>

<p>But Steve Meacher, the president of the advocacy group Friends of the Leadbeater’s Possum, said the sightings were often of colonies that were already known to conservationists, and questioned whether they represented whole colonies, or just individual possums foraging for food. The possums live in family groups centred around a breeding pair and forage over a territory of about three hectares.</p>

<p>“What’s happening is these individual animals are being seen away from the nest,” Meacher said. “We don’t know how far they are from the nest when the are being recorded, so we don’t know whether these surveys represent actual colonies or individual animals.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to draw conclusions about all settled populations from these individual sightings.”</p>

<p>Meacher said a number of the colonies now recorded had been known about by some possum enthusiasts for years and deliberately not recorded, out of concern that identifying a population could cause some harm to come to it.</p>

<p>“Because there was no protection to be had by reporting a colony and there was concern that there could be negative effects of doing so, so people didn’t do it, there was no reason to do it,” he said.</p>

<p>He attributed some of the increase in reporting to the introduction of a special protection zone, which prohibits logging within 200 metres of a known possum colony.</p>

<p>While the survey results showed the government’s Leadbeater possum program was on track, Meacher said it did not mean anything significant for the species.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t really change anything on the ground,” he said. “The animal is still critically endangered, it’s still has a very limited range in the central highlands of Victoria and it still needs a lot of work to ensure its protection from permanent extinction.”</p>

<p>The environment minister, Lisa Neville, said the colonies had been identified using new survey techniques that relied on the use of tree-top cameras to spot the fast-moving, nocturnal animals. </p>

<p>Most of the work has been done by scientists from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) and other agencies but Neville said 24 colonies had been identified by members of the community.</p>

<p>“Our scientists and the community are delivering critical information and DELWP is making sure the location of each colony is accurately mapped while the recommended protection measures are put in place,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’d urge the community to keep submitting records of Leadbeater’s possum sightings to contribute to our knowledge of our iconic faunal emblem and help us improve the conservation of the iconic Leadbeater’s for generations to come.”</p>

<p>DELWP principal scientist, Dr Lindy Lumsden, said concerns the survey could have overstated the number of colonies was misplaced because all recorded sightings were “a reasonable distance apart”.</p>

<p>Lumsden told Guardian Australia that the small territories of each colony meant that individuals rarely ventured more than 100 metres from its nest. So if a possum was sighted on its own more than 400 metres from the nearest recorded colony, it was taken to be belonging to a different colony.</p>

<p>“These are all new locations, but a lot of them are in general areas that we knew the species to be in before,” she said.</p>

It is worth remembering that Leadbeater's possums require old growth mountain ash forest for nesting, not just any age of forest. And mountain ash takes over 100 years to reach this age class. So LBPs are still feeling the effects of habitat loss/alteration from the beginning of the twentieth century.

Practically every Australian native species (mammal, bird, plant, invertebrate) has declined since the 80s, Australia is going backwards as regards nature conservation.

Not sure how you reached the conclusion that the Leadbeater's possum is no longer critically endangered. Care to clarify?

Would 201 colonies have done the trick?

Thanks for your interest in our indigenous wildlife.

Unrestrained logging, an increase in wildfire frequency, an increase in road construction around known habitat have all contributed to the population decline since the 1980s. There have also been a number of major organizational changes which have had the effect of diluting, if not deleting, relevant scientific expertise within government departments nominally responsible for the environmental health of the Central Highlands forests.

Obviously the "advocacy group" aren't going to let a bit of good science get in the way of their prejudices and threaten their very own reason to exist.

So what happened between the eighties and now to see such a marked decline?
