World wildlife day: Animals are being slaughtered one by one, not saved two by two

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>nimals, according to many traditions, were once protected from a global flood by entering the shelter of an ark. <br/> <br/>Today, many of those same animal species face a new catastrophic flood, but this time the deadly downpour is caused by humans. Animals around the world confront a rain of bullets, poisonings, traps, and snares. <br/> <br/>Some of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/african-elephants-killed-faster-than-they-are-being-born">the most emblematic animals on this planet</a> – tigers, elephants, rhinos – are closer to extinction than salvation. <br/> <br/>But if beauty is fast disappearing from the world, what of the beasts? Posters of the scaly anteater, aka the pangolin, hang on few bedroom walls, but it is possibly the most hunted creature on earth.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/african-elephants-killed-faster-than-they-are-being-born">African elephants 'killed faster than they are being born'</a> </p>

<p> <br/>In May 2015, police in Kohima, India, seized nearly 10 tons of pangolin scales – just one of many such seizures. Up to 100,000 pangolin are killed every year for their scales, which fetch as much as $3,000 a kilo in Asian markets where they are believed to possess magical powers. <br/> <br/>And there are others. <br/> <br/>Pythons, antelopes, turtles, and numerous bird species provide a roll call of animals not happily going two by two to their safety, but towards oblivion, one by one. <br/> <br/>We have to act quickly to protect and conserve biodiversity on this planet. <br/> <br/>That means chasing down the criminals and ending the unconscionable trafficking of these vulnerable species; but it also means demand reduction and offering alternative livelihoods to local communities involved in the trade. <br/> <br/>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime argues that countries need to swap fines and non-custodial sentences for serious prison terms. Terms of four years or more can spark the use of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime – if adopted by countries. <br/> <br/>This effectively creates a global network of countries prepared to share information, undertake joint operations and offer invaluable legal assistance. <br/> <br/>Countries and inter-governmental organisations appear to be listening. Last week <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/25/poachers-and-wildlife-traffickers-to-face-prison-sentences-across-europe">the European commission launched an action plan</a> that called for member states to introduce prison terms of more than four years. The plan also recommends that the European Union encourage countries to act through negotiated trade policies, something which the US had previously pioneered. <br/> <br/>But this does not curb the heavy demand that fuels the trafficking. <br/> <br/>Changing ingrained views, and embedded perceptions, are an essential part of tackling the demand side, but young people must be our target audience. Fragile animal species will only be saved if young people and future generations reject mysticism and embrace science. <br/> <br/>All of these actions can and must be done. <br/> <br/>We cannot, however, forget the communities and societies who have lived side by side with animal populations for tens of thousands of years. The world adopted, in September last year, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/live/2015/sep/25/un-sustainable-development-summit-2015-goals-sdgs-united-nations-general-assembly-70th-session-new-york-live">the 2030 sustainable development agenda</a>, which seeks to provide security and prosperity for all. <br/> <br/>If we are to sustain animal species and promote sustainable development for exposed communities, alternative livelihoods must be offered as a means to achieve both goals. Such a change can empower communities to live in harmony with their surroundings and ensure their sustained development. <br/> <br/>Work with farmers cultivating coca plants in Latin America already shows that promoting suitable and profitable alternatives is a reality that can and does work. It must become a central element of our anti-wildlife crime activities. <br/> <br/>Cooperation is a powerful ally. UN agencies, Cites and its partners are all working together to ensure there is action on the ground where it matters. <br/> <br/>Today is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.un.org/en/events/wildlifeday/">world wildlife day</a> and yet another year has passed and the species pool has been further drained. It is not an inexhaustible supply. <br/> <br/>We have to act now, or we may have to build another ark to protect this planet’s wonderful diversity not from a flood, but from ourselves. </p>

"Flying as a pair?"Only yesterday afternoon, my dog put up a pair out of one field. After crossing into the next field he managed to put up a covey of nine birds.

"By the way is it possible that a small herd of deer could travel, probably unobserved for 50-100 miles across country SW England, or would they be sticking to a very local area?"The fact deer travel is one of the reasons why the population is increasing and spreading nationwide, and it's not limited just to "the ones with the huge horns" otherwise known as antlers.

It is certainly not well "watched" round here unless he is allowed to kill/cull as well.One particular deer path has regular evidence of kills and removal of the "good" parts of the corpse, including the mother of very young twins one year.

I couldn't agree more. Education is key. I am planning my trip to Africa in the fall. I'm hoping to volunteer at an ethical wildlife sanctuary, one that doesn't exploit the animals by allowing cub petting, human interaction and photo opps. I'm going to be talking to people every day about the purpose of my trip. Here in the U.S. the attitude toward our native predators like mountain lions and wolves is shameful. We need to protect these animals before it is too late. It may already be. Ignorant fools who shoot them are either acting out of fear, selfishness, ego or ignorance. So sad.

Good point. Alongside African lakes where the crowds of barn swallows gathered for winter, people used to harvest them for food, greatly decimating flocks. Once they were persuaded instead to create a haven and set up beautiful holiday accommodation, the tourists brought prosperity along with the bird watching.

At the Agriculture and the Environment conference held in Edinburgh earlier this week, it was interesting to see the RSPB acknowledge the benefits of management by gamekeepers with evidence showing that Curlew do better as density of gamekeepers increases.In addition, the RSPB's programme of active fox and crow control has proved beneficial to curlews.

Mostly likely birds that have been reared by a gamekeeper on a nearby estate, one of the many involved in getting grey partridge back into the countryside.This is occurring nationwide, with voluntary bans on shooting where numbers are low.

There are are 'Poacher Watch' schemes within Forestry Commission and private forestry areas to deter the illegal taking of deer.The schemes are manned by stalkers, both independent or in the employ of the Forestry Commission.

One way to stop wildlife exploitation by poor communities who poach for bushmeat or traditional medicine is to create an environment in which the animals are worth more alive than dead. This has worked in some areas of Africa, where the poachers of yesterday now act as gamekeepers and guides to Western tourists. This makes the community much more money and they are highly incentivised to maintain a thriving ecosystem with high biodiversity. However, how we can halt the extinctions of our own flora and fauna in the industial world is quite another matter. We are rapidly losing biodiversity and destroying habitats. And since there is little money to be made with wildlife here in the West, it counts for nothing. It will be destroyed in the name of profit.

I think you should leave the subject to those who know a little more about deer than you apparently do!There are six species of wild deer within the UK, not four! Secondly, how do you propose tagging all wild deer?Those involved with deer management are well aware of numbers, and culling programmes are selective for the benefit of the species.

It is good to see the awareness of this matter and that action is being taken against these crimes.

The "stock"numbers of the four species of wild deer in the UK seems to be unknown. It may be unknowable If deer stalkers were trained in tagging rather than killing we would have a better idea of numbers. They do little if any harm to farm crops, although stalkers will persuade you otherwise. Deer hunters are not farmers.

And yet Facebook communities promoting deer stalking and killing with dogs are all the rave in the UK, mainly poachers on Forestry Commission land. Deer are not vermin, as many farmers will say they are , to discourage poaching.

I've made conscious decisions to alter my lifestyle and attempt to have less impact on the environment. But I must admit that I fear that it will be in vain. I hope not and it won't stop what I'm doing. But I have to agree with the sentiment of Mark's post.

We notice the writer of the article carefully doesn't point the finger at anyone in particular, maintaining conspicuous silence over some things you and I might consider wildlife crime. It happens all day, every day, across land and ocean.

really depressing. countries like costa rica show there is an alternative but the neoliberal agenda is really powerful. just look at the pictures of Donald trump's children next to "trophies" they've killed. nauseating.

There is hope and that is in the form of over 3 million NGOs and counting, working to try and stop the rate of extinction and biodiversity loss, which we all know is a planetary boundary. The sad thing is that there is money to be made in extinction and this is an extremely dangerous situation to be in. we are all in this together and hence the choices that we make today will affect us tomorrow. if you have some time, check out the TEDx of Captain Paul Watson from Sea Shepherd. He hits the nail right on the head...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwgx9DaiE2g

The situation for wildlife conservation in this country (UK) is the worst for a generation. This is the first government that is actually anti-environment as a core ideology. The situation in Europe is little better, with most governments beholden to extractive agro-industry and blood sports. Birds that were common farmland species forty years ago are down by 90%. There is talk from the RSPB of turtle doves effectively becoming extinct.

I admire your optimism and really hope it is vindicated in the face of growing multi nationalismand vested interest in exploiting the habitats of many species. I would really like to believe that the world could improve for my grandaughter's sake and for all the generations to come after her. Sadly, the track record so far gives me little hope for our small planet.

Here in Brazil its as if wildlife did not exist. It`s not just the government`s pro agri business stance it`s the education of the people who have no idea, or care even less. I hate to be a pessimist but reality has to be faced.Extinction is alive and kicking.

The rapid loss of species is said to be currently running at anywhere between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate. Dear beautiful Wildlife, excuse us while we hang our heads in shame.

Let's put wildlife first in the UK, instead of the interests of shooting estates, property developers, fracking companies et al........then we will have the moral fibre to comment on the inept, corrupt and ignorant devils who destroy the bio-diversity of our earth, elsewhere.

In a world where we are obsessed with the cult of celebrity and cannot protect our fellow human beings, what chance do animals have of becoming the concern of the average person?Sadly as a species we are too greedy and far too self possessed to have regard for bio diversity.
