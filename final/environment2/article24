Hotter planet spells harder rains to come – study




DateTime::::2016-03-08T12:00:53+0000



<p>Severe rainfall has increased throughout the world’s wettest and driest regions and is set to intensify this century, new research suggests. </p>

<p>Since 1950, daily extremes have risen 1-2% a decade, a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nclimate2941">study published</a> in journal Nature said on Monday.</p>

<p>That trend is expected to last until at least 2100, prompting emergency planners to take precautions against flash flooding. Dry regions such as Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula or Australia, whose parched soil poorly absorbs excess water, would be most vulnerable.</p>

<p>Global warming increases the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, leading to heavier downpours.</p>

<p>The study led by Markus Donat at the University of New South Wales in Australia couldn’t say exactly where extreme rainfall would occur, but underlined the heightened risks. Tropical regions were most uncertain.</p>

<p>Floods made up almost half of all weather-related disasters in the last two decades, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.unisdr.org/2015/docs/climatechange/COP21_WeatherDisastersReport_2015_FINAL.pdf">according</a> to the UN office for disaster risk reduction. They affected 2.3 billion people, 95% of whom were in Asia.</p>

Mountainsides and flood plains exist in the subtropics and temperate zones but in these regions there is progressively more of the in- between rolling country. The coastal plain around Townsville is largely flat even far away from any current river system - flat and seasonally swampy with small Melaleucas and the Coptotermes have to build mounds to keep out of the water in the wet season. In my yard amongst the rolling foothills of the Taylor Range in Brisbane, the Coptotermes don't need to build mounds but remain underground until they construct galleries to eat my fence or house.

I don't agree they failed completely, but I agree they left out or obscured an important finding. The paper is evidence that they did 'investigate', as they claimed in stated in opening

My error, the first para states one thing they show, the averaged findings. The next 'show' is not their work, and is a statement that should have been footnoted.

My claim is that they failed what they proposed to do, and ended up putting on the abstract an irrelevant "finding", leaving out what they actually found. This is why the task was important



Author::::Zsioux
DateTime::::2016-03-09T22:41:34Z
The abstract is the abstract. It's not a paragraph.



Author::::NewmanOldjoke
DateTime::::2016-03-09T22:33:36Z
You are wrong about the first para. it is a combination of setting up and findings. They explicitly state two things they 'show'.



Author::::RicardoK
DateTime::::2016-03-09T21:44:57Z
Plenty of evidence for this already. Modelling suggests storms are getting "front-loaded" so they dump more rain at the very beginning of a downpour. That's why we're breaking rainfall intensity records. My back yard managed 50mm in 30min recently. That's heavier rain than most cyclones.



Author::::Henforthe
DateTime::::2016-03-09T21:08:55Z
This is exactly what we see when we look at the 'hyperthermals' in the geologic past. Spikes in greenhouse gases, probably originating in rare extreme volcanic events, tie in not only with a temperature hike and sea level rise, but also indicators in the sedimentary record that hint both at higher aridity and higher precipitation- sometimes in the same locations. So we should expect to see a more extreme, 'monsoon-style' precipitation regime across more of the world.

You claim that dry catchment flash flooding of the type described by Bluecloud has nothing to do with a paper about global warming increasing the number of extreme rainfall days and increasing the risk of flooding. Dry catchment flooding due to an extreme rainfall event is as much a part of flooding as other types of flooding - wet catchment, riverine or storm surge backup.



Author::::Annette Schneider
DateTime::::2016-03-09T13:01:16Z
You are so right, but we still have to trust the capacity of the Earth to recover if we just stop the damage.

Which is why a sea-water flooded Lake Eyre would provide some relief from that heat and dryness.

Dams. For poor soil that can't absorb water, the best solution is to regulate the way the water moves across the landscape, and also slow it down (following Peter Allen's principle) in order to encourage absorption, by using systems of slow leaking dams.

Just stop coal, tar sands, unconventional gas and all new oil projects. Disaster risk reduction is a bandaid solution - why not go for the jugular? http://breakfree2016.org/

You say an observed increase in extreme daily precipitation doesn't mean an increased risk of flash flooding. If that doesn't mean an increased risk of flash flooding what does? A fine fine sunny day? Soft gentle rain as occurs in the temperate regions and soaks slowly into the soil with little to no runoff?

In the north of England this year it could be called flood of the week.
