Call for pollution tax on sales of new diesel cars in Britain




DateTime::::2016-03-11T07:00:27+0000



<p>An £800 pollution tax should be put on sales of new diesel cars, with the proceeds used for a scrappage scheme for older diesels, according to the thinktank <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/">Policy Exchange</a>.</p>

<p>The move, proposed ahead of George Osborne’s budget on 16 March, would encourage motorists to move towards lower emission vehicles and significantly reduce air pollution, according to the thinktank, which is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/30/george-osborne-thinktank-boss-new-voters">close to Osborne</a>. The idea is also backed by the mayor of London, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/20/mps-call-for-diesel-cars-scrappage-scheme-to-tackle-air-pollution">Boris Johnson, and an influential committee of MPs</a>.</p>

<p>Air pollution is illegally high in many UK cities and causes <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/30/emissions-scandal-how-the-drive-for-diesel-ran-out-of-gas">tens of thousands of premature deaths a year</a>. Regulations have failed to control nitrogen dioxide levels, which mostly comes from diesel vehicles and was highlighted by the VW emissions cheating scandal.</p>

<p>“London and many of the UK’s other major cities are facing an air pollution crisis, with residents exposed to illegal and unhealthy levels of NO2 pollution,” said Richard Howard, head of environment and energy at Policy Exchange. “If we are to clean up air pollution, then government needs to recognise that diesel is the primary cause of the problem, and to promote a shift to alternatives.”</p>

<p>Howard said: “I know the government is thinking hard about this.” He said increased vehicle excise duty [VED, or ‘road tax’] on new cars was preferable to increasing the tax on diesel fuel or banning diesels from city centres: “It needs to be done in a way which does not unduly penalise existing diesel drivers, who bought their vehicle in good faith, and gives motorists sufficient time to respond.”</p>

<p>In 2015, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-osborne-unveils-green-car-tax-overhaul-to-fund-roadbuilding">Osborne announced changes to VED</a> which removed exemptions for low-emission cars. From 2017, all cars except electric vehicles will pay £140 a year. But new cars will be charged a one-off tax in their first year. Those producing the most carbon dioxide, which drives climate change, will be charged £2,000 while average emitters will pay £160.</p>

<p>Policy Exchange argues that an additional £800 should be charged for diesel cars. “The current plans for 2017 fails to reflect that diesel is more polluting in other ways [than CO2],” said Howard. The £800 is the estimated cost of the damage caused by the extra pollution, calculated using government valuation methods.</p>

<p>Howard estimates the extra tax would raise £500m a year. He said this should be used to fund a diesel scrappage scheme. This would give a £2,000 grant to drivers taking an older diesel vehicle off the road and buying a lower emission vehicle. </p>

<p>The government would pay £1,000, with the manufacturer matching this by reducing the list price by £1,000. The government ran a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/22/budget-scappage-scheme-welcomed">£300m car scrappage scheme in 2009</a> in this way, in order to boost the recession-hit motor industry. Johnson <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/10/boris-johnsons-diesel-car-scrappage-scheme-could-cost-300m">is among MPs and others who have called for a diesel scrappage scheme</a>.</p>

<p>Simon Birkett, director of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://cleanair.london/">Clean Air in London</a> campaign, backed the Policy Exchange ideas but said a city-centre ban on diesels was also needed. “We must ban diesel vehicles from the most-polluted places by 2020. There is no alternative if we’re to protect a generation of schoolkids. Diesel drivers must press those responsible for compensation. You wouldn’t let someone keep poisoning the water would you?”</p>

<p>Policy Exchange noted that tax incentives increased diesel cars from 14% of Britain’s car fleet in 2001 to 36% now, but that diesel cars no longer produce significantly less CO2 than petrol cars. The thinktank said diesel cars and vans cause 70% of NOx emissions in London, with vehicles producing four times more than the official limits on average.</p>

How about a pollution tax on ALL fossil fuel burning cars, boats and planes. Less pollution, less tax. No cars sold with more than 100 g/km CO2 release.

Some truth in what you say, but nothing has empowered or given so much freedom and opportunity so many people in such a short space of time either. And there is a huge difference in petrol and diesel exhaust quality, in terms of the immediate damaging effect on us, particularly children

kafkafan, Good post (up to a point). most people are not like you. The reason we have thirty million private cars on UK roads is down to conformity and the indoctrination of the masses by the motor car industry. You think for yourself, the mindless masses do not. The world will end before people start walking, cycling, and using public transport.

Danny, my old mucker, I am not making it up! These orange flashing gadgets are on many cars (Audis and BMWs excepted), but are cunningly disguised and only go orange when flashing. There seems to be some sort of age sensor involved, as they tend to wink, seductively, when the steering wheel is turned, but only on the side to which said steering wheel is turned. However, in the case of the older driver, the "Captain Careful" type, perhaps, this function seems to me manual. This means that the flashing thingy starts some time ahead of the turn. All very confusing and modern.

Wow! "a £2,000 grant to drivers taking an older diesel vehicle off the road and buying a lower emission vehicle."Trade in a stinky diesel and get £2,000 to spend on a nice bicycle. Can't wait till they do this in Australia. Might be dead by then, but hey! Aspirational.

So, diesel is a killer, and petrol is okay? No, of course not; all fuels when burned emit noxious gases. The guestimates vary but it is fair to say about FIFTY THOUSAND people die each year due to traffic pollution. Arrogant motor vehicle drivers believe (possibly not) that they are safe cocooned within their metal box, this much is for sure, they are dismissive of people dying and suffering ill health. There is no greater legal evil in our world than the PRIVATE MOTOR CAR - and that is without mentioning other consequences of there being THIRTY MILLION killing machines on the roads of the UK

surplus, I have never owned a car, hate them beyond words. I am now 67 and have spent my life walking, cycling, and using public transport. Having stated who I am, let me say this - anyone (cyclist or killing machine driver) who hurts or kills a pedestrian should be charged with serious assault/murder/manslaughter. I do not, and never will, defend cyclists who endanger pedestrians. Motorists? absolutely no comment

The idea is that, through government taxation incentives, manufactures develop and promote cleaner technologies (such as hybrid), and consumers adopt these technologies, so the dirty, harmful technologies effectively get 'taxed out of existence'.

Sadly true though.I cannot fathom, for the life of me, how people can not have sussed that those smelly old diesels had not really become any cleaner, just because the smoke wasn't trailing out of the exhaust pipe.Not criticising you , just saying people have listened to the industry and government guff and somehow believed it.

Right because banning the sales of diesel cars is the same as work vehicles? Surprisingly enough I'm not an idiot(yeah shocker right!!) I do realise that most delivery/farm vehicles are diesel and guess what some trains are too! Guess what though they could be protected if you stopped the sale of diesel vehicles to the general public for none business purposes. Its about idiots who live in a city centre yet need a huge 4x4 to do a school run which is causing town and city air pollution which is actually killing people. Now I've proven that I can find a sensible solution it just goes to prove how much of an idiotic comment you made.

To bracket all diesels as dangerously polluting is a poor analysis.

If diesels were sold on a lie how about getting the automotive industry to pay for clearing up the mess? Especially as they benefited from all these public subsidies in the first place!

This supports the notion that the technologies for “real-world clean” diesels (i.e., vehicles whose average emission levels lie below Euro 6 emission limits under real-world driving) already exist.

EV vs ICE are currently the same lifetime cost- EV fuel is very cheap but the cars are twice the price- ICE cars are cheap but the fuel a substantial investment.

well currently electic cars are 6 times cheaper to run than petrol/diesel. Plus they only have around 10 moving parts compared to hundreds in a petrol/diesel car so less things to go wrong and no messy oil changes,etc.

Its also worth mentioning that the emissions/economy testing discriminates in favour of diesel engines due to their narrow rev range (some of the cycle is based on the proportion of maximum engine revs). My diesel revs to about 4500rpm, my petrol car revs to 8000rpm.

In my case, I would love to not own a car, but for the simple fact that using public transport to commute to work would increase my travel time from about 20 minutes by car for the full journey, to about an hour and a half using a bus to get to the city I work in, then another bus to get to the area where I work.
