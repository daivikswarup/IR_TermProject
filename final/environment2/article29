Why is 2016 smashing heat records?




DateTime::::2016-03-04T06:00:26+0000



<p>Yet another global heat record has been beaten. It appears January 2016 - the most abnormally hot month in history, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt">according to Nasa</a> - will be comprehensively trounced once official figures come in for February. </p>

<p>Initial satellite measurements, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/03/01/february_2016_s_shocking_global_warming_temperature_record.html?wpsrc=sh_all_mob_tw_ru">compiled by Eric Holthaus at Slate</a>, put February’s anomaly from the pre-industrial average between <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://models.weatherbell.com/climate/ncep_cfsr_t2m_anom_022016.png">1.15C</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/MJVentrice/status/704695193321279488/photo/1">1.4C</a>. The UN Paris climate agreement struck in December seeks to limit warming to 1.5C if possible.</p>

<p>“Even the lower part of that range is extraordinary,” said Will Steffen, an emeritus professor of climate science at Australian National University and a councillor at Australia’s Climate Council. </p>

<p></p>

<p>It appears that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/03/01/february_2016_s_shocking_global_warming_temperature_record.html">on Wednesday</a>, the northern hemisphere even slipped above the milestone 2C average for the first time in recorded history. This is the arbitrary limit above which scientists believe global temperature rise will be “dangerous”.</p>

<p>The Arctic in particular experienced terrific warmth throughout the winter. Temperatures at the north pole <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/30/north-pole-could-be-25c-warmer-than-average-this-week-warn-meteorologists">approached 0C in late December</a> – 30C to 35C above average. </p>

<p>Mark Serreze, the director of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre, described the conditions as “absurd”.</p>

<p>“The heat has been unrelenting over the entire season,” he said. “I’ve been studying Arctic climate for 35 years and have never seen anything like this before”.</p>

<p>All this weirdness follows the record-smashing year of 2015, which was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201513">0.9C above the 20th century average</a>. This beat the previous record warmth of 2014 by 0.16C.<br/></p>

<p>These tumbling temperature records are often <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3de080da-bf99-11e5-846f-79b0e3d20eaf.html">accompanied in media reports by the caveat</a> that we are experiencing a particularly strong El Niño - perhaps the largest in history. But should El Niño and climate change be given equal billing?</p>

<p>No, according to Professor Michael Mann, the director of Penn State Earth System Science Centre. He said it was possible to look back over the temperature records and assess the impact of an El Niño on global temperatures.</p>

<p>“A number of folks have done this,” he said, “and come to the conclusion it was responsible for less than 0.1C of the anomalous warmth. In other words, we would have set an all-time global temperature record [in 2015] even without any help from El Niño.”</p>

<p>Global surface temperature is the major yardstick used to track how we are changing the climate. It is the average the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations">UN Paris agreement</a> refers to.</p>

<p>But the atmosphere doesn’t stop at the surface. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatechange2013.org/report/full-report/">In fact 93% of the extra energy trapped</a> by the greenhouse gases humans have emitted gets sunk into the oceans – just 1% ends up in the atmosphere where temperature is most often and most thoroughly measured. During El Niño, which occurs every three to six years, currents in the Pacific Ocean bring warm water to the surface and heat up the air.</p>

<p>Jeff Knight from the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said their modelling set the additional heat from a big El Niño, like the current one, at about 0.2C. He said wind patterns in the northern hemisphere had added another 0.1C to recent monthly readings.</p>

<p>“The bottom line is that the contributions of the current El Niño and wind patterns to the very warm conditions globally over the last couple of months are relatively small compared to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jan/09/global-warming-humans-not-sun">anthropogenically driven</a> increase in global temperature since pre-industrial times,” he added.</p>

<p>Steffen said the definitive assessment of this El Niño and its effect on the world’s temperature would only be possible once the event had run its course (it has now peaked and is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.yahoo.com/el-nino-eased-moderate-levels-australia-weather-bureau-043632145.html">expected to end</a> in the second quarter of this year). But he agreed that past El Niño cycles could be an appropriate guide for the order of magnitude of the effect. </p>

<p>The picture becomes less clear cut when we talk about monthly records. Even weather trends can have small effects on the monthly average temperature, said Knight. The effect of El Niño traditionally increases as it dies, so Mann believes it may have added more than the “nominal” o.1C during the past three months.</p>

<p>In the Arctic, the effect of El Niño is poorly understood but likely to be weak, said Knight. “Given that the Arctic has been very warm for a number of years, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/">record low sea ice</a>, it is more likely that the warmth there currently is part of a long-term trend rather than the response to a episodic event like El Niño.”<br/></p>

<p>Steffen says quantifying the relative contributions of El Niño and climate change on a monthly or even annual basis cannot help to answer how fast the world is warming. Only trends over 30 years really matter.</p>

<p>But the pile up of records we have had in the early part of this century are significant. All things being constant, record hot years should occur once every 150 years. Yet 1998, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2015 have all been record breakers.</p>

<p>A study published in January found that even without last year’s mammoth anomaly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/25/record-hot-years-near-impossible-without-manmade-climate-change-study">such a run was 600 to 130,000 times more likely to have occurred with human interference than without</a>.</p>

<p>“The fact that you are getting records so close, one after the other is really striking. And that is symptomatic of that long-term trend,” said Steffen.</p>

<p>But while they may be poor signals for long-term climate change, record hot months and years do have an immediate and tangible impact. </p>

<p>“It’s making heat waves worse. Here in Australia it bumps up the bushfire danger weather really fast. It tends to lead to drier conditions in our part of the world. These things are exacerbated by El Niños, so I don’t want to downplay the importance of them for human suffering,” said Steffen.</p>

You empirically did. You refused to speak about the roles of annual variations and error bars, and ignored that the observed trend had been outside of those error bars for several years.

Paul, your original comment puts 'global' in inverted commas, which seems to suggest that you doubt whether it can genuinely be described as such. While you are plausibly right to be skeptical about this, I suspect that it is not for the right reasons, (otherwise, you would have your answers by now). There is a huge field concerned with global SURFACE temperatures, which is to do with how you amass all of the thermometers in the world to say something sensible about the global average surface temperature (the one humans care about). It's hard, because the system wasn't really designed to answer this question when it first began decades and centuries ago, and because humans themselves change the climate of cities, etc. Your comments have a tone that scientists are engaged with hiding the location of said sensors, and while this simply isn't the case, it's quite hard to visualize the whole network because it's so large, and because it is non-stationary in time.

You might choose to be wary of a record that uses a model to correct for the diurnal cycle, but in that case, you'd probably have to do something else to correct for the diurnal cycle, given that record are potentially taken at different times of the day. You do know what a diurnal cycle is, and why it's important to correct for it, right? If so, what is your better idea to make that correction? Might it plausibly be a model, taking into account the things we know about how temperatures vary between day and night, perchance?

That does not suffice to show that 2015 was a record 



Author::::JamesCA
DateTime::::2016-03-07T02:22:34Z
Let us assume that the rise from 2014 to 2015 was about 0.16C, and that about 0.1C of this rise was from El Nino. (Or pick different numbers: IT DOESN'T MATTER FOR THE STRUCTURE OF THE ARGUMENT.)That does not suffice to show that 2015 was a record, so it is (literally) meaningless to ask which portion of that 0.16C (or whatever) rise was responsible for 2015 setting a record.When you can clearly explain the information that must be added to talk about 2015 being a record we can resume the discussion. Until then, you're just babbling.

I panicked two years ago and subsequently moved to NZ, I have a friend who is a paleo climatologist and he told me things are far, far, far worse than most people know, mainly because climate scientists are reticent (forced to be conservative because of the far right deniers) and don't want to alarm, but this is bad because really we should be very alarmed and be on a war footing for geo engineering right now, basically our approach is to say sure, some millions will die and be displaced, so be it.

You're question is irrelevant, it's not local warming, it's Global Warming, what matters is the overall climate change, just because one area has a warm summer or cooler winter does not mean climate change, its weather, what matters are long term trends over 30 years, and they all tell us the earth is getting hotter.

The El Nino index has only just fallen from its record 2.3C to 2.2C. The atmospheric temperature always lags the El Nino by several months so the atmospheric warming is likely to continue well into the summer months.

This has been examined in detail on other sites. Basically what the surface station guys have done is to keep the same amount of overall warming since 1900, but to redistribute it so that less supposedly occurred pre-2000, which allows the remainder to be placed in the post-2000 era.

The atmosphere is warming at about 0.16C per decade. There was no let up in the steadily rising trend after 1998 and there will be no let up in the trend for many years after 2016. On top of that trend are short term fluctuations caused by El Ninos, La Ninas, volcanoes and solar cycles. They are interesting but largely irrelevant to the key statistic, the rising trend of about 0.16C per decade.

What we always need to remember is that the key statistic is the steadily warming trend of about 0.17C per decade. Despite what the deniers try to claim there was no pause after the strong El Nino in 1998 and there will be no pause after the strong El Nino of 2016, they are just blips on the steadily warming trend.

Is this article based on the surface temperature records? If so then these records have inexplicably diverged from, and are now significantly warmer than satellite temperature records. As for many observed phenomena in climate science, no one seems to know why this is the case.
