Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau to join forces on climate change




DateTime::::2016-03-08T14:52:15+0000



<p>Barack Obama and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> will commit to work together to fight climate change and protect an Arctic experiencing the mildest winter ever recorded, sources familiar with the initiatives said.</p>

<p>The two leaders were expected to announce a number of common climate measures at a meeting at the White House this week, from a 45% cut in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry to protections for a rapidly warming <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/arctic">Arctic</a>.</p>

<p>The state visit on Thursday is seen as an important moment for Trudeau to break with his Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, who was accused of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/20/scientists-attack-muzzling-government-state-funded-cabinet-office">muzzling government scientists</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/13/canada-withdrawal-kyoto-protocol">backtracking on climate promises</a>.</p>

<p> The visit – four months after Trudeau’s election and 11 months before Obama leaves the White House – offered a rare window of opportunity to advance the cause that is important to both leaders, the Canadian prime minister said.</p>

<p>“There is a nice alignment between a Canadian prime minister who wants to get all sorts of things done right off the bat and an American president who is thinking about the legacy he is going to leave in his last year in office,” Trudeau <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/justin-trudeau_us_56ddec4ae4b03a405679827c?ir=Canada&amp;section=ca_canada&amp;utm_hp_ref=canada&amp;utm_hp_ref=canada">told a Huffington Post town hall</a><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/">.</a></p>

<p> “The issues that are important to him and to me are climate change … We’re talking about border issues, as well – making sure there is a smooth flow of goods and people across our shared border that isn’t putting our security at risk.”</p>

<p>Taking prime position among those issues was the Arctic – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/04/is-el-nino-or-climate-change-behind-the-run-of-record-temperatures">where winter temperatures are 7C above normal this year</a> and the sea ice cover is also dwindling towards a new record low. In Alaska, the winter was so unseasonably warm that the authorities were forced to import <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/03/04/alaskas-winter-is-so-warm-the-iditarod-is-importing-snow-and-shortening-its-ceremonial-start/">freight cars full of snow</a> for the launch of the annual Iditarod dog sledding race.</p>

<p>The US took over from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> last year as leader of the Arctic Council, the group of polar regional countries.</p>

<p>The US and Canadian leaders were expected to use the Washington visit to announce a number of measures to protect remote communities and ecologically sensitive marine areas in the Arctic, sources familiar with the initiatives said.<br/></p>

<p>Some of those initiatives involved efforts to reduce reliance on diesel fuel – which is transported by barge into remote native Alaskan villages. </p>

<p>With the melting of the Arctic summer sea ice, the region faces sweeping changes in the years and decades ahead. <br/></p>

<p>Shipping traffic in the North-west Passage and the Bering Sea is projected to rise by a factor of seven over the next decade – which could disrupt hunting and fishing by native Alaskan communities. </p>

<p>The two leaders are also expected to announce joint initiatives in Arctic science research. Scientists have blamed the warming of the Arctic for changes in global weather patterns.</p>

<p>Obama and Trudeau are also expected to announce common positions on reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Both countries have been edging towards a common 45% target for cutting emissions from methane – which is more than 80 times as warming as carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the US State Department’s climate envoy, Todd Stern, told reporters that methane emissions reductions would be an area the countries could work together on.</p>

<p>In November last year, Alberta, Canada’s main energy-producing province,<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=38885E74F7B63-A62D-D1D2-E7BCF6A98D616C09"> unveiled a new climate plan</a> proposing to reduce methane emissions from oil wells by 45% from 2014 levels by 2025. Two months later, Obama <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/13/obama-state-of-the-union-methane-regulation-climate-change">proposed new rules</a> cutting methane emissions 45% from 2012 levels by 2025.</p>

<p>Campaigners saw the curbs on methane as a chance to cap one of the fastest growing sources of climate pollution in recent years – because of the boom in oil and gas drilling.</p>

<p>“Methane is a very significant climate pollutant,” said Erin Flanagan, the federal policy director for the Pembina Institute, a Canadian environmental thinktank. </p>

You remain a die hard adherent to the first rule I see. Despite the fact that that this is a pain on my phone. Here you go. The Constitution Act, 1867 states under III. Executive Power, section 9 that "The Executive Government of Canada and Authority of and over Canada is hearby declared to continue and be vested in the Queen." (Victoria at the time of course).

How Much Carbon Dioxide in the Atmosphere Versus Methane?Carbon DioxideAccording to the EPA’s overview of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for about 82 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the U.S. Since the industrial revolution, human activities have been altering the carbon cycle in the atmosphere by adding more CO2 and influencing the ability of “natural sinks”, like forests, to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

I agree. However, just because the journalists probably went where it was expedient to take a picture does not mean what the text says is false. They were honest about where the picture was taken, not trying to pass it off as in the arctic circle. I think climate change still has bearing there, in any event.

The Harper years will be reflected on as the darkest in Canada’s environmental history. Muzzled federal scientists, the gutting of decades’ worth of environmental regulations, the steamrolling of First Nations Rights, the demise of Canada’s climate leadership on the world stage, the removal of the public from public consultation processes – the list is long and tragic.

A typically misleading comment from John. Of course Oil sands extraction began decades before Harper. Extraction did of course expand under him which was primarily due to the high price of oil. But that won't stop John from deliberately trying to mislead readers into thinking that Harper is why oil extraction expanded.

Undeniably it's been a warm winter up here in Alaska and yes we need to reassess our impact on the environment that we breathe, drink, and eat in. But the 2 pictures used in this article are misleading and bias. The first pic of the snow being hauled in for the Iditarod fails to mention that the snow wasn't asked for by Anchorage city officials and wasn't used for the race because they hauled their own snow in from the north side of town already. The second picture showing melting ice on the Chilkat River is misleading because the river is over 1000 miles from the Arctic Circle!By misleading readers with dramatic captions and and images that are irrelevant and false, makes me question the validity of this article. Maybe it is intended to put a spin on their own interests? Let's clean the environment up yes, but using false and bias information to support your interest works against the ultimate goal of addressing environmental issues.

Even more instructive is to check what the "normal" is for that place and see that since records have been kept that March weather has varied from lows of minus 24F to highs of 51F. Now tell me that you can detect the impact of "global warming" of about 1 degree F in that picture. Also note that the warmest March on record was 1926 and the coldest 1959.

Global warming is not a hoax, climate has always changed and always will since there are driving forces we don't yet fully understand and certainly have no control over that have acted since the beginning of the Earth. CO2 is a very minor one and considering that the climate changes are very clearly not following the changes in CO2 in our atmosphere its effect is proving to be insignificant. The hoax is the claim that creating a tax on combustion of fuel will somehow have any positive effect on our climate. Increasing CO2 has had one measurable effect which is the general greening of Earth's deserts since plants that are stressed by lack of rainfall can do better when not also stressed by lack of CO2.

Most moderate parties strike a middle balance between government and private sector involvement in the economy or between socialism and capitalism. The best and most efficient are hybrids. There are some things governments can do better than private enterprise and vice versa.

It certainly puzzling how perpetuating the fracking boom is compatible with this 'we're cutting methane!' photo-op -- given the recent revelations about fracking basically leaving a landscape leaking methane like a barbecue someone's terminated with a shotgun.

Usually, I don't try to. But when political parties describe themselvesas socialist, we do take some notice.In economic terms the standard definition would look like this.The more leftist parties would favour more involvement by governmentin economic decisions. The more right parties would favour more involvement by the private sector. It is basically a choice between bigger, more intrusive governmentand a less intrusive, smaller government.This economic divide is the most important but there are, of course,many other differences in other areas such as individual responsibilityas opposed to societal responsibility. But these are the same argumentof less or more government.

I would certainly defer to your judgement of your own party.But all three of these parties were members, in good standing,of Socialist International. The UK, under Blair, did leave the membership and become an 'observer'. The Australian party has now left and joined a new off-shoot group. The Canadian NDP is still a member of SI. In anycase, we have never experimented with a radical leftist government.Australians will always decide if they want such a government.

To me they're centre right to you Canada's LPC are centre right because, unlike the electromagnetic spectrum, the units of measurement of that of politics are not standardized or attached to any physical reality.
