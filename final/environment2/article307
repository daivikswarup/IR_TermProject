The eco guide to eating meat

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>nstead of the steaks and pork chops in our fridges, should we be investing in clean, green protein? Well, yes. Methane from livestock is responsible for 14% of global warming, and the gas is 25 times more potent than CO<sub>2</sub>. The more meat and dairy you eat from ruminants, particularly cows, the more burping and farting you are responsible for. The 2014 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/">documentary <em>Cowspiracy</em></a> focuses on the idea that this is the<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/05/think-dairy-farming-is-benign-our-rivers-tell-a-different-story"> great neglected greenhouse gas source</a>.</p>

<p>By 2050, experts predict, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/19/population-crisis-farm-animals-laying-waste-to-planet">demand for meat will have doubled</a>, and meat-related emissions will boom at 12bn tonnes of carbon to feed a population of 9 billion. Our consumption has to tail off if we are to achieve Paris emissions goals.</p>

<p>In 2013 researchers found the carbon footprint of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269687511_Flexitarianism_Decarbonising_through_flexible_vegetarianism">vegetarian to be half that of a meat eater</a>. Comfortingly, they also found that a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/mar/24/why-meat-free-week-wont-work">flexitarian approach</a> is a close second. By replacing three-quarters of our ruminant budget with other forms of protein, we could reduce livestock emissions to 3.1bn tonnes by 2050. Chicken could play a part, but some <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/nov/17/move-over-meat-how-the-uk-can-diversify-its-protein-consumption">non-meat proteins</a> should be included, too.</p>

<p>Not all animals are equal, ethically. Cows raised on species-rich pasture produce fewer emissions. But industrialised agriculture focuses on how to raise animals indoors in feedlots more efficiently. Low-emissions meat could have a big ethical impact in other ways.</p>

<p>Do food retailers have a responsibility to sell less? <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.riverford.co.uk/how-much-meat">Riverford’s “How Much Meat</a>” campaign explores this idea. Riverford sells vegetables, so it has a vested interest, but it also sells organic meat. Apparently founder Guy Watson launched the campaign after his daughter, having seen <em>Cowspiracy</em>, petitioned him to divest from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/industrial-farming-one-worst-crimes-history-ethical-question"> livestock industry</a>.</p>

<p>Fungi are known as nature’s ultimate recycler, but it is time to acknowledge the radical diversity and downright beauty of fungi, slime moulds and lichens. Botanist photographer and fungi-obsessive Steve Axford, a native of New South Wales, Australia, is on a mission to take pictures of the most obscure specimens to be found on the planet, many of which have never been catalogued before. </p>

<p>Diamonds aren’t our best friends, ethically speaking, which is why I love the way the best new jewellery brands are redefining which materials really are precious. Pembe Club is a recent member of this club. Yasmine Haji, a third-generation jewellery designer, sources natural, sustainable materials from Tanzania including wild grass seeds, recycled glass, East African coins, harita, ostrich eggs and cowrie shells alongside recycled glass beads, pyrite and black onyx. Her mission is to make sure that the materials are readily available to the local artisans and villagers she works with – and to convince them as well as buyers that these materials can replace ivory. Elephant poaching plagues Tanzania. Haji is determined that by replicating shapes and techniques in sustainable materials she can make a positive change to this desperate situation.

The worlds demand for meat cannot be met by well kept pastures though. Plain and simple, we have to eat less.

it's a fair bit easier to cut down on meat consumption rather than cutting down people though...bit more moral as well.

Author::::pavanne

Well kept pasture isn't that biodiverse (I've been reading George Monbiot's Feral, which makes a very good point that pretty much any farm activity reduces carbon sequestration from vegetation, and also biodiversity - compare a wood with a field). Also, the climate change effect from cattle farming certainly isn't the same as it being carbon neutral, since methane is a considerably more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

depends on where/weather. i am in ireland and have cattle on pasture behind my house now. anyways, being in a barn over winter/during bad weather isn't remotely factory farming.

Whilst your ideals are lovely, its doesn't mean they are sustainable. Enjoy is different from essential. You want the entire planet's population to continue to 'enjoy' meat, however we'll destroy the planet in the process doing that. Worth it?

Africa has just passed the billion mark of population, it has a very unstable climate, with starvation always somewhere [ethiopia again now]. Yet the UN say that the African population will reach 2 billion in 35 years, who will feed them, what will they all do?

In the UK most cattle, beef and dairy are wintered indoors. My brothers' cattle live in luxury, [even better than some humans] compared with cattle 40 years ago. Warm, dry, plenty of food, even electric light , to see their food by.

You don't need 'sources' anyone with common sense and agricultural knowledge can tell you the welsh hills are mainly fit for sheep grazing, far too steep and poor for arable crops, apart from too wet a climate!



Author::::DavidVinter

But if you want a vegetarian diet, and much lower use of artificial fertilizers, then without farm animal turds, where is the fertilizer to come from?Back to square 1 ----too many humans on earth!

"...o feed a population of 9 billion. Our consumption has to tail off if we are to achieve Paris emissions goals" I think you've hit the most important point here. The problem isn't eating meat, the problem is that there are too many people. With 7 or 8 or 9 billion people around, then almost everything we might all want to eat becomes unsustainable.

 The carbon footprint of a vegetarian is half that of a meat eater

of what?



Author::::sabelmouse
DateTime::::2016-02-15T11:10:24Z
the thing is that we don't all have to eat the same thing or live on it alone. it's about finding what's most sustainable and that varies from region to region as well as to amount of animal foods in one's diet and how they are produced. our globalised food system is wasteful, and unsustainable, as is veganism altogether.

all cattle are pastured in north america, even those who spend the last 3 months or so in feed lots. beef and lamb are sustainable and well kept pasture is a carbon sink as well as a bio diverse wildlife habitat. you might enjoy this video Precious Phiri, "Community Grazing for Community Abundance"and thanks for the link.

only if pastured beef/lamb weren't carbon neutral and sustainable which it is if done properly. this article lies.

if you want sustainability then pastured beef and lamb/mutton is the thing to eat in many regions.

vegetarians [whatever those are ; vegans? lacto/ovo vegetarians?]don't have half the foot print. it's a myth that has been perpetrated for a while now, based on a mistake in a study that was soon rectified. vegan sites like to keep it going and the fossil fuel sits back smiling while people talk about cows causing climate change. humans are omnivores and only a few rare tribes are close to carnivorous. what most of us really mostly live on are plant foods, mostly refined carbs and veg oils. another problem of course is our horrendous food waste though that would actually increase as at least 50% of animal feed is non human consumable phytomass, aka by/waste products from crops for humans such as soy for oil, corn for methanol,syrup, ans eating [stalks and leaves as well as mush] bran, waste from juice and alcohol production and so on.



Author::::sabelmouse
DateTime::::2016-02-15T10:44:26Z
maybe what they mean is historical/biological roots. we're omnivores and large amounts of animal foods almost always benefit us while there never has been a voluntarily vegan culture until recently, and it's only possible with industrially produced supplements and an unsustainable and unjust globalised food system. even then few keep it up past 5 years, if that. for good reasons.



Author::::sabelmouse
DateTime::::2016-02-15T10:41:17Z
pretty much. according to a new york state based study omnivory with mostly dairy comes out as most sustainable.



Author::::sabelmouse
DateTime::::2016-02-15T10:40:12Z
sadly no solution to anything. 1. pasturing is2. veganism is not sustainable and doesn't help animals either. not even those few that vegans care about, let alone the many that suffer and are killed for crops [growing and even more so, protection], petrochemicals, transport, and so on. it's nigh impossible to embrace a vegan diet/lifestyle anywhere on this planet without relying on an unsustainable globalised food system. what would really help animals, humans, and the environment is fully supporting a sustainable, localised, humane food system.

The carbon footprint of a vegetarian is half that of a meat eater, but it’s not all bad news for carnivoresnot even remotely true. well done pasturing is carbon neutral [research carbon cycle and carbon sink] not to mention the well kept pasture is a bio diverse wildlife habitat the retains water and needs no pesticides. and very few humans are even nearly carnivorous. you cite nothing but propaganda that vegans like and that is most likely sponsored by the fossil fuel industry. i man COWSPIRACY?!? come on!!!

Almost all mussels eaten are farmed, and mussel farming is certainly the least damaging of all forms of fish farming - all you need to is drop weighted ropes from a float and mussels grow away happily on the rope, filtering away whatever floats past.

exactly, going vegan is an ideological choice, not a rational one. The vegan diet has no vit B12 ( which is a required nutrient), and no historical roots.

The "documentary" Cowspiracy peddles equivalent bs as the "documentary" Gasland.Vast agricultural lands are only suitable for animal husbandry or planting animal feed or need animals as part of the usage.
