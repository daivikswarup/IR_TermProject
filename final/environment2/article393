Ocean acidification slowing coral reef growth, study confirms




DateTime::::2016-02-24T18:00:03+0000



<p>Coral reefs are having their growth stunted by ocean acidification caused by global warming, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature17155">new research</a> has confirmed. </p>

<p>For the first time, scientists conducted an experiment on a natural coral reef which involved altering sea water chemistry to mimic the effect of excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. </p>

<p>The results provide strong evidence that ocean acidification linked to greenhouse gas emissions is already slowing coral reef growth, the team claims. </p>

<p>Without “deep cuts” in greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s coral reefs may not survive into the next century, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/02/coral-catastrophic-future">scientists say</a>. </p>

<p>Carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean where it reacts with seawater to increase acidity. </p>

<p>If the water becomes too acid it dissolves away the calcium carbonate corals that molluscs and creatures such as crabs and lobsters need to build their shells and stony skeletons. </p>

<p>Although previous studies have demonstrated large scale declines in coral reefs in recent decades, the reason for the trend has been harder to pinpoint. </p>

<p>Acidification is one possible cause, but others include warming, pollution and over-fishing. </p>

<p>To investigate the role played by greenhouse gas emissions, the US scientists manipulated the acidity of seawater flowing over a section of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia’s One Tree Island. </p>

<p>Bringing the reef’s pH value – a measurement of acidity or alkalinity – closer to what it would have been in pre-industrial times increased the rate at which calcium carbonate was deposited to grow hard coral exoskeletons. </p>

<p>Lead researcher, Dr Rebecca Albright, from the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, said: “Our work provides the first strong evidence from experiments on a natural ecosystem that ocean acidification is already slowing coral reef growth. </p>

<p>“Ocean acidification is already taking its toll on coral reef communities. This is no longer a fear for the future; it is the reality of today.”</p>

<p>The research <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature17155">is reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature</a>. </p>

<p>Other work by Carnegie colleague Professor Ken Caldeira found that rates of reef calcification in 2008 and 2009 were 40% lower than they were in 1975 and 1976. </p>

<p>He said: “The only real, lasting way to protect coral reefs is to make deep cuts in our carbon dioxide emissions. </p>

<p>“If we don’t take action on this issue very rapidly, coral reefs - and everything that depends on them, including both wildlife and local communities – will not survive into the next century.”</p>

To provide some background on Australian Pleistocene archaeological sites and their interpretation particularly with respect to life style and diet of the peoples at that time the following are only a sample.

I'd have to read the original reports and articles on these sites you mention, to judge them, but most peer reviewed theories claiming evidence of early meat consumption are processualist, fail to acknowledge their own bias' and are guilty of 'presenting the past'. I've read many that have been widely reported as fact in the mainstream media and yet have been heavily criticized by peers. Reading material evidence is always subjective, but as better scientific analysis is developed you can get a better picture (though, still a subjective one, everything has to be read and interpreted by someone), and most isotope analysis of early humans show evidence of plant based diets. In Europe, even as late as the neolithic, there is very little isotope evidence for widespread meat consumption, until it's conspicuous consumption for a short period of c.50yrs coinciding with the collapse of that society and the beginning of the bronze age. Otzi is a good example of how isotope analysis has turned earlier assumptions on their heads, he was found with a belly full of meat, so it was thought meat formed a regular part of his diet, the isotope analysis showed it didn't and he ate a mainly plant based diet, his belly was full of a meal eaten in unusual circumstances. My point being that even if at times in the past people needed to eat meat occasionally, that is not the case for the majority of humans alive on the planet today. In fact the no.1 cause of world hunger is animal agriculture, so doing so actively causes global food insecurity.

To protect coral reefs we need deep cuts in our carbon dioxide emissions.Is it acceptable to powerful Corporations that lobby US Congress?

I enjoy my tofu and have made my own. Also enjoy a wide range of lentils and pulses as part of my balanced diet. Moong dal or mung bean is a local native plant to south east Queensland, and I suspect was one of the many plant foods used by the Turrbal and Jagera people. Before wheat bread northern Europeans would have used rye and barky as their main grains. I enjoy pumpernickel but couldn't live on it and only eat barley when processed as beer or whiskey.

"Also there is little proof in the archaeological record of of meat-eating in Australia dating back that far" but as a paleontologist who worked on Pleistocene mammal faunas I am well aware of the archaeological sites from 40,000 years ago with evidence of charred bones, clay ovens and the consumption of a range of animal species. I suspect that those people also made use of a wide range of fresh and processed plant foods as aboriginal Australians did before becoming economically part of the European settler culture. This resulted in a balanced diet.

Plus, I need to add, 98% of all soy production is used in animal agriculture and animal based processed foods. Wheat and any agriculture wouldn't exist without animal agriculture, it was brought to Europe, in their late Neolithic, from the Middle and Near East where crop based agriculture was developed after they domesticated 'livestock' animals.

There are far more people on the planet today than 50,000 ya. Plus there is a huge difference between hunting wild animals and domesticated animal agriculture. Also there is little proof in the archaeological record of meat-eating in Australia dating back that far. Finally, grass-fed 'meat' has a higher carbon footprint than feed-lot.

You can base your ideas on belief but the reality of my country is that grass fed beef and kangaroo are readily available and taste better. Even most lot fed beef here is only lot fed for a very short time. Over most of my state stock are not watered from dams on the natural grasslands on which they graze. You need topography for dams.

I prefer to believe all the scientific data that shows animal agriculture to be the single most environmentally damaging industry there is over your self interest. Also just one serving of meat is equal to a months worth of showers in water usage, so recalculate. Believe all lies you tell yourself if you wish, but the fact is you can't care about the environment and eat meat or dairy.

Excessive CO2 production has meant that the ocean pH has dropped by 0.1 pH unit. Atmospheric CO2 is now 400 ppm CO2 but coral started dying on a big scale when CO2 reached 320 ppm, noting that atmospheric CO2 had not exceeded 280 ppm for lat 800,000 years until after the start of the Industrial Revolution (see “2011 climate change course”: https://sites.google.com/site/300orgsite/2011-climate-change-course ).

However, it could be sunspots, or the wrong pH indicators used !? say Nigel Lawson, Owen Paterson and Mr Rothermere - and they are actually in charge and have the ability to convince all the countless millions and millions of science-denialists in the UK.

Last winters bushfires near Townsville followed by summers monsoon trough rains would have seen much more wood ash replete with KOH washed into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef than your paltry contribution; but they didn't make any noticeable difference either. It all a matter of comparative scales and not the ones on the reef fish.

The biggest success of the climate change deniers was to move the matter into the realm of belief and discredit scientific facts.It's called Global Warming.If Australia was affected,it would be called Australian Warming and all those scientist have no idea.But don't despair.We have the the world's best environment minister.

it may be it seems impossible.We think "Poor corals. So pretty ! Divers and that".As for fish we think "Aha, sustainable fishing. Must look at that sustainable fish list, it was on MasterChef, in the credits".Or "Those Japanese and Icelanders, eating whales: Barbarians !"

Fascinating: you mean corals effectively became extinct, and something similar evolved anew later on?

I totally agree, why I ended up saying what I did in response to the Bill Gates piece. Mankinds priorities are all wrong and marketing propaganda has beaten common-sense yet again. And We wonder why the politicians never do anything, they are just pandering to what the people crave. Chocolate biscuit politics. I'm signing off to enjoy the last days of this quality of life before it's gone. I've had enough of this bullshit. It IS the guardian who's given it more prominence isn't it ? Bye

I've got a bit of very alkaline woodash, should I encourage that quickly into the oceans to do a bit of pH correcting for marinelife, or should I let it sit in the atmosphere to absorb a bit of CO2 and save the potassium for my soil?

Totally irrelevant to deniers, or should I say people who lack knowledge/intelligence.They do not live in the sea therefore what does it matter. If the oceans are covered in ice, what is it to them. If the oceans die, what is it to them.
