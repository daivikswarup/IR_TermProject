Who’s in line to be the next UN climate change chief?




DateTime::::2016-02-24T10:34:07+0000



<p>There’s a well-paid vacancy at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations">United Nations</a> going at the moment.<br/>After six years in the hot-seat, UN climate chief Christiana Figueres is off, with a global pact at the top of her CV.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.un.org/sg/vacancies/usgvas.shtml#UNFCCC">hunt is on</a> for her replacement, the UN job portal is open, the salary in the region of $200,000 (£143,000).</p>

<p>Applicants need to demonstrate vision, communication skills, experience of working with senior leaders and be a patient sort.</p>

<p>With less than five years until a new global pact comes into force, it’s a critical time for whoever takes over, with the prospect of little glory but plenty of graft.</p>

<p>On the downside you have to live in Bonn. On the upside it requires a lot of travel so you won’t be there much.</p>

<p>The UN climate body has only had four heads: one from Malta, two from the Netherlands and the incumbent from Costa Rica. History favours candidates from small countries, not permanent members of the UN security council.</p>

<p>Climate Home has canvassed opinion from the international climate change community – here’s a rundown of the top 10 names being discussed (in no particular order).</p>

<p>Mexico’s ambassador to Germany is highly regarded in climate circles, having taken over the presidency of the UN talks in 2010 with the Copenhagen hangover still raging. Careful diplomacy and a tight alliance with Figueres saw the Cancun talks get back on track after the Danish disaster.</p>

<p>If the UN wants to emphasise its commitment to implementation between now and 2020, the executive director of the International Energy Agency could be a decent bet. The Turkish economist is on the UN’s Sustainable Energy 4 All panel and is a respected media performer.</p>

<p>Lima’s environment chief has an election coming up, potentially freeing him up for other pursuits. Credited with ensuring UN talks were more open and transparent in 2014, MPV was asked to assist COP21 president Laurent Fabius in Paris as a bridge with civil society groups.</p>

<p>The lean and quiet environment minister of the Gambia lives on the frontline of climate change, a powerful advocate for investment in adaptation and loss and damage. One-time head of the Least Developed Countries group was chosen to be one of Fabius’ advisors in the closing stages of Paris.</p>

<p>Diseko brought a touch of drama and glamour to UN talks through 2015, fiercely defending the 134-strong Group of 77 she was charged with leading. She’s an old hand at the UN and one of the key advisors to the South African government during the 2011 COP17 summit in Durban.</p>

<p>Former chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, Grenada ambassador to the UN and Oxfam climate advisor, Williams is a UN talks veteran. She’s another potential candidate who lives on the climate frontline, often writing about the impact of rising sea levels on her home.<br/></p>

<p>An architecture critic, author, economist and diplomat, there are apparently few subjects Corrêa do Lago cannot discuss with authority. Brazil’s smooth and media-friendly ambassador to Japan was – until 2012 – its head of climate negotiations, and chief negotiator at the Rio+20 talks.<br/></p>

<p>Secretary of state for climate change between 2008-2011, Ribera now runs the Paris-based IDDRI thinktank, which played a key behind-the-scenes role helping the French government at COP21. An established name on the circuit, Ribera has also led IDDRI’s Latin American outreach.</p>

<p>If Laurent Fabius was the face of the UN climate talks, Tubiana was the brains trust behind the project, advising the COP president on the technical aspects of a climate deal. A warm personality who made many new friends in the past year, it’s doubtful she’d want to swap Paris for Bonn.</p>

<p>When Paris looked in trouble, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/12/07/brazil-tasked-with-resolving-rich-poor-divide-at-climate-talks/">France turned to Teixeira</a> to resolve the developed v developing divide at UN talks. A robust negotiator and career civil servant who rarely smiles in public, she was the face of the Rio+20 talks and sits on the UN high level panel for post-2015 development. </p>

Intriguing, what report did Christiana Figueres sanction the editing to promote Flat Earth Climate Change Beliefs as evidenced previously? I can’t think of one of hand. Are you sure you are thinking of the UNFCCC?

Thank you for your explanation. I conclude from the unnecessary complexity, inefficiency and waste that what you describe is most probably correct.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate was established by UNEP and WMO and is based in Geneva, whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change span out of the Rio Conventions and has its own secretariat based in Bonn. There is also Janos Pasztor, United Nations Assistant Secretary-General on Climate Change over in New York. Not sure where he fits in. Perhaps another candidate for the UNFCCC job?

Who? A masochist with a concrete-lined stomach and a blind, completely unreasonable faith in the UN's effectiveness in dealing with climate change.

Izabella Teixeira is nothing more than a yes person for the present government. She has supported the total weakening of the Forest Code, openeing the door to deforestation everywhere here, supports the return of keeping wildlife as pets and has generally weakened the green policies with full support for agri business and especially destructive ranching.If she cared about climate change she certainly has been hiding this fact for the last 6 years or so she has been the Environment minister here in Brazil.This must be a political choice not a scientific or idealistic one.

Yes, plenty of graft. Whoever goes for the job will need to check under the covers first. Whilst from an external perspective Paris sets the ball rolling for the next five years of negotiations, internally the secretariat is in poor shape. Like many parts of the UN system it has some serious problems and really needs to improve the way it works to sustainably support the Parties in the long haul ahead. So whoever gets the job will need to put a lot of hard work as well as learning to ride a bike ;-)

It was a joke. You questioned the Saudis' environmental credentials, since their own climate is so uncomfortable. I was making a positive point about their ability to manage their environment, since none of their rivers are polluted. However, this is mainly because there are no rivers in Saudi Arabia.



Author::::LibbyElk

Given that the population density in the UK is nearly 20 times higher than in Saudi Arabia I do not find that to be particularly surprising.



Author::::Andy54
DateTime::::2016-02-24T15:55:38Z
But unlike the UK, absolutely none of Saudi Arabia's rivers are polluted.

I nominate Guy McPherson whose motto is "nature bats last." But seriously, a job that exemplifies the futility of trying to stop runaway heating while civilization operates as a heat engine bent on self destruction and prone to self delusion, must be a mere sham.

I seriously doubt that whomever is chosen will continue the UN's impotence in dealing with climate change. The UN is helpless in the face of oligarch power. They are meaningless and ignored by the very powers who can do anything about climate change.

No it will probably go to some wanker with political connections with no gravitas in the UN .....get paid and achieve nothing but attend talkfest....it's quite an industry that does not measure productivity or results.

Bonn? What a fantastic place to exile Rudd to. The most boring town in Germany, especially since the West German government ran out of there as fast as possible to Berlin.

Hopefully, whomsoever is appointed will be devoid of any political connections, is fully informed over the science, and refuses to sanction the editing of any report to promote Flat Earth Climate Change Beliefs as evidenced previously.

I'm a bit confused as well. I am familiar with the UNIPCC which was chaired until recently by railway engineer Rajendra Pachauri before sexual abuse allegations concerning a junior colleague put a stop to his reign. My first impression was that this article concerned his replacement, but now I am not so sure.

Best not to chance it - the Saudis can't even manage their own climate. If you've ever visited you'll know what I mean - it is mind-bogglingly hot and dry!

Disappointed to see no candidate from Saudi Arabia on this list. If, as the UN believes, the Saudis are eligible for membership of the Human Rights Council then surely they can look after the climate for us too?
