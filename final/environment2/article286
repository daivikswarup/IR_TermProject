UK government moves to ease energy supply fears




DateTime::::2016-03-01T11:00:45+0000



<p>The UK government has moved to allay fears of a coming electricity supply crunch by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/reforms-to-capacity-market-to-improve-energy-security-for-families-and-businesses">unexpectedly bringing forward key reforms to the energy market</a>.</p>

<p>An auction of contracts to supply electricity is to be brought forward a year, to next January, and will cover the supply of power in the winter of 2017 to 2018.</p>

<p>The recently announced <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/sse-set-to-close-most-of-major-coal-power-plant">closure of two power stations</a>, along with the failure to bring forward new generating capacity and problems with uneconomic fossil fuel plants, has raised fears of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/will-the-lights-go-out-in-the-uk-this-winter">looming energy supply gap</a>.</p>

<p>Amber Rudd, energy and climate change secretary, said on Tuesday: “Ensuring our families and businesses have secure energy supplies they can rely on is not negotiable and I’ll take no risks with this. I’m taking further action to tackle the legacy of under-investment and ensure our country’s long-term energy security.”</p>

<p>While this year’s mild winter has meant lower energy needs, by next winter and by 2018 - particularly if there is a cold snap - supply gaps may be more difficult to avoid.</p>

<p>In another attempt to stave off potential problems, the government also signalled its intention to get tough on electricity suppliers by promising stronger sanctions against companies that break their contracts to supply power. Ministers were angered by the closure of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/sse-set-to-close-most-of-major-coal-power-plant">Fiddlers Ferry power station</a>, as its owner SSE had agreed a contract to supply power from it.</p>

<p>The loss of generating capacity from coal-fired power stations has several causes, including the poor economics of running coal plants at present, compared with gas, and the government’s intention to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/18/energy-policy-shift-climate-change-amber-rudd-backburner">phase out unabated coal by 2025</a>, while <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/25/uk-cancels-pioneering-1bn-carbon-capture-and-storage-competition">cancelling a planned £1bn investment in carbon capture and storage</a> technology.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Fiddlers Ferry announcement, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/08/government-denies-blackout-risk-engie-rugeley-coal-power-station-shuts">French company Engie said it would shut its Rugeley coal plant</a> with the loss of 150 jobs.</p>

<p>While Ofgem, the energy regulator, and the Department of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> and Climate Change have dismissed fears of blackouts to consumers, there are concerns about energy supply to businesses. National Grid has put in place measures to pay energy-intensive companies to manage their use in such a way, which could include shutting down capacity at key times, that would make more power available for domestic use if needed.</p>

<p>But Lisa Nandy, Labour’s shadow climate secretary said the move would prove costly for consumers. “This is a panicked response that will raise energy bills and deliver a windfall to some of the biggest energy companies. Tory Ministers now need to come clean over how much energy bills will rise next year to pay for the consequence of their failure to get new power stations built,” she said.</p>

<p>Rudd said that by awarding contracts for generating capacity a year earlier than expected, the government would “protect consumers and businesses from avoidable spikes in energy costs”.</p>

<p>Buying capacity earlier is also intended to encourage investment in new gas-fired power stations and electricity interconnectors with other countries, on which progress has been slow.</p>

<p>Other changes to the government’s market regulations, which only became fully operational last year, will include measures on diesel power generation, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/11/diesel-farms-built-subsidies-national-grid-auction">which has benefited by an unexpected extent from the new rules</a>.</p>

Wind is not the only renewable energy, there is hydro, micro-hydro plants using Archimedes screw can generate electricity from quit modest falls of water so could be useful all over lowland Britain, then there is wave power, bio power, tidal power, If you fixate on wind power so we will never be self reliant on clean energy.

Firstly, the guy who fixed my broadband called himself an 'engineer', it's a bit meaningless in the UK. Secondly, linking to a site called 'cleantechnica', is a bit like linking to the VW site to support an assertion that diesel engines are good for the environment.

we'd need about 40 of them to just replace the Drax units that are under threat).

Which is the certainty of the prediction, not the availability of wind.

And what do you do when your 95% certainty shows the wind falling away.... like it does on the 3rd to around 600MW total generation?

I've had a 2kW gennie sitting around for a few years, Raykalon - I've not got around to having an isolator installed to allow myself to disconnect from the local grid, though, to allow myself to keep supplied during a power cut.

Before the cuts how much renewable capacity was planned out?

I bought one of these last September on impulse (it was £60 in a clearance pile in the store). It works fine and ran the gas combi boiler and the fridge freezer okay though a tad on the noisy side! Guess I should invest in some deep cycle batteries and an inverter before next winter.

Out of intetrest, Griff, when do you think an offshore wind farm entering the planning stage today would be likely to start generation?



Author::::PatLogan
DateTime::::2016-03-01T14:23:55Z
AS a rule, EC, you can anticipate the cost of diesel generated power being 2-4 times that from a coal plant; on CO2 there's little to choose, but diesel is probably worse in terms of NOx, SOx etc - ironic given that reductions in those were the main objective of the LCPD. Apart from anything else, they have more local issues simply because they don't have a 100 metre high chimney stack...

The output of wind has been known to fall to 1%, or less, of nameplate capacity. That would only 135 MWe. For example: 4th Oct. 2015, from 2am to 4am [ref 2]. When this happens there's no guarantee we import replacement renewable energy from Europe because wind power throughout Europe often falls everywhere at the same time too. E.g. 8th Feb. 2013 [ref 1] The green movement and renewable energy companies have been spouting nonsense about renewable energy for decades. It's time you grew up and stopped believing in nonsense.1.

That's certainly no the case with the stuff that'd been retrofitted under LCPD, Griff - for example, Drax had undertaken a reblading of it's turbines across all six units, sufficient to give probably another 30 years of operation there. The plants I listed were all LPCD compliant to a greater or lesser degree.

Surely most coal plant was already going to close before 2025? The stuff which did not upgrade under the LCPD and has burnt through its permitted hours asap was never going to get to 2025...



Author::::EnviroCapitalist

It means that the owners of the remaining coal fired units won't bid them into the next capacity market auctions, and bring forward their closure even further.



Author::::PatLogan
DateTime::::2016-03-01T14:07:49Z
The implications of the NG forecast are worrying - it takes us into a place where the diesel plant secured under the capacity auction won't just be used intermittently for a few hours a year - it'll be running for extended periods. That's bad news in terms of both costs and emissions.

They did (in the 1990s, we built gas-fired capacity equivalent to about 45% of our peak demand), and they can - the main problem is, we've had increasing government interference in the operation of the market. Of which, the main example is mandating closure of coal-fired plant by 2025, and the guaranteed market access enjoyed by intermittent renewables.

If only Amber hadn't cancelled all the renewable Energy subsidies, there would be plenty of energy for all. Still on the other hand that would have driven the wholesale market price for electricity even lower and we can't have that now can we, it would drive the Fossil Fuel Dinosaurs & Atom Smashers out of business! :)
