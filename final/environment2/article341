After Fukushima: faces from Japan's tsunami tragedy, five years on

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>n 11 March 2011 a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the north-east coast of Japan and triggered a triple meltdown at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima">Fukushima</a> Daiichi nuclear power plant.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/five-years-after-japans-tsunami-orphan-victims-lament-their-lost-parents">Five years after Japan's tsunami, orphan victims lament their lost parents</a> </p>

<p>Almost 19,000 people died in the tsunami, while 160,000 people fled radiation in Fukushima. Five years on more than 174,000 survivors remain displaced, including almost 100,000 people from Fukushima who have yet to return to their homes.</p>

<p>But there are signs, too, that for some people life is returning to a semblance of normality.</p>

<p><em>To mark the anniversary of Japan’s worst disaster since the war, the Guardian met six people whose courage and determination has inspired other people across the disaster-hit region. From the mayor of a radiation-hit city who refused to leave, to a traumatised fisherman who now looks after his elderly neighbours – ordinary people who, in a few terrifying minutes, saw their lives transformed by catastrophe.</em></p>

<p><strong>Minamisoma</strong></p>

<p>It comes as little surprise to hear that Katsunobu Sakurai rarely looks out of his office window these days.</p>

<p>Five years ago he watched from the same window as massive tsunami waves crashed through rows of pine trees before tearing up farmland and homes in Minamisoma.</p>

<p>Sakurai had been the city’s mayor for just a few months when the disaster killed almost 500 of his constituents. The death toll, however, was just the beginning of Minamisoma’s agony.When the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, 25km (16 miles) south of the city centre, went into meltdown, all but 9,000 of Minamisoma’s 71,000 residents <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-radiation-minamisoma%20http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-radiation-minamisoma">voted with their feet</a>, leaving behind a ghost town bereft of people and essential services.</p>

<p>While his city ground to a halt, Sakurai stayed put. Clearly exhausted, he took to YouTube on 24 March 2011 to issue a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6URqs9kb20">plea for help</a>, subtitled in English, that reverberated around the world.<br/></p>

<p>Five years later the city’s population has recovered to around 57,000 and preparations are being made to allow residents to return to the abandoned neighbourhood closest to the nuclear plant.</p>

<p>Yet the community is far from normal. Many mothers and their children have stayed away, and the city’s kindergartens are half empty – even though, as Sakurai points out, radiation levels in the city are now lower than those in Rome.<br/></p>

<p>Last year Sakurai was re-elected in a landslide, while other local leaders were turfed out by voters who believe they have bungled their communities’ recovery. “I stayed even after everyone else had left,” said Sakurai, who credits his samurai ancestors with giving him the determination to carry on. “I think people appreciated that.”</p>

<p>There is still much work to be done. Just over half of the city’s 23,000 households have been decontaminated – a huge undertaking that is expected to cost as much as US$400m. “It’s a good job that <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a> is rich enough to do all of this,” he said, with obvious mischief.</p>

<p>His sense of humour disappeared when talk turned to the operator of the Fukushima plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). “My attitude towards Tepco hasn’t changed,” he said. “And the way Tepco goes about things hasn’t changed either. They simply won’t take full responsibility for what they’ve done.”</p>

<p>Despite the challenges, Sakurai, a veteran marathon runner, has witnessed the city’s slow ascent from despair during his regular runs. “We still have a long way to go,” he said. “But life today is heaven compared to the hell of March 2011.”</p>

<p><strong>Ofunato</strong></p>

<p>One of the most poignant <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://img01.ti-da.net/usr/field/%E9%99%B8%E5%89%8D%E9%AB%98%E7%94%B0s%E9%85%94%E4%BB%99%E9%85%92%E9%80%A0.JPG">images</a> of the immediate aftermath of the Japan disaster was of a bent and rusting sign pointing to the shattered remains of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://suisenshuzo.jp/">Suisen Shuzo</a> sake brewery in Rikuzentakata.</p>

<p>But for Suisen, regarded as one of Japan’s best sake brewers, the tragedy of the tsunami had only just begun, as it became clear that nine of the brewery’s 57 employees had died.</p>

<p>“When my father told the surviving staff a few days later that we would brew sake again, we knew he wasn’t just putting on a brave face,” said Yasuaki Konno, the son of Suisen’s president, Yasuhiko Konno.</p>

<p>True to Konno senior’s word, within months the firm was producing sake at the premises of a rival brewer, Iwate Meijo – one of countless examples of companies coming to the aid of stricken competitors after the disaster.</p>

<p>Now, with the help of government aid and donations from customers determined to resurrect their local brewer, Suisen is again making premium-quality sake at its new premises on a hill overlooking the nearby port of Ofunato. In 2014 it entered the US market with its first overseas brand, Kibo, which means “hope”.</p>

<p>“We’re originally a Rikuzentakata company but the water there was no longer good enough to produce sake,” said Yuki Murakami, a manager at Suisen, which formed 70 years ago after a merger between eight smaller breweries. The firm employs fewer staff, and production is at about 40% of pre-disaster levels.</p>

<p>For now, though, just the ability to turn rice into Japan’s national drink is enough for Yasuaki Konno. “We were about to start shipping out that year’s supply which we had made during the winter,” he said of the events of five years ago. “When I went back the next day and saw what had happened to the brewery, I couldn’t take it in.”<br/></p>

<p>Konno, who oversees the production of about 20 Suisen sake labels, said the brewery owed it to its customers to rebuild. “If we’d given up it would have been another piece of bad news for the town and our customers, many of whom had lost their homes.<br/></p>

<p>“If we hadn’t at least tried I don’t think we’d have been able to show our faces in Rikuzentakata again.”</p>

<p>He concedes that Suisen’s sake may have undergone subtle changes in taste due to its new premises. “Sake is not just a product – it’s an incredibly complex drink,” he said. “We’re still in the early stages of recovery, and it could be another 10 years before we’re truly out of the woods.</p>

<p>“But nothing can ever be as bad as the situation we found ourselves in five years ago. If we can get through that, we can get through anything.”</p>

<p><strong>Rikuzentakata</strong></p>

<p>Strange as it may sound, Kazuo Sato considers himself one of the lucky ones.</p>

<p>He lost his home in the tsunami that killed 1,700 people in his hometown of Rikuzentakata, but he, his wife, their three children, and his own parents survived. A former fishermen, he was left too traumatised to go back out to sea.</p>

<p>Today they all live in the same in a temporary housing complex in the grounds of a local junior high school that once served as an evacuation shelter.</p>

<p>Other couples with children have secured loans and moved on, leaving behind the Sato family and 100 or so residents whose average age is over 60; several are in their late 90s.</p>

<p>Sato’s 78-year-old father, Kichiro, is mending fishing nets in preparation for his first trip back out to sea since the tsunami, in search of whitebait. Before the disaster, the father and son would have gone fishing together. But the younger Sato won’t be joining his father this spring.</p>

<p>“I was a fisherman before the disaster,” said Sato, 50. “I tried to continue after the tsunami, but I kept having flashbacks and it was affecting me psychologically. I watched the tsunami arrive from the hillside, so I could see people trying to escape and hear their screams for help. But there was nothing I could do.”</p>

<p>Instead, Sato reinvented himself as a community leader, and now divides his time between chairing the residents’ association and working as a voluntary firefighter. He also helps the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.sakura-line311.org/english-information">Sakura Line</a> project to plant cherry blossoms in areas considered safe from tsunami.</p>

<p>His office at the top of a hill overlooking the temporary housing has become the first point of contact for residents with complaints about everything from leaky roofs to lack of privacy. On occasion he plays the role of peacemaker.</p>

<p>“There is no privacy here, which adds to people’s problems,” said Sato, who blames the stress of life as a displaced survivor for the minor stroke he suffered last year, aged just 49. “We often have to defuse arguments caused by complaints about noisy neighbours, or after people have had too much to drink.”</p>

<p>As the exodus of younger people continues, Sato’s biggest concern is the welfare of elderly neighbours who live alone, amid a recent rise in the number of solitary deaths in the disaster-hit region.</p>

<p>“We ask people to keep their doors unlocked so we can get inside quickly if we think something is wrong,” he said. Despite the cramped conditions inside poorly constructed prefab units, Sato says he is prepared to wait until he can raise enough money to build his family a new, permanent home.</p>

<p>“We live at the end of a row of units and our neighbours recently moved out, so we have more privacy. Compared with what many people have to put up with, we’re lucky.”</p>

<p><strong>Rikuzentakata</strong></p>

<p>Masaaki Shimanuki’s professional wishlist sounds much like that of any other doctor: new equipment, bigger premises, more staff.</p>

<p>But on the afternoon of 11 March 2011 the 73-year-old’s troubles were of an altogether different magnitude.</p>

<p>Shimanuki, a doctor in the internal medicine department at Iwate Prefectural Takata hospital in the coastal town of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/18/soy-sauce-japan-determination-tsunami">Rikuzentakata</a>, was in his consulting room when he felt the ground begin to shake.</p>

<p>The biggest earthquake in Japan’s recorded history had just struck the north-east coast, generating a huge tsunami that would reach Rikuzentakata just over 30 minutes later.</p>

<p>“Our priority was to help get our patients out of danger,” Shimanuki said during a break at the town’s only major hospital – a prefabricated replacement that was built on higher ground after the disaster. “We moved them up to the fourth floor, but even that wasn’t high enough.”</p>

<p>As the water level continued to rise, the only place left to take refuge was the hospital roof. By nightfall 11 of the hospital’s 51 patients – most of them elderly – had died, including four who succumbed to freezing temperatures on the roof. Nine staff also died.</p>

<p>Today, dozens of patients – all wearing obligatory flu masks – line the corridor outside Shimanuki’s office just minutes after the hospital has opened.</p>

<p>On a typical day the hospital’s five on-duty doctors and 30 nurses see 170 people, about a quarter of whom are still living in temporary housing.</p>

<p>Medical and administrative workers barely have time to draw breath; as soon as Shimanuki sees one patient, another joins the end of the queue. But in its organised chaos, Takata is at last beginning to resemble an ordinary hospital again.</p>

<p>“We never thought about giving up, even during those dreadful days after the tsunami,” Shimanuki said. “We received so much help from outside that we had no choice but to carry on. But if there is one thing I could have right now, it would be more doctors and nurses.”</p>

<p><strong>Koishihama</strong></p>

<p>Five years ago Jun Sasaki could have been forgiven for banishing all thoughts of returning to the sea to make a living.</p>

<p>After steering his boat back to port moments before the tsunami careered into the tiny fishing village of Koishihama, the fisherman and his family watched helplessly as the waves destroyed his scallop beds.</p>

<p>In a matter of minutes he had lost 1,000 tonnes of scallops, worth an estimated 50m yen (£311,000/US$440,000).</p>

<p>“When I saw the tsunami was withdraw back out to sea, I knew that it had taken all of my scallops with it,” said the 45-year-old, who was born and raised in the area.</p>

<p>Like so many people who lost their businesses in March 2011, Sasaki had no choice but to embrace the philanthropic spirit that would help his and other fishing communities through their darkest hours.</p>

<p>Within days 400 volunteer divers were working in shifts to clear the seabed of debris so Koishihahama could quickly rebuild its aquaculture industry. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://kizunafoundation.org/">Kizuna Foundation</a>, a non-profit business launched after the disaster, offered financial help.</p>

<p>“It was like getting a gentle push in the back, carrying us along,” said Sasaki, who by 2014 was producing as many scallops as he had done before the disaster. Now, he says, the water in the bay is even cleaner than it was before 11 March.</p>

<p>The village, framed by pine-covered cliffs, is attempting to attract more tourists through its famed oysters, scallops and sea pineapples.</p>

<p>“Fishermen all over the region are getting old, so we need to find other ways to keep the local economy going,” said Sasaki, who is head of the village’s 12-member scallop fishermen’s union. “We want this to be a place that attracts people who love great seafood.”</p>

<p>Inspired by the post-disaster volunteer effort, he obtained a diver’s licence so he could remove what little debris is left, and keep a closer eye on his livelihood.</p>

<p>“I love getting into the water now, even after what happened in 2011,” he said. “I can see the scallops for myself … and it goes without saying that they are the best in the world.”</p>

I live on the Colorado Plateau where I will receive a daily 'above average' dose of radiation of 1.2 µSv. I also live at 9000 ft. altitude which adds another 1 µSv per day. That's 803 µSv per year which is roughly 4X the lifetime exposure of a Fukushima resident. Moving to Fukushima would mean a lot less radiation and a lot more oxygen for me.

Welcome to a public education disaster brought to you media like the Guardian and NGOs like Greenpeace. Living in the vast majority of the Fukushima exclusion zone is no more risky than being a civilian nuclear plant worker; and studies have shown they don't experience statistically significant negative health effects.

Thanks for that facetious non-sequitur. So what you're saying is that if I'm not scared of 20mSv of radiation because I'm scientifically literate about radioactivity then I'm a hypocrite because I don't travel halfway around the world and join a clean up crew? What skunked-out mindset does that make sense in.

To be blunt, the answer is simply yes. Japan is a great place. It has problems like anywhere else obviously, lying politicians and bureaucrats are hardly unique to its culture. There are other issues too, like sexism and corporate culture, and their tough (but successful) education system.

I liked and admired Japan when I first visited some years ago. The people, the lifestyle, I thought were really nice. Reading news from afar, I now feel distaste for Japan's politicians and bureaucrats such as Tepco. That's very disappointing. When I went to Japan again a few years ago, I bought a newspaper: the editorial said that no minutes were kept of meetings that Tepco had had about the Fukishima disaster. The stories above show the compassion of ordinary people of Japan and that's nice but they are in striking contrast to the 'leadership' I now wonder about Japan : is it such a good place?

The only shame here is for the anti-nuclear crusaders who continue to spread their fear-mongering propaganda. Fukushima, after 5 years now, has become the best example yet for the safety of nuclear power. These people are showing the best of humanity, resilient and willing to work to rebuild their communities after a devastating natural disaster. All in the face of the hysterical NGOs and bloggers who, instead of using their funds to affirm the science and truly help these communities, unilaterally refuse to accept that most of Fukushima is now safe for people to return and rebuild their lives.

Thanks, Kirstie. I agree ... as you say, women have been instrumental in the region's recovery, and I regret not being able to include any in the profiles. All I can say is that we were in Tohoku for a very short time, covering a lot of ground, and had to take whatever came our way after requesting interviews at very short notice. I'll certainly bear it in mind for future coverage. Here are a couple of pieces that might interest you.

What? He is totally right though! The way that nuclear accidents are reported, you would think that they are constant time bombs ticking with a huge number of casualties to back that up, but the reality of it is that Nuclear is by far and away the safest and cleanest ways of generating energy. Sure, Nuclear incidents seem scary because the spectre of Chernobyl still hangs over the industry and rightfully, it should serve as a reminder as what can happen when the worst possible circumstances combine but only 3 such major incidents have happened since Chernobyl with a death toll that you can count on your hands. Absolutely every other energy source has a higher death toll associated with it. The impact on the environment from other sources is far more significant too, even when you take into account the exclusion zones. Coal and Oil for example are two of the chief contributors to the Beijing smog levels which are far more harmful that the exclusion zone could ever hope to be.

Just goes to show it is the fear of radiation rather than the radiation itself that is keeping people away. Hopefully this won't be like Chernobyl (though perhaps conservationists would like a national park to be created), once the fear subsides people will move back in and only a relatively small area around the plant will need to remain off-limits.
