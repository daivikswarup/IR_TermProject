Earth is warming 50x faster than when it comes out of an ice age

<p>Recently, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/08/sea-level-rise-could-last-twice-as-long-as-human-history">The Guardian reported</a> on a significant <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2923.html">new study published in Nature Climate Change</a>, finding that even if we meet our carbon reduction targets and stay below <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points">the 2°C global warming threshold</a>, sea level rise will eventually inundate many major coastal cities around the world.<br/></p>

<p><em>20% of the world’s population will eventually have to migrate away from coasts swamped by rising oceans. Cities including New York, London, Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Calcutta, Jakarta and Shanghai would all be submerged.</em></p>

<p>The authors looked at past climate change events and model simulations of the future. They found a clear, strong relationship between the total amount of carbon pollution humans emit, and how far global sea levels will rise. The issue is that ice sheets melt quite slowly, but because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for a long time, the eventual melting and associated sea level rise are effectively locked in.</p>

<p>As a result, the study authors found that due to the carbon pollution humans have emitted so far, we’ve committed the planet to an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters (5.5 feet). If we manage to stay within <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17051-humanitys-carbon-budget-set-at-one-trillion-tonnes/">the 1 trillion ton carbon budget</a>, which we hope will keep the planet below 2°C warming above pre-industrial levels, sea levels will nevertheless rise a total of about 9 meters (30 feet). If we continue on a fossil fuel-heavy path, we could trigger a staggering eventual 50 meters (165 feet) of sea level rise.</p>

<p>Predicting how quickly sea levels will rise is a challenge. However, two other studies just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2016/02/millennia-of-sea-level-change/">Antarctic ice sheet could melt more quickly than previously thought</a>, and thus contribute to relatively rapid sea level rise. Over the past century, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2016/02/millennia-of-sea-level-change/">global sea level has risen faster than at any time in the past two millennia</a>, and most of the recent sea level rise is due to human-caused global warming. Several feet of sea level rise this century is likely, with a possibility of 5 feet or more.<br/></p>

<p>The Nature Climate Change study didn’t just look at sea level rise; it also looked at global temperature changes. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://globalwarmingart.com/wiki/File:Ice_Age_Temperature_Rev_png">Earth’s sharpest climate changes over the past half million years </a>have occurred when the planet transitions from a ‘glacial’ to ‘interglacial’ period, and vice-versa. <br/></p>

<p>Right now we’re in a warm interglacial period, having come out of the last ice age (when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurentide_Ice_Sheet">New York City and Chicago were under an ice sheet</a>) about 12,000 years ago. During that transition, the Earth’s average surface temperature warmed about 4°C, but that temperature rise occurred over a period of about 10,000 years.</p>

<p>In contrast, humans have caused nearly 1°C warming over the past 150 years, and we could trigger anywhere from another 1 to 4°C warming over the next 85 years, depending on how much more carbon we pump into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>What humans are in the process of doing to the climate makes the transition out of the last ice age look like a casual stroll through the park. We’re already warming the Earth about 20 times faster than during the ice age transition, and over the next century that rate could increase to 50 times faster or more. We’re in the process of destabilizing the global climate far more quickly than happens even in some of the most severe natural climate change events.<br/></p>

<p>That rapid climate destabilization is what has climate scientists worried. It’s faster than many species can adapt to, and could therefore cause widespread extinctions, among other <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://skepticalscience.com/climate-best-to-worst-case-scenarios.html">dangerous climate change consequences</a>. Coastal flooding in places like Florida has already become <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/science/sea-level-rise-global-warming-climate-change.html">much more common than it was just 50 years ago</a>, and sea level rise is expected to keep accelerating.</p>

<p>As Aaron Goldner, one of the Nature Climate Change study authors told me, the next 10–20 years are critical in determining which path we follow. There’s a big difference between an eventual sea level rise of 1.7 meters and one of 9 meters.</p>

<p>The sooner we transition away from fossil fuels and cut our carbon pollution, the better we’ll be able to limit the climate destabilization and associated damages. It’s a sobering thought: our children, grandchildren, and future generations for hundreds, even thousands of years will feel the impacts of the choices we make over the next decade.<br/></p>

Both statements are correct, 20 x times faster warming is accounted for last 150 years.. But the trend has accelerated in last 40 years and is now 50 x faster. The really shitty part of the message is that warming has accelerated and we are still putting logs in the stove.

Question. If the Earth is heating 20-50 times faster than when coming out of an ice age (depending on what part of the article you read), would this then result in a greater rate of ice melt?

Hi Erik,

Like when one shows that the atmosphere is warming much slower than the models say they should.

The precise figures are for sure debatable, but I think the principle of what you are saying is correct.

I will admit that I think I probably overstated in the first comment. But again, there is an amplification effect related to all the issues I raised. The overall point, though, was related to how quickly this is going to affect Florida. An inch of SLR doesn't just mean the ocean has risen an inch closer in elevation relative to your hotel on the Miami coast. All the combined factors are going to put your property at severe risk well within the lifetime of existing structures, probably to the point that large portions of Florida are not going to be insurable.

In my original comment I was trying to keep the figures vague because I didn't know what exactly the rate of amplification would be. I don't think 4" turns into 4', though. I still don't know quite what the actual level of amplification is, but I've already cited a good list of papers that discuss amplification, so it's certainly not zero, as Kevin suggests. I think the slope issue is just another compounding element of the overall impacts.

There my be two (or more) positions, but the idea is that the science shows that one is correct...surely the debate succeeds if it allows open conversation (and open minds) to get to the answer that the science & observations shows...

You're welcome. Both quotes are from the abstract, reproduced completely below, from a discussion paper which I think is still undergoing peer review.

You first have to recognize the basic fact that in a debate there are two legitimate positions.

There is no legitimate position stating that AGW is not real and bad.

Water vapour has a greater effect..there is so much more of it than CO2.

Kev. Just google "tidal amplification."



Author::::paulwhiffen

Good question. From what I understand, this is about energy transfer as much as anything - so if the energy is being transferred at 20 - 50 times the rate then the ice will melt more quickly...?

Having a more powerful storm will generate a larger storm surge. That is not rocket science. That is also not what you said earlier. A higher sea level does not produce greater storms. A higher sea level does not produce a greater tide change - obviously it produces a higher tide, but if the sea level increases 1 foot and a normal high tide increases it by an additional foot, it will not now suddenly be 2.5 feet higher.

You need to clear on what you mean by two legitimate positions.

Perhaps just a greater rate of increase of rise rather than an ultimately higher rate.

Start adding these together, Kev. We get storms with lower pressure. We get storms covering a much broader area. We get higher wind speeds. We get higher high tides... The inches start adding up pretty quickly.

The deniers do seem to go to extremes it has to be said. Every time I think surely the evidence must change their minds, it doesn't - but I guess the issue is we aren't dealing with logic here.

I imagine that for every person that contributes to comments on articles there are 10 that simply read (and perhaps quite a few of these first time or occasional visitors) what we are saying - and I am trying to make the message as clear as possible to as many people as possible about the reality of what is happening.
