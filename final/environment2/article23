Canada’s post office could get a revolutionary green make-over




DateTime::::2016-03-09T17:31:08+0000



<p>The story has an air of inevitability. A rise in online communication has led to a inexorable decline of mail. Our local post offices, squeezed by the digital era, will soon be quaint outposts of a bygone era. What’s left to do but end door-to-door mail delivery, lay off postal workers, and hand over what remains to private companies?</p>

<p>This tale may be repeated endlessly by the media, but little of it holds true. The drop-off in mail, while accurate, has been offset by a pick-up in e-parcel delivery. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> Post remains profitable – bringing 1.5 billion in profits to the government in the last decade alone.</p>

<p>And its profits cannot capture another striking value: there are almost twice as many post offices as Canada’s ubiquitous coffee chain Tim Hortons. In its bricks-and-mortar scale, in the millions of its daily human interactions, the postal service knits together thousands of communities — a retail network unlike any other in the country. </p>

<p>Forget the notion that the post office has exhausted its purpose. We have scarcely begun to realize its potential.</p>

<p>The postal service may be roiled by a digital crisis, but it could be retooled to simultaneously address far more severe crises: rising inequality that has left millions overworked and indebted; climate-change delivering increasingly extreme weather; continuing injustices faced by Indigenous peoples; and an aging and increasingly isolated population.</p>

<p>A bold proposal <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.deliveringcommunitypower.ca">launched</a> last week by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers lays out how this reimagining would look. Their vision begins by transforming the post office itself: putting solar panels on its roofs and made-in-Canada electric vehicles on the roads, and installing charging stations outside. (Full disclosure: I was part of a team that worked with the postal workers on this plan.)</p>

<p>They wouldn’t rest at being a model of sustainability. They would offer the public the possibility of far more: the delivery of farm food to your home, checking in on elders, and promoting climate-friendly businesses. Most dramatically, they would also offer postal banking: affordable basic services as well as loans and support to start a renewable energy project at your home or in the community.</p>

<p> In many places, especially rurally, the post office already serves as a community hub; but now it could also help power a new economy. This is exactly the kind of transformative public services we need in an age of overlapping crises – fostering more caring communities and sustainable economic development, while helping bring down carbon emissions.</p>

<p>That this sounds faintly utopian is not a reflection of its lack of practicality. It is a reflection of how far to the right the political spectrum has shifted. In the last several decades we have been fed a steady diet of market fundamentalism: that public services are inefficient; the private sector knows best; and cuts, deregulation, and privatization will improve our lives. Today we can more easily imagine public services being remote and irrelevant than vital and vibrant. </p>

<p>Yet elements over each one of the policies the postal workers propose have been successfully implemented in other countries: food delivery to communities in France; electrification of postal vehicles in Norway; assistance to elders in Japan; and postal banking in Germany, New Zealand, Brazil and Italy.</p>

<p>Postal banking, however unexpected, is in fact straightforward: by offering simple deposits and withdrawals, loans and cheque-cashing through its 6300 postal outlets, the postal service <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.policyalternatives.ca/newsroom/updates/making-case-postal-banking-canada">would instantly become</a> Canada’s most accessible bank. This would be a boon to lower-income, unbanked or Indigenous people who are currently forced to rely on money marts and payday outlets. Infuriated by ATM withdrawal fees or cut-throat loan rates? So are millions of other Canadians.</p>

<p>Canada Post’s management, appointed by ex Prime Minister Stephen Harper, insists the obstacles to postal banking are “insurmountable”. Yet when reporters got their hands on a unpublicized internal study on the matter, it <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.blacklocks.ca/canada-postal-banks-win-win-secret-records-show/">showed</a> Canada Post had in fact reached the opposite conclusion: postal banking would be a “win-win” strategy. Imagine what might be possible: raising millions to subsidize mail delivery, unleashing community-owned wind and solar projects across the country, and providing stiff competition to the corporate banks, making banking much more affordable.</p>

<p>That hints at the real obstacle to this proposal: private profits. Canada previously had postal banking, but lobbying by the banks killed it in 1968. There’s a very good reason why the big banks would fight a plan to bring back postal banking: they <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thestar.com/business/2015/12/03/canadian-banks-earn-96-million-a-day-in-2015.html">made</a> $35 billion in profits last year alone.</p>

<p>The Harper government found other creative ways to undermine attempts to create more sustainable local postal-connected jobs. In 2009, the postal workers devised a plan to get their vehicles locally made. What did Harper do? He bought them from Turkey. Built for balmy weather, they promptly broke down. Today, there is an opportunity to buy electric vehicles being made in southern Ontario: the government should seize it.</p>

<p>While climate change and soaring inequality make these sorts of policies necessary, the current political climate in Canada make them perfectly practical as well. The new Liberal government has promised a review of Canada Post, has a new climate change plan in the works, and is preparing massive stimulus funding in the next budget. </p>

<p>We must demand the Liberals don’t simply throw money at projects that are shovel-ready – they need to be shovel-worthy. That means no expanded highways or pipelines that lock in a fossil fuel economy for several more decades – and it means saying no when Premiers like Christy Clark <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cknw.com/2016/03/03/province-pitches-massey-tunnel-replacement-as-green-infrastructure-project">pitch</a> ten-lane bridges as “green infrastructure”. It also means getting behind projects – like the postal worker’s ambitious plan – that accomplish everything the Liberals claim they’re for: respecting the rights of Indigenous peoples, bringing emissions radically down, and making the economy more equal and humane. </p>

<p>The prophecies about the postal service’s demise are premature. Forget what you think you know about Canada’s post office: it’s time for a revolutionary green make-over.</p>

Do I wish to be held hostage for food deliveries when there is a postal strike

The purpose of a post office is to deliver mail. Canada Post does it well, and at a profit.

Hope this doesn't spoil your day : " Imperial Oil Ltd. has unveiled plans for a $2-billion oil sands project that it says will harness new technology to cut costs and lower carbon emissions, a sign that the industry’s biggest players are making plans to revive growth despite sputtering crude prices."

Those darn unions, they want to pay the people who do the actual work!

The postal workers Union is more interested in creating jobs for themselves than improving service.

Trudeau and the liberals are a lot more radical than that, but no one wants to destroy the productive end of the economy.

This is a power play by the postal union. If Trudeau goes for it then it will be up to subsequent governments to clean up the mess.

Excellent article, at least wrt the ideas themselves and the concise analysis of why they seem so utopian.

Should be able to but there is a limit to contributions from groups andindividuals. The members would be encouraged to make their own taxdeductible donations.You get a better idea observing various protests round the country.CUPW is one of our more activist unions.

You can see how many are interested in this visionary by the numberof comments after 24 hours. He is a clueless, socialist, green fanaticfrom Montreal. The Guardian could have done better.The oil sands will not be going anywhere, no matter the government.

Are CUPW donations to political parties prior to federal elections available to the public to see under the freedom of information act? Inquiring minds what to know!

Should be many greenish articles ahead for this acolyte.We won't hear much about the oil sands for the next 4 years unless Harper is featured in the article.The Postal Workers Union doesn't actually run the Post Officeand they support the NDP.
