2015 smashes record for hottest year, final figures confirm




DateTime::::2016-01-20T15:30:26+0000



<p>2015 smashed the record for the hottest year since reporting began in 1850, according to the first full-year figures from the world’s three principal temperature estimates.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2016/2015-global-temperature">Data released on Wednesday by the UK Met Office</a> shows the average global temperature in 2015 was 0.75C higher than the long-term average between 1961 and 1990, much higher than the 0.57C in 2014, which itself was a record. The Met Office also expects <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/2016-set-to-be-hottest-year-on-record-globally">2016 to set a new record</a>, meaning the global temperature records will have been broken for three years running.</p>

<p>Temperature data released in the US on Wednesday by Nasa and by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration<em> (</em>Noaa) also showed 2015 shattered previous records.</p>

<p>Experts warned that the record-breaking heat shows global warming is driving the world’s climate into “uncharted territory” and that it showed the urgency of implementing the carbon-cutting pledges made by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-21-un-climate-change-conference-paris">world’s governments in Paris in December</a>.</p>

<p>Heatwaves have scorched China, Russia, Australia, the Middle East and parts of South America in the last two years, while climate change made the UK’s record December rainfall, which caused devastating floods, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/14/climate-change-made-record-uk-rainfall-in-december-more-likely">50-75% more likely</a>.</p>

<p>The Paris agreement commits the world’s nations to limit warming to below 2C compared to pre-industrial times, or 1.5C if possible, to avoid widespread and dangerous impacts. But the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/met-office">Met Office</a> data, when compared to global temperatures before fossil fuel burning took off, shows that 2015 was already 1C higher.</p>

<p>A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/elnino">strong El Niño event</a> is peaking at the moment, putting the “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/17/2016-set-to-be-hottest-year-on-record-globally">icing on the cake</a>” of high global temperatures. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> is a natural cycle of warming in the Pacific Ocean which has a global impact on weather. But scientists are clear that the vast majority of the warming seen in 2015 was due to the emissions from human activity.</p>

<p>“Even without an El Niño, this would have been the warmest year on record,” said Prof Gavin Schmidt, director at Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He said he expected the long trend of rising global temperatures to continue because its principal cause – fossil fuel burning – was also continuing.</p>

<p>“It is clear that human influence is driving our climate into uncharted territory,” said Prof Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit, which produces the temperature record – called HadCRUT4 – with the Met Office. Peter Stott, at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, said 2015 was the first year global average temperature was more than 1C above pre-industrial levels.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/global/201512">Noaa’s global temperature records</a> stretch back to 1880 and it also found 2015 was the hottest year yet, beating the previous high by a record margin. The agency also found December was warmer than any other month in the record, when compared to long-term averages. Ten of the 12 months in 2015 had record high temperatures for their respective months, according to Noaa.<br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-record-shattering-global-warm-temperatures-in-2015">Nasa’s new data for 2015</a> also shattered its previous record and showed 15 of the 16 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.<br/></p>

<p>“Climate change is the challenge of our generation,” said Nasa head Charles Bolden. “Today’s announcement is a key data point that should make policymakers stand up and take notice - now is the time to act.”</p>

<p> The Nasa, Noaa and HadCRUT4 temperature records all use independent methods to calculate the global average. They use many thousands of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/science/temp-records">temperature measurements</a> taken across the globe, on land and at sea, each day.</p>

<p>There are uncertainties in the measurements, partly due to fewer measurements in the polar regions, and these are included in the calculations. Stott said: “Remaining uncertainties are clearly much smaller than the overall warming seen since pre-industrial times.” Another independent temperature record, from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/gwp/temp/ann_wld.html">the Japan Meteorological Agency</a>, indicates 2015 was by far the hottest year on record.</p>

<p>Bob Ward, at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said: “This [record heat] should put pressure on governments to urgently implement their commitments to act against climate change, and to increase their planned cuts of greenhouse gases. The warming is already affecting the climate around the world, including dangerous shifts in extreme weather events. Those who claim that climate change is either not happening, or is not dangerous, have been conclusively proven wrong by the meteorological evidence around the world.”</p>

<p>Despite constantly rising greenhouse gas emissions trapping ever more heat on Earth, the last decade has seen relatively slow warming of air temperatures, dubbed a “pause” in climate change by some. In fact, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/nov/24/study-drives-a-sixth-nail-in-the-global-warming-pause-myth">global warming had not paused at all</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, natural climate cycles led to more of the trapped heat being stored in the oceans (which already absorbed most the heat), some of which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/06/earth-is-experiencing-a-global-warming-spurt">El Niño is now releasing</a>. Scientists usually assess changes in climate over decades, rather than years, and the each of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://go.nasa.gov/2015climate">last four decades has been warmer</a> than any decade on record before. </p>

<p>“It’s the long term warming trend we need to worry about rather than one hot year,” said Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds in the UK. “So we shouldn’t get too excited - but it is certainly a sign of things to come.”</p>

What an amusing story. A business man makes a bet on global cooling and then tries to get out of the terms of the bet on the grounds that he didn't understand it. This same former BT executive also parades his ignorance about climate as an "expert" advisor for a the think tank, "global warming policy foundation". About what you might expect from such a "Fink Tank": an academic advisor without understanding of the academic foundation of global warming, who advises on policy?

When I was kid in Sheffield in the '50s and early '60s, deep snow was a regular and welcome occurrence for 2-3 weeks, every winter, with no exceptions. The change is unbelievably obvious to anyone who's lived any length of time (though they might choose to deny it).

Your whole thesis is based on using very short periods of time, often picking the strongest El Nino so far recorded as a starting point.

You are still not understanding the concept of a calculated pause. It does not start at the 1998 El Nino year except by chance. If the pause were to last long enough, the starting date of it would move backwards to the previous year, then the one before that, and so on. I believe it did actually reach back to late 1996 at one point. I agree that to measure a trend both the 1998 El Nino and the following La Nina should be omitted. You then have a much lower trend from about 2000 onwards than in the 1990s. The 1998 El Nino marked a step change upwards in GMT, followed by an almost flat trend. However, none of this addresses the question of how much temperature rise can be attributed to CO2. To my mind that is the core problem, that the IPCC have overestimated climate sensitivity to CO2 forcing. There are about 7 peer reviewed and published papers that put sensitivity at between one fifth and one seventh of the IPCC value. I'm not saying they are right, but they certainly throw considerable doubt on it. If the IPCC had got it wrong, that would be an easy excuse for why the climate models were so wrong, but the IPCC and their crew are just too reluctant to give up the idea of catastrophic global warming. About one third of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the start of the industrial revolution were produced during that 18 years and 8 months, and you would expect a sharp temperature rise in response, and indeed the models reflected that. However the observed temperature rise is somewhat lower even on the ground station records. Why is it so hard for the so called warmists to see that if the observed data does not support the theory, the theory needs adjusting?

1. Makes no sense. What are you trying to say.2. I think you'll find, on balance, that people wear fewer clothes when it's hot. Unless you come from somewhere very strange.3. No I didn't say that did I. I implied that we would be eating more ice cream because it will be hotter. That happens you know.4. and 5. Debate clearly over.6. You obviously don't get science.

I don't know what konallis was suggesting, but carbon dioxide is mainly removed from the atmosphere by either being captured by a plant and chemically combined with water to form carbohydrates, or by chemically combining with eroding rocks and being incorporated into a different form of rock. These processes takes a very long time; some of the carbon dioxide being emitted today will still be in the air 500 years from now.

"There is no way one cannot deduct that the planet, oceans and atmosphere are not warming."I struggle with multiple negatives too - just invert them:"There is a way one can deduct that the planet, oceans and atmosphere are warming."Not quite the same meaning, but the sign is revealed.

Your selective choice of data sets simply demonstrates your desire to mislead by omitting the complete picture. Your link gives the impression something dramatic is happening in sea level rise in recent years. But how about looking at sea level rise over the past 100 years, which started well before CO2 could have had any impact. Also bearing in mind that the average sea level rise since the end of the last ice age is about 1m per century. Yes, the rate has dramaticly slowed down in recent centuries. But its clear a rise of 20-30 cm or so per century is anything but dramatic. The need to be deliberately selective and misleading in your selection of data and evidence only serves to demonstrate the absence of hard evidence.

The so-called pause is an artefact of the records, caused by picking the extraordinary year 1998 as a starting point.

I am aware of the whole satellite data set. In it's early years it agreed approximately with the ground station sets, and NASA proclaimed it the most accurate temperature data set available. When it became obvious that it was diverging, after a period of stunned silence, NASA set about trying to disown it. This has now culminated in a group of the most alarmist scientists posting a video on YouTube vilifying it. Such is the politics of climate change. The point is that though no data set is perfect, the satellite sets by their very nature are less prone to inaccuracy than the ground station sets, which are far more adjusted and therefore more likely to be affected by human error.I have no argument with the 30 year periods, and it will be interesting to see how the satellite sets work out for the period of 2000 to 2030, but of course we have to wait another 15 years for that. It will have the advantage of not including the 1998 peak.Regarding the 18 years and 8 months pause, this is not a cherry picked period. Why is it so hard to understand that it is calculated? It is quite a simple calculation. You start with the present day, then just count backwards as far as it is possible to go without any significant warming. As such it is a variable period, which is why the warmth of 2015 has lopped a month off it.
