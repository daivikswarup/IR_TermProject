The UK media reaction to 'toastergate' is hysterical and illogical




DateTime::::2016-03-01T10:40:10+0000



<p>Some Brits love to hate the EU, especially when the bureaucrats are going after things like kettles or toasters.</p>

<p>Last week was no exception, when old news resurfaced that one day the EU may gently show the door to the worst-performing kitchen equipment. There are no current EU rules for toasters and there was no real development.</p>

<p>But that didn’t stop the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6956600/Ukip-MEP-claims-the-EU-leaves-the-UK-and-his-TOASTER-powerless.html">The Sun</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jamieross/this-ukip-mep-wants-to-leave-the-eu-because-his-toaster-is-c#.elrNAMnnvK">others</a> going into overdrive for a story based on a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/DavidCoburnUKip/status/702797562827436032">tweet</a> from a Ukip MEP suffering from limp toast and a logic gap. </p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">My toaster takes 4 attempts before bread goes brown and can put. My Dundee marmalade on many thanks to EU</p>

<p>The irony is that if the EU was allowed to get on with its work, everyone would have crisp toast every time. It was all a merry dig at the EU, but the fallout is more serious. </p>

<p>Before toastergate there was ovengate, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2014/sep/04/will-banning-high-powered-kettles-and-hairdryers-help-climate-change-efforts">hairdryergate</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2014/sep/02/threat-to-vacuum-cleaners-daily-mail-energy-efficiency">vacuumgate</a>. This now-typical UK press reaction to sensible and sensitive EU product rules is a textbook case of cutting off our nose to spite our face. </p>

<p>Regardless of whether we stay in or leave the EU, every home is now certain to benefit from an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-products">average energy bill cut of more than £350 each year</a> from 2020 thanks to better appliances driven by EU minimum performance standards. They help cut energyreliance on the likes of Vladimir Putin and push our firms to create next generation products sold around the world, according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ecofys.com/files/files/fraunhofer-ecofys-2014-impact-of-ecodesign-energy-labelling-on-innovation.pdf">a recent study</a>.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30518649">Research from the BBC</a> shows that better appliances are at the centre of a 10% drop in UK energy use in the face of a growing economy. Last year the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.carbonbrief.org/five-ways-the-uks-electricity-grid-is-changing">National Grid</a> acknowledged that year after year, they are helping to keep the lights on, and it’s a similar picture in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://theconversation.com/why-is-electricity-consumption-decreasing-in-australia-20998">Australia</a>. </p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32009L0125">European rules</a> carefully guard against disruption to both consumers and businesses, so much so that they take years to craft, too many years in our view. So what’s not to like? That’s what the rest of Europe thinks as they look on at our media reports with bemused wonder.<br/></p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.coolproducts.eu/blog/media-vortex">vacuumgate debacle</a> is a great example of how we are punching ourselves in the belly for a laugh. Years ago, the EU decided to cap the power of vacuum cleaners because manufacturers had got themselves into a mad arms race, producing ever more energy-intensive machines with precious little bearing on performance. </p>

<p>Incredibly, vacuums from the 1960s were doing a better job for less power than their modern counterparts, according to a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7996416/Biggest-is-not-always-best-in-the-world-of-the-vacuum-cleaner.html">Telegraph story</a> from 2010 which, even more incredibly, actually praises Brussels. That didn’t stop the Telegraph <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/11047127/EU-rules-against-powerful-vacuum-cleaners-ban-best-models-Which-warns.html">letting rip</a>, along with the rest of the press, when the ban came in four years later. </p>

<p>After the dust had settled, evidence from market data specialists GfK suggested that just a year after the rules came into force, firms were competing to see who could market the most efficient product. That means year after year, you will be getting more bang for your buck.<br/></p>

<p>The public actually want this kind of action. A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://eciu.net/press-releases/2015/oven-energy-makeover-to-slash-1-1bn-from-brits-bills">survey</a> from the Women’s Institute suggests that nine out of 10 British consumers like energy efficiency measures because they help them save money. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_409_en.pdf">Pollsters</a> in Europe found that the same proportion of Europeans want their governments to do more on the issue. </p>

<p>Behind the scenes, despite the bullets whizzing overhead, the British government is quietly crawling forward, voting in favour of most of these policies because they make so much sense. They are spurred on by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/406225/defra-regulation-assessment-2015.pdf">research </a>(see p104) from the environment department showing that for every £1 they spend on such “red tape”, Brits and our businesses benefit from £3.8 in lower energy bills. Just like EU rules cutting roaming charges, product policies are a practical example of how Europe is making life easier for us all and should be something we get behind.<br/></p>

<p>So-called ecodesign isn’t perfect. We green groups and our friends in the consumer associations regularly criticise them. But this pales next to the hysteria from all shades of the UK press, a reaction that is posing a serious risking of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

No, you'll just end up with new appliances that aren't as effective as the old ones, and use just as much energy because you have to run them longer.

No, he is right, and you just proved his point, if 100,000,000 households use their toasters (and other appliances) twice a week and you can make the standards more efficient then that is a metric fuck tonnes (SI UNIT) of saving.

well actually given the amount of money that the EU funnels into things like cancer research it is far more likely that a cure for cancer would come from the EU rather than say from a UK exited from the EU.

Look at the vacuum case in the article - industry was in a mad arms race producing rubbish products until the standards came along. If standards came in for toasters and kettles etc, they'd all improve too.

A verbose way of saying nothing at all. I'm well aware of the differences between energy, power and efficiency, thank-you for patronising. I'm challenging the idea that there is anything to be gained in the design of a heating element warming a slice of bread.

Nothing to do with broadcast standards. SD and HD broadcasts are still viewable on the earliest HD panels and SD broadcasts are still compatible with all SD panels.

What standards have been changed exactly? Analogue was phased out over a long period and you can still use an analogue TV today with a set top box that costs less than a tenner. The digital standard has never changed. My flat screen TV is over 10 years old and still works fine.

Efficiency and power are different things. Less power for longer is the same energy; engineering more efficient browning, or energy transfer, would be the target.

This presumes that without the glorious wonderfulness of the EU's selfless regulators, the government of the UK would be far too thick to come up with regulations of its own.

...on energy issues and wastage.. the amount of flatscreen TV's hitting the skips simply because networkers and broadcasters permanently messing with the standards, is effectively swindling the population by creating incompatibility, so they purchase new ones. It is an utter scandal.. I see perfectly sound flatscreens of only a few years old piled in the skips. ....and worse that's throughout the EU too. It's become cheaper to ditch rather employ anyone to re-do, whereas a humble toaster can sit in the kitchen for decades and used only minimally.

If people in the UK, and in the US as well, would just get on with the job of designing and building better appliances, rather than screaming about bureaucrats and their energy regulations, industry in both nations would take off, and both nations could return to a position of world leadership in the design and production of quality goods built in country.

I'm not sure how you can say that the Guardian has been silent on the matter with a straight face: it has featured in at least one news item in every month since August 2014! They've even included the quote from John McDonnell that presstheredbutton mentioned to "modern day serfdom".

Unless the energy you use has no carbon footprint then the act of consuming more energy through the use of inefficient devices will cause more global warming. Sorry its not your planet to do with how you wish. We all share this planet.

Energy efficiency shouldn't be mandated, especially not by the EU of all people. If I want some horribly inefficient device I should be allowed, as I pay my electricity bill, and if anyone wants to regulate my usage it should be part of the contract between me and my provider.

Some toasters can be made more efficient. Many more designs can be made lower power to meet the law but perform even worse than before and end up as junk wasting far more energy. It is notable that the article ignored the flawed move to ban high powered kettles, the most energy efficient of which burn the most power.

Essentially a low powered kettle will use the same power as a high powered one; you just have to wait longer. The EU must know this, so it makes me wonder if the media are reporting the kettle story correctly.
