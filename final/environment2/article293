Supreme court to block Obama's sweeping climate change plan




DateTime::::2016-02-10T00:08:07+0000



<p>The supreme court agreed to block Barack Obama’s clean power plan on Tuesday, raising fears that the centrepiece of his climate change plan could be overturned.<br/></p>

<p>The unexpected decision creates instant uncertainty about the future of Obama’s climate plan and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points">historic global agreement</a> to fight climate change reached in Paris last December.<br/></p>

<p>The White House registered its immediate disapproval, and said in a statement that the administration would continue taking “aggressive steps” to reduce climate pollution. “We disagree with the supreme court’s decision,” the White House said.</p>

<p>But officials told reporters in a conference call that they remained confident this was a “bump in the road”, and that the plan would prevail.</p>

<p>The officials also said Obama had been briefed and would speak on the decisions soon.</p>

This doesn't bode well | Scott Lemieux</a> </p>

<p>The surprising vote by the justices put a temporary freeze on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/02/obama-to-hit-us-power-plants-with-tougher-than-expected-emissions-cuts">cutting carbon emissions from power plants</a> until the Washington DC circuit court of appeals hears challenges from 29, mainly Republican-led states, and dozens of corporations and industry groups. Arguments are scheduled for 2 June. <br/></p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/020916zr3_hf5m.pdf">5-4 decision for a stay </a> came as a shock to the EPA and environmental campaign groups, and was widely seen as a sign that opponents of the power plant rules have made a strong argument against the plan.<br/></p>

<p>“We’re disappointed the rule has been stayed, but you can’t stay climate change and you can’t stay climate action,” said Melissa Harrison, an EPA spokeswoman. “We believe strongly in this rule and we will continue working with our partners to address carbon pollution.”</p>

<p>Margie Alt, the director of Environment America, said in a statement: “This decision is a huge loss for our kids’ future and for all Americans who care about the health of our planet, and a huge win for the polluters and the deniers.” She added that she hoped it would only be a temporary setback.<br/></p>

<p>“It is not what we had hoped for,” Joanne Spalding, senior climate counsel for the Sierra Club, said. “We are disappointed.”</p>

<p>Opponents of the EPA rules – who had described the clean power plan as a “war on coal” – said the stay was an indication the carbon-cutting regulations would eventually be overturned.</p>

<p>West Virginia, one of the states leading the legal challenge, said it was thrilled at the outcome.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake – this is a great victory for West Virginia,” Patrick Morrisey, the state’s attorney general, said in a statement. </p>

<p>The main lobby group for the coal industry claimed the decision indicated the supreme court<strong> </strong>was leaning in their favor on the broader legal challenge.<br/></p>

<p>“We are pleased the supreme court took this unprecedented step to protect the states from further economic harm while the courts are deciding whether the administration’s power plan is unlawful and unconstitutional,” said Mike Duncan, president of Americans for Clean Coal Electricity. “The stay is a signal the supreme court has serious concerns with the power plan. We’re optimistic the power plan will ultimately be rejected.”<br/></p>

<p>Republicans in Congress claimed the stay was a rebuke to Obama’s use of his executive powers to fight climate change, in the absence of any legislative efforts. “Today’s decision by the Supreme Court is an important step toward reining in the Obama administration’s unprecedented abuse of executive power,” Deb Fischer, Republican Senator from Nebraska, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The plan was a linchpin of Obama’s climate agenda and was critical to the administration’s efforts to persuade nearly 200 countries to rally around the Paris agreement.</p>

<p>The rules were the first ever cutting climate pollution from power plants – the single largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the US. They called for reducing carbon emissions from power plants by about one-third by 2030.</p>

<p>Obama and US officials have been adamant in their discussions with world leaders that the power plant rules would withstand legal challenges, and would come into force even if a Republican wins the White House next November.</p>

<p>The United Nations had invited world leaders to a signing ceremony on 22 April to finalize the agreement, and spur further action to cut emissions. White House officials said last month that they expected to unveil further climate actions in the lead-up to the ceremony. </p>

<p>Campaign groups insisted that the reasons for the stay would have little to no bearing on the case itself – and expressed confidence that the EPA ultimately would prevail. “The bottom line is that they still need to look closely at the case,” Spalding said.</p>

<p>Under the schedule set out by the EPA when it unveiled the rules last summer, states had until September to submit their plans for cutting emissions from power plants. Many of the states suing the EPA had been working on their plans. </p>

<p>But that schedule was now put in doubt by Tuesday’s decision – which raises the prospect that states may not finish their plans before Obama leaves the White House.</p>

<p>What happens next is that states can call pause on that work while the lower court considers arguments about the EPA’s authority to limit carbon pollution from power plants. </p>

<p>White House officials said the plan had been constructed to allow for such legal delays. States do not have to submit their final plans until 2018, and the rules do not come into force until 2022. “That glide path gives states and utilities ample time to get their plans in place, and that continues to be the case notwithstanding the decision today,” the officials said in the conference call. </p>

<p>But the decision was nevertheless a blow to the administration’s repeated claims that the rules were at little risk from the courts.</p>

<p>Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, had frequently expressed confidence that the EPA could beat back any legal challenge, citing previous supreme court decisions upholding the agency’s authority to cut carbon emissions.</p>

<p>The EPA had also chalked up a number of other legal victories against industry groups to block air pollution and other rules.</p>

<p>But the stay had shaken some of that confidence, and injected uncertainty into the energy transformation that was already taking place on the ground – even in the absence of the power plant rules.</p>

<p>America’s use of coal for electricity fell to an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/us-electricity-industrys-use-of-coal-fell-to-historic-low-in-2015-as-plants-closed">all-time low</a> last year, and about 5% of coal-fired power plants were shut down. Most of that electricity was replaced with fracked natural gas, but wind and solar energy was also coming onto the grid.<br/></p>

<p>“Today’s supreme court decision is a major setback,” said Gregory Wetstone, the president of the American Council on Renewable Energy. “But this is not the end of the story ... There is every reason to anticipate that, in the end, the court will affirm that the Clean Air Act does indeed provide authority to address the greenhouse emissions that are changing the global climate.”</p>

Same simple reason the US never got into a nuclear war with the USSR: Mutually Assured Destruction. In order to maintain their legitimacy and authority, Supreme Court Justices cannot be fired, by anyone, unless some sort of malfeasance can be proven (and no, making decisions with which you disagree does not constitute malfeasance).

As this story develops, it’s clear that because the Supreme Court voted along partisan lines rather than providing arguments against Obama’s climate plan – especially, which is unprecedented, before the lower court had a chance to even review it -- it was a political decision supporting vested fossil fuel interests.

The current level of CO2 is 0.05%. It has not risen appreciably over the last few decades. Icepilot74 is correct. Any catalytic/enzyme reaction has an equilibrium. If CO2 levels rise, then the rate of photosynthesis will also rise to take advantage of this. Current O2 levels are c. 20%. In prehistoric times they were up at 30%, thus allowing insects to grow much larger - some dragonflies had 2ft (60cm) wing spans.

Thank you Mountain Climaber. I went to COP21 as an NGO observer, and when I got back to Canada I found that the media had NOT been reporting very much about the biggest meeting of nations since the !948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 40,000 people. So I made a documentary that shows both sides of the issue as to whether the COP21 agreement, miraculously signed by all 195 countries, is sufficient or not.My documentary is freely available and reflects my background as a writer and as a science information specialist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqchwR9eYts

Those of us here in Germany knew at the outset that there would be a temporary rise in CO2 output. The "very bleak results" have been way better than originally forecast and the prospect of being the world leader in low CO2 emissions is proceeding ahead of schedule. You are in the sad position of being either intentionally misleading or ignorant.

Well put. When the Cheney Administration was feverishly issuing executive orders, all the wingnuts now howling and wailing and rending their garments over Obama's perfectly legal exercise of executive power, were confidently defending the idea of the "unitary executive," the idea that the prez can set aside laws that attempt to limit his power over national security, which pretty much means any law at all. There is no hypocrite like a wingnut hypocrite.

Safety is paramount, but not unbounded. Building the foundation for an ordinary diesel generator using the same stringent parameters as for a nuclear plant will make it extraordinarily safe, but will be the wrong way to look at safety. As Mark Steyn said, the way to control flooding from the sea at Miami Beach is to build flood barriers like on the Thames in London, not go for the carastrophic solutions proposed by the Alarmists. Safety is adequately addressed, at a reasonable cost. Projects cannot splurge in the name of safety, or for that matter, in support of ideology.

"The main lobby group for the coal industry claimed the decision indicated the supreme court was leaning in their favor on the broader legal challenge." Just because they give the law the opportunity to be heard doesn't mean the courts are siding with the polluting industries! I recall the arguments from the time of Acid Rain and they were almost identical to the industries challenge now! We can't, it costs too much, takes too long to comply and so on were the same as today! Billions of cubic tons of natural gas available, so why keep trying to pollute the air with the antiquated coal burning process!"The plan had been constructed to allow for such legal delays. States do not have to submit their final plans until 2018, and the rules do not come into force until 2022." “That glide path gives states and utilities ample time to get their plans in place."

Japan has started a programme to build coal fired power plants. On 'convergence of evidence' , look at the nature of light. One set of phenomena can be explained by the particle theory of light, and if one were look at only those phenomena, then, wave theorists would be sceptics. But, I am not a denier. I am only arguing that you should have engineering solutions and technologies to address the disastrous vacuum in power when all coal plants are shut down. Listen to the Chief of Drax Power today - the UK's aim of shutting coal based generation by 2025 is impracticable. People who do not agree with the IPCC's manufactured consensus include the 1973 Nobel Laureate in Physics Iver Giaever. Nobel laureate 2005 Thomas Schelling has argued technology change and adaptation are the most effective ways to tackle climate change. The world's leading Atmospheric Scientist, Prof Richard Lindzen has an anti-alarmist stance. You cannot ignore all these guys. Other 'Nobel' pretenders like Michael Mann project catastrophic scenarios with exaggerated hockey sticks. So this convergence means nothing if it ignores genuine scepticism - only in religion is ignoring and suppressing scepticism allowed, and in fact encouraged and perpetrated. The more Climate Alarmists do this, the more they resemble the Catholic Church of the dark ages.

If you know how this works, then you know that it is extremely unusual for the court to rule on something BEFORE the appeals court. Ipso facto all this rigamarole about constitutional law goes out the window. The Right side of the court just decided for political reasons (not constitutional ones) to try and preempt Obama's policy. By the way, a rant is a preachy, long winded, self-serving diatribe usually showing little sense of nuance.

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) & Photosynthesis are the foundation of Life on Earth. Plants/plankton turn Sunlight/CO2 into Food/Oxygen. Neither animal nor blade of grass would exist, absent CO2. Increasing CO2 lengthens growing seasons & encourages plants to move higher in altitude & Latitudes; just as it helps to shrink deserts, plants using water more efficiently. Rising temperatures also lengthen growing seasons, help babies of nearly every species, increase net rainfall & save lives; because cold kills. The Earth is greener, more fertile & life sustaining than it was 40 years ago.

The Supreme Court did the right thing in letting the matter work its way through the court system. That's one of its jobs: maintaining both the rule of law and due process, no matter how important the matter may be.We have a legal system. If we don't use the legal system or ignore it, then we might as well not have the legal system. Let the appropriate Court decide first, before we do something we may have to dismantle and go back to square one with. Yeah, it will take time but if we don't support the law, we might as well not have laws.I expect that the President's plan will pass and be declared legal and binding, by the way.

You don't seem to understand how a representative democracy, or the Supreme Court. An election is not required for the president to act in his/her role as chief executive. The presidency is the only nationally elected office. Obama has every right, and even an obligation, to act when he believes it is required to execute his duties. Congress, of course, has every right to push back. The role of the SCOTUS is to judge the constitutionality of actions by, among others, the other two co-equal branches of government. A challenge is fine, though I fear the rightward bias in the court will result not in the interpretation of constitunality but new ways to restrict this president. It will be interesting to see the turnabout if/when another Republican president.
