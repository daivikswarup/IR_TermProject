France's oldest nuclear plant to close this year




DateTime::::2016-03-08T10:31:46+0000



<p>The French environment minister, Ségolène Royal, said on Monday that work will begin this year to shut down the country’s oldest nuclear power plant, at the centre of a row with neighbouring Germany and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland">Switzerland</a>. <br/> <br/>In doing so she implicitly contradicted a Green party minister who had said on Sunday that the process to close the Fessenheim plant in Alsace would be completed, rather than merely started, by the end of the year. <br/> <br/>The two ministers spoke to the French media after a row sparked on Friday when Germany demanded that France close down Fessenheim following reports that a 2014 incident was worse than earlier portrayed. <br/> <br/>Royal said on the TF1 television channel that shutting down a nuclear reactor “is not just turning off a tap” and involved not only time-consuming official paperwork but careful decommissioning under strict safety conditions, along with collateral issues such as the question of job losses. <br/> <br/>“A nuclear plant like Fessenheim employs 2,000 people,” she explained, saying the site could eventually be converted for renewable energy, or maybe a car factory. <br/> <br/>On Sunday France’s housing minister, Green party member Emmanuelle Cosse, had said that closing Fessenheim this year was “the timeline ... the president [François Hollande] has repeated to me several times”. <br/> <br/>“The process of stopping a reactor is simple enough,” she added. <br/> <br/>France’s Nuclear Safety Agency has said that safety at the plant was “overall satisfactory” but that the government’s energy policy “could lead to different choices” regarding the facility, which is near the German and Swiss borders. <br/> <br/>It said there was “no need” to shut the plant from a nuclear safety point of view. <br/> <br/>France has promised to cut reliance on nuclear energy from more than 75% to 50% by shutting 24 reactors by 2025, while stepping up reliance on renewable energy. <br/> <br/>Fessenheim, located on a seismic fault line, has worried French, German and Swiss environmentalists for years. <br/> <br/>In September, Hollande said the plant, in operation since 1977, would not be shut this year, contrary to a 2012 campaign promise, because of delays in completion of a new plant in northern Flamanville. <br/> <br/>On Sunday, Cosse said that to reach its target, the government would have “to close other nuclear plants, other reactors, obviously, over several years.” <br/> <br/></p>

France is a net importer for traded electricity from Germany since many years, without German power exports the lights would have gone out many times in France.

Wouldn't it be a win-win-win situation if Fessenheim were left open and the far more dangerous coal-fired power plants just over the border on Karlsruhe & Mannheim were closed instead?

You'll find that those Wikipedia contributors (here the French  and the German article) have taken this report into account, only they didn't limit their scope to a single source of information. As for the Autorité de sûreté nucléaire, I'm wondering what makes you think that they are any more independent, objective or competent in their judgment than their Japanese colleagues (NISA) who so disastrously misjudged the risks posed by the Fukushima reactor?

That's a relief. If they announced they were closing down their newest nuke plant I would really start to worry because after all these years of running nuclear reactors they should have learned something about doing the job right.

There's no comparison. If you run the numbers you'll see. Don't get me wrong. Nuclear has its own problems, huge ones, but it gets the job done immeasurably cleaner than other methods.

"Over the last fifty years, nuclear energy has proven to be the safest and most efficient of all energy sources, from both the human health and environmental perspectives. In total, to produce a trillion kWh of electricity, nuclear takes less land, uses less steel and concrete, has less emissions, kills fewer people, and has lower life-cycle costs than any other energy source."http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2015/07/07/what-about-nuclear-power-isnt-good/http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/89162_5_.gif"History suggests that nuclear power rarely kills and causes little illness.

France’s Nuclear Safety Agency has said that safety at the plant was “overall satisfactory” but that the government’s energy policy “could lead to different choices” regarding the facility, which is near the German and Swiss borders.

If they're forced to, they could transfer the Gravelines plant to the UK. 5GW for a fraction of the cost of Hinkley. It would though highlight the idiocy of the policy.

More information on Fessenheim (from French and German Wikipedia):The powerplant is situated on a seismic faultline (Oberrheingraben). According to Swiss studies, earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 to 6.5 occur about once in 100 years, earthquakes of 6.5 to 7.0 once in a thousand years (case in point being the earthquake that destroyed Basel in 1356, the strongest earthquake ever registered in Northwestern Europe). This is far less strong than the Fukushima earthquake (9.0), but Fessenheim would be much nearer to the epicenter (being right on the faultline). The foundations of the powerplant are 1.5 m thick (the thinnest foundations of all French nuclear powerplants; Fukushima's foundations were 7 m thick). It is built next to the Grand Canal of Alsace without sufficient protection against a dam break (the canal being subjected to seismic risks just as well). It sits on the Upper Rhine aquifer which supplies about 3 million people with drinking water. In a radius of 30 km live a population of 930,000 (among them, my parents).I won't be sorry when it's gone... if it finally happens (French politicians have been promising it for years).

It's unclear whether the shutting down of these old nuclear power plants is able to replace them with newer and much safer nuclear plants or if it's a concentrated effort to get away from nuclear power altogether. I just hope they don't replace nuclear power in France with burning of fossil fuels for generating electricity as that would be much worse.

So that's a 40 year lifespan and it only eventually succumbed to the ideological witchhunt. Even the lobbyists don't claim that sort of figure for renewables. Well done and thanks to the workers at Fessenheim.

Just to add some technical context to the discussion, on the INES accident scale (1-7) it was originally graded 0 but subsequently upgraded to 1. A similar incident at a Bulgarian reactor rated 2.The incident was initiated by water damage to some control systems, which initiated the shutdown of the reactor by boron injection. Cover up - probably. Serious - yes in terms of economic loss and cost of restart. Dangerous - once the boron was injected - absolutely no.

What I said was that corruption was rife at TEPCO, obviously the tsunami was the trigger for the malfunction of the cooling system, but if you read up on it you will find out that TEPCO is responsible for the actual failure of the cooling system.They changed the piping of the emergency cooling system during construction, which allowed for both generator rooms to be flooded, this was a clear violation of the building permit.Later (1991) the generators got flooded and they didn't fix it properly, and then in 2007 they did an in house tsunami study and chose to ignore their own advise to enhance the sea wall because 10 metre tsunami waves were considered unrealistic.

The only criticism that the ASN raised over Fessenheim was that it believed the containment floor was insufficiently protective, in the event of meltdown that breached the reactor bottom-head.

Or Fukushima, try go and ask how the tens of thousands of displaced people felt about losing their homes. You probably just don't care enough for others.
