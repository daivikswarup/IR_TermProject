After the rain, as the sun sets, the bullfinches come out of hiding

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> song thrush celebrates the ending of the afternoon rain with repeated <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.xeno-canto.org/26981">trills, scales and whistles</a>. In the trees either side of the footpath, other birds join in the wall of bird song – warbling dunnocks, tinkling goldfinches and stuttering chaffinches. Greenfinches add their harsh falling notes. Groups of midges hover above the woodland track. It’s the first time I’ve seen the flies in these numbers; another sign that plentiful food is emerging in time for the birds’ breeding season.</p>

<p>I reach the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/Images/pulborough-brooks-map_tcm9-264987.pdf">Hanger viewpoint</a> overlooking the brooks that line the River Arun. Wigeon quietly whistle and wander among the pools in the fading light. Excitable <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/l/lapwing/index.aspx">lapwing</a> flap and loop above them, calling “pee-woot”, but even they are settling down now as evening approaches.</p>

<p>A bright pink spot flashes above the brambles in the gloom. A handsome male <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/b/bullfinch/index.aspx">bullfinch</a>, with a velvet black cap and bright pink chest and underparts, is plucking hungrily at the remains of berries. There’s a soft mush of chewed food gathering along the edge of his beak as he eats. Below him, a duller black, brown and soft pink female is also feeding hurriedly.</p>

<p>It’s remarkable to see these thick-set finches, so conspicuous now, and think that this is a relatively rare treat, especially in spring and summer. Occasionally, while driving along the lanes, you may see a black and white tail disappear into the roadside hedge, but they’re nervous birds that prefer to remain hidden in dense vegetation, only giving away their presence with a soft, plaintive whistle. Although common in Sussex – their population here is static – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bto.org/about-birds/bird-of-month/bullfinch">bullfinches have been declining</a> in south-east England, possibly from a loss of the dense, mixed vegetation they prefer.</p>

<p>The low sun emerges briefly from the cloud, and the bullfinches’ moist black beaks glisten.</p>

<p>I hear splashing in the brooks below, and look down to watch a small herd of dark brown fallow deer run out across the flooded grass. They upset a pair of shoveler ducks, which fly up and in turn disturb two irritated lapwing. It’s only then that I notice the young peregrine falcon, perched in a tall tree, also watching.</p>

I am lucky to see one every 5 years or so, but what a buzz when I do!

Fifty years ago our Sussex garden was home to numbers of Bullfinches. Sadly, I've not seen one for many years now.

Beautiful, beautiful birds. A joy to behold.

Thanks for this article especially the descriptions of bird song and sound.Your Bullfinches, were they calling? Have you heard any singing from this species this year? I haven’t.You say they have declined across Sussex but fortunately Bullfinches have maintained steady numbers here at Midhurst over the last quarter of a century. What does vary is how vociferous they are from year to year. It’s a puzzle.That impression is based on simple statistics generated from counting the amount of song and calls across various common species in a fixed time frame on a dog walking transect. The data flows from the spring, summer, autumn and winter soundscapes.It’s a good way to ‘add value’ to those canine creatures of habit – a kind of ‘two for the price of one’ exercise.
