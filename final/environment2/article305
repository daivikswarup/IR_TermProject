How green is online shopping?




DateTime::::2016-02-17T12:13:25+0000



<p>On the surface, shopping online seems good for the environment: it eliminates car trips and associated carbon emissions.</p>

<p>But what about the emissions from fleets of delivery vehicles bringing orders to houses? Delivery trucks also contribute substantially to the burden of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, in the air, which is associated with many effects on human health.</p>

<p>Relatively little research has thoroughly traced the effects of online shopping on transportation networks. But a recent study in Newark, Delaware suggests that the knock-on effects of online shopping may worsen traffic congestion and transport-related carbon emissions.</p>

<p>Researchers at the University of Delaware conducted a survey of downtown Newark residents’ shopping habits and preferences and used the responses to calculate the quantity of goods purchased through home shopping.</p>

<p>They also got information from delivery companies about the number of trucks on the road and the number of packages per truck, and used this to determine how many delivery trucks are required to distribute home shopping purchases.</p>

<p>Finally, the researchers used transportation simulation software and data from local transportation authorities to determine the effect of delivery trucks on the transportation network, focusing on an area of downtown Newark that includes a portion of the university’s campus.</p>

<p>They conducted similar analyses in 2001, at the dawn of the online shopping era, and again in 2008. They reported their results <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13504509.2015.1124471?journalCode=tsdw20">in a recent paper</a> in the International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology.</p>

<p>Curiously, the 2008 data suggested that home shopping in Newark had grown by only 14.8% since 2001. That’s much less than the researchers predicted in their earlier study. It also contrasts with data from other researchers showing that internet shopping increased six-fold between 2001 and 2011.</p>

<p>The researchers don’t offer any explanation for their unexpected finding. However, a large proportion of their survey respondents were university students, and the convenience of internet shopping may appeal more to people who are running a household.</p>

<p>Also, it’s significant that the researchers’ latest data are from 2008, which suggests that if anything their study underestimates the effect of home shopping on the transportation network.</p>

<p>In any case, the researchers found that even though home shopping by residents of Newark grew more slowly than anticipated, traffic in 2008 was worse than they had predicted.</p>

<p>An increase in the number of home shopping purchases increases travel time, traffic delays, and vehicle emissions of the transportation network as a whole, the researchers say.</p>

<p>While some previous studies suggest that e-commerce is associated with lower carbon emissions than traditional retail, other researchers have warned of a “rebound effect,” which occurs when gains in efficiency merely stimulate new consumption. Something similar may be going on in Newark, the results suggest.</p>

<p>“We found that the total number of vehicles miles travelled hasn’t decreased at all with the growth of online shopping,” says study leader Arde Faghri, professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of the Delaware Center for Transportation. “This suggests that people are using the time they save by shopping on the internet to do other things like eating out at restaurants, going to the movies, or visiting friends.” </p>

but there is NOTHING people can do,

Yes. Have you tried using transport simulation software? It's quite involved if you want to get realistic results. And this is definitely science. It's often slow.

Stop getting lost in consumerism.Go on a walk around the houses and meet other humans.

An article on this same report in ScienceDaily, 5 February 2016. http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160205135418.htm quotes one of the study authors, Ardeshir Faghria, saying:

NOTE to GUARDIAN EDITORS: When publishing the 'results' from any new study could you please tell us who funded the study, or alternatively who funded the people conducting the study.

Give this crap a rest will you. People are sick of all the scare campaigns.

You're not the only one, I know exactly what you mean. I'm not housebound at the moment, but I have serious mobility problems and can't carry things due to RA in nearly all of my joints. I have no idea how disabled people coped before internet shopping; if I didn't have my groceries delivered I'd be completely stuck.All very well to have principles but practicalities have to come first!

It may not be green but, for me, it's a lifeline. I'm housebound, totally unable to go shopping. Online lets me choose my own groceries, have them delivered when it suits, gives me more independence and saves me having to impose on others. Frankly I don't know how I'd manage without it. I'm sure I'm not the only one in this situation.

But if you are anything like my sister and family this also means that you buy more stuff.

Yes, but the study showed that people are still driving, only not to the supermarket so much.

Depends where you live. I used to jump in the car and drive 12 miles to the nearest town for something I sometimes couldn't find. Now I use Amazon and it arrives tomorrow. And going to Amazon through Easygiving raises 1-2% for a charity of my choice. Not tax, I know, but better than nothing.

Fleets of delivery trucks . When one truck is used it carries orders for ( say ) 20 deliveries . Therefore one truck only belches out carbon monoxide for one vehicle rather than that of 20 cars , even though those deliveries take in an area .

Pollution implications though runs a surprising risk of less transparency. You end up getting lots of accounting tricks to hide the real emissions. I mean the guitar he bought from Germany sometimes even starts off as parts in China. (mightn't be true for guitars I am not familiar with that industry sector) perhaps having originated in Brazil.

The main reason though online shopping isn't green is because you will buy more stuff and tend to go for the cheapest price.

You may not be so guilty as you think as some air freight will go by scheduled passenger services, but there's no way of telling. Ideally I think we ought to be told the pollution implications when we make an order, before finally confirming it so that the environmental costs of the transport can be factored in by the purchaser.

I am guilty. Here's why. I ordered a guitar on line from a shop near London. I live in Scotland.
