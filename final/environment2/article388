EU set to emit 2bn tonnes more CO2 than Paris climate pledge




DateTime::::2016-02-29T16:30:29+0000



<p>The EU is set to emit 2bn tonnes more CO2 than it promised at the Paris climate talks, threatening an agreement to cap global warming at 2C, a note from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission">European commission</a> has revealed.</p>

<p>Carbon prices will rise too slowly to cut industrial emissions as much as needed, says a confidential note prepared for MEPs on the environment committee, which the Guardian has seen.</p>

<p>Lawmakers say that the shortfall could spur criticism from other countries that signed up to the Paris agreement, which aims for net zero emissions later this century.</p>

<p>But a correction in the pace at which carbon allowances are removed from the market - to raise their prices - could spark anger from coal-dependent EU countries such as Poland, which believes its industry would be unfairly hit.</p>

<p>The EU was “caught between a rock and a hard place” said the Green MEP Bas Eickhout, who sits on the environment committee.</p>

<p> “The current proposals are not consistent with what was agreed in Paris and they are not even in line with what’s necessary to stay below 2C,” he told the Guardian. “What kind of signal is that sending our partners? These Emissions Trading System (ETS) numbers need to be changed now to make them consistent with the Paris agreement.”</p>

<p>Seb Dance, the Labour party’s environment spokesman, who also sits on the committee, said: “If we do not raise the level of ambition and move towards a greater linear reduction factor for the ETS, the UK and other EU countries will not meet the groundbreaking climate change targets agreed in Paris.”</p>

<p>The reason for the CO2 overshoot lies in an EU decision to make its ETS the only lever to ratchet emissions down, when renewable energy and efficiency targets end in 2020.</p>

<p>The ETS’s “cap and trade” scheme creates a limited emissions market, within which 11,000 power stations and industrial plants can buy or sell allowances. </p>

<p>It is lauded by supporters for a market-based approach that rewards greener firms with tradable credits, while encouraging dirtier firms to clean up their act, or offset their emissions by paying for accredited emissions cuts elsewhere.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://carbonmarketwatch.org/">Critics</a> have raised questions about the veracity of some of these schemes, the over-allocation of free allowances to heavy polluters, and the extent to which prices – currently <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="https://www.eex.com/en/market-data/emission-allowances/spot-market/european-emission-allowances#!/2016/02/29">hovering at around €5 a tonne</a> – can help fuel switching.</p>

<p>The system does have a mechanism to gradually reduce the number of carbon credits available - and so raise prices - but the note says that this will not be enough to cut emissions to at least 80% of 1990 levels by 2050, as the EU has promised.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> would emit more than 2bn tonnes of CO2 because of the carbon accounting problem, according to an analysis for the Guardian by the campaigning group Sandbag.</p>

<p>By 2050, the cost of the carbon credits needed to account for this extra CO2 would be €146bn the group estimated, based on price ranges used in a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A52014SC0015">European commission impact assessment</a>.</p>

<p> Damien Morris, an analyst for Sandbag, said that Europe needed to remove a higher number of allowances from the ETS, more quickly: “This is what is needed just to align the carbon market with the current EU goal in its low-carbon roadmap. After Paris, though, Europe should be looking to go significantly further than this.”</p>

<p>The Paris agreement proposed an aspirational cap on global warming of 1.5C. A draft commission summit analysis said that a communique would be produced by 2019 to spark a debate on the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/15/europe-climate-change-goals-need-profound-lifestyle-changes-european-commission">“profound lifestyle changes”</a> needed for this to happen. <br/></p>

Of course it was a record, what else would you expect at the height of an El Nino. It will be back down to normal levels as soon as the La Nina takes hold.

Who cares, it's a non problem anyway. The marginal arming from anthropogenic CO2 will be beneficial until at least well into the latter half of this century. By then we will have developed new clean RELIABLE sources of nuclear power.

More specifically, nuclear and intermittent renewables (wind/solar/tidal/wave/lagoon) aren't complimentary but pumped hydro and nuclear is.

The basic problem is not climate change, it is the extent of the power of lobbies in Brussels and the billions of euros they use to "influence" the EU administration.It's not only about climate change, it concerns the negotiations for the TTIP, chemical products, pharmaceutical products, banking regulations, tax heavens, etc.

quokkaZ - you claim that nuclear is not expensive and is only a little more expensive than onshore wind. Well, I think you're wrong:The Strike Price agreed for nuclear was £92.50 per Mega Watt hour, guaranteed (index linked) for 35 years. In the first round of auctions for onshore wind the Strike Price was less than £80/MWhr but, crucially, is expected to diminish rapidly as scale economies kick in. Indeed the industry is now contemplating a sub £70/MWhr CfD for wind, cost competitive with new gas fired stations.

Back in the 50s the world was told that nuclear was safe, cheap and clean. Now all three have consistently been shown to be wrong; and yet we are hearing the same arguments all over again.

Renewables and nuclear arent complimentary - the former are intermittent but the latter cant load follow effectively. Hence building lots of renewables leads to despatchable fossil plant for back up in the absence of a viable alternative, in this case that means filthy lignite/coal stations even if Germany hadnt committed madness in getting rid of its nuclear.

Expect the lifestyle changes to be broadly in line with Agenda 21. Climate change hoo-hah is broadly a means to that end. Agenda 21 is not something that can be rushed. It is a slow but ratcheting impetus in the direction of a dystopian future for the masses.Reminds me a bit of socialism.I will be dead, my children are already comfortably established in the elite...having seen the way the wind was blowing....and the rest of you are welcome to it.

Not true - the problem is that the EU ETS was always a political project & has never delivered (the Danish power company Dong observed last year that the ETS has had zero impact on emissions). The only way forward is carbon taxes & border carbon taxes. Sandbag have nailed their colours to ETS - which is why they are supporters. Personally, I like things that work - carbon taxes do - carbon markets - after nearly 15 years of operation - don't.

The nuclear capacity has to be replaced though. The replacement is coal. The coal has to run when the sun goes down. Then it's easier to not turn it off when the sun comes on.

How about the definition: "compared to coal". Germany could meet their 2020 targets, despite the Energiewende, if they switched from coal to gas. Not politically feasible though.

Only wishful thinking on the part of the average warmista could have had you believing the Paris agreement would deliver what you thought it promised. I can't understand why the various Governments feel a periodic need to play this charade in front of the media, since it plays to such a minute audience, but at least they don't, evidently, believe this climate change tosh or they would do something about it.

This has nothing to do with phasing out nuclear power. Germany has a huge surplus in energy production due to coal plants which should be switched off, but the "social democrats" do not want to harm the coal companies.

We can all hope for the pie in the sky of energy production but in the end we must accept that the only reasonable and responsible way to cut emissions is to use nuclear energy. It may be expensive and polutting but it'll be the only source of energy that offers a decent standard of living for the billions and billions of humans without CO2 emissions.
