Ed Miliband calls for law to make CO2 emissions target legally binding

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband">Ed Miliband</a> has assembled a group of cross-party MPs and campaigners to demand parliament enacts a law to to make the carbon emissions target agreed at the Paris climate talks legally binding.</p>

<p>The former Labour leader – alongside Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, Green MP Caroline Lucas and two Conservative MPs – has called for legislation that would significantly extend the present UK target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050.</p>

<p>His intervention follows December’s Paris summit, where global leaders accepted that the world must achieve net zero emissions in the second half of the century, as recommended by scientists.</p>

<p>However, there is growing disquiet that even Paris’s limited aims are not being met. Last week, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/29/eu-set-to-emit-2bn-tonnes-more-co2-than-paris-climate-pledge">the Guardian revealed </a>that the EU is expected to emit 2bn tonnes more CO2 than it promised at the Paris climate talks, threatening the agreement to cap global warming at 2C. </p>

<p>In a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/06/uk-must-aim-for-zero-emissions-at-home-too">letter published by the Guardian</a>, Miliband calls for the British government to take the lead by drawing up plans for a new law, with an implementation date set by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), an independent body which advises the UK government and was established under the Climate Change Act 2008. </p>

<p>As well as Farron and Lucas, he is also supported by Tory MPs Dan Poulter and Graham Stuart, as well as the NGOs Christian Aid, ClientEarth, ShareAction, Sandbag and WWF. </p>

<p> In his letter, Miliband states: “The UK government deserves significant credit for having helped deliver the Paris agreement. Now we urge it to follow up its high ambition internationally, with high ambition here at home. </p>

<p>“Specifically, it can build on the momentum from Paris by supporting the idea of enshrining net zero emissions in UK domestic law, with the date to be advised by the independent Committee on Climate Change. </p>

<p>“Just as the 2008 UK Climate Change Act, prompted by business and civil society, and passed with all-party support, sent a signal to the world, so we would do so again.”</p>

<p>Before Christmas, Miliband said that having stood down as Labour leader after the election in May, he had decided throw his energy behind building a “high-ambition coalition” of UK businesses, trade unions and civic society to challenge the government’s “backward” environmental policies.</p>

<p>“This is the thing my kids will judge me on,” he told the Guardian at the time. “Did you do something about this? Were you the last generation not to get it or the first generation to get it? I think that is in the balance now.”</p>

<p>EU leaders are <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/02/08/eu-faces-two-year-wrangle-to-ratify-paris-climate-deal/">expected to discuss</a> the possibility of raising Europe’s 2030 target at a summit between 17-18 March. But powerful figures in the European commission will try to ensure this happens through a revision of the bloc’s carbon market rules in 2023.<br/></p>

<p>The EU’s climate chief, Miguel Arias Cañete, has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-16-264_en.htm">already signalled</a> he would like Europe to ratify the Paris climate agreement at a conference in New York on 22 April.<br/></p>

<p>A 2C rise in global temperatures could have consequences including the migration of 20% of the world’s population from cities flooded by sea level rise, such as New York, London and Cairo, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/08/sea-level-rise-could-last-twice-as-long-as-human-history">according to a study published last month</a>.</p>

<p>This summer, the government’s statutory climate advisers <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/22/uk-risks-missing-its-carbon-targets-climate-advisers-warn">warned that the UK’s existing carbon budgets could be missed</a>. The group’s chairman, for Tory minister Lord Gummer, took the unusual step of singling out Conservative policy changes such as scrapping a target for all new homes to be zero carbon.<br/></p>

I saw the document you linked to. It does not actually show any link between wind installations and reduced carbon intensity of electricity.

Why would you call someone who takes climate change seriously, and is trying to do something significant about it, 'a tosser'? The most polite thing one could say is that that is childish.

Most of the emissions comes from countries where the population is not increasing, or is reducing (all of Europe, Japan, Australia, China, etc). The issue is the (for now) the population of rich people, not the population as a whole.

All law is simply ink on pages. But we attach a lot of social importance to it, and generally use various mechanisms to get everyone to comply with what it says.

Whilst one does gain credibility from having a very low personal footprint, one can be correct in what one says independently of one's actual actions. If one flight to Ibiza is all he took this year, than that's 0.7T, which isn't ideal but it's a lot better than flying to Thailand, for example, which is still entirely normal in our society.

This is why Miliband should have been PM - he is the only significant politician in the two major parties who one would trust to do something about reducing carbon emissions. Not only has Cameron failed to show leadership, but he has been a coward in the face of Tory opposition.

In your "reply" to me, there is nothing sensible from you on the topic of CO2 emissions, I note. Nor anything about whether any significant reduction in the carbon-intensity of electricity has been (or can be) archived by increased wind and solar in the UK as a means to meeting the UK's emission objectives.

As a basic first step, let's hear what Ed Miliband is doing to reduce his own carbon footprint. Without being able to demonstrate big efforts (excluding buying offsets), his comments lack credibiity. Here's one example: What was the first thing he did after losing the election? He took a plane to Ibiza!Reducing CO2 emissions by 80% cannot be achieved without significant adaption and sacrifices by all, regardless of how successful are renewables. Now, just who is it who is afraid of cutting back on their own comfortable lifestyle? For now, its seems to be those who shout loudest about the need to do so.

Why is it a mess? It's called democracy.Nobody voted for this current state of affairs. The EU is already in a mess economically and now socially thanks to the immigration/refugee crisis and now we hear they are bribing Turkey to help stop the flow by promising them membership in the near future regardless of wether they meet the criteria. The Labour position of stay in no matter what regardless of what people think is bizarre but then they don't care what the voters think. They always know best - that's what finished them in Scotland.

Next current generation has very poor chance of maintaining human civilisation at faster and faster accelerating rate of Climate Change even if Paris COP 21 is rectified and concreted into law. Human GREED is much to all pervasive in its power to influence and fund the negative meaning Oil & Gas to add more and more emissions into the environment than is the desire to do what we all know innately is the right thing to preserve life by cutting them. One is away with the fairies of one thinks governments and the banking masters will invest in correct manner to save planet and mankind and life upon this world. I think you all forgot the Devil and his hoardes having been cast down to Earth are driving the mandate to do as much destruction as possible before the final demise of his brood. They run the governments and banks, so one is stupid to expect them to try save planet. Not trying to be unscientific of overly religious here but, this is one obvious fact few dare to even mention.

Surely the answer is a universal carbon tax, the rate being set high enough to keep CO2 down to a safe level, and the revenue being used to subsidise alternatives. The tax should apply throughout the EU, with tariffs applied to goods imported from elsewhere if CO2 is emitted as a result of their production.

Ed you are as clueless as Amber Rudd. You had a chance to fully decarbonise the UK within a generation, instead you and Ms Worthington chose intermittent renewables rather than state built and run nuclear forcing the country down a road of massively subsidised wind turbines and solar pv propped up by imported gas and coal, with the result our industrial base has eroded and is probably beyond the point of no return.

If we take no action there will be a slow degradation in our way of life and that of our children. Food shortages will increase and food prices will rise. There will be increased tension between countries over resources such as water leading to more conflict. Migration that is now in the millions will become tens and then hundreds of millions. Some large built up areas in river valleys and low lying land will have to be abandoned due to regular flooding. We are already seeing species dying off at a higher rate than usual that will change complex ecosystems, some of which we depend on.
