Diesel cars may be worse than petrol for carbon emissions, report claims

<p>Diesel engines may be doing nothing to slow global warming despite being the backbone of Europe’s policy to reduce car emissions, a new report claims.</p>

<p>Tailpipe emissions of sooty ‘black carbon’ could be as much as 25-50% higher than the EU estimates for cars made before 2005, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://green-budget.eu/what-future-for-diesel-cars/">says the paper</a> by Professor Eckard Helmers of Triers University.<br/></p>

<p>On this analysis, some 20m cars in use since the 1990s may each have produced 40-80g of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent per kilometre more than previously thought.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/01/boris-johnson-and-london-toxic-air">Boris Johnson and London’s toxic air | Letters</a> </p>

<p>However, the finding was questioned by the car industry and other experts.</p>

<p>Diesel engines made after 2005 have all had particulate filters installed, but Helmers’ study cites French research which found that 75% of the devices tested were not working properly.</p>

<p>“Diesel cars are intensifying rather than mitigating global warming,” Helmers told the Guardian. “EU policy has produced the opposite result to what it intended, and has exposed its population to more pollutants than was necessary.”</p>

<p>Brussels has used tax perks to favour diesel over petrol <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/30/emissions-scandal-how-the-drive-for-diesel-ran-out-of-gas">since the 1990s</a>, even though they are a leading emitter of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is responsible for an estimated <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/many-europeans-still-exposed-to-air-pollution-2015#tab-related-infographics">70,000 premature European deaths each year</a>.</p>

<p>An over-riding priority to lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions helped make the case for the fuel, and a litre of diesel today costs €0.184 less than petrol in Germany and €0.173 less in France. More than half of all new car sales in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> have diesel engines.</p>

<p>But new cars sold in Japan emitted 20g of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent less than European ones in 2013, due to the country’s high share of efficient petrol-hybrid cars, which receive no tax advantages here.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/car-fumes-air-pollution-ban-motorists">Car fumes are killing us. So why isn’t anyone telling us not to drive? | Susanna Rustin</a> </p>

<p>“The Japanese car industry was forced to invest in new technology 20 years ago, leading to the development of the hybrid car,” the report says. “This technical alternative in the EU could have saved – and in the future may save - Europe a very significant amount of CO2 emissions as well as toxic fine particles and NOx [the group of gases which includes NO2] emissions.”</p>

<p>The Liberal MEP Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy said that it was time to stop taxing diesel and petrol so differently. “I don’t see why we should stimulate diesel through tax incentives in such a way,” he said. “There are very good reasons to stimulate renewable electric cars or hybrids but diesel is generally not seen as the cleanest way to drive your car.”</p>

<p>The European commission refused to comment on the report. But the car industry says that diesel cars still emit 15% less carbon dioxide per kilometre than their petrol equivalents.</p>

<p>“Diesel fuel has a higher energy content per litre than other fuels,” said a spokesperson for the European Automobile Association. “Moreover, diesel engines convert more of this energy into useful work. Due to these two factors, diesel cars consume about 20-25% less fuel by volume than equivalent petrol cars.”</p>

<p>The new report was also dismissed as “nonsense” by Axel Friedrich, a former transport director at the German Federal Environment Agency and the co-founder of the International Council for Clean Transportation, which revealed the VW scandal.</p>

<p> “A diesel engine with a filter removes 99.99% of black carbon emissions and today all the diesel cars have filters, so there are virtually no black carbon emissions anymore,” he said. “We can see the filters are working because the concentrations of black carbon are going down year by year.”</p>

<p> Monitoring stations in German cities such as Berlin, Munich and Dusseldorf have recorded dramatic falls in measurements of black carbon, which are down by nearly one half in the last decade, Friedrich said.</p>

<p>This may not be the case everywhere though. Campaigners point to a black market cottage industry in tampering with – or removing – particulate filters to increase car performance, acceleration and fuel efficiency, in several EU states, including the UK.</p>

<p>“Removing a filter is not illegal,” said Greg Archer the clean vehicles director at Transport and Environment. “Driving a car without a diesel particulate filter is. So we are in the ridiculous situation where businesses can advertise to do this, earn money through doing it and then afterwards, the car is illegal to drive but it’s very hard to detect what’s been done because they tamper with the software that would detect it.”</p>

<p> Black carbon is a light-absorbing component of fine particulate matter (PM) formed during fossil fuel and bioenergy combustion processes. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/15/black-carbon-twice-global-warming">Some climate scientists believe</a> it to be the second most potent greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide.</p>

<p> The substance tends to concentrate at road level, where its primary effect is felt on public health. Amounts of black carbon in the upper atmosphere <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/26/climate-impact-of-black-carbon-severely-overestimated-says-study">are disputed</a>, and the substance is enigmatic, with cooling as well as warming properties. But there is scientific consensus that it has a powerful warming potential in the upper troposphere.</p>

<p> If it is blown towards polar and glacier regions, black carbon can also reduce the ‘albedo’ of snow and ice, preventing it from reflecting sunlight away from the Earth, again boosting global warming. </p>

Most DPF issues are caused by people either not driving their cars fast/long enough or by them putting the wrong oil in and hard ash forming on the filter.

I suppose the Professor is looking at the TOTAL global warming effect of the CO2 + black carbon emissions. He says OLD diesels emit more global-warming pollutants than petrol cars (because of the added effect of the black-carbon). And the ICCT guy said NEW diesels emit less than petrol (because they give out much less black carbon now). Sounds reasonable. Why all the shouting?

This report appears to be complete drivel. It's confusing carbon dioxide gas with carbon particles. Diesel cars manufactured in the last several years emit very few particles since filters were applied to new cars. Indeed they emit fewer than petrol cars. The claim that many "are not working properly" is I think deliberately misleading. They may not be 100% in some respect (e.g. the self cleaning) but it is unlikely to be that they let particles through. The reports I have seen indicate that the filters are very, very good at stopping particles engine cold or hot, car new or old. Climate change is, of course, driven mostly by CO2 and only to a small extent by carbon particles.

"muscle car" - as much of a horrid American term as "gas guzzler". VED as it is, is a joke (which is why it's being reformed for new cars from 2017), the serious money is in the VAT and Duty paid on fuel - where that 3 litre A8 TDi will be paying an awful lot more to the treasury than the A1 1.6TDi.

The financial situation encourages anyone who owns a car to use it in preference to public transport. That is because the fixed costs of ownership are actually higher than the cost of driving it. Since many people need a car for journeys not possible by public transport, and thus will buy one, that predisposes most people to go by car, most of the time.

Although, the whole complicated and problematic DPF self-cleaning arrangement is due to an obsession with zero-maintenance vehicles. The sensible thing would be to put the DPF on the rear of the exhaust, and simply take it off and pressure wash it once in a while. Hardly beyond the capability of the average owner. (Apart from ultrasonic cleaning that's all they do when they 'service' a DPF anyway.)

This is true, and the really crazy thing is that VED takes no account of brake horsepower or engine size, so you have the situation where a 3-litre, 150mph 'muscle car' pays half the road tax of an average diesel or petrol car that must surely use far fewer resources and pollute far less in real terms.

The thing I cannot understand is how, of two diesel cars with roughly equivalent fuel economy, one which is a performance saloon capable of very high speeds can have a much lower 'carbon' figure and therefore VED banding than the other which is a low-powered runabout.

As others say, you are wrong to assume a ban on non-electric cars would reduce GHG emissions - but it would certainly do a lot for cleaner air and improved human health in our cities - and reduced deaths. That is why London has its low-emissions zone for commercial vehicles.

these particles clog up filters and if not cleaned properly (which is often the case ) no longer work correctly. They are expensive to replace (these filters) and in order to to their work correctly need to reduce both PM10 ,and PM2.5 particles as well as NOx's (NO2 and NO) , however this is not possible. NOx's Ozone precursors are very bad on human (AKA Animals) and plant health in the cities. These gases and PM's increase the heating /greenhouse effect in cities which are experiencing further warming because of the shift northwards of the temperature gradients. THis is an alarming issue often not dealt with and diesel cars are a disgusting and ridiculous absurdity regarding the vast sums of money invested into infrastructure for healthy living. GET with it and GET RID OF DIESEL and COMBUSTION CARs in cities. THINK ABOUT IT !

Because the oil companies lobbied governments to get more diesel cars on the road despite petrol being adequate for vehicles under 5 tonnes which meant that sales of diesel would increase but diesel is cheaper to produce than petrol so oil companies get more money while they poison the air we breathe.

Not really. Take a look at the average car sold in the US these days and it's a *lot* smaller than it was in the 1960's (Aside from pick-up trucks, which have always been pretty sizeable). I'm not sure what you mean by "narrow car", I can't really think of any that have been specifically marketed as such?

Personally I think the public should be banned for use of a car, the only vehicles on the road should be public transport, emergency vehicles, police and goods transportation, if a member of public wants to go somewhere let them get a bus, or heavily invest into driverless cars with low/zero emissions which will pick up and transport all people (prefrably car pooled to work and such). They will be shared and go to their own storage, significantly cleaning up our street parked car's which have turned into high density parking Everywhere.
