When it comes to a shift to low-carbon energy, key players need a history lesson




DateTime::::2016-03-04T09:00:29+0000



<p>Energy UK, the trade association representing the big six energy suppliers, has in welcome - if belated - fashion <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/28/top-lobbying-group-green-energy-u-turn">come out in favour</a> of a large-scale shift to low-carbon, renewable energy. </p>

<p>Their desire to not be left behind might seem rather academic, as they already have been - both by a warming climate and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/04/morocco-to-switch-on-first-phase-of-worlds-largest-solar-plant">countries whose embrace of renewable energy</a> is far advanced. </p>

<p>Their report on pathways to 2030 is littered with the buzzwords for a more sustainable energy system. It looks at everything from more decentralised energy generation to a “whole systems” approach, energy efficiency and even “reducing energy demand”.</p>

<p>Contrary to previous official expectations of rising demand, it expects demand to remain roughly stable, but describes an otherwise substantially changing energy market overseen by uncertain government policies that threaten the investment needed for transformation. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Late in 2015 the Department for Energy and Climate Change <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-government-quietly-slashes-renewable-energy-forecast">cut its projection</a> for new renewable energy capacity coming on stream by 2015 by more than one-third from 34 gigawatts (GW) to 22GW. It emerged around the same time that the big six energy suppliers represented by Energy UK had all dropped their <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/big-six-energy-companies-have-quietly-abandoned-their-green-electricity-tariffs-10481787.html">green electricity tariffs</a>.</p>

<p>Both the big energy companies and government seem to lack any idea of the scale and speed of transition in infrastructure that nations are capable of. Perhaps they need a reminder.</p>

<p>Taking a lesson from the dark side, our initial system-wide addiction to fossil fuels was a rapid affair. Starting in 1956 the US Interstate Highway System, for example, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/sad1109Jaco5p.indd.pdf">managed to build</a> 47,000 miles of highway in just over three decades, “changing commerce and society”. </p>

<p>A century earlier,<strong> </strong>Britain demonstrated the capacity for the rapid rollout of a more benign transport system when just between the years of 1845 and 1852 there were 4,400 miles of railway track laid. A single weekend in 1892 saw the upgrading of 177 miles of track on the Great Western route by 4,200 well-coordinated workers.</p>

<p>It is astonishing by the contemporary standards of apparent official impotence to solve the crisis in the housing market (also a key energy issue), that in Britain’s battered and far more indebted post-war condition, the number of homes built annually by local authorities <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14380936">in the early 1950s hit 250,000</a>, and under a Conservative government. Under a Labour government social housing around 1967-68 still saw around <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/24/history-british-housing-decade">200,000 homes built</a> with the private sector building a similar number, before such ambition fell off a cliff in the 1980s. In comparison, during 2014-15 just <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/477823/House_Building_Release_Sep_Qtr_2015.pdf">1,350 homes</a> were completed by local authorities in England and the private sector built less than half what it did during the mid 1960s.</p>

<p>It is possible to transform societies in response to positive visions of “homes fit for heroes”, but also to mobilise rapidly to fight against the external threats that called for the heroes in the first place. Against significant, official intransigence, from 1936–39 dozens of factories were built or repurposed around Britain as part of a “shadow factories” programme to produce the military hardware for the war effort. And, when they were bombed, as they often were, in great adversity the factories were rapidly repaired and returned to production. </p>

<p>Compared to proven historical ability, even the boldest comments of the big energy companies appear tentative and insipid. Recent human migration in response to conflict and other drivers seems to stress our ability to adapt. But forms of large scale adaptation are happening all the time in response to economic and demographic change. It took an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/events-documents/1125.pdf">estimated 10,000 years</a> for the world’s urban population to add up to 1 billion. Going from 2-3 billion took just 17 years, from 1985–2002. Somehow, however imperfectly and haphazardly, we adapted, responding with urban infrastructures to provide shelter and basic services. </p>

<p>What’s needed now is a more conscious, bold and planned programme to achieve the rapid transition of an energy system to respond to a known challenge with clear targets. </p>

<p>Denmark, as a small nation, provides in microcosm a classic example. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://aquamarinepower.com/sites/resources/Published%20papers/2914/The%20Danish%20wind%20industry%201980%20-%202010%20Lessons%20for%20the%20British%20marine%20energy%20industry%20International%20Journal%20of%20the%20Society%20for%20Underwater%20Technology.pdf">An incentive scheme</a> brought communities and investors together creating both grassroots support and a secure investment environment. In two decades from 1983, 3GW of wind energy capacity were installed. By 2014 wind power was providng <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.windpower.org/en/knowledge/statistics/the_danish_market.html">39</a>% of Danish electricity. </p>

<p>Internationally things are changing fast. Even in the fossil fuel-hungry US, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2016/02/wind-power-will-soon-surpass-hydro-as-the-largest-source-of-clean-energy-in-the-us.html">8GW of wind</a> were installed in 2015. And in China, for all its problems, nearly 20GW of wind power were introduced <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theclimategroup.org/_assets/files/RE100-China-analysis.pdf">in a single year</a>, 2014. Which is more than the UK’s current <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.renewableuk.com/en/renewable-energy/wind-energy/uk-wind-energy-database/">total installed capacity</a>, onshore and offshore, of wind energy, of just over 14GW.</p>

<p>We should applaud the change of tone from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> UK, but remind them that what makes a real difference finally is: deeds not words.</p>

Absolutely - neoliberalism gives rights - the clue is in the world "liberal". People have a right not to have their property destroyed by a new rail line or hydro dam. Overcoming these rights - through compulsory purchase orders for example - takes time and care in liberal democracies. Not so in China where the peasants can be forced out of the town at the signature of a party official.

Yes, but the fossil fuels that go into mining Uranium, or into making the magnets for wind turbine drives, or the silicon baking for solar panels, are recouped many times over compared to using gas, let alone coal, for electricity generation.

Increased atmospheric CO2 enhances the greenhouse effect causing global warming which increases the absolute humidity or atmospheric concentration water vapor further enhancing the greenhouse effect causing more warming. The extra CO2 stays in the atmosphere for a very long time whereas the extra H2O vapor is at the mercy of weather patterns which can cause it to precipitate from the atmosphere.

Like you they say they are open minded but won't buy this heliocentricism despite that Italian blokes evidence. All that star gazing. It's dangerous at night, there are dingoes. They also say they don't trust that German bloke with his mathematical models - you can prove anything with numbers. Who needs to know which one comes after four, anyway?

in the electricity sector is not growing and when we had a price on carbon the carbon emissions to meet that declining demand declined faster than the demand. However as global warming increases the severity of droughts the current three to four year drought topped off with a severe El Nino has punched a hole in the capacity of hydro power to reduce carbon emissions for this year just gone.

CO2 always lags temperature increases, this is the case even during glacial periods as well as interglacial. Attempts to say otherwise are efforts of warmistas / AGW supporters catching on that people know a little more than they would hope.

and we cannot therefore fixate on CO2 as we have been. It means at worst that whatever the effect CO2, it is outmatched by other natural phenomenon, and is not that important, or - from my point of view - at best it has no overall effect.

Envirocapilalist, while what you are saying regarding France's, Nuclear power generation program as being supposedly the solution to stopping reliance upon fossil fuels you forget to mention the massive fossil fuel powered efforts required to extract the refined elements to run what is a pretty basic STEAM ENGINE. Same expensive dirty fossil fuel effort applies when producing the R/E and subsequent refinement to make Ultra Strong - Permanent Magnets which are required to build the new highly efficient power generators of which I had some personal input from 1996 to 2008 when derailed by brainless petty hostiles for the 4th time. Renewable big and small as well as their electronic management systems rely on such elements.

Nothing would make me happier than to see Hinkley in its current form scrapped. Far better to wait a few extra years while a better design is licensed. Given that other designs have faster build times it might not even delay first power too much.

There is no need to build anymore large hydro dams using current popular configurations that damage the environment beyond repair while displacing thousands of people, when long couple of hundred meters each - endless chain type - aka - stainless steel flexible caterpillar track type set up with scoops to catch water to drive hydraulic pumps to drive fluid to shore based generators attached with banks of large magnetically suspended carbon fiber flywheels. Each wheel several meters in diameter weighing several tonnes each encase in vacuumed housing spinning at very high rates to store and balance load requirements. Such system can be fabricated for installation in a fraction of the time of convention hydro dam system. Concrete structure to direct and concentrate flow can also be constructed in less time and for less than a quarter of the price of current 100 year old systems. Time to think outside the box rather than stick with conventional thinking. Fish and river traffic flows do not get interrupted with such systems, which can handle floods and droughts and do not need to be cleaned of silt. I hope this helps Governments Politicians, Bankers and Engineers to consider less environmentally disruptive and destructive means towards clean power generation by using innovative systems.

"This hypothesis has been questioned with data froma composite bulk stable isotope record of Site 1258 showingthat a series of negative stable isotope excursions continuedthroughout the EECO. This evidence suggests that episodesof carbon release persisted during the peak of warmth andthe onset of the cooling trend (Kirtland Turner et al., 2014).Kirtland Turner et al. (2014) suggest that the mechanismsoperating in the early Eocene climate were not necessar-ily exceptional but actually similar to those invoked for theOligocene and Miocene when cyclic variations in the car-bon cycle were also clearly paced by orbital forcing, particu-larly in the eccentricity bands (Holbourn et al., 2007; Pälikeet al., 2006; Zachos et al., 2001b)."Carbon release persisted even on the onset of cooling - odd
