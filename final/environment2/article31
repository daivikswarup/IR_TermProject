Would British farmers be better off in or out of the EU?




DateTime::::2016-02-24T16:55:10+0000



<p>A battle for the Tory heartlands of the UK countryside has broken out within the government’s ministerial ranks, as David Cameron’s farming minister has defied his boss to urge farmers to vote to leave the EU. <br/> <br/>George Eustice, the farming minister,<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/24/uk-environment-ministers-at-odds-over-brexit-impact-on-farming"> told the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) annual conference on Wednesday</a> that they would be better off out of the EU. “We would do far better as a country if we ended the supremacy of Europe and shaped new fresh-thinking policies that really deliver for our agriculture,” he said. </p>

<p>“The truth of the matter is that if we left the EU there would be an £18bn a year dividend, so could we find the money to spend £2bn a year on farming and the environment? Of course we could. Would we? Without a shadow of a doubt.” <br/> <br/>His appeal for exit was a very public breaking of ranks with the secretary of state for environment, farming and rural affairs, Liz Truss. She addressed the conference on Tuesday with a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/23/leaving-eu-would-put-uk-food-and-farming-exports-at-risk-says-liz-truss">plea to farmers to stay within the EU</a>, calling an exit “a leap into the dark” at a time when farmers are already hard-pressed. <br/> <br/>She told the conference: “By voting to remain we can work within a reformed EU to reduce bureaucracy and secure further reform while still enjoying the significant benefits of the single market, which gives us access to 500m consumers. At a time of severe price volatility and global market uncertainty, it would be wrong to take a leap into the dark. The years of complication and risk caused by negotiating withdrawal would be a distraction.” <br/> <br/>At stake, for farmers, is the roughly £2.5 to £3bn a year - varying according to the euro exchange rate - that farmers receive from Brussels. This is paid on the basis of the area of land they farm, and efforts they make to improve the environment, for instance by maintaining habitats for wildlife. Farmers also benefit from access to the EU market, which accounts for more than half of all British food and farming exports, amounting to more than £11bn a year. <br/> <br/>Despite Eustice’s assurances, it is unclear that a Conservative government after a Brexit would divert similar levels of taxpayer funding to farmers, and neither the prime minister, David Cameron, nor Truss has made such promises. <br/> <br/>Such a measure would be deeply controversial, particularly as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/01/farm-subsidies-blatant-transfer-of-cash-to-rich">current subsidies tend to favour the biggest and richest landowners</a>. To put the money in context, the<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/25/chancellors-cash-injection-nhs-comes-at-price-spending-review"> NHS budget boost in the last review was £3.8bn</a>. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>Many farmers argue that the benefit from the EU’s subsidy <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/06/dairy-farmers-call-for-supermarkets-boycott-as-milk-price-falls">rarely reaches them</a>, in any case: supermarkets factor in the expected income in their calculations of what to pay their suppliers. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>The NFU has been carefully neutral on the issue, but did include in its information pack for the 1,400 farmers attending its conference a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.nfuonline.com/news/eu-referendum/uk-farmings-relationship-with-the-eu-nfu-report/">comparison</a> of the £153 a year paid by the UK per person into the EU with more than £106 per citizen a year from Norway “with no influence” because Norway is not a member. Norway is frequently cited as an alternative model by those favouring an exit. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>For the Tory party, farmers and rural communities have always been a bedrock of support. Few rural constituencies outside Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and a few in the south-west of England vote anything but Conservative. But some farmers feel that they have been taken for granted, while buffeted by the forces of international trade. Farmgate prices for produce such as milk, wheat and pigs have plummeted by more than a third in the last year.<br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>Farming votes in the referendum are up for grabs as never before. When the Guardian questioned farmers at the conference on whether they would prefer to remain in or leave, there was a clear split, with a substantial number opting to leave. </p>

<p>That in itself is a new development, as until recently farmers were clearly in favour of remaining. At last year’s NFU conference, when the farmers in the hall were asked the question, an overwhelming majority raised their hands to favour remaining. Only a small fraction said they favoured exit. No such straw poll was taken this year. <br/> <br/>The NFU has refused to take an official survey of its members this year on their views on Brexit. Instead, in late March it will publish a report commissioned from independent academics on the effects of EU membership on farming. In early April, its governing council will meet to decide whether to use the contents of that report to take a public stance on in or out.</p>

The NFU and other commentators are very misleading with their claims that the EU pays for farmers and if we leave, they will loose the money.Before the EU, we paid farm subsidies. When we joined the EU, we transferred the power to it. We pay in £20billion a year and we get out £12billion. If we left the EU we would have more money than we have now available and so the government could pay farmers exactly the same amount and still have £8billion left over.And, where policies have not been working, of which farmers will tell you many, when the UK and Welsh governments have the power to change them, they are much easier to lobby than the EU is. We could, after BREXIT, keep all the good things the EU has done but change all the less successful things.Farmers in Norway and Japan are more subsidized than UK farmers currently. Life outside the EU does not have to mean cuts.

aside from my concerns about the validity of your figures (but for the purposes of this post accepted) - what makes you think the government will match the current subsidies or indeed give any of this 'extra' money to those who currently get EU subsidies farmers/researchers/etc?

3bn is the VAT payment we make to the EU on top of our regular payments so farmers can be much better off if they are encouraged to make sure we have enough dairy produce at home instead of shipping in polish and german milk.

Outside the EU, free of the Common Agricultural Policy and excessive regulations, we will be able to introduce fairer, simpler ways to support farmers. For every £1 British agriculture receives from the CAP, the British taxpayer has already contributed £2, so we can easily continue to subsidise farmers after leaving the EU. Better off OUT.

Why? There was upland farming before we joined, why should it mysteriously end if we come out? UK farming was once one of the most efficient in the world before we joined and there is no reason at all why that should not continue. In fact they could be better off is imported milk is replaced with UK's own once more.The farms where I live had fields full of cattle or sheep at one time, now most are just used for silage, which shows the demise of the sector since we joined the EU.

If we leave the EU, hill-farming will be pretty much over in the UK. Uplands sheep farming is basically uplands subsidy farming. I don't personally believe that any UK government will step in and duplicate the insane subsidy arrangements that the EU has developed. I think that could be an amazing opportunity for reforesting and rewinding, but it would take a huge and traumatic cultural shift in the traditional uplands farming areas.

One important factor you have omitted to mention is 'entitlements'. If one doesn't have entitlements, one cannot claim subsidies.There are many farming who cannot afford to purchase entitlements, therefore cannot claim!

The EU had plans to cut subsidies for biggest farms/landowners but the idea was scrapped several times.The UK and France were the leading force into stopping this.

As long as you are happy to have farms which only produce food which can be consumed in the Uk, which means such small volumes that prices will go up and variety will go down.

For you and many like you it is all about the number of immigrant and refugees, fine that is clear. The loose of democracy? British people are voting for their federal government and for a representative in the EU (MEP). UK still makes their own regulations and use their own border controle.

Considering the amount of farmers who have voted,you confirm that this type of agriculture reduces workplaces in the countryside,and reduces the number of farmers for the greed megalomania of few "left" who imagine their empire will eternally extend.Those farmers are the worse enemy of those farmers who have tried the same and end in dept and their land get's taken by the banks who sells it to those extremely rich ones. Nobody wins in this type of game, remaining in the EU or not.The soil fertility decreases , the end of the oil based agriculture is predictable.Instead of supporting little units serving the real needs of consumers demanding quality products, they pretend solidarity amongst themselves on the surface during they keep an eye out, how to remain servile to those "up there" in their petty provincial country hierarchy, and act up nose towards intelligent farmers who try to go more towards though full environmental and social ways.Less and less trees and bushes around fields, ...tells the type of "bright" mindset only by looking at the sterile landscape they favour.

A really important point made above is that supermarkets factor in subsidies. Thats the problem with grants, they are all too often poisonous with taxpayers money going straight to big business. A better way has to be found.

dream on Brexit lover - you are deluded - but if you want to be educated read my blogs - a Brexit will hand over the uk to exploitation by the US who want our gold plated social service contracts to manage, our NHS to privatise and to the right wing tory elite who generally cause havoc to our economies and social policies every 5 years or so - the same tories who have taken your wifes pension, raised retirement age, reduced your state pension, created a huge problem for any public worker though privatisation of their jobs, deskilling a country to warehouse and call centre work, introducing zero hour andd agency work which has enabled and encouraged migrant labour as we have the most dereulated labour market in the EU - then blame the EU - liars !!

Farm subsidies insulate farmers from the consumer end of the market so they have tended to become primary commodity producers leaving it to transnational food processors to fill the gap between the farm gate and kitchen table. With land prices at around £10k an acre, partly the result of capitialised subsidies, it is difficult for young food entrepreneurs and growers to contribute to the healthy diet the nation needs. Brexit gives an opportunity to design a countryside support policy that benefits consumer health, new entrants into food production and growing as well as an ecological rich and healthy countryside. The danger would be that the small but vocal industrial farming lobby will try to maintain the status quo, however the opportunity of creating a countryside policy that benefits the nation as a whole and not just a tiny minority is too good to miss.
