France calls on world leaders to give Paris climate deal 'new push'




DateTime::::2016-01-22T06:00:03+0000



<p>World leaders should give international efforts to fight global warming a new push by ratifying <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-200-nations-sign-finish-fossil-fuel-era">the historic Paris climate deal</a> in person, according to France’s foreign minister.</p>

<p>Laurent Fabius, who steered December’s UN talks, wants heads of state to ratify the accord at a meeting in April in New York, so that it can be enshrined in international law. Nations accounting for more than 55% of global emissions must formally sign up before the Paris agreement can be made official. </p>

<p>He told the Guardian he had discussed the plans with UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon a few days ago, gaining his support, and was “pretty confident” that heads of government would attend what would be the third leaders’ climate summit in a little over six months. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br/>“We should have the leaders there, to give a new impulse [to the implementation of the accord],” he said of the New York meeting, which he will preside over. “At the first day of Paris [<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/live/2015/nov/30/paris-climate-summit-world-leaders-meet-for-opening-day-live">which leaders attended</a>] there was a tremendous push. It’s time for a new push in April.” <br/> <br/>Fabius is acutely aware that, despite the success of the Paris negotiations, much more needs to be done before the future of the accord is secure. “There are many things which can go wrong,” he told the Guardian. “We have to avoid being lazy. We have to be calm, and to be hopeful. We have to talk to developing countries.” <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>He pointed to the need to tackle emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which were omitted from the UN talks, and which he said are urgent.</p>

<p> More work is needed on setting out clear rules on how to monitor emissions in a “transparent” fashion, he said. African countries must be assured that they are receiving the support that was promised to them at Paris. Businesses must also receive cooperation from governments to develop new clean technologies that will be “decisive” in bringing down emissions. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>Fabius also called for a renewed focus on the possibility of putting a price on carbon, pointing to a Chinese plan to institute a national system of carbon trading from next year. This would be a major step forward, he said. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>At Paris, 196 countries <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points">agreed to limit greenhouse gases in line with scientific advice</a>, to avoid temperature rises of more than 2C, and to review their commitments and progress on meeting them every five years. This framework is legally binding, and most countries - including all the biggest emitters - <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/oct/16/which-countries-are-doing-the-most-to-stop-dangerous-global-warming">also set out national targets for emissions</a>, to 2025 or 2030. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>Fabius addressed the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, asking MEPs for their continued support for plans for the EU to meet its obligations on greenhouse gas emissions. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>He set out “four Ps” which he said are needed to implement the Paris agreement: the process of ratification of the accord, including the April meeting; clarifying the principles underlying the agreement, such as a precise definition of climate change financing, rules on the conduct of the five-year reviews and the transparency of monitoring emissions; the pre-2020 period, during which countries must make progress on their existing emissions goals; and preparing for this November’s UN climate conference, ‘COP22’. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>The success of the Paris conference was a rare bright moment in a dark end to 2015 for France, scarred by the terrorist attacks in November that left 130 people dead and scores more wounded. Fabius hailed the agreement as a triumph for international cooperation. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>“This is about security and peace,” he said. “There are massive risks to global warming, which could lead to widespread conflict. We have to stop that risk from becoming reality. That means this agreement was actually about peace for future generations, and current generations. This is a chaotic world, and a dangerous one. The Paris agreement is making the world safer.” <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>Relaxed in a fashionably high-collared brown leather jacket as he travelled by French government plane to a snow-covered Strasbourg, Fabius reflected that the signing of the Paris accord had been just a beginning, though a very important one. </p>

<p>“We need to look for concrete measures now,” he said. “I think that will arrive. The shift [to tackling climate change] has been made now, and there will be no turning back.” <br/> <br/>For the year ahead, Fabius has a punishing schedule of climate meetings as part of his role as president of the COP, which under UN convention continues until COP22 in November. After the summit in April there will be a meeting in Germany in May to discuss some of the details of the accord, then a further conference in Washington DC in May or June hosted by the US, followed by a meeting of local authorities from around the world in Nantes, France, in September, as well as meetings held with the IMF and World Bank, and the UN general assembly in September. <br/> <br/>During that time, it is widely expected that Fabius will leave his post as foreign minister, perhaps to be succeeded by his long-time rival Ségolène Royal. He has been tipped in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a> as a potential future candidate for UN secretary-general, with his steering of the Paris conference having burnished his credentials.</p>

<p>Though he declined to speculate on his future, Fabius noted that he could remain COP president without being French foreign minister.</p>

(unintended early post). Note I drew attention to extreme right wing climate science denial to balance the extreme left wing (not really that different) genetic science denial of Stalin. I could have mentioned the contemporaneous extreme right wing racial genetics denial of the German Nazi regime but didn't.

No, which is why it would need to be agreed by international treaties and such. You'd need to have the whole thing enshrined in international law with the threat of sanctions against countries which broke the agreement.

Every day, in the Guardian, we read of actions proposed by countriesall over the world. You say: 'the EU is trying to do something'. You shouldcomplete that by adding 'through the UN'.This is not what the UN is for and is why these efforts are unsuccessful.

I think you mean the facts according to the LA Times letter editor. Of course, it's up to him to determine what gets included, but it is nevertheless a form of censorship. I believe Pravda used to only print the facts.BTW, here are Dr. Roy Spencer's thoughts on the validity of satellite data, and only 2 days old.

The treaty of Paris is threaten by three side:1) the low price of the oil2) the collapse of the Schengen agreement inside the EU because this collapse will lead to the give up of an ecologist policy at the european level.3) Malthusianism: as the move of the people would be restricted in Europe the growth of the human population would be reduced as it is explained by the book of M.Watson http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/captain-watsons-works.htmlwho hopes save the animal survival by the restrictions of the human population on earth that shoudn't be according to him bigger than one billion.

So because the EU is trying to do something nobody else will?Maybe the EU has a problem with telling Canada, Russia and the US how to run their lives...(.I am bloody sure you would have plenty to say on THAT subject) and are going for an agreement they stand a chance of securing at home.If that worked, it might be seen as a good example and others may want to join in.......though the comments on here make me doubt it very much.Again and again you adorn these pages with negativity and a barren outlook with nary a single word suggesting a way out, well done!

Perhaps you didn't follow the Paris COP very closely.The EU Commission and France had a position that included'legally binding emission reductions'. Mr. Fabius actually said:'We won't take no for an answer'. Previously he had said:'Better no deal than a bad deal'These statements and what is said in this article are good examplesof things the rest of the world would not care about.All of the major countries, major emitters, had the position of nolegally binding targets.During the overtime period, Mr. Kerry finally convinced the EU to climbdown from their position. This was the sum total of all the negotiations.If that didn't happen there would have been a UN deal with the majorcountries that excluded the EU (like the Copenhagen statement) or there would have been no deal.You should know that there can be a UN climate treaty without the EU,but if the US and China don't ratify a climate treaty there is no agreement.There is no climate agreement between China and the US, likely not withChina and France. These were statements made by the current leaders ofthese countries, nothing to do with the countries.The Kyoto Accord is interesting and still in effect for 4 more years. Do youknow which countries are parties to that accord, and have targets to reducetheir emissions?

This is not what I said. I've not talked about who is interestedin negotiations or diplomacy, only who has negotiated.If you are in the EU, you might recall meetings over year agobetween EU members to negotiate among themselves a commonposition on emission reductions. This was to develop a joint plan forthe upcoming Paris COP.I can't think of another case where sovereign countries have negotiatedwith each other on the climate change issue.Canada -US -Mexico have a trade arrangement but have never discussedemission targets. Their INDCs are unique, not similar to each other.I don't remember when Russia, China, India and Japan negotiated emissiontargets with each other or even discussed the issue.Perhaps if Iran and Saudi Arabia had diplomatic relations with each other,they would discuss emission reductions.

Perhaps you confuse diplomacy with negotiations.All countries do diplomacy.What I said was it has only been the EU members that have had negotiationsover their climate change position. They did this more than a year ago inorder to have a joint EU position for the Paris COP.I don't see where any other countries have negotiated with each otheror with the EU on the climate issue.

Soviet communism were in denial of genetic science in the same way as today's extreme right wing political climate science deniers are in denial of the findings of modern climate science climate science. Both the Soviet communists of that time and the extreme right wing climate science deniers sought/seek to mislead and responsible media editors and journalists have a duty to not mislead the public. You can always go to the Russian rump of Soviet communism where ex KGB head and President will support denial of climate science. The political spectrum is circular with the extremes singing from the same songbook.

Will this be the same country that believes that because the EU is treated as a block for emissions targets and that as the UK's targets are particularly stringent then it can relax it's own targets to compensate.
