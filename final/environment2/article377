Queensland's soaring pollution rate 'threatens national emissions target'

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a> faces a “dramatic escalation” in carbon pollution that guarantees Australia will fail to meet even its “weak” greenhouse targets unless the commonwealth sets a price on emissions, the state’s environment minister, Steven Miles, has warned.</p>

<p>A state government report shows that Queensland, Australia’s single largest polluter, is on track for a 35% rise in carbon emissions by 2030.</p>

<p>Queensland’s high emissions are due to its heavy reliance on coal for electricity, heavy use of fuel for transport, gas processing for export and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/29/exclusive-land-clearing-surge-in-qld-set-to-wipe-out-direct-action-gains-report">a recent surge in land clearing</a>.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/29/exclusive-land-clearing-surge-in-qld-set-to-wipe-out-direct-action-gains-report">Exclusive: land-clearing surge in Queensland set to wipe out Direct Action gains – report</a> </p>

<p>And after clearing laws were relaxed under the former Newman government, it accounts for 90% of Australia’s emissions from deforestation.</p>

<p>In 2013-14 its land clearing doubled to 300,000ha – half the annual rate of deforestation in the Amazon in Brazil – and a similar result is expected for 2014-15.</p>

<p>In the same year power stations began to switch back to higher-emitting coal because exporting gas was more profitable than burning it for electricity, thanks to a new export pipeline to Asia.</p>

<p>Miles said the state government’s pending bill to limit tree clearing was the “most important lever” it could pull to limit carbon pollution, which had been falling in Queensland between 2005 and 2011.</p>

<p>But the new pollution projections, at what the report said was “the very time emissions need to be reduced”, showed this alone would not be enough.</p>

<p>“This new modelling shows that emissions in Queensland, if we do nothing new, will escalate dramatically,” Miles said.</p>

<p>“This is the effect of Campbell Newman’s LNP government dismantling successful climate-change programs that were in place in Queensland.</p>

<p>“But it also demonstrates what happens when the national government has no effective climate mitigation programs.</p>

<p>“How can [the federal environment minister] Greg Hunt and [the prime minister] Malcolm Turnbull honestly say that they will achieve a 26% to 28% increase with no new climate policies when Queensland, their highest emitting state, is going to increase its emissions by 35%?”</p>

<p>Miles said Australia was “the only developed country to go backwards on climate policy” by repealing a carbon price.</p>

<p>“The targets [the commonwealth] has set are not high enough and we should be doing our fair share, but even their weak targets will be impossible to meet with Queensland on its current trajectory,” he said. </p>

<p>“They need to do more. The national government needs to bring in an appropriate policy mechanism to achieve the targets they’ve set.</p>

<p>“We’ve always said the way to address carbon emissions here in Australia is with a market-based mechanism, a cap-and-trade mechanism, that puts a price on pollution and allows the economy to accommodate that price.</p>

<p>“We had a carbon price. The fact it’s not there means emissions are continuing to increase, particularly in Queensland where we have the legacy of not just a failing national policy but also a state government that wilfully and recklessly objected to the community transitioning away from carbon pollution.”</p>

<p>Wilderness Society Queensland’s campaign manager, Tim Seelig, said 18 months of land clearing in Queensland was enough to wipe out $670m worth of carbon abatement through tree planting and preservation by the Turnbull government’s emissions reduction fund. </p>

<p>“This is a national tree clearing crisis that requires immediate action,” Seeling said.</p>

<p>“The Queensland parliament must urgently fix the state’s tree clearing laws. The Turnbull government must also step in to ensure a strong national plan is in place to control tree clearing and make sure Queensland cannot revert back to weakened laws at any stage in the future.”</p>

You talk RUBBISH!. I can show you my gas/electricity accounts for the period since the liar Abbott took power, and these have not diminished since the abolition of the CT. Within my family (yes, workingclass, 5 people), nothing has changed over the last 6 years. We need a healthy environment - humans will not prosper in an environmentally degraded world.

It's a bit hard to undo land clearing. Even the English are smart enough to leave a bit of green around the edges of their fields but Queensland farmers clear fell hundreds of hectares. Where did they learn their land care techniques? Handed down through the generations which we can trace back to a couple of convicts from East London (who'd never seen a field before the fronted up here), I imagine.

Under the Labor / Green Fed Govt, electricity prices skyrocketed, partly because of the insidious carbon tax. So much for caring about low income families, what a joke they are.

A carbon tax is a market mechanism to price in an external cost. Most smart Companies are already pricing in a carbon price in their investment decisions. I think I'd trust the intelligence of those business leaders more than you as they live in the real world unlike you.

Completely agree that another three years will inflict damage on an unimaginable scale. I am satisfied it is largely feeble mindedness on the part of our people. They have fixed in their heads the glories of the Menzies and Howard years either directly or from their parents/grandparents. Even though the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming this idea seems to prevail, that the LNP are better managers. It does not help that the MSM amplifies any Labor fault real or otherwise while burying the numerous failures by the LNP. Letting that pass without question is also feebleness.

I sent an email to the Queensland environment minister 12 months ago, criticising the mining of coal at the Carmichael mine and the support they were giving for the mine. Didn't get the courtesy of a reply. Now the bloody stupid politicians are moaning about pollution. We have the same calibre of govt. members as those clowns in the U.S. DUMB.

Yes, a good point and at the beginning I admired Turnbull's ruthlessness in arranging the Savva attack on Abbott, but better to let the oaf continue I reckon.It'd be better to let Abbott carp away from the side-lines, because knuckle draggers like that were a god-send for the Labor party.Turnbull might be an intelligent turd, ruthless and offensively smug https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzEFwunM9-U but he knows to have a chance of re-election he must have Abbott by the goolies.I dunno if it's feebleness or ignorance that might allow folks to give the great waffler a three year term, but at the end of it what would we have left.Already the LNP has set about cutting the balls off the CSIRO, knackering the ABC, ensuring the RET Agency is government controlled.I reckon hell will freeze over before the LNP admits a carbon price is the way to go.
