The eco guide to running out

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t’s hard to imagine running out of loo roll, never mind the rare minerals that power our economy and appliances. But depletion looms as we speed through the Earth’s resources and climate change alters the rules.</p>

<p>We’re reaching, or have surpassed, the peak availability of copper, lithium (essential for the electric vehicle revolution), phosphate, anchovies, artisanal coffee and even chocolate. Cause yourself peak anxiety and read Richard Heinburg’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://richardheinberg.com/bookshelf/peak-everything"><em>Peak Everything</em></a><em>: Waking Up to the Century of Declines</em>.</p>

<p>You may feel lithium and copper shortages are not your problem. They might be soon. Take phosphorus: All agricultural systems depend on it. . Yet demand could outstrip supply in 30-60 years. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-looming-copper-supply-crunch/">Copper</a> is essential to electronics, everything in your house and medical technology (including MRIs). And we’re facing a 10m tonne supply deficit by 2028.</p>

<p>Here’s your strategy. 1) Be a smarter consumer. Remember that 20-40% of British-grown crops don’t even make it into stores thanks to overproduction and aesthetic appearance. Smart consumers seek out production gluts and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://feedbackglobal.org/gleaning-network-eu-2/">glean ugly, rejected fruit and veg</a> destined for the dump.</p>

<p>2) Be a better consumer: 500m small-scale farmers produce 80% of the world’s food by value but research shows a farmer shortage is looming. They won’t continue to produce our coffee and cocoa if they can’t make a fair living. Buying from the producer-centric Fairtrade system is imperative to securing future supply. Try <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.divinechocolate.com/uk/">divinechocolate.com</a>.</p>

<p>3) Be a real consumer. As campaigner Orsola de Castro (blogging at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://fashionrevolution.org/">fashionrevolution.org</a>) points out, the word “consumer” means to use up a material, not squander resources on hardly used items and shovel them prematurely into landfill.</p>

<p>Inspired by Hyperion, the world’s tallest tree, architectural practice Vincent Callebaut has drawn up a spellbinding, utopian plan for six wooden tower blocks in New Delhi that will include 1,000 homes, offices, gyms and restaurants. A sustainable, productive garden will wrap around each 36-storey-high tower. This ecosystem project will unite high-density living with small-scale farming and actually create energy.</p>

<p>You literally cannot buy these items from some of Sweden’s hottest fashion brands, including Filippa K, Hope, House of Dagmar, Nikolaj d’Étoiles, Uniforms for the Dedicated, Weekday and Whyred. You can only “share them forward”. Because rather than ready-to-wear, this collection is ready-to-share. Here’s how it works: the collection is uploaded to Instagram, and the first user to comment on the photo of an item is eligible to borrow it for one week. (You can also contribute to the ShareWear collection with your own pieces, sharing pictures of your own clothes using the hashtag <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://sharewear.se/">#sharewear</a>). All pieces are then available in the digital showroom at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://sharewear.se/">sharewear.se</a>. You can see where an item is and when it will be available to borrow again. A refreshing, disruptive take on fashion that messes with the idea of ownership. Share it.</p>

Mostly good ideas although they range from the do-able to the very aspirational. I pause at the concept of sharing shoes though. As someone who spent a lot of her youth wearing hand-me-downs, it's very uncomfortable to wear shoes that another person has already worn and broken in to their foot shape.
