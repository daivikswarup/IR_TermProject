Sumatran orangutan numbers double but fires destroy habitat

<p>There are twice as many Sumatran orangutans alive than previously thought but the critically endangered great ape is far from out of the woods, say researchers who conducted the landmark survey.</p>

<p>Loss of forest habitat is the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2013/feb/14/sumatran-orangutan-tripa-indonesia-deforestation">biggest threat facing Sumatran orangutans</a>, followed by the illegal pet trade and poaching.

<p>“The chance that there will be zero [Sumatran orangutans] in the near future is certainly less now,” said the lead author of the survey, Serge Wich, of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.</p>

<p>Wich and his colleagues estimated there were about 14,600 living in the wild, compared with the 6,600 Wich and colleagues <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1937420&amp;fileId=S003060530800197X">estimated in 2008</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier estimates suggested the population had <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/39780/0">dropped by 80% in the past 75 years</a> and Wich said the new findings would not significantly change that figure. </p>

<p>“There has been so much forest loss in Sumatra during the past decades that the population will still have declined [about] that much, albeit a bit less.”</p>

<p>He said it was vital to realise this did not meant the population was growing. Rather, the new survey looked more closely at places where it was previously thought no orangutans lived. </p>

<p>They surveyed regions in Sumatra 1,500m above sea level, whereas previous surveys assumed no orangutans would live above 900m. They also looked at areas that had previously been logged and were surprised to find some orangutans repopulating the areas. Finally, they surveyed areas further west, where orangutan populations were only recently discovered.</p>

<p> The authors concluded that previous estimates “drastically underestimated” the animals’ range, now estimated as 2.56 times as big as previously thought.</p>

<p>But with more orangutans, there were also more to be lost. Modelling the impact of future deforestation, the researchers found as many as 4,500 individuals could be lost by 2030.</p>

<p>But Wich warned that protecting Sumatran orangutans was not just a matter of avoiding extinction of the whole species.</p>

<p>“Not all orangutans are the same,” he said. “What we have discovered in orangutans, similarly as in chimpanzees and other great apes, is there are these differences between populations: different rich cultures of different vocalisations, different tool use and other behaviours. If we lose the orangutans in the peat swamp areas, say, then we lose most of the tool use cultures in orangutans in Sumatra.”</p>

<p>The discovery that Sumatran orangutans lived at higher altitudes opened up the promise of exciting new findings, he said. Initial observations suggested those orangutans had a different diet, eating trees not consumed by orangutans in lower-lying areas. And they used tools differently too, Wich said. “There’s some unique cultural behaviours.”</p>

<p>The discovery that orangutans seem to live in forests that have been affected by logging suggested they might be more resilient to human impacts than previously thought.</p>

<p>Wich said the new population estimate was unlikely to change the animals’ conservation status, which the International Union for Conservation of Nature <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/39780/0">lists as “critically endangered”</a>.</p>

<p>“If we look at forests that have been logged, the reduction in numbers is still big enough for them to remain critically endangered,” he said.</p>

<p>Wich said it was urgent that <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/indonesia">Indonesia</a> enforced its anti-deforestation regulations.</p>

<p>“There are regulations that there shouldn’t be any forest clearance when peatland areas are deeper than 3m, but it still happens,” he said. “And there shouldn’t be deforestation on slopes more than a certain steepness but it still happens. And deforestation happens in protected areas too.”</p>

<p>He said <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/30/indonesian-government-must-halt-road-through-orangutan-reserve-says-green-prize-winner">roads through orangutan habitats</a> should be stopped where possible, since illegal clearing often happened around roads.</p>

<p>But he agreed the research finding was definitely good news. “It does give us, in a way, some more time to try to put conservation strategies in place.”</p>

<p>Sumatran orangutans are one of two distinct species of orangutans. Bornean orangutans number about 50,000 or 60,000. Sumatran orangutans have longer, paler fur and slightly longer faces. Orangutans are the only great apes that live in Asia, besides humans.</p>

<p>Orangutans spend most of their time in trees, moving through forests by swinging between them. They are the largest arboreal animal in the world. </p>

Is there a legal way?

It's more that other oils became more expensive than that palm oil got cheap. After decades of falling prices, the price of all vegetable oils soared when EU motorists were forced to buy biodiesel at whatever cost. This caused a large increase in the rate of oil palm expansion, especially on to tropical peat forest, with disastrous climate consequences as well as habitat loss. Even though vegetable oil prices have recently been falling again along with crude oil prices, they are still well above 2001 levels.

Did you know that, in Indonesia, some female orangutans are illegally used in bestiality, even dressing them up as women. Some people deserve to be castrated.

Yes, contrary to popular belief it's not 'hard' to check labels and go for products without palm oil.

Australia’s cooked food industry has an insatiable appetite for palm oil. Go to any supermarket, for instance, and read the label of any cooked product such as from an in or ex situ bakery and you’ll find that it contains palm oil, either by way of direct designation or by dint of having been included under the heading ‘vegetable oil’. And remember, if the label lists several types of oil, the first-mentioned is always the predominant one. So that if the label says ‘palm oil, canola oil’, the product may contain 99% palm oil, 1% canola oil.Take-away food outlets, from the most prominent ones to other places that produce cooked foods sold either hot or cold follow such a process of cooking with palm oil.Have you ever noticed how you cannot buy a bottle of palm oil in a supermarket? A couple of times I asked a store attendant to find me a bottle – just for interest’s sake. They are simply non-existent.That’s because such oil is too cheap; and that’s also the reason why the manufacturers of cooked foods use this type of oil.And the reason why palm oil is cheap is because of cheap labour costs associated with the harvesting of palm oil by, for instance, poor Sumatran natives - in the process of which natural habitats, such as where the endangered orang-utans live, are destroyed.There’s another aspect to this saga. The medical profession will tell you that palm oil is the worst oil you can stuff into your body, because it clogs up your arteries, big time; as does coconut oil, for example, which in the artery-clogging department comes second to palm oil.You may say you don’t care. But the government does care; that’s to say, it doesn’t care if you stuff yourself with this stuff because of the mantra consumption is good for business and business is good for employment and wealth, these things being important for re-election of governments.The only drawback of course is that the sicker, the unhealthier people get, the greater the dollar-burden on the nation’s health care system; and don’t we know that’s getting more and more expensive: didn’t Scott Morrison want to increase GST by 50% predominantly for that reason?

We as consumers have some influence and if enough people stopped buying products with palm oil as part of the ingredients then by boycotting them we can make a difference.Marks and Spencer, it seems with virtually every food product from biscuits, liquorice all sorts, jelly tots, hot cross buns, Christmas puddings, mince pies, bread, soft drinks etc. all containing Palm oil. Marks and Spencers blatant disregard for safe guarding the rain forests from the abuse of palm oil from plantations which were once pristine rainforests used whether from the questionable 'Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil certification or not, M&S must take action immediately and take rainforest destruction more seriously and change to using Palm Oil alternatives to give customers like myself a real alternative se we can have a choice to purchase sustainable products like coconut oil, olive oil, sunflower oil etc. and we as consumers can all help make a difference to reduce rainforest destruction at the end point of its use.

I was lucky to visit Bukit Lawang Orangutan sanctuary in 1986 , 30 years ago and amazed and pleased to hear it is still surviving today. In those days Orangutans were being made homeless as the Sumatran rainforests were being cut down at an alarming rate then and I don't remember seeing any Palm oil plantations.  I am afraid to say that the madness of the rainforest destruction is an unstoppable inherent sick psychotic disease...and consumers of palm oil ingredients in products bought in Europe and the U.S. should know better and be better educated but too many either don't know, don't care or are apathetic to the fate of the rainforests. We need a miracle to save the remaining pristine rainforests ..whats left of them!?

Perhaps keeping one as a pet is a bad idea. Could i get one to join my embryonic monkey tennis all-star road show instead?

Sadly many have been taken as pets and often their mothers killed to do so.

I recently visited a place called Bukit Lawang in northern Sumatra and saw a couple of Orangutans in the wild, which is an experience I highly recommend.However the 3 ½ hour journey from Medan was mostly palm oil plantation’s which was quite disappointing to see.

Headline is totally misleading. Numbers have not doubled. They've just realised that there are twice as many as they thought a number of years ago. Great app here that scans food for palm oil when shopping: http://www.palmoilinvestigations.org

You can adopt one to help pay for its care, usually babies of parents that have been killed.

If this is supposed to be a joke, it's not funny - numbers are still in serious decline and the pet trade is an important reason behind that. Joking about something like this might encourage people to think it's OK. It is not. And if you're not joking, then I pray the moderators remove your comment before any readers do get the impression that suggesting keeping a Critically Endangered, CITES Appendix I, dangerous animal as a pet is anything other than atrocious

60,000 might sound like a lot but that's the size of a medium sized regional town. 1 Orang for every 100,000 people on the planet.
