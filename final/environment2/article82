Record fines for UK property developer who destroyed bat roost




DateTime::::2016-03-10T12:12:07+0000



<p>A property developer who destroyed a bat roost has been ordered to pay record compensation under a law usually deployed against drug dealers. <br/> <br/>Isar Enterprises was told to pay £10,730 in fines, costs and a confiscation of profits order after it failed to obtain the legally required licence to remove a roost of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/-brown_long-eared_bat-829.html">brown long-eared bats</a> from offices it was redeveloping in Matlock. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>It is the first time that the Proceeds of Crime Act, which seeks to ensure that offenders do not benefit from criminal behaviour, has been used in a case of bat crime. All <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/uk_bats.html">17 bat species</a> found breeding in Britain are protected by law and it is an offence to destroy roosts in houses, outbuildings or trees without a licence and professional advice to ensure they are not removed while hibernating or rearing young. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>The Bat Conservation Trust (BCT), which each year reports to the police more than 120 cases of bat roosts being illegally destroyed, hailed the verdict as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.bats.org.uk/news.php/317/most_significant_conviction_for_bat_crime_ever_recorded">“the most significant conviction for bat crime ever recorded”</a>. <br/> <br/>“Up until now, the fines seldom exceeded the financial gain from not following the law,” said Peter Charleston, investigations officer for the BCT. In this case, however, the fines are greater than the additional cost if the developer had abided by the law and removed the bats in a lawful way. <br/> <br/>According to Charleston, the case sets a precedent by establishing bigger fines for destroying bats and the use of the Proceeds of Crime Act to ensure that penalties are greater than any financial gain. “This case is going to be used in the future to inform decisions by the police, the crown prosecution service and the courts,” he said. <br/> <br/>He added: “Having bats in your property is unlikely to prevent you doing what you want to do – it’s a case of doing things at the right time and in a manner that doesn’t have detrimental impact on the bats. Offending is avoidable but if you choose to ignore the issues and commit criminal offences you need to be aware that it is something that the police will take seriously.” <br/> <br/>Judge John Burgess told Derby crown court that the offence had not been intentional but was, “at best” negligent and fined Isar Enterprises £3,000, with £2,000 costs and a proceeds of crime order of £5,730. An additional conviction for the Birmingham-based company director Hargudial Singh Rai was quashed by the judge. <br/> <br tabindex="-1"/>Charleston, a former police officer specialising in wildlife crimes, praised the Wildlife Crime Unit – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/01/uks-national-wildlife-unit-wins-late-reprieve-from-closure">recently reprieved from funding cuts by the government</a> – for its involvement in the case. “Having them around to assist investigating officers is a godsend. We’re very pleased and relieved that the unit has now received funding for the next four years.”</p>

Let's hope the next one is truly proportionate. Remove any profits from the endeavour, and force them to pay back the increased value of the property.

Not defending the guy but why do you assume he's rich, just because he's a developer?I know 2 'property developers' and they are by no means rich.The sweeping generalisations on Cif are rife.

I still think this is a paltry fine compared with the advantages they gained by not following the proper procedures.

Should of lost any profit on the development and banned from doing any development where bats might reside in the future. Hit them in the pocket.

He should have gone to prison and the fine should be much larger.It is about time wildlife crime was taken more seriously by the courts.

The developer obviously should be grateful as they got off lightly. One assumes that the fine of £3.000 was for the offence under The Wildlife and Countryside Act (WACA). He was lucky in that he could've been liable for a max of £5,000 per animal, with roosts often having tens of animals.Losing the profit is a start and may well deter this developer but will it deter other developers

What's a mere £10k to a rich property developer? Some jail time would have really taught a lesson...



Author::::Rob S
DateTime::::2016-03-10T15:10:20Z
The cost of the fine will simply be put on to the asking price of the new development. Still not enough of a deterrent

The habit of just destroying such as roosts for bats is quite common. We had a number that lived in the roof space of a large old house close by for at least 25 years. The council were told several times they were there but chose to look the other way when giving redevoplment consent to build 15 houses on the site. Haven't seen a bat since on summer nights, do miss flicking up in the air little silver paper ball for them to home in on

A few years ago, when I worked in ecological consultancy, I heard many cases from senior colleagues where they had discovered clear signs of bat habitation in recently developed old buildings, but not enough in terms of evidence to prosecute - this was despite their expert knowledge leading them to suspect the bats had simply been "dealt with" prior to the ecological survey being comissioned! Custodial Sentences and far higher fines need to be brought in to tackle this largely under-the-radar issue.

Your sympathy is misplaced. The law requires them not to be reckless towards bats, so they should have done a survey and made their arrangements for the bats before they needed to fork out any substantial expenses on starting the development.

If someone can get jailed for four years for making a comment about wrecking their local town, without actually intending to do anything, then I don't see why it would be an overreaction in this case.

It was more than a fine, it was, under the proceeds of crime stipulation, seizure of the profits made on the work which disturbed the bats.

The fine is a deterrent, because it is more than the cost of consulting a qualified ecologist and carrying out the mitigation required.

It is possible it won't hurt them much- they appear to be one end of a chain ofproperty developing companies. Usually they are all run by the same people but are isolated financialy from each other.

A fine is just not enough, there are developers who care not a jot and will try to get away with as mush as they can. Even if caught, will likely see it as a chance game and they probably won't get caught the next time.
