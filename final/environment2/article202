Liz Truss is choosing to protect farmers over flood victims




DateTime::::2016-01-07T10:08:55+0000



<p>Those of you with memories longer than a week will be aware that Britain experienced a degree of hydrological inconvenience in December. You know: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/05/floods-hit-16000-properties-wettest-december-century">16,000 homes inundated</a>, £5bn of damage, that kind of thing. I vaguely recall that it made the news once or twice.</p>

<p>You may also remember that, for the first time in Britain, there was a wide-ranging discussion on the causes of the floods. Connections that have been familiar to geographers, hydrologists and fluvial geomorphologists for two centuries finally broke through the media dam and into public debate. We began, at last, to discuss the second component of freshwater flooding.<br/></p>

<p>The first component is of course heavy rainfall (or snow melt). The second is the way that land and rivers respond to this deluge. If land and rivers are managed to enable them to hold back the water, slow the flow to the lowlands (where almost everyone lives) and reduce the height of the flood peak, flood defences at the bottom of the catchment are less likely to be overwhelmed. If, instead, the water flashes off the land and rushes down the rivers as quickly as possible, the chances of disaster downstream are significantly raised.</p>

<p>So reducing the likelihood of devastating floods means considering a river’s catchment as a whole, rather than treating different sections of it as isolated components. It means retaining water in the hills (where most of the rain falls) for as long as possible, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/13/flooding-public-spending-britain-europe-policies-homes">by allowing trees to grow</a> and bogs to form.</p>

<p>It means leaving obstructions in rivers and the streams and ditches that feed them, to impede the water that flows through them. This means letting the main channels meander and braid, developing islands, gravel banks, riffle runs and pools. It means allowing wood and other vegetation to accumulate in the feeder streams and ditches, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-flooding-how-a-yorkshire-flood-blackspot-worked-with-nature-to-stay-dry-a6794286.html">to act as leaky dams</a>, restraining the flow of water (beavers, by the way, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28488-should-the-uk-bring-back-beavers-to-help-manage-floods/">can greatly enhance this process</a>). It means reconnecting rivers to their floodplains where it is safe to do so, holding the water back on farmland, rather than allowing it to balter down to the nearest town.</p>

<p>When very high rainfall hits a country, not all the water can be retained at the top of the catchment. Some parts of the floodplain must flood. Either fields take the water, or the river is rushed past them with the help of embankments, canalisation and dredging, so that the homes, schools, sub-stations, roads and railways downstream cop it instead. The obvious way of resolving this choice is to pay farmers to store the water in their fields until the flood peak passes. Yes, it’s inconvenient for the farmers, but it causes hundreds of times less damage, expense and misery than the alternative.<br/></p>

<p>There’s nothing exotic or esoteric about this knowledge; it’s common currency among scientists, insurers and government officials. In fact everyone involved in seeking to prevent homes and infrastructure from being flooded seems to be aware of it, except the person in charge: the secretary of state for the environment, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liz-truss">Liz Truss</a>.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>That, at least, is the charitable interpretation. For if she possesses even the vaguest flicker of awareness of basic hydrology, the policies she announced this week must be ascribed to something worse. Something like this: the appeasement of special interests at the expense of the rest of the population. Is she really as blitheringly ignorant of a central aspect of her brief as her announcement suggests, or is she placing the demands of one sector above the wellbeing of the nation?<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>At the Oxford farming conference on Wednesday, as if nothing had happened in the preceding month, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/environment-minister-addresses-the-oxford-farming-conference--2">Truss revealed</a> that she is intends to go ahead with her long-standing plan to allow farmers to dredge and clear the water courses passing through their land, without oversight, regulation, or consideration of the impacts downstream, in order to prevent their fields from flooding.</p>

<p>She also intends “to give internal drainage boards and other groups more power to maintain local watercourses”. The autonomy of internal drainage boards has long been recognised <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/29/deluge-farmers-flood-grouse-moor-drain-land">as part of the problem</a>: dominated by local landowners, they tend to be narrowly focused on getting water off farmland as quickly as possible. They are responsible for much of the embankment, canalisation and dredging that speeds rivers into people’s homes.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>She capped this madness by announcing that the government “will be protecting an additional million acres” of farmland from flooding by 2021. I repeat: when extreme rainfall strikes, you can’t protect both farmland and homes; a choice has to be made. And the secretary of state for the environment has chosen to use public money to make the flooding of the built environment more likely.</p>

<p>Why do I suspect that Truss cannot be as ignorant as the charitable interpretation would suggest? Because advice to the contrary by her own officials continues to be not only ignored but purged.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>I’ve mentioned <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/07/hide-evidence-storm-desmond-floods-paris-talks">in previous articles</a> how reports by Natural England and the Environment Agency on rational catchment management have been deleted and pulped. Now, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.anglingtrust.net/news.asp?itemid=2851&amp;itemTitle=Defra+proposals+to+protect+farmland+could+make+flooding+worse+and+damage+wildlife&amp;section=29&amp;sectionTitle=Angling+Trust+News">thanks to the Angling Trust</a>, we discover that another, crucial Environment Agency document has been removed from public view. Titled “Evidence: Impacts of dredging”, and first published in 2013, it has now been deleted from all government websites. The trust <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.anglingtrust.net/core/core_picker/download.asp?id=6971">has republished it</a>.<br/></p>

<p>Here is some of the advice this document contains:<br/></p>

<p>“Increasing risk downstream: Dredging could in theory speed up flow and potentially increase the risk of flooding downstream. This is fully covered by the existing research.”</p>

<p>“Channels which have been artificially deepened by dredging silt-up more frequently as they return to their pre-dredged state. In these situations dredging will be an unsustainable activity since it needs to be repeated regularly. The best approach is to identify the sediment source and address the issue at source rather than treat the impact.”</p>

<p>“Dredging can damage ecology by directly affecting its physical habitat, disrupting riverine processes and reduced connectivity with the floodplain.”</p>

<p>“Dredging may also make a channel more vulnerable to exploitation by invasive non-native species such as signal crayfish and Himalayan balsam.”</p>

<p>So, if the advice conflicts with the policy, what do you do? Change the policy? Not on your life. Get rid of the advice. And if that’s the kind of censorship you might expect in rogue states, not the United Kingdom, who cares?<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Why is this happening? The National Farmers’ Union gives us a clue. Its president, Meurig Raymond, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35246752">told the BBC</a>: “The NFU has pressed Defra [the environment department] and the Environment Agency to enable farmers to undertake minor works for many years.” At the Oxford farming conference, he got what he wanted. And to hell with everyone else.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>That wall between 17 Smith Square, London SW1, where Truss’s department is based, and 16 Smith Square, London SW1, occupied by the National Farmers’ Union, is looking thinner than ever. Under Truss, Defra – which claims to be the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but really stands for Doing Everything Farmers’ Representatives Ask – appears to be even more susceptible to lobbying and regulatory capture than it was under her predecessor, Owen Paterson.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>As for the people who live downstream of the orgy of dredging, channel clearing and field protection that Truss has just licensed - and have just been condemned by her to even greater misery when the next storms break - sorry, who are you again?<br/></p>

Monbiot clearly knows little about flood defence. Few defences of agricultural land are against floods of more than the ten or twenty year floods.: ie the odds against them failing in any one year are 10to1 or 20 to 1. These probabilities shorten rapidly for periods of 4 or 5 yearsThe other thing is that there is always a bigger flood waiting to happen. Total protection is neither practical nor affordable. The best that can be done is to provide adequate warnings to threatened areas and for people to seek to protect their most valued possessions.I have attended the aftermath of many floods and the skips of possessions are burned in my memory as well as the traumatic effect on those involved.Riverside, Millside, Summerfield are places to avoid when looking for property. When, not if, the nearby river/stream overflows, where silly he water go?

Traditionally, farmers (in the sense of owners of larger farms rather than tenants) have been conservative. There are reasons for this but the main one, to my mind, would be the identification of their goals with those of King and Country.

Sue I agree with all that you say except agri environment schemes - they are a double edge sword and can create as many problems as they solve. To understand this you have to see how the economics of land use work out. Agri- environment schemes actually are capitalised into land values and rents and as such make land acquisition much more (probably about 20 times more) expensive. Also Agri-environment schemes shift the margin of production and actually cause land that would be uneconomic to be farmed to remain in production at a higher intensity, destroying wildlife.

Trees grow themselves they just need land, we need less land owned and farmed. I want the wildlife of this world to have its place irrespective of the false 'charity' of landowners. The tragedy of private landownership is that in aggregate Landowners are the problem not the solution we need to change the system and not just try to buy off a few landowners to have a few more trees on their land, the economics just do not stack up and we will continue to loose biodiversity.

At least you've heard of Cobbett. I have lived in England in the past and I am not under any illusion that nothing has changed there since 1822 when he was riding about on horseback. I find much to disagree with in his views but his work gives a good bit of historical perspective to the change over from an agricultural society to an industrial mercantile one. The current dependence of Britain's economy on "invisible assets" and financial deals is not the same as it was in Cobbett's time but his criticism of stock-jobbers and what he calls "the wen" does have certain parallels to the casino economics of the present.

Your farm is probably uneconomic to produce food at a competitive price and thus you will go out of business. I have no interest in your personal financial position. I am interested in a fair and just system that rewards good work useful to the community and punishes monopoly and bad outcomes for all. Your self interest is of no concern to me. Self interest is at the heart of all the problems in society and ecological destruction it is also a major issue in effective and efficient flood mitigation.

It was the carte blanche policy given to farmers that originally created much of the problems we see today with waterwater and mud ending up in people's front rooms.  it is a fact that the predecessors to the environment agency along with the ministry of Agriculture actively promoted the drainage of agricultural land, especially infloodplains, facilitated by river dredgingdredging done by the EA's predecessors. I was told that the National Rivers Authority actually used to fly over floodplains looking for wet bits that could be drained so allowing farmers to do what they want on their land at anytime to speed water off land which should never have been drained in the first placeplace. Truss's decision is absolute Madness when we should be putting some of that drainage into reverse. Onee of the most obscene things I ever saw was in the Nene Washes in Cambridgeshire in the early 1980ss; the Nene Washes is an area of land designed for storing flood water to prevent Peterborough from floodingflooding. However one area had been in banked ditched and was being actively pumped so that a farmer who had land within the washers could grow carrots there; fortunately this is one area where that kind of thing is no longer happening and where the conservation ngos particularly RSPB now have large holdings. Also during that time we were still losing the last boggy fields and flashes on hillsides and in floodplains to improve the land for intensification either for arable or reseeded leys. About 15 years ago I had a privilege to look at some of the original 1960s land use survey that Alice Coleman spearheadedspearheaded - at that time I was involved in restoring flower rich grassland arable on claylands in West Buckinghamshire and those areas were very difficult to restore because they should never have been ploughed in the first place ... in the 1960s all that area was permanent grassland because it was stupid to do anything else with it. The drainage and ploughing of that area was another example where carte blanche land drainage for so called agricultural improvement was bad for farming, devastating for soils and bad for floodin .. But there are just so many examples of this. Of course the big consequence was for wildlife of flower rich boggy places such as the wild flowers, butterflies, snipe, redshank and the curlew. We started to see the tide begin to turn with Andrew Lees in the 1980s standing firm over the proposed drainage of Halvergate Marshes, thank goodness. This marked the first steps towards what we now know as the agri-environment schemes which remain the most important life line we have for protecting wildlife and countryside and arguably stopping some of the stupid things that many farmers will do unless they are paid not to. I now fear that the small gains made over the past 30 years are under threat.

The less sheep the better. The main destroyer of biodiversity in the uplands is the artificial nitrogen used to grow rye grass for sheep grazing. A profitable exercise, but only just; subsidies tip the balance. Take away the nitrogen (which has a huge carbon footprint) and all the wild flowers plus all the invertebrates, will slowly return. Sheep must be reduced or got rid of. But keep the farming communities by using the subsidies to return the uplands to a more natural state – native woodlands; wood pastures alongside restored and active peat bogs on the moors freed up from intensive grouse ‘farming’.  If you are worried about too much scrub taking over, then let cattle roam. They love to browse, in fact they are woodland animals by nature. Result: less compacted soils; more humus; more sponge-like sphagnum mosses; more rain absorbent peat; more statements of the obvious about runoff and peak flows with a reduced probability of overtopping flood barriers. A one per cent reduction will do. That translates every time, no matter how much rain, to a few more dry homes than would have otherwise been the case.

This is the same Liz Truss that wrote a book on how all workers rights should be stripped away and that all workers (not just 'some') in the United Kingdom are 'lazy'.

Absolute nonsense. The NFU may be a total shambles. one that should never have been allowed to draw up the govts legislation for DEFRA since 201 (check numerous sources - they have), but they do represent the mass of farmers, sorry farm owners, views. To claim, as you do, 'the majority do care' is as erroneous as you can get. Individual, tenant farmers may, but who cares what they think? They don't own the land, they have no say on how the land is managed, and they don't have the govts ear. They run the farms, tend the crops, tend the animals, but they cannot stop landowners from ruining the countryside.

Not sure you quite understand how this sort of drainage works - the water doesn't stay in the ditch it drains into the river system all year round so that the field is never waterlogged. If we have a massive deluge of rain and it lands on a dry (drained) field it doesn't enter the ditch immediately, it has to percolate through the soil to the drainage system. This takes a certain amount of time and though it is quite quick it is no where near as fast as the time it takes for surface water to run off a waterlogged field into the river system. That said I'm not altogether for drainage of all fields. There is a place for wet meadows that will hold far more water than an average field, however these will end up needing funding from somewhere as they, by their very nature, are not very agriculturally productive and therefore won't pay the rent!

This is in parts an inaccurate article. Farmers suffer from flooding too. On rivers such as the Kentish Stour obstructions in the river hold the water back and flood areas such as Canterbury as well as the water meadows. Each river has to be treated according to its origins, in some cases dredging and weed clearance is necessary and has been practised for generations to ease the flow through to the estuary.Has George forgotten that once our rivers had watermills and mill pools (10 on the Kentish Stour) controlling flows and necessitating some canalisation above the mill and that they were used for transport for thousands of years?

Just now I'm rereading Cobbett and though he has his reactionary views, he definitely cares for the land and the people who work it. The main object of his criticism is those who were taking over the land without any interest in husbandry. The wealthy take over the land and see it as a playground rather than a part of the yearly cycle of planting and harvesting. This was true of his time and is even more true today. These are the landed "gentry" that the Tories support.
