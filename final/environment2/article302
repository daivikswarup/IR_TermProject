Organic consumers avoiding processed and red meat, sales show




DateTime::::2016-02-23T15:12:24+0000



<p>Consumers of organic food are avoiding processed and red meats in favour of fish and poultry, according to data on UK buying habits for 2015.<br/></p>

<p>The move away from products such as sausages and bacon may be because high-end consumers are heeding growing warnings about their impact on health. That was reinforced by an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/26/bacon-ham-sausages-processed-meats-cancer-risk-smoking-says-who">assessment by the World Health Organisation in October</a> that placed cured and processed meats in the same category as asbestos, alcohol, arsenic and tobacco as major causes of cancer.</p>

<p>Sales of organic sausages and bacon were down 14.4% last year compared with 2014 and sales of red meat fell by 8.1%. In contrast, sales of poultry and fish were rose by 13.1% and 25.1% respectively.</p>

<p>The changes in consumer habits happened against the backdrop of a continued recovery for the sector with sales of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/organics">organic food and drink </a>in the UK growing for the third consecutive year by 4.9%. The Soil Association, the organic food trade association, believes this is due to more “millennial” consumers who are prepared to pay a premium for healthier options and shifting shopping patterns away from “the big weekly shop”.<br/></p>

<p>Shoppers splashed out an extra £1.73m a week on organic products in 2015, according to the Soil Association’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://securepayment.soilassociation.org/page/contribute/organicmarketreport2015">2016 Organic Market report</a> - as the steady rise of the market mirrored global growth and widening interest in the sector. Star performers in 2015 included jams and spreads (up 28.1%), and tea (up 12.8%).</p>

<p>The organic trade body - which also certifies products - forecast that the market, now worth £1.95bn, was set to recover further and top £2bn this year, leapfrogging its pre-recession peak of £2.11bn in 2008.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Although organic food and drink is dwarfed by the scale of the overall UK food and drink market - of which it has just a 1.4% share - sales of organic products have continued to outperform the non-organic grocery market which decreased by 0.9% in the same period as mainstream food retailers struggled to retain market share in the grip of an ongoing price war. </p>

<p>“In a year of challenging deflation, in which retailers have struggled to grow sales, organic products have performed exceptionally well,” said Clare McDermott, business development director with the Soil Association. “They offer a choice to customers who care about provenance and quality. Despite the turmoil in the market, savvy customers are searching out and remaining loyal to premium food options.” </p>

<p>This year’s figures also highlight a shift in consumer shopping habits away from a weekly shop in favour of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://In its annual barometer of consumer shopping and spending,http://www.waitrose.com/foodreport http://www.waitrose.com/foodreport">“little and often”.</a> The independent and box scheme sectors (which grew by 8.2% in 2015) have both benefitted from these changing habits and an increasing desire from consumers to avoid ready meals and “cook from scratch”. Consumers are now spending more than £544m every year through these channels.</p>

<p>The sustained interest in organic is driven by an increase in young and socially conscious “millennials” (born from 1980 to the early 2000s) with strong social, ethical and environmental values, the report said. They want to know the origins of their food and are willing to pay more for products with quality assurance standards supporting the environment, society and animal welfare. </p>

<p>A decade ago, supermarkets boasted around 80% of organic sales, but they now have less than 70% - equivalent to a £200m sales switch which have boosted independent retailers such as Planet Organic and As Nature Intended, which both opened major new stores last year. <br/></p>

<p>The four biggest retailers of organic continue to be Ocado, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Waitrose, with the lion’s share of total supermarket sales - 80% - between them. But the discounters Aldi and Lidl - through their established European networks - are broadening organic choice at a more affordable price in the UK. </p>

<p>Online retailer Ocado - hailed in the report as “a real success story” has increased its range from 2,654 lines to 3,344, with online sales of organic set to increase further. </p>

<p></p>

<p>At Tesco sales of organic fruit and vegetables have risen by more than 18% over the last year - double the market average. Tesco fruit commercial manager Gareth Wilcock said: “The revival of organic foods has been gathering pace over the last few years, with keener prices and better availability both playing a major part in that.”<em> <br/></em></p>

<p>George Scott, food and grocery analyst with Verdict Retail, said: “Organic food is no longer niche and I think this upward sales trend is here to stay. It is very significant that we have discerning consumers who are prepared to trade up for the foods where they want the best quality and assurances of provenance.”</p>

You never really needed Captain Crunch, Oreos, Chips Ahoy, bologna, and Jimmie Dean sausages, anyway, did you?

I find this stance on avoiding red meat quite irrational.

Fair enough.

Personally, if possible, I would always choose the more ethical option.

Oh no I have lots of cows and sheep, all with little impact. Unless you know different?

I don't know about your sheep, I was talking about animal species in general. Of course, if you have a few sheep or cows who live the 'organic' life then there could be little impact. On the whole though certain animals are worse than others. I'm more interested in the general impact of a certain species because it has bigger implications.

Or lamb? I think you will find my lamb is produced in more environmentally friendly way than just about any chicken you will buy :-)

Plus bycatch and the trust one has to give to existing fishing quotas.

Some of our food is classed as organic, we have a large allotment and don't use anything but manure, it is a site rule not to use certain pesticides etc.

Or, just maybe, they care about their health and choose to spend their limited funds on non-processed, non-chemically infused food produce.

True that. Are people not worried about mercury levels?!

Its a bit sad how natural food has a special name (organic). Shows how much garbage we put through our system with all these additives, chemicals and unmentionables. Hence why we have to be supported by a concuction of pills in later life ...

Gotta' love those "organic consumers" - all natural, and very tasty, I have been told.

With the way the ocean fish stocks are being depleted, is this actually good news?



Author::::EpicHawk
DateTime::::2016-02-23T16:55:53Z
This is good news for the environment, although people should not frequently eat fish as a replacement for red meat. It's even harder to trust the fishing industry. Chicken is a sensible choice and has far less environmental impact than beef or pork.

It is not a hardship to live without processed meats and any other kinds of processed foods. Just east very simply and organic. It is better for you.You never really needed Captain Crunch, Oreos, Chips Ahoy, bologna, and Jimmie Dean sausages, anyway, did you?

so organic foods have regained the sales of pre 2008 or have put their prices up. Need to see the increase in weight/volume rather than price.
