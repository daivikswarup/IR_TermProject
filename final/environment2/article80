Early nesters get started on rearing their young

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">F</span></span>or most of the year, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/g/greyheron/index.aspx" title="">grey herons</a> live a relatively solitary existence, lone individuals standing sentinel in the stream, stalking the mudflat pools on the low tide, or sailing silently over the house at dusk in pterodactyl-like silhouette. In spring, they assemble for the nesting season, usually returning to long-established heronries, but while they have always roosted alongside <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/l/littleegret/index.aspx" title="">little egrets</a> in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.countrysideinfo.co.uk/woodland_manage/broadlf3.htm" title="">alder carr</a> that borders the mill pond, the heronry here was only founded in 2014.</p>

<p>There are only eight nests, messy jumbles of twigs like giant <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://treesforlife.org.uk/forest/forest-ecology/plant-galls/" title="">witch’s broom galls</a>. Several of them are clustered in a squat, evergreen <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/visiting-woods/trees-woods-and-wildlife/british-trees/common-non-native-trees/holm-oak/" title="">holm oak</a>, the others in neighbouring trees. Herons are early nesters, with females usually beginning to lay in February, but the Langstone colony’s 2016 season got off to a premature start. Two pairs were seen courting in mid-December and both were sitting by January.</p>

<p>With the incubation period lasting 23-28 days, I was hoping to spot a chick. One adult lay flattened to her nest, the breeze stirring the slate-grey feathers on her back. Another was using her rapier bill, with its breeding season blush suggesting that she had applied a dab of lipstick, to gently manipulate something at her feet – eggs or chicks, I couldn’t tell.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bto.org/volunteer-surveys/heronries-census" title="">Completed nests</a> can reach a metre in diameter but several of the stick platforms were works in progress, females arranging twigs as males gathered building materials. As one male flew in with a whippy branch almost the width of his six-foot wingspan, a neighbour flapped up off its perch and tried to grab it. As the mugger’s neck snaked forward, the defending bird reared up, raising its crest, puffing out its chest and pulsing its wings to strike the thief, the prized stick tumbling from its grasp.</p>

<p>As the sun began to set, backlighting the colony with a golden apricot glow, the birds settled to roost. A nestling’s begging call, like two flints knocking together, rang out from the top of the holm oak. As one of its parents descended on deeply bowed wings, I glimpsed the downy punk hairdo and goggle-eyes of the young heron through the foliage.</p>

Here the starlings have flown in from foreign parts and are busy nesting in the one gap in a gable that is used by starlings every year. I have a notion this year to regularly play them a simple mobile phone alert to see if they will add it to their repertoire.

My favorite sentence 'As one of its parents descended on deeply bowed wings, I glimpsed the downy punk hairdo and goggle-eyes of the young heron through the foliage.'

I agrees, beautifully written and evocative.

Superbly written, and brings to mind how watching animals of any kind nearly always brings a smile to my face. My favorite sentence 'As one of its parents descended on deeply bowed wings, I glimpsed the downy punk hairdo and goggle-eyes of the young heron through the foliage.'

I have the good fortune to live near a park with some 30 breeding pairs (the largest heronry in any municipal park in the UK). The breeding/nesting season through to the chick rearing make fascinating watching even for the non-ornithologist. Constant arrivals, departures and skirmishing, I can lose hours to it.

Herons are beautiful birds to watch so still till they strike at their food.
