Major UK coal power plant closure 'will not lead to blackouts'




DateTime::::2016-02-04T15:20:35+0000



<p>The UK government and the electricity regulator moved on Thursday to reassure consumers that they will not face blackouts as the result of the closure of most of a major coal power plant.</p>

<p>Operator <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://sse.com/newsandviews/allarticles/2016/02/consultation-on-future-of-sses-fiddlers-ferry-power-station/">SSE said the closure</a> of three out of four generation units at the 2GW Fiddler’s Ferry near Manchester, which has made financial losses for two years, was likely to take place on 1 April. </p>

<p>The move was seen as significant because the company had a contract in place to provide back-up generation from the site, but falling oil and gas prices and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/18/energy-policy-shift-climate-change-amber-rudd-backburner">long-term signals from government on phasing out coal</a> have made coal-fired plants much less economical in the UK. </p>

<p>Ofgem said supplies of electricity for this winter would be unaffected, but that measures were needed to ensure supplies next year. </p>

<p>Ministers were understood to be disappointed at the SSE move, which highlights potential problems with the government’s electricity market reforms, under which generators are handed long-term “contracts for difference” to supply electricity. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>The Department of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> and Climate Change said: “There will be no impact on this winter and action has already been taken to secure extra capacity for next winter. We will continue to work alongside National Grid and Ofgem to take whatever additional steps are necessary to protect our energy supply.</p>

<p>“SSE’s intention to break their contract is extremely disappointing and they will have to pay a significant penalty.” <br/> <br/>Ofgem said: “The planned closure of Fiddler’s Ferry power station will have no impact on security of energy supply for the current winter. We are confident that electricity supplies will be secure next winter but there is no room for complacency. </p>

<p>“There are a range of tools to manage the electricity system. National Grid will be conducting its detailed review of energy security for next winter in due course. National Grid’s review will take into consideration all relevant factors, including this announcement.” <br/> <br/>Greens argued that the government’s lack of support for renewable energy would create problems with filling any supply gap with low-carbon power. </p>

<p>Molly Scott Cato, Green party MEP for the south-west, told the Guardian: “The move into the post-fossil era must inevitably bring about the end of coal-fired power-stations. It is of course difficult for those who lose their jobs during such an energy transition, but the German example proves that renewables actually offer many more skilled jobs per kWh than coal.” <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>She added: “The problem in this country is the mixed messages government is sending out on energy. While shutting down coal it continues to promote other fossil fuels, offering huge subsidies and support to oil, gas and fracking. It has also devastated the renewables sector through recent policy changes, destroying the jobs that could replace those lost in coal generation.”</p>

<p><br/><br tabindex="-1"/>A surge in renewable energy production and cheap gas prices have effectively priced coal-fired power plants out of the market in Britain. <br/> <br tabindex="-1"/>SSE said it was consulting staff on the closure but that shutdown from 1 April was a likely outcome. <br/> <br/>“The plant at the station is ageing, its method of generating electricity is being rendered out of date and it has been, and is expected to continue to be, loss-making,” said Paul Smith, managing director of the generation business at SSE, in a statement. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br/>Fiddler’s Ferry power plant, which employs 213 people, won a 2018-19 capacity market contract for three of its units in Britain’s first ever capacity market auction. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>These contracts reward successful bidders for keeping power plants on standby so they can be called upon when renewable energy production is low. They are a major pillar of the British government’s electricity market reform. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>SSE said it would incur a penalty charge of around £33m if it breaches the contract by closing the units. <br/> <br/>Last month, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/scottishandsouthernenergy">SSE</a> was unsuccessful in gaining a capacity contract for the power plant for the year 2019-20. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>The fourth generation unit at Fiddler’s Ferry is contracted by network operator National Grid to provide market balancing services during the winter of 2016-17. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>SSE declined to comment on what will happen to the unit after that contract expires.</p>

Something seriously wrong when coal stations are too expensive when all capital costs have been written down and it is more cost effective to run emergency diesel driver alternators. Rigged springs to mind.

There'll be very considerable costs to SSE - I rather doubt the sorts of treatment required to manufacture "coalswitch" itself comes for free.

The advantages of coal are 1. It can come from anywhere. The UK might buy from Russia because it's cheap - but Australia has plenty.2. It's easy to stockpile - as we discovered in the miners strike. A mothballed plant would be mothballed with a winter's supply of coal. (And the coal bunkers are already in place).

A lot of coal in the UK comes from Putin's Russia, most gas from Norway so for us coal generation puts us in his pocket.

Not to mention that despite the "record" breaking (amusing how easily people can be appeased), its per capita use of renewable energy is still much, much lower than many countries including the USA and the UK.

Of course the two not really being linked (why do that) as coal use is dropping due to their manufacturing decline.

How many GW can wind outputs be relied



Author::::whateverpoiuyt
DateTime::::2016-02-05T08:23:20Z
Nope. In terms of levelized costs (discounting subsidies), and including system costs (contingent grid upgrades, backup generation, or demand management) nuclear's costs stack up better than intermittent renewables. The difficulty is making the political sale, which is where the myth-makers of the Gruan are indispensable to the industry and a grave threat to our hopes for zero carbon.



Author::::whateverpoiuyt
DateTime::::2016-02-05T08:18:04Z
Obfuscation as usual. Lignite, even if it stops supplying baseload due to competition, is staying open in Germany under their equivalent of a capacity market arrangement to supply renewable balancing. Whereas in the UK the capacity market will still see all coal gone by 2025.

If you are concerned about climate change, ocean acidification etc, as I indeed am, then Nuclear power plants are the most practical solution.

Assume what you like about my qualifications, rather than disappear down a semantic wormhole I'd like to think we can bring about an electricity network that doesn't rely on burning the photosynthetic products of the carboniferous. Energy policy is easy if not aren't concerned with climate change, ocean acidification etc.

I have to admit I am unsure how the mechanisms work but I do know that the amazing beast that is Littlebrook D is now fully functional (all three units) and there are 550,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil in its storage tanks. If required it could fire up over 100MW in 5 minute and max power in under 4 hours. With recent upgrades over its original design and together with its "Concorde" engines (3x35MW OCGTs) it can belt out nearly 2.2GW. During the miners strike (I did some work on it at the time) it managed over 18,000GWh for a year which I believe is still a UK station record.There are others like this still around and you certainly wouldn`t want to throw them away!http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-electricity-oil-kemp-idUSKBN0MR2B520150401

sphenicus, you are quite clearly not an engineer, that is pretty obvious. But you also clearly have a problem understanding the term "reliable" as in "consistently good in quality or performance; able to be trusted." Wind power is "not consistently good in quality or performance; able to be trusted."It is therefore unreliable and also intermittent.



Author::::riveness
DateTime::::2016-02-04T19:18:14Z
Indeed. But instead of powering on renewables and leaving nuclear on (and also not using solar), Germany has lost a decade and a half. Their emissions from the grid are back to 1997-1999 ish levels. And BTW I meant that target was for 2014.

Did you miss the bit about the next ice age being delayed from 50-90,000 years out to 100,000 years? That is on the plus side on your mental balance sheet is it? So how does a 2m sea level rise by 2100 stack up? Can't see many winners in that scenario. And who are China manufacturing all these goods for?



Author::::spheniscus
DateTime::::2016-02-04T17:29:06Z
I'll tell you on Thursday the 25th, but probably between 2-6GW grid connected plus another 1-3GW embedded. No-one is pretending wind power is dispatchable but that is something different to unreliable. More storage and interconnection is required to deal with the daily demand cycle and for winter high pressure scenarios, with gas back-up in the short term.

What massive financial impact, can you quantify, is the more important question. Even if we accept that man is changing the climate there are positives and negatives, there will be winners and losers. A recent article in this paper talked about research which showed it had delayed the next ice age.What's more I only see cost, as our folly will just mean that industry will move to more sensible countries who have cheaper energy and can guarantee that the lights will stay such as China, who are far more polluting.

When you legally commit yourself to cut CO2 emissions by 80% without considering the consequences and costs you get these and many bad other policy decisions. Coal is cheap but is being priced out by carbon taxes. Green energy will never be as reliable or cheap, and nuclear is unlikely to come online before our coal fired power stations are taken out of production. As a result we will pay much higher costs for our electricity and will suffer blackouts, for this green lunacy. I hope they are prepared for the consequences because a modern economy need reliable energy to remain competitive.

It is not the closure of this plant that will cause blackouts. It is the continued refusal of successive governments to grasp the nettle of energy supply and get on and dam well commission new power plants. If no action is taken soon the lights will go out as there are further scheduled closures and as yet insufficient replacements approved.

Well at least the people who are always bemoaning the fact that "it used to be the Manchester Guardian" should be happy with this article. Fiddler's Ferry is not "near Manchester". It's in Widnes (or "Widnes, Northern England", as the photo caption has it). Widnes is "near Liverpool".

No, it doesn't, at all. We can fairly easily predict wind, solar, tidal and other renewable outputs. Sudden outages (such as 1-2GW of thermal plant dropping off due to a fire) are what causes the issues. Renewables could be seen to increase resilience, as one turbine, embedded solar installation failing is not the same as a centralised thermal plant dropping off.
