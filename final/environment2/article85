Record number of African rhinos killed in 2015




DateTime::::2016-03-09T22:00:01+0000



<p>A record number of rhinos were killed by poachers across <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a> last year, driven by demand in the far east for their horn.</p>

<p>The number slaughtered in their heartland in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica">South Africa</a>, which has four-fifths of the continent’s rhino, dipped for the first time since the crisis exploded nearly a decade ago.</p>

<p>But increases in the number of rhino poached in Nambia and Zimbabwe offset the small signs of hope in South Africa, leading to a record 1,338 to be killed continent-wide. A total of 5,940 have been poached since 2008.</p>

<p>Conservationists said it was possible that a clampdown by authorities in South Africa, where ministers have stepped up efforts against an illegal trade <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/23/600-rhinos-killed-south-africa-2013">that they say threatens the tourism industry</a>, have led to organised criminals moving their operations. </p>

<p>“They [poachers] operate like an amoeba so if you push in one place they expand elsewhere. What you may be seeing is a response at the regional level, where increased pressure in South Africa makes it more difficult for operatives to operate, having a response elsewhere,” said Mike Knight, chair of the respected International Union for the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/conservation">Conservation</a> of Nature’s African rhino specialist group.</p>

<p>The group met in late February at South Africa’s Kruger, a vast national park and poaching hotspot that is the size of Belgium and has a 1,000km border with Mozambique. The meeting heard that although record numbers of rhino were killed in 2015, the rate of increase across Africa had slowed.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have bad news that the poaching is still increasing but the good news is that we may be able to turn the rate of increase, so there is now a flicker of hope,” said Knight, who praised rangers for “putting their lives on the line”. One South African ranger was wounded by poachers earlier this year, he said.</p>

<p>The expert group said that the number of white rhino across Africa had levelled off in 2015 to 19,682-21,077, while the population of black rhino stood at 5,042-5,455, a growth of around 2.9% a year since 2012. South Africa, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/namibia">Namibia</a> and Zimbabwe are home to 95% of Africa’s rhino.</p>

<p>The situation in South Africa, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/21/rhino-poaching-levels-in-south-africa-fell-in-2015">where 1,175 rhino were killed in 2015</a>, is so bad that some private game reserves are selling off their rhino because of increasing security costs and fears over attacks on the animals and their staff, the IUCN said. </p>

<p>In Namibia the authorities worked well with local communities but it appeared they had sat “back on their laurels, thinking they are immune [to the wildlife trade]”, Knight said.</p>

<p>Alongside nationals from China, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand involved in the illegal wildlife trade, Knight said that for the first time he had heard of North Korean nationals being implicated, which he said was a trend that needed watching closely.</p>

<p>He praised the South African government for having realised the crisis was not just a “wildlife crime” but an “economic crime” too, and said other countries needed to follow that approach.</p>

<p>“You cannot win this war in the parks. You have to win it outside protected areas. [You can] only do that through intelligence, that has to come from whole government response. It’s not only [the] wildlife sector, it has to be customs and excise, it has to be police.”</p>

There is no way that a small trade in horns by SA farmers can possibly meet all demand for it in Asia. Such "above the counter" trade would just fuel demand and criminal networks would seek the extra needed horn illegally elsewhere. Rather rapidly all rhinos outside the farms would be wiped out, and then the armed gangs would come to the farms themselves. To dream of a market solution is to indulge in dangerous fantasy, with no basis in the real world. No two ways about it.

Exactly. 1. It is not Africans who are operating the criminal networks to supply demand for horn and ivory in Asian countries. The world is globalised and to pretend that problems stop at national borders is to play the proverbial ostrich.2. The criminal syndicates pay armed gangs and militias, including Islamist terror groups, for the ivory and horn. These groups are terrorising rural communities and killing African rangers. National governments need international help to stop this. 3. Extinction is forever, and it is not good enough to sit by and say the largest land mammals can go extinct if that's what the people who happen to live next to them want. 4. There are MANY African conservationists trying to stop the destruction of their national heritage and they need the support of people and organisations with resources. To play the childish anti-colonialism charade may give you some smug satisfaction but it is utter irresponsibility to abandon Africa in the face of the poaching juggernaut.

Are you that compassionless and cold hearted to allow these magnificent creatures to be poached or hunted to extinction. It is your kind of mentality the reason we are losing the earths species and the environment. Grow up and learn to be embrace nature and stop using innocent animals as some expendable commodity.

The medicinal trade is now a very small fraction of demand. The real issue is bling. Sad but true. And there is zero evidence that demand reduction is working. But for some weird reason, people oppose trade on the grounds that it is morally wrong. Africa could supply the demand for ivory and horn without a single animal dying - but as long as the western nations continue to oppose trade, that will never happen. And all those who oppose trade are feeding a huge myth - that somehow there is a way to stop Asia from using horn and ivory. They will stop when there is no more to be had, because it is profitable. Rather let them obtain ivory and horn through legitimate means - it is in everyone's interest to maintain rhinos and elephants in Africa. As things stand, the killing is set to continue. and Cites will in due course place its stamp of approval on that process.

They are not bred solely for their horns - that is bullshit. They are de-horned as a protection measure, and if they do ever get to sell the horn, as they should be allowed to do, the proceeds will help to cover the huge costs of protecting rhino. Transparent and regulated trade in horn is the only way we can stop the illegal killing. Anyone who is opposed to legal trade is by default supporting illegal trade. There are no two ways about it.



Author::::CallmeJimmy
DateTime::::2016-03-10T11:49:47Z
This is already happening - and of course the horn grows back. A bull rhino can grow up to 1.5 kg of horn a year. And although the poachers do still kill de-horned rhino, it significantly reduces the profit accruing to the poacher and the bosses who buy the horn.

You are correct - Sanparks is fighting a battle they can never win. They know it, but they have no choice but to fight this war. And if they were to stop their efforts, the carnage would be unthinkable. Because the trade in horn is illegal, there are no controls, no limits and the gangsters who run these supply chains will keep going until there are no more rhinos left to kill. A dead rhino is worth up to $500 000. Why would they stop? Because of Sanparks, we are still able to maintain South Africa's rhino population, but it is getting more and more difficult.

Wild animals don't have passports. Environmental problems don't stop at borders nor do habitats of wildlife. The tragic extinctions concern the whole world, not just the people that live there. The whole world with all its natural beauty is ours to take care of as sentient, conscious creatures.

If the UN had any guts they would charge China with encouraging genocide for that is what is taking place - the systematic genocide of elephants and rhinos. They should provide support to those agencies struggling to combat the poachers in the form of communications, transport and weapons. Ivory sales should be banned regardless of their origins. Humanity has a moral obligation to protect other species. If China and other Asian nations refuse to clamp down on this evil trade the West should initiate trade sanctions. We have an obligation to future generations to protect these noble creatures (all creatures).

My answer to the "i don't care" brigade: It affects you and your offspring. If you bothered a little with the mindset behind poaching and the underlying poverty as a result of universal plundering of resources, you would see that humans too are an endangered species!

Typical smugness from a South African conservationist - they experience a "dip" in poaching consisting of possibly 40 animals (and which could just be a result of not finding carcasses) and already they're advising the rest of Africa to follow their example!! SA rhino poaching is out of control, the authorities are totally unable to deal with it and the corrupt "axis of evil" consisting of the Afrikaaner farmers/vets/hunters, their east Asian friends and the judges who take their money aren't going anywhere. Why did the Vietnamese smuggler sentenced to ten years get out after only 10 months? Why have all the rich white landowners charged with rhino crimes been allowed out on bail? An example for the rest of Africa? Don't make me laugh.

I was in Botswana a couple of years ago and in general the security forces are not very friendly well, because I could have been a poacher's spy. Through a strange coincidence, I ended up sharing my vehicle and I said to the guy that is the biggest gun I have ever seen - why do you need a massive gun - "the poachers have even bigger guns" was his reply

Simplistic solutions like that do not work. They have had the army in Kruger ffs. We are talking the second biggest money making black market in the world. Billions of dollars. The funding of terrorist groups. The purchase of weapons. The links to other illegal global trade. Worldwide wildlife trafficking cartels buying off politicians, police, customs, soldiers, rangers etc. together with tens of millions of people living in poverty you have quite the predicament.

Kruger National Park loses around three per day. At any one time up to 16 or more teams of usually three male poachers are operating in the park at any given time. South African Rangers have shot and killed hundreds over the last five years. National Park rangers have been coopted into a type of insurgent war mainly with cross border Mozambique nationals. Mozambique have largely done nothing to either stem this tide or to help prosecute or infiltrate wildlife cartels. Borders are porous. Big men are paid off. Police are paid off. Some Rangers are paid off. The poor are a never ending source of cannon fodder. One successful poaching job can change their lives....or end it.

There are also thousands of rhino on wealthy white owned private rhino farms in South Africa. These private owners are banking on legalisation of the rhino horn trade, a proposal that the South African government is in favour of (surprise surprise). This can only be a very bad thing for wild rhino. Wild rhino must be protected in the wilderness areas but until African governments actually have the will to tackle serious inequality and corruption then it is just a matter of putting out fires.
