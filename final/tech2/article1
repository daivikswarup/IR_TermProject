Apple: government 'intended to smear' us in digital privacy fight with FBI




DateTime::::2016-03-11T01:21:11+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> said federal prosecutors are “offensive”, “desperate” and “intended to smear”<strong tabindex="-1"> </strong>them in a remarkable escalation of the digital privacy fight between America’s most valuable company<strong tabindex="-1"> </strong>and the FBI.</p>

<p>The remarks from Apple’s top lawyer, general counsel Bruce Sewell, were made in a conference call with reporters just hours after the Justice Department <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/10/apple-fbi-encryption-case-san-bernardino-privacy">submitted a legal brief</a> that accused the technology company of trying to usurp power from the government. </p>

<p>In sometimes caustic language, the government had claimed Apple had declared itself “the primary guardian of Americans’ privacy”.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Sewell responded: “In 30 years of practice, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a legal brief that was more intended to smear the other side. I can only conclude that the Department of Justice is so desperate at this point that they’ve thrown decorum to the winds.”<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/10/apple-fbi-encryption-case-san-bernardino-privacy">Apple accused of trying to make iPhones 'warrant-proof' in FBI case</a> </p>

<p>Investigators want a federal judge in California to order Apple to weaken the security defenses of an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook. The government would then be able to break into the phone.</p>

<p>The breakdown in relations is more than just headline-grabbing dramatics. It means that Silicon Valley and Washington are now less likely than ever to come to a middle ground in their two-year debate over encryption and law enforcement in the smartphone age. The only foreseeable solution would come from a broad court ruling or new legislation, which could miss many of the subtleties of the debate. <br/></p>

<p>The day’s developments were a shift from recent efforts by Apple executives and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> director James Comey to mend fences and restart good relations. During his testimony in front of Congress on 1 March, Comey said about the tech company: “I don’t question their motives.”</p>

<p>That seemed like a distant memory on Thursday.</p>

<p>In its 35-page filing, the government cited news reports and other sources in suggesting that Apple was being hypocritical in refusing to help the US any more in the San Bernardino case while cooperating with the Chinese government. Apple, for instance, stores data for Chinese users in Chinese data centers, and its Chinese devices can work with Beijing-exclusive Wi-Fi and mobile broadband standards. Some US officials have long assumed those standards facilitate Chinese state surveillance. </p>

<p>“The evidence in the public record raises questions whether it is even resisting foreign governments now,” the government wrote. </p>

<p>The insinuation clearly enraged Apple executives. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Sewell said it was the equivalent of Apple asking the judge in the case if she can really trust the FBI by citing a thinly sourced rumor, such as, didn’t J Edgar Hoover order the assassination of John Kennedy. “See conspiracytheory.com as our supporting evidence,” Sewell said jokingly. </p>

<p>Apple attorneys acknowledge the company does store data in China and is compatible with local wireless standards. However, the attorneys said these are for trade and usability reasons and don’t relate to surveillance. </p>

<p>“This should be deeply offensive to anyone who reads it,” Sewell said. “The tone of the brief reads like an indictment.”</p>

If the FBI asked Colt or Ford for help in investigating a crime committed with their products - and the companies refused - then yes, the FBI would probably end up accusing those companies of aiding and abetting the crime.The difference is the technological complexity. The FBI can purchase and take apart a Colt-made weapon to do forensic science with it - so they don't need Colt's help. Although they can probably get design specs from Colt.With cars - the police most certainly use design specs from the manufacturer to study car accidents. There's a privacy concern with cars - because modern cars record a lot technical information during driving using their on-board electronics (like a block box). There's a danger police may start demanding that to prove traffic offenses, although that doesn't seem to be happening much yet.

By using the ancient All Writs Law, once they find a friendly court that sets a precedent, the path they establish can be used by any law enforcement body or regulatory agency to seek access for any purpose. There are hundreds of requests lined up awaiting the outcome of this one. Start with the FBI, then comes the IRS and SEC and divorce court. There are hundreds of federal and state bodies with subpoena power.

"The FBI has no interest in law abiding citizenry." that's not what we can read form leaked documents. They were collecting data from all and monitoring law abiding citizens. Furthermore weakend encryption would mean weak encryption for all. In other words criminals can then access your bank accounts. Do you want to publish you password and keys online?

Isn't this a bit like saying 'you buy gun from Colt and use it all in the commission of a crime therefore Colt is responsible for the commissioner of the crime? Or the car you drove to commit the crime was a Ford therefore Ford is culpable for selling you the car?'

Me too. I've always regarded Apple products as ridiculously expensive. But ever since Google was caught capturing unencrypted WiFi traffic via its Street View cars, I've been looking for an excuse to dump my android phone. Apple's fight for our privacy finally convinced me. I'm now the owner of an Apple iPhone 6s and loving every minute of it.

The problem is that with modern cryptographic technology you can't pick and choose who you grant privacy (and security) to. Either everyone gets it or no one gets it. It's not like the old days when it was not standardised and difficult and expensive to obtain cryptographic equipment. These days all you need is a copy of a cryptographic standard and the ability to write computer code.

It's only about "this phone" in the sense that they need a particular case to use to try to set precedent. Once they have that, they'll use their back door in any investigation they want.

It won't matter what brand they use. If The Govt set a precedent here, the FBI could require any company within the US border to do the same thing they're trying to force Apple to do.

Yes, I don't quite follow the FBI's logic here: "China spies on its citizens and Apple helps by following local laws, which is awful. Therefore it is only right that they should help us weaken the security of all iphones everywhere in a manner that is legally untested". The old adage that two wrongs don't make a right seems to have passed them by.

The highest law is the constitution. Agencies that ignore or seek to circumvent the constitution are acting as criminals. They are in fact the most dangerous criminals in our society because they have the trust of the public and the courts. If they violate the constitution they are far worse criminals than any common murderer. Whether they are Police or FBI or any other law enforcement agency, the moment they step over the line and violate a single constitutional right they are the criminals.
