Forget Apple's fight with the FBI – our privacy catastrophe has only just begun




DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:00:34+0000



<p>For privacy advocates, the Apple-FBI standoff over encryption is deja vu all over again.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, they fought and won a pitched battle with the Clinton administration over the Clipper chip, a proposal to add mandatory backdoors to the encryption in telecommunications devices. </p>

<p>Soon after that battle was won, it moved overseas: in the UK, the Blair government brought in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/01/technology-firms-hopes-dashed-by-cosmetic-tweaks-to-snoopers-charter">Regulatory of Investigatory Powers Act</a> (RIPA). Privacy advocates lost that fight: the bill passed in 2000, enabling the government to imprison people who refused to reveal their cryptographic keys.</p>

<p>The privacy fight never stopped. In the years since, a bewildering array of new fronts have opened up on the battlefield: social media, third-party cookies, NSA/GCHQ mass surveillance, corporate espionage, mass-scale breaches, the trade in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/07/nsa-spying-harmed-digital-crime-fight">zero-day vulnerabilities</a> that governments weaponise to attack their adversaries, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/sep/05/nsa-project-bullrun-classification-guide">Bullrun</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-gchq-encryption-codes-security">Edgehill</a>, the secret programmes of security sabotage revealed by whistleblower <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden">Edward Snowden</a>.</p>

<p>The first line of defense for surveillance advocates – whether private sector or governmental – is to point out just how few people seem to care about privacy. What can it matter that the government is harvesting so much of our data through the backdoor, when so many of us are handing over all that and more through the front door, uploading it to Facebook and Google and Amazon and anyone who cares to set a third-party cookie on the pages we visit? </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/02/why-is-it-so-hard-to-convince-people-to-care-about-privacy">Why is it so hard to convince people to care about privacy?</a> </p>

<p>Painting the pro-privacy side as out-of-step loonies, tinfoil-hatted throwbacks in the post-privacy era was a cheap and effective tactic. It made the pro-surveillance argument into a *pro-progress* one: “Society has moved on. Our data can do more good in big, aggregated piles than it can in atomized fragments on your device and mine. The private data we exhaust when we move through the digital world is a precious resource, not pollution.” </p>

<p>It’s a powerful argument. When companies that promise to monetize your surveillance beat companies that promise to protect your privacy, when people can’t even be bothered to tick the box to block tracking cookies, let alone install full-disk encryption and GPG to protect their email, the pro-surveillance camp can always argue that they’re doing something that no one minds very much.</p>

<p>From the perennial fights over national ID cards to the fights over data retention orders, the lack of any commercial success for privacy tech was a great way to shorthand: “Nothing to see here – just mountains being made from molehills.”</p>

<p>But a funny thing happened on the way to the 21st century: we disclosed more and more of our information, or it was taken from us.</p>

<p>As that data could be used in ever-greater frauds, the giant databases storing our personal details became irresistible targets. Pranksters, criminals and spies broke the databases wide open and dumped them: the IRS, the Office of Personnel Management, Target and, of course, Ashley Madison. Then the full impact of the Snowden revelations set in, and people started to feel funny when they texted something intimate to a lover or typed a potentially embarrassing query into a search box.</p>

<p>Companies started to sell the idea of privacy. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> and Microsoft sought to differentiate themselves from Facebook and Google by touting the importance of <em>not</em> data-mining to their bottom lines. Google started warning users when it looked like governments were trying to hack into their emails. Facebook set up a hidden service on Tor’s darknet. Everybody jumped on the two-factor authentication bandwagon, then the SSL bandwagon, then the full-disk encryption bandwagon.</p>

<p>The social proof of privacy’s irrelevance vanished, just like that. If Apple – the second most profitable company in the world – thinks that customers will buy its products because no one, not even Apple, can break into the data stored on them, what does it say about the privacy zeitgeist?</p>

<p>Seamlessly, the US Department of Justice switched tacks: Apple’s encryption is a “marketing stunt”. The company has an obligation to backdoor its products to assist law enforcement. Please, let’s not dredge up the old argument about whether it’s OK to spy on everyone – we settled that argument already, by pointing out the fact that no one was making any money by making privacy promises. Now that someone <em>is</em> making money from privacy tech, they’re clearly up to no good.</p>

<p>The smog of personal data is the carbon dioxide of privacy. We’ve emitted far too much of it over the past decades, refusing to contemplate the consequences until the storms came. Now they’ve arrived, and they’ll only get worse, because the databases that haven’t breached yet are far bigger, and more sensitive than those that have.</p>

<p>Like climate change, the privacy catastrophes of the next two decades are already inevitable. The problem we face is preventing the <em>much worse</em> catastrophes of the following the decades. </p>

<p>And as computers are integrated into the buildings and vehicles and cities we inhabit, as they penetrate our bodies, the potential harms from breaches will become worse.</p>

Yes, it does as backed up by Roe v Wade - and the Federalist Papers. The original purpose of the Constitution was to enumerate the powers of the government. Nowhere in the constitution does the government have the right to invade a citizen's privacy. The government doesn't have the right to force a citizen to make something that it doesn't have and heaven (or whatever) help us if they do get that right.

You have missed a point. The Jihadists committed a terror act, and used a phone that belonged to the County of San Bernardino.Why shouldn't the FBI have access to the information transmitted back and forth from that phone, especially when the County of San Bernardino has agreed?Apple doesn't have a leg to stand on, constitutionally, under the Fourth Amendments. It does not amount to unreasonable search or seizure.

No. You can't break encryption. Not your standard aes encryption at least. That's just a law of maths. It's not possible. No resources can change that fact. It would be like predicting exactly where a specific single atom is going to be in the universe 100 billion billion years from now. No computer will be able to do that. For start you'd have to be able to predict the universe would look like. Exactly.

You really don't understand encryption do you. A standard pgp key with password of 8 letters and characters would take more energy to decrypt than all the stars in the universe could provide at the current know fastest computational rate. It would take longer than the life of the universe to bruteforce a key. No amount of resources could make that time significantly less.

It does however seem that Apple in fact is trying to capitalize on the privacy issue. Unless I am mistaken, their cloud service is not encrypted. As a result one really concerned about privacy for photos etc. must buy a more expensive iPhone with greater storage capability. Yes I understand the encryption safeguards as well such things as financials and social security numbers, etc. But shouldn't things be set up so that this firm's wonderful encryption guarded extra firmly ONLY the data of this latter sort?? Is a device with such rock-solid, all-eccumpassing encryption really suited to to the world we (or most of us) live in?

Attorneys should take note of what this article points out, that the governments' arguments change. If they remind judges and juries of the old arguments by citing them and the arguments that disproved them it puts in focus how the government is being manipulative rather than principled in its logic and its actions in the courts.

Right. Again,1. They can't break the actual encryption. Only the implementation can be attacked. 2. Presumably if you're very keen to not get hacked and compromised you don't keep the key on a computer.

I take the point but as the NSA and associated agencies are also adept at hacking too i wouldnt be so blase about their potential to either break the encryption or just hack you until they find a way in.

It may look like an over estimation but its probably accurate given that Snowdon stated this himself. However there are different levels of access and i take the point that not all will have a level of access that is a cause for concern.

Cory, I agree with this to some extent. However, what no-one seems to be paying much attention to here is that this is as much a series of internal fights between US state agencies as anything else. The NSA will already know everything that actually matters that is on that phone. The FBI won't. The FBI don't have the surveillance capabilities of the NSA so they want another method to get what they want without having to beg the NSA. The NSA of course support encryption because, apart from being a surveillance agency, their other main job (which everyone seems to have forgotten because of the Snowden revelations largely being about their surveillance work) is cybersecurity and cyberwar. They are responsible for the security of state systems and, indirectly, have a very strong interest in the encryption security (not so much 'privacy') of US products on world markets. On the other side, the FBI is not wrong that Apple want to create a market position and restore their reputation with consumers, a reputation that has been somewhat tarnished recently by some poor products and design decisions. The Snowden revelations have, ironically created a hieghtened awareness of the market segment that a pro-privacy stance can exploit. But do Apple really care about privacy? Maybe. But I don't think it really matters. In the end the FBI will probably lose not because anyone in government cares about privacy, and not because of any campaign about privacy, but because effective encryption actually matters more to deeper US state and corporate interests. Weakened encryption and backdoors damage US national interests, both military and economic. No doubt all the groups who do great work for privacy (EFF, ACLU, EPIC etc.) will claim such an inevitable loss or climb-down or compromise (however it is presented) as a victory, but I'd be very careful of considering it as such.

We're literally talking about the laws of physics. Done right there's simply nothing you can do with current technology... Of course there's ways around, but they have absolutely nothing to do with compromising the encryption itself - they involve hacking you and finding the key. So just as in real life, don't lose your keys.

What is truly a concern is that Snowden is one of up to 4 million US security service employees that has access to this type of information, although the vast majority will be at a lower level than Snowden’s Systems Administrator level. Many of these employees are outside private contractors as Snowden was when he leaked the first documents.

Many people in the information security and cryptography sphere have suspected that these type of surveillance operations have been going on for many years. In the book ‘ Cypherpunks- Freedom and the Future of the Internet‘ Julian Assange with Jacob Appelbaum, Andy Müller-Maguhn and Jérémie Zimmermann discuss the technologies they believe are already in place and the consequences these technologies have on personal freedoms, privacy and the future of the internet. The conclusions they come to are bleak and stark. As Assange says:
