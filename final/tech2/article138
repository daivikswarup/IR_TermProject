Ah! One of my fondest recollections is buying a kilo of fresh strawberries from a street vendor for a pittance and then eating them over the next few days with and without cream...

Cookie update: I've not been as conscientious as I should have been and hence I do expect some shareholder discontent at the next AGM. However cookie production and sales have still seen strong growth and current output is 27.187 billion cookies per second (excluding any multipliers). The antimatter condensors are not yet working to peak optimal performance but I'm hoping our investors will take a longer term view and this won't negatively impact on approval to invest 2.1 quadrillion in a Prism.

Author::::lone_wolf_uk
DateTime::::2016-03-02T16:21:51Z
