Same with Tyson. He definitely wasn't veggie when he fought Holyfield.

Einstein was only veggie at the very end of his life. He'd probably gone senile.



Author::::Rambozo
DateTime::::2016-03-09T16:48:46Z
What is pepperami made of? I'm guessing it's just pepper and...stuff. Deeelishuss.



Author::::SandyBahookie

Einstein and Mike Tyson, both vegetarians. The most clever guy ever and the hardest mentalist boxer ever.

The best / worst* thing about Wee's recipe is that you don't have to ass the onions before putting them in the pan.

I once had a sniff of some beef dripping I found in a fridge. I thought it was a delicious pudding. Anyway it wasn't nice. My stomach lurched and rumbled. I think I may even have run outside to get some fresh air.



Author::::Darkgoat

Can you pop that on the drive?

Currywurst is just Ketchup drowned sausage with curry powder splashed all over it.

Not Hull. Huddersfield. 



Author::::LOUDquietLOUD
DateTime::::2016-03-09T15:59:38Z
I went to a wedding in Hull a couple of years back and they had beef dripping sandwiches on the evening buffet. Absolutely smashed them. Almost shit my underpants on the drive home the next day. No regrets

I just go to the German sausage man for lunch if I want currywurst. He is the best.

With the right marketing and legislation, those warehouses full of cockroaches could be replaced with warehouses full of delicious humans, industrially bred and fed on nutritionally balanced broth eliminating pesky prions and unappetising Kuru.

I'm not sure that's going to fit on the front cover. Are you sure we can't go with

I'd rather eat a microwave burger made of insect protein than reconstituted slaughterhouse runoff but maybe that's just me.

Big warehouses full of cockroaches, processed en masse for general consumption. The future, and rightly so. People are idiots.
