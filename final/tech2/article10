DateTime::::2016-03-09T13:35:52+0000



<p>Amazon is to open its first fulfilment centre in north-west England, creating 1,000 new jobs in Manchester over the next three years.</p>

<p>The online retailer is recruiting operations managers and engineers, and for IT and HR roles at the site, which will open later this year.</p>

<p>Mike Kane, the MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East, said the move was “fantastic news” for his constituents, adding: “This investment is another big step in the renaissance of Wythenshawe.” </p>

<p>The centre will join Amazon’s 10 fulfilment centres in the UK, including two in Doncaster and one each in Dunfermline, Dunstable, Gourock, Hemel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, Peterborough, Rugeley and Swansea Bay. Two of these centres opened in 2015. </p>

<p>The move is part of Amazon’s plan to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/22/amazon-creating-more-than-2500-new-uk-jobs-2016">expand across the UK this year</a>, creating 2,500 permanent jobs.</p>

<p>The company is hiring at its head office in London, at three research and development centres in Cambridge, Edinburgh and London, at its customer service centre in Edinburgh and at warehouses across the country. Amazon is also recruiting people to support a new UK datacentre region.</p>

<p>Next year, the company plans to open a new head office, which will house 5,000 employees in Old Street, central London.</p>

<p>The group caused a stir in the grocery market last week by signing a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/29/amazon-is-to-start-selling-fresh-and-frozen-morrisons-food">deal to sell food from Morrisons</a>, the UK’s fourth largest supermarket chain.</p>

Can we have "Fulfilment Centre" in inverted commas to acknowledge it as a bullshit term for 'Warehouse'. I doubt any of the workers will leave their shifts feeling fulfilled.

Will be interesting to see if these jobs go to local residents or if they will be just like the recently announced jobs at Manchester Airport- ear marked for locals but actually open to all.

Inverted commas roundt "Jobs" please. No point us importing poor unskilled foreigners, mind, if not for de-humanised exploitation such as this.

Too many people in the north want well paid public sector jobs so they can sit on their arse all day or enjoy benefits funded by the hard working south.

Usually but, in this case, I think the infrastructure is already in place since it will be located in the Airport City - I may be wrong. DHL are already located there and handle Amazon's deliveries at the present.

To you, me, and every other citizen who does not live in a tax haven like Luxemburg or the Cayman Islands. Because of Amazon's endemic global tax avoidance, obviously.

If you live in Greater Manchester and are looking for work at any point in the next decade, you'll be told to take a zero hours minimum wage contract for one of the harshest companies to work for in the western world, or have your dole stopped.

I think it goes to say that most people who do a job don't have better job options readily available, or else they'd take the better option. So even if you don't think you'd enjoy a job like this, bear in mind that its probably better than the alternative for the people who do take these jobs.

These are pointless jobs; agency work, at 3-7 per hour topped up by benefits, after Bezos discovered how uk corporate welfare works. If it was a manufacturer setting up/creating 1000 worthwhile jobs, at the median wage of 24 grand, I'd defy anyone not to applaud.

Perfectly articulated, brain dead Tory apologists and apparatchiks just don't get it and the sad part is most of them are as potless as they're plotless, they champion guys like Bezos, but they've more in common with the bleating woman on question time; worried about losing their benefits for their home based nail bars.
