The flow of time is distorted in the Chatterbox, an eternal wasteland of emptiness.

I think Keef must be lost in the Brighton sea mist. I could barely see out to sea more than 100ft this morning.

It's still Thursday? That's not fair! That's not fair at all! There was time now...

I want it to be Friday so much. Maybe too much.

I thought it stood for "Premium Grade Lager", of which there is none in the UK.



Author::::bigworv
DateTime::::2016-03-10T18:06:53Z
It's quite clearly the refreshment sweet spot, a widely available lager than isn't awful toss like Carling or Fosters. This is basic stuff.

Your mind has twanged. You have been utterly consumed by the need to bully.



Author::::Lazybones

One of these are you? A Big Man?



Author::::Lazybones

You can have a premium lager or a generic lager. Someone decided they were going to act wise and combine the two. What it means in reality, Lord knows.

What the balls is a PGL?



Author::::Lazybones
DateTime::::2016-03-10T17:19:32Z
I'm not a big lager fan to be honest. Occasionally I put a glass in a freezer, beside a bottle of lager. Two and a half hours later I pour the lager into the frozen glass. I will have a sip, but after that it becomes too warm and I just throw it down the sink.

Apres hippy PGL? What?



Author::::alimantado

It can only be five - I don't make the rules.



Author::::Grezmo

Fair shout. It's a comfort to know they were appropriately considered and, for what it's worth, I am in agreement.

Great shout, sack off birthday PGLs for that one and pop it at number 2 on the list.

The Heineken stubby cans have the opposite effect. When I'm drinking one I like to pretend I'm weecooper supping from a barrel.

I'd pay for you to be stitched up in a charity auction if it involves a dog, a cat and a sack.

I'm up at the County Ground so I'm hoping for St Austell booze as they're a sponsor.

I love those big bottles of beer. When I hold one I like to pretend I'm Worv holding a normal sized bottle of beer.

I've got one big bottle of Stella left. It won't be enough.

DateTime::::2016-03-10T16:07:12Z
i'd suggest keeping it for a while longer for the DLC but if you've not enjoyed the first 15 hours then maybe not...plus my opinion is carried very far



Author::::alimantado
DateTime::::2016-03-10T16:06:38Z
I'm too upset by to think about specifics.
