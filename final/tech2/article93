<p>Amazon is expanding into grocery shopping after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/29/amazon-is-to-start-selling-fresh-and-frozen-morrisons-food">agreeing a deal to sell Morrisons food</a>. But that is not the only initiative the ambitious US company is investing in:</p>

<p><strong>Fashion</strong></p>

<p>Amazon is in talks with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/17/amazon-own-label-fashion-brand-online-retail-marks-spencer-frances-russell">former chief of Marks &amp; Spencer womenswear</a> about joining the company and is looking to build an own-label clothing brand.

<p><strong>Loans</strong></p>

<p>Amazon <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/amazon-loans-customers-pay-monthly-option">Pay Monthly quietly launched in the UK</a> at the turn of the year and the service has the potential to significantly increase sales. It offers shoppers the chance to pay for orders worth more than £250 in monthly instalments for up to four years. Interest is free for the first 12 months on purchases of more than £400 and for 24 months on purchases of more than £1,000. Otherwise, interest is charged at 16.9%.</p>

Announcing it so early was certainly PR. But don't be fooled - it most certainly is a possibility for the not-so-distant future. It won't work everywhere, but certainly will for more remote properties. For dense, inner-city locations, we'll probably see autonomous delivery vehicles on the roads.

As the NHS is decimated and farmed out to volume-discount providers Amazon will be able to send a drone to diagnose your symptoms and treat you.
