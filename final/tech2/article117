Mr destry something has happened at our beloved club and the manager has exited stage left and we don't know if he will be in charge for Sunday. The Teesside parmo grape vine is going into overdrive with all these rumours about what happened and how he stormed out of the club. I can't believe this is happening if it's true with the promise land been in touching distance
