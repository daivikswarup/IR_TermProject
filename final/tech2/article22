<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft">Microsoft</a> is set to close the UK game development studio Lionhead and has canned its forthcoming title Fable Legends.</p>

<p>Hanno Lemke, the general manager of Microsoft Studios Europe, announced the decision <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.xbox.com/2016/03/07/microsoft-studios-changes-uk-denmark/">in a blog post</a> on the Xbox news site. In the same article, posted to the site on Monday afternoon, Lemke announced that the Danish studio Press Play would also be closed.</p>

<p>In the post, Lemke wrote: “These changes are taking effect as Microsoft Studios continues to focus its investment and development on the games and franchises that fans find most exciting and want to play.”</p>

<p>Co-founded by veteran British game designer <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/13/peter-molyneux-game-designer-interview-godus">Peter Molyneux</a> in 1996, Lionhead is best known for the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/oct/26/fable-iii-3-review">Fable</a> series of role-playing adventures, which became hugely successful on the Xbox consoles. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2006/apr/06/microsoftbuys2">Microsoft purchased the studio in 2006</a>, with Molyneux employed as creative director across Microsoft Game Studios. </p>

<p>He departed in 2012 to found independent studio 22 Cans, just as work began on Fable: Legends, a spin-off from the Fable series, based around co-op play. The release date of this project was delayed several times, reportedly to allow the team to polish the game. </p>

<p>Due to UK employment law, Microsoft must begin a formal consultation period with the employees of Lionhead before the studio can be shut, but closure is all but certain. Other studios are already posting messages on social media and industry forums offering work to departing Lionhead staff members.</p>

<p>Danish studio Press Play, was formed in 2006 and is best known for platforming adventure<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/09/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review"> Max: The Curse of Brotherhood</a> and offbeat puzzler Kalimba.</p>

<p>Microsoft was keen to point out that it was still committed to supporting game development in Europe. Its remaining UK based studio Rare is currently working on much-anticipated adventure Seas of Thieves, while Quantum Break from Finnish team Remedy Entertainment is likely to be one of this year’s major <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/xbox-one">Xbox One</a> releases.</p>

Well, okay then. If Molyneux isn't that talented then in a way that's even better, because even untalented games designed can still start up their own studios and gain entry to the market...

Ah, Black & White! I always held out hope for another one in the series. Loved it. Such a shame....

I thought Fable Legends was a hugely anticipated exclusive for Xbox / PC?

The suspicion is that the studio was shuttered because the game was failing, close to release, in the quality assurance department. M$is not stupid enough to slaughter a golden goose but they are ruthless enough to shut down a failing proposition (Nokia and Surface being two big examples).

Is there much up to date evidence for stating that Molyneux is a talented game designer? He may have had good ideas once upon a time (before others got to there) but the present day challenge for "talent" is in the execution of those ideas. I wouldn't want to criticise Molyneux but it's helpful to point out that there's a difference between historical successes in an 8 bit world and muli-member team development of today's much, much more complex software.

Ordinarily I would agree with you, but recently the Intel i3 6100 was put against the AMD FX 6300, and the i3 rinsed it.

When developers start using the 'multi platform development tools', maybe.

Lionhead Studios will always have a place in my heart for the original Black and White - Truly different and groundbreaking releases like Black and White was are too few these days. What an exciting time it was to be growing up :)

Very sad news. I really enjoyed Fable 1-3, sunk a lot of time into them all, especially 2. Hope the staff move on to bigger and better things.

There no reason why the IP would have to remain with MS, it could be attached to the studio and sold with it.

Going down a blind alley by the looks of it.even ignoring the bad beta reviews, their problems possibly stem from not being able to drive the technology they have as far as they thought and the problem of looking dated against more recent releases. 1 & 2 are pretty much universally regarded as better than 3, they may simply have run out of workable ideas for 4.

Even then most games run fine on an AMD FX4300 or Athlon 850k, if you put the gtx 960 as the most you can spend on a card. In "most" circumstances a four core AMD setup won't end up bottlenecking the system so you'll probably be looking at £400.

I much preferred the Fable series to either of those two. It's more lightweight, obviously, but I've played all three Fable games, and wasn't interested enough in the other series to play more than one installment of each. I'm sad there won't be a Fable 4, too.



Author::::yosemitesamuel
DateTime::::2016-03-08T10:38:45Z
Fable 1 and 2 were the only decent ones in the series

Yeah, because the Xbox 360 was such a colossal failure and Windows, who uses that? And MS Office is a joke, no one uses that for Gods sake ...oh wait!

My PC cost me £850 3 years ago (albeit I already had a monitor, keyboard, etc) and still plays new games on high settings. Not ultra, but I've never even got close to that moment where trees appear from nowhere in front of you and you think "Time to upgrade my computer".

...and no probing into whether Pete Molyneux is among the tranche of developers turning against Microsoft and their Jeremy-Hunt-like strategy of foisting the Universal Windows Platform initiative...

I built my own rig for 750 quid, i5 6500 with a GTX 960 card and it runs everything i've thrown at it so far at ultra, I know it can't do the VR that is coming but a card upgrade to a 980 will ensure it can.

Fable wasn't even close to the greatness of Dragon Age or Mass Effect.

Fable 2 had charm and was very immersive, which let you forgive it's faults. 3 was simply a massive pile of doodoo with practically no redeeming qualities.

Turn to what? Their cloud services are excellent, for example, and their multi-platform development tools an innovative idea.

I'm not sure if you are a troll or not, but you really don't need £2000 to build a rig that can play games in decent settings.

It always strikes me as such a waste when games get canned so far in development... surely it must be either in or close to some sort of state where it could be released and earn at least some of its money back? What have the developers been doing for 4 years!

The Fable games on the 360 were really not great; some nice ideas implemented in very uninteresting ways.

Bet Xbone users are really really cheated now!!! I'm not an PS4 fanboy as refused to buy into this generation. £300 for a minor upgrade over PS3 Xbox 360... Now MS have merged PC/XBone, even thou you need to £2000 rig to play games at good FPS high settings!!! And now exclusives and studios are closing down.... This is a bad year for MS!!!!!!
