Apple says the FBI is making access demands even China hasn't asked for




DateTime::::2016-02-20T02:06:05+0000



<p>The US government is asking for greater access to Apple’s software than even the Chinese government, an Apple executive has said, as the company resists an order forcing it to help the government crack the passcode for a phone that was used by a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-bernardino-shooting">San Bernardino shooter</a>.</p>

<p>America’s most valuable company and its government used increasingly bellicose tones on Friday in a debate over whether national security can dictate how Silicon Valley makes products.</p>

<p>On 16 February, a federal judge <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/inside-the-fbis-encryption-battle-with-apple">ordered Apple to assist the FBI in accessing the phone</a>.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> has refused, arguing that to do so would set a legal precedent that could force it to hack a suspect’s phone each time authorities face a warrant. It argues that would violate user trust, privacy norms and weaken the core security of the company’s flagship smartphone.</p>

<p>Early Friday, the Justice Department <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/fbi-apple-san-bernardino-shooter-court-order-iphone">released a lengthy legal filing</a> that accused Apple of misinterpreting the law and placing marketing goals over national security. </p>

<p>Apple’s legal team was huddled Friday preparing a response and declined to speak on the record. But in several calls with reporters, a senior Apple executive agreed to offer some response on the condition of anonymity and that reporters not quote the executive’s exact words. </p>

<p>The company’s executive said that the Justice Department’s request was so unprecedented that no other country – specifically mentioning China – had asked for similar access. That comes following reports that the country, a huge market for Apple, has asked to inspect western technology products for “security”.</p>

<p>The company executive also said it was safe to assume that Apple would continue to add more security features to its products to make it harder still for investigators to get access. </p>

<p>The company’s latest spat with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> goes back to the fall of 2014, when Apple expanded the default use of encryption on its newer iPhones. At the time, it said it would no longer be able to retrieve passcodes used to unlock phones for federal agents.</p>

<p>The FBI conceded this week it can’t force Apple to give it the passcode, but it concocted a clever workaround. It persuaded a judge to order Apple to make it easier to guess the passcode by weakening other countermeasures. </p>

<p>On the call Apple acknowledged that, on a technical level, the workaround could be applied to any <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone">iPhone</a>. Authorities would have to get a warrant for each of those cases.</p>

<p>In its filing Friday, the government said that it had tried several other ways to access gunman Syed Farook’s phone, which was owned by his employer – the county agency he targeted. One of them would have been to return his iPhone to his home wireless network to see if it would automatically back up its files on Apple’s iCloud service. </p>

<p>This potentially could have given investigators access to Farook’s files and iMessages up to the moment of the attack. </p>

<p>However, Apple and federal agents discovered that option wouldn’t work. In the hours after the shooting, San Bernardino county staff tried to access Farook’s iCloud account and reset his password. This, unintentionally, triggered an Apple security measure that made it impossible to back up the phone. </p>

<p>The Apple executive conceded there is no way to know if this would have worked. It’s possible, as the government argues, that Farook had turned off the auto-update function. The phone last updated on 19 October, some six weeks before the shooting. </p>

<p>Apple has until 26 February to file a response in federal court.</p>

Snowden has shown that governments have boundary issues. Double-Speakers tell us government may be trusted not violate the law. Its already too easy to classify the knowledge that surveyors haven't stopped; too easy to classify the intention not to stop; too easy to use the cover of team-player closed circles to continue to operate unobstructed. Judicial support of this notion goes beyond the everyday puppet theater we have become accustomed to. For a member of the Third Estate to order industry to write software that permits even further degradation of the human right to privacy is a slippery slope that got slicker before our very eyes. As if an errantly released trial balloon has just passed us by in the everyday wind while we had our eyes wide shut.

You can't trust the FBI, they have a long record of Murder, framing innocent people, taking part in terrorist acts against the United States, destroying and removing evidence.

Apple is in the right. The FBI is demanding the company break its product to make it easier for the FBI to do its job. The FBI and Homeland Security should have done their jobs correctly in the first place with proper vetting and enforcement of immigration laws. It's not Apple's job to fix the incompetence of the US government. I hope Apple stands firm and properly gives the finger to this government overreach.

all right. here's the thing. encryption is real. it really is beyond anyone to brute force it. we know this because encryption protocols are open to the public and are continuously being challenged and that this is exactly the proof of its strength. the biggest mistake anyone can make regarding encryption is keeping it private. germany did this with enigma and lost everything for it. why? because there wasn't an army of dedicated hackers determined to find its flaws and take it down as quickly as it should have been; by keeping it closed, when an actual hacker outside did attack it, he won and relatively quickly. had germany allowed the world to freely test it, it would have crumbled even faster and the result would have been where we are today--with unbreakable encryption.

The US on numerous, in fact possible, situations behave as if they have devine rights: all others are wrong. Whether FBI or not, they have lost all moral credibility. They simply cannot be treated. Julien Assange is a prime example. They use all conceivable means to get their way.

Note to my fellow commenters; sorry to be a bore, but this isn't really a political issue as it's about interpretations of an existing law, so one's standing on Liberal/Left/Tory/Whatever doesn't really come into it. Neither the DoJ, nor Apple are claiming that anything needs to be changed in any law. It's quite possible that politicians may suggest future changes to laws as a result of this debate, but that is unlikely to be applied in retrospect to this case since it would violate principles of legal predictability.

apple is saying that by complying with the request, it will make their products less safe in terms of data protection. If Apple were to lose the case, then it would also force all software companies (Google, etc) to make their product less secure. Thus if in the future you Internet bank account, personal data were hacked ( talk talk), then companies can just say that they were complying with this law and not get sued.

idk, but I'm guessing that IF the key is possible, and it's created, it will never be put back in the bottle. Best case, bad ppl will know it's possible and will eventually create it, if not steal it like they stole the plans to the F-35.

I could give a rat's butt about what China wants. Apple should make it possible for it to access it's products whenever a regularly convened U.S. Court issues such an order. Not a FISA Court, a regularly convened criminal Court.

Yep, that I got out of what I read also, but how would the key pass to the bad guys? No... not being naive, the key could be designed so that after it is used one time successfully it automatically destroys itself... I would think...Anyway, bottom line is that some time in the future a device (iphone?) will have some info that truly is needed NOW, not tomorrow, but now. When that happens I guess we just be plain out of luck....
