An invention to die for…

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here’s a moment in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/24/sundance-2015-review-the-end-of-the-tour-jason-segel-david-foster-wallace" title=""><em>The End of the Tour</em></a>, a recent film based on the transcripts of a meeting between<em> Rolling Stone</em> reporter David Lipsky and the late American novelist <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace" title="">David Foster Wallace</a>, in which the writer likens the act of watching television to masturbation. Both activities, he argues, offer a pleasurable way to spend a few minutes. Both activities may also highlight deeper issues if allowed to become a person’s primary habit. “At least with masturbation some action is being performed,” says Lipsky. “Isn’t that better?”</p>

<p>Wallace is unmoved. “Yes, you’re performing muscular movements,” he says. “But what you’re really doing is running a movie, having a fantasy relationship with somebody who is not real, strictly to stimulate a neurological response.”</p>

<p>Lipsky and Wallace’s observations combine to offer a perspicacious summary of the delights and dangers of the video game medium: onanistic action, vivid fantasy and the final, endorphin-soaked neurological climax.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">The aesthetic of total enclosure inside a screen-laced helmet makes freshly clear the risks of screen reliance</p>

<p>Wallace was obsessed with what he viewed as the perilous allure of television. He refused to have a set in his home because, as he put it to Lipsky in 1996: “If I had one I would watch it all the time.” Had Wallace given in to TV’s siren call, the world almost certainly wouldn’t have been gifted his masterwork, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/15/infinite-jest-at-20-still-a-challenge-still-brilliant-emma-lee-moss" title=""><em>Infinite Jest</em></a>, a 1,000-page novel about a piece of film said to be so dangerously entertaining that its viewers become irresistibly entranced, to the point of death. The premise is a dramatic exaggeration, but it proved prophetic. Every year, a handful of young men (it’s always men) die sitting at their computers when playing video games for extended periods.</p>

<p>Wallace also lays out to Lipsky his concerns about virtual reality. “As… VR pornography becomes a reality, we will have to develop some real machinery inside our guts to turn off pure unalloyed pleasure,” he says, before adding, with grim foreshadowing, “Or I’m going to have to leave the planet.” (Wallace, who suffered from enduring depression, took his life in 2008.)</p>

<p>VR technology, which emerged in the late 1980s, had faltered when Wallace was speaking. Today it’s poised for mass revival, with Facebook, Samsung, HTC and Sony all releasing headsets in 2016, each supported by hundreds of VR video games. There are already numerous film studios around the world dedicated to making live-action VR porn. “[It is going to become] more and more pleasurable to sit alone, with images on a screen given to us by people who do not love us, but who want our money,” said Wallace. “That’s fine in low doses, but if it’s the mainstay of your diet you’re going to die. In a very meaningful way, you are going to die.”</p>

<p>Last month, a photograph of a battalion of potbellied American tech journalists wearing <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/06/oculus-rift-virtual-reality-headset-finally-available-for-pre-order-at-600" title="">Oculus Rift VR</a> headsets while attending a Samsung press conference was widely shared. Facebook’s CEO <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg" title="">Mark Zuckerberg</a> can be seen striding past their oblivious ranks. What was intended to be an inspiring display of the miracle of human technological progress comes across, in this image, as something pitiable and eerie, as if humanity has discovered some irresistible arcane prop in which first pleasure, then destruction is to be found. The scene, however, is not alien. Our species’ emigration into screens for both work and play has, for decades, been steady and unrelenting. The VR helmet simply completes the unnatural attachment by blocking out all peripheral vision, while the umbilical cord twizzles from head to computer.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/virtual-reality">Virtual reality</a>, like every other television, computer and smartphone screen that already lights up our lives, is a window through which knowledge, transformation, empathy and wonder can be delivered (as well as every one of their ugly antonyms). The aesthetic of total enclosure inside a screen-laced helmet makes freshly clear the risks of screen reliance, the power of soul-distracting illusions, which have the capacity to nourish and redeem, and to make us puerile and dependent.</p>

I've tried out an Oculus Rift. The experience was...mildly nauseating...

The photo brilliantly captures the moment. Zuckerberg realises his ultimate fantasy; his expression not able to disguise his secret delight - a room full of drones wired 24/7 into social media.

Still, what is the difference between a VR headset and being immersed in a 1000 page novel by David Foster Wallace, philosophically speaking?

How is my comment in any way trying to shut down the discussion?



Author::::oblongscone

But why try to shut-down the discussion? Is reading a book comparable to using VR? Maybe, maybe not; but it's at least worth thinking about.

Whilst I have no idea if it will be more than a passing distraction, there is certainly an interesting discussion here.

I think rich people and poor people have traditionally used drugs for different reasons - poor people use them to escape the pain of normal existence, rich people use them to escape the boredom. I think there could be similar motivations to use VR.

Every year thousands of people (it's always people) die sitting at their TVs when drinking alcohol for extended periods.

WIll probably appeal to people who like 3D. People who focus on one thing at a time.

With all these highly addictive experiences on tap from birth onwards there won't be many people with the neurological architecture to thrive intellectually or emotionally. VR is just another piece of straw for the camel's load.

It's a rabbit hole for sure, with the potential to change the world (and us) more than the internet has. Is it healthy? Not in large doses.One thing I keep coming back to is huge chunks of the population living in real poverty but also in opulent VR luxury - that's going to be very attractive for a lot of people isn't it? You could even say addictive.

As a child I embraced the Spectrum, Master System & Mega Drive. I programmed games with my Dad and was a member of the school computer club. I've explored the depths of the internet for nearly 20 years, wasting time as a hobby. I love my PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 and my big HD TV. In 1998 I said I'd never get a mobile phone (why would I want to be contacted when I'm out with my friends?), then got one the following year. I said I'd never join Facebook, but I did. However, I can state with 100% certainty that I will not be buying a VR gimp mask.

Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is also worth a read on the same topic.It describes a future reality so bad that people create a virtual society rather than existing in the real world.

It always strikes me as a very Victorian attitude to treat something that gives you pleasure, whether games, masturbation or anything else, with such suspicion.

Reality is obviously not entertaining enough, so we need to replace it with fantasy. Or maybe we're shutting out what we don't like to see. Or perhaps it's just a really cool way to watch a movie or play a game.

If you demo some of the new VR technologies you'll understand why it's being hyped up so much (and getting so much coverage and investment). It really is amazing.

A fascinating picture you've chosen to head the piece with. It reminds me all too much of the cover to the english translation of 'The Society of the Spectacle', Guy Debord's 1967 situationist text (which was reputed to have been the inspiration for the '68 protests in Paris and elsewhere in Europe) .

E. M. Forster foresaw this in his 1909 story, "The Machine Stops". But fear not - despite all the hype, Oculus Rift isn't actually very good.

Herbert W. Franke saw this in the 1960's, in his book "The Orchid Cage".
