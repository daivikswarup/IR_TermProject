'We're just getting started': inside Austin's contentious clash with Uber and Lyft

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>nn Kitchen never imagined the repercussions of her decision to regulate <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/uber">Uber</a>, the ride-hailing behemoth with a valuation of $62.5bn and – she now knows – a reputation for taking no prisoners.</p>

<p>The 61-year-old <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/austin">Austin</a> councilwoman had the temerity to propose that Uber and its rival, Lyft, be subject to the same rules that apply to other companies offering transport in the Texan state capital.</p>

<p>Kitchen, who represents the 80,000 people of district 5 in South Austin and was a barely-known local political figure in the city, now finds herself the target of a sophisticated, well-funded, and highly-personalized political operation.<br/></p>

<p>She is facing a recall election campaign, the rare procedure through which elected officials can be booted from office. If it succeeds, she will be the first city official to be recalled in the city’s history.</p>

<p>“It’s brutal, and I don’t understand it,” she said. “I want to work with Uber. I’m not trying to ban them.”</p>

<p>Kitchen, who used to work as a social worker, does not fit a stereotype of a ragged, political bruiser. </p>

<p>During a recent interview at her City Hall office decorated with her mother’s paintings, she arrived in a blazer, wearing a city seal as a necklace. “A pin is fine but what woman doesn’t love a necklace?” she said, in a faint Texan drawl.</p>

<p>A longtime advocate for affordable housing and expanded medical coverage, she had been an expert in transport issues, never taken an Uber ride, and never thought much about the service. That changed in January 2015, when Austin’s newly-elected city council convened, and its mayor, Steve Adler, assigned Kitchen to chair the mobility committee, a team with jurisdiction over transport in the state capital.</p>

<p>Kitchen and her committee drew up a spreadsheet. It contained all of the city’s private transportation services, from common taxis to the pedal-powered rickshaws or bike taxis (also known as pedicabs) to the quaint, horse-drawn carriages beloved by tourists.</p>

<p>They all had to abide by the same ordinances: drivers were fingerprinted, vehicles were required to pull over to the side of the road to pick-up passengers, and companies had to be identified with some form of official marker. To Kitchen, it seemed logical that Uber and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/lyft">Lyft</a> would be subject to the same rules in the name of passenger safety.</p>

<p>“We had an unfortunate incident – a young woman coming out of one of our festivals called an Uber driver and got in the wrong car, and she was sexually assaulted, so we want to prevent that,” she said. </p>

<p>Kitchen was conscious that these rules should not be too burdensome. The official marker for transport providers, she said, could be rudimentary. “Just a sticker would be enough identification,” Kitchen said. </p>

<p>She drew up regulations to ensure the rules would be fairly applied across all transport providers. She had the backing of the mayor, the committee, and other council members.</p>

<p>“We thought we were done at that point,” Kitchen said, laughing.</p>

<p>Few of the technology enthusiasts streaming into Austin on Thursday for the annual <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/08/sxsw-south-by-southwest-insiders-guide-2016">South by Southwest</a> (SXSW) festival will have heard of Kitchen – or the controversy she has stoked in the liberal Texan enclave.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Uber users who logged onto the app in Austin were informed there was an option called 'Kitchen’s Horse and Buggy'</p>

<p>Had the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/sxsw">SXSW</a> hordes arrived in the city back in November, when Kitchen and her team’s regulation was working its way through the city’s bureaucracy, they would have found it hard to escape the local politician’s name.</p>

<p>In a remarkable example of the lengths Uber is willing to go in order to crush its political opponents – however small – the company redesigned its app to broadcast a stinging piece of political sloganeering against the councilwoman.</p>

<p>One day in early November, Uber users who logged onto the app in Austin were informed that, in addition to a fleet of on-demand Priuses and Chevrolets available at the tap of a button, there was also an option called “Kitchen’s Horse and Buggy”.</p>

<p>For a flat rate of $50, they could order the city’s most antiquated form of transport, the horse-drawn carriages, named after Uber’s political opponent.</p>

<p>The point of the not-so-subtle gimmick was hammered home in a press release from Uber’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> division.</p>

<p>“Austinites looking to Uber around town today will get a glimpse of what life could be like if the Austin City Council adopts Council Member Ann Kitchen’s ridesharing regulations,” it said, claiming the rules would prevent the company from operating in the city. “Council Member Kitchen’s plan would impose 19th century regulations on 21st Century technology.”</p>

<p>This was not the first time Uber had used its app to attack a political opponent. </p>

<p>Months earlier, when New York’s Mayor Bill de Blasio floated the possibility of restricting Uber’s expansion, the company’s enormous (and ultimately successful) lobbying effort included a similar tweak to its app, offering users a “de Blasio Uber” option, with a 25 minute wait time.</p>

<p>But that was de Blasio, mayor of America’s largest city. The “Kitchen’s Horse and Buggy” option offered to Austin users was an attack on the low-profile city representative of one corner of Austin. “At first it was funny. It was just ludicrous,” Kitchen recalled. “Then it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>She added: “These guys out in Silicon Valley like to consider themselves disrupters, but they’re just another version of what we’ve had before: big business [types] who think they can write their own laws.”</p>

<p>For its part, Uber defended targeting Kitchen. “Ann is the chair of the mobility committee that introduced this ordinance,” Uber spokesperson Jennifer Mullin said. “If you’ve seen the regulations, you see they’re clearly written for the incumbent industry.”</p>

<p>In December, a month after Uber’s redesigned app was rolled out in Austin, Kitchen’s regulations were finally approved. It was a significant victory for the councilwoman, but it was short-lived.</p>

<p>Uber and Lyft swiftly created and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2016/01/21/ridesharing-works-petition-had-financial-help-from.html">funded</a> a political action committee, or PAC, called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ridesharingworks.com/">RideSharing Works</a> to overturn Austin’s new ride-sharing regulations. The aim was to secure enough signatures to win a special referendum to put the council’s regulations to a city-wide vote, and then defeat Kitchen’s plan.</p>

<p>“Look, it’s the state capital of the second most populous state in the union,” a Lyft spokesman who works for RideSharing Works, Reed Galen, added. “It’s an important city for us.”</p>

<p>Uber gave $18,111 in in-kind contributions and pledged $10,000 to help pay for a fleet of canvassers to collect signatures on the street. Lyft gave $8,730 in-kind and also pledged $10,000. Within three weeks, the campaign claims it garnered <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://kxan.com/2016/01/19/ridesharing-petition-garners-more-than-65000-signatures/">65,000 signatures</a> (triple the number they needed).<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p></p>

<p>From city hall, it was clear that while Kitchen had won a battle by getting the legislation passed, but she was on course to lose the wider war, potentially at great personal cost. The combined force of Uber, Lyft, and a slew of PACs was, most observers agreed, likely going to overturn the city’s regulations in the citywide referendum in May.</p>

<p>In what looked like an attempt to salvage a compromise, Adler, the mayor, tried to introduce a voluntary scheme under which Uber and Lyft drivers would be incentivized, rather than compelled, to submit their fingerprints. </p>

<p>Adler and Kitchen argue fingerprinting is a key issue because it enables the city’s most robust background check, which cross references against FBI records. They believe a slew of serious sexual assaults by on-demand drivers in Austin underscore the need to improve screening. </p>

<p>And there is precedent. In a rare example of city authorities laying down the law for ride-hailing companies, Houston successfully implemented finger-printing background checks after an Uber user was raped by a driver in the city. Uber <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2015/10/07/background-checks-center-city-fights-uber/">begrudgingly</a> relented to the new rules, whereas Lyft abandoned the city in protest.</p>

<p>Under Adler’s new plan, sharing economy service providers – initially Uber and Lyft drivers, but potentially Airbnb hosts too – would earn “badges” if they submitted to fingerprinting background checks, entitling them to special privileges. </p>

<p>It was intended as a business-friendly fix. Uber and Lyft drivers, Adler said, would get access to lucrative pick-up points if they submitted to the enhanced vetting procedures, paid for by the city. The mayor’s scheme, dubbed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thumbsupatx.org/">Thumbs up!</a>, won the backing of the city council in January.</p>

<p>But it is toothless without the support of Uber and Lyft, both of which remain opposed to the arrangement, arguing it would create a two-tier system of drivers and discriminate against those who do not submit to the time-consuming process of background checks.</p>

<p>That means Kitchen’s regulations for universal, compulsory checks, and parity for all of the city’s private transport providers will (by most accounts) be defeated in May. </p>

<p>But the councilwoman is not just expected to lose her regulations. She could lose her job, too. Neither Uber nor Lyft appear directly responsible for the effort to recall Kitchen.</p>

<p>But the attack on the councilwoman, stoked by Uber and its “Kitchen’s Horse and Buggy” initiative, has put her in the crosshairs of allied political operations that now want to see her removed from post. And Uber did not dispute that it precipitated the recall movement.</p>

<p>Mullin, the Uber spokesperson, did not dispute the assertion that the company galvanized the effort that has now led to moves to oust Kitchen. “A lot of people in Austin use Uber,” she said.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Few doubt that Kania and Moreland will trigger the recall election, probably in time for a vote in November</p>

<p>“Since when can’t adults decide how they’d like to travel?” said Justin Arman, executive director of conservative PAC <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.tagtexas.org/">Texans for Accountable Government</a>, who is helping organize against Kitchen, whom he called “a threat to the social and economic freedoms that create local prosperity”.</p>

<p>“These regulations really infantilize the good people of Austin,” he added. “There’s no such thing as zero risk, and according to Kitchen’s logic, everyone should be fingerprinted – and hey, why not even chipped? – before leaving the house.”</p>

<p>The recall effort has been coordinated by another right-wing PAC, Austin4All, which seeks to defend the corporate interests of ride-sharing apps.</p>

<p>It is led by Rachel Kania, 28, and Tori Moreland, 25, who raised $46,000 for the Kitchen recall campaign, close to half of it from Joe Liemandt, billionaire CEO of the software firm Trilogy. </p>

<p>The pair quickly secured 7,000 signatures, exceeding the tally needed to instigate recall procedures against Kitchen. </p>

<p>The city has hit back, saying the signatures are invalid on a technicality. But few doubt that Kania and Moreland will, in the end, trigger the recall election, probably in time for a vote in November.</p>

<p>Local media describes Kania and Moreland as a mysterious pair who are hard to reach. (One enterprising reporter from the Austin Monitor was denied entry at their launch event but got into a nearby building <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2016/02/austin4all-kicks-offs-its-ongoing-petition-drive/">so he could take photos from above</a>.)</p>

<p>Both are experienced Republican operatives. Kania is a former senior field and tech strategist for the Kentucky senator Rand Paul’s presidential campaign. Moreland worked for a consulting firm doing data analytics for Ted Cruz’s campaign for the White House.</p>

<p>Over margaritas at an outdoor Austin bar, Kania and Moreland told the Guardian that they tended not to speak to reporters because they had a singular focus. “Getting at the root of the problem,” Moreland said. “Ann Kitchen.”</p>

<p>Katia added: “Ann’s the definition of a really well entrenched politician who’s been bought by special interest. She’s self serving. There’s something bigger at play here.” </p>

<p>As evidence, Kania pointed to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=220211">$4,000 worth of campaign contributions</a> Kitchen has received from taxi drivers and lobbyists. “She’s absolutely corrupt,” she said.</p>

<p>They insisted that their political campaigning against Kitchen was separate from the anti-regulation efforts funded by the Uber and Lyft funded PAC, even if their causes were aligned. The fact that some canvassers happened to be doubling-up and collecting signatures for both initiatives at the same time was serendipitous, they added, but “not coordinated”.</p>

<p>Kania and Moreland were undeterred by the possibility the signatures they collected demanding for the recall election may be invalid, which may require they fund a second round of canvassing. “They think we’re going to give up or something,” Kania said. “We’re just getting started.”</p>

Rachel and Tori appear to have lost their moral compass. Community safety should trump the minor inconvenience of being vetted to the same standard as their competitors. Would either of them prefer to be sent home after an evening of over indulgence alone in a vehicle with a person who has several rape convictions, or someone who can prove that he does not?

It seems to me it is simply a case of Uber and Lyft wanting to remove any possible obstacles to drivers signing up to their service, thus reducing the companies revenue. This is about profit. Public safety and good governance must not be allowed to get in the way, it could set a VERY dangerous precedent ��



Author::::c4lib4n
DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:30:25Z
Or perhaps the existing forms of conventional travel are simply going to have to fade away, like the horse-drawn cab. The invention of the automobile brought greater risk to the driver, and required a new regulatory framework. Perhaps a new framework should be considered rather than attempting to foist the old one onto an emergening transport system.

I would of thought that riders safety was paramount. Background checks & fingerprinting of drivers would be in the companies interest if this was the case. Just to keep the ball rolling and the $ coming in for the company,that's what it's all about nothing else... shooting fish in a barrel.

I don't use Uber or Lyft anymore, I find the pricing ridiculous. However, more worrisome is the lack of screening, training and background checks and the fact they are bullying their way out of this. It's disgusting frankly. I also have had at least three pretty unsafe situations using them and I didn't use the service regularly so 3/4 bad experiences out of my sporadic use was enough to put me off.

Maybe you missed the news that Uber settled at least one of the lawsuits against it for falsely advertising they have good background checks. 28.5 million dollars, not allowed to claim they're the safest ride in town anymore, and their safe ride fee is now called a booking fee. They have at least two DA's still suing them for their laxed background checks that have allowed convicted rapists, burglars, identity thieves, sex offenders, and one murderer to drive for them. If I'm not mistaken these were all caught during a sting at one airport. Uber lies through their teeth about their background checks and it's been proven. They're worthless.

“These guys out in Silicon Valley like to consider themselves disrupters, but they’re just another version of what we’ve had before: big business [types] who think they can write their own laws.” Quite. Uber and Lyft's business model is welcome but they must learn to play on a level playing field and not pretend they are somehow different just because they designed a funky app. What is astounding is how the younger generation really, genuinely believe that Silicon Valley is somehow benign and does not have it's own multi-billion dollar agenda. When they do wake up to the reality of a Silicon Valley controlling the public good - will it be too late for them?

Exactly get rid of the rules and then whine about it when something bad happens. Anyone who believes business will behave morally without regulation has never read "Lord of the Flies". That's how businesses behaved and now we have regulations to prevent that. Remember how the right wing anti-regulation crowd whined about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill? "Oh! How could this have happened? Why can't the government stop that leak? And BTW, where's my gummint check to fix my business and pay my expenses?"

Both of those ride sharing firms have paid out serious money in settlements with victims after getting non-disclosure agreements from the victims. If there wasn't a problem why the settlement WITH a non-disclosure agreement? The info is available if you look for it. Google search pulls it right up. And the article clearly states that the city would cover expenses. And city workers do have to submit to background checks. Check out any online application for city employment, not elected office.

OK, not seeing the real problem here. Background checks, cabbies and limo drivers need 'em, can't work without them. Uber and Lyft do the same work for maybe about the same amount of money. The city offers to cover all expenses involved except maybe for the time and offered incentives to drivers for participating. But those two companies have spent a ton of money in opposition and funded a recall effort likely to cost the city a bundle. What are they hiding? They have paid out considerable sums in settlements to assault victims. Wouldn't it be in their best interest to know that a convicted rapist wasn't operating with their aps? What will happen if and when an assault turns into a homicide? How will those two young women feel about "personal freedom" then. Will they still be smiling when they send their condolences to the victims family knowing that the perpetrator could have been screened out by the background check?
