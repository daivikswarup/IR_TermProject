Apple, Trump, the government: can anybody find me someone to trust?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>f you wanted proof that Americans trust Apple more than they trust their own government, look no further than the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-request-response">FBI encryption debate</a>.</p>

<p>The battle between the two giants of modern American society – the nation’s government and the world’s largest corporation – is a watershed moment in technology and corporate history. It’s an amazing new high in the rise of brands, considered by many to be a sort of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.brandingmagazine.com/2013/07/18/will-brands-replace-religion-in-the-search-for-meaning/">religious force in the 21st century</a>. And though the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://in.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-poll-idINKCN0VX159">verdict</a> <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/02/22/more-support-for-justice-department-than-for-apple-in-dispute-over-unlocking-iphone/">is out</a> on who the majority of Americans will support in this battle, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-apple-fbi-polls-20160224-story.html">public opinion polls inconclusive</a>, the reality is we’re seeing a corporation successfully take on one of our government’s basic premises: that it knows best how to keep us safe. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/26/reverend-jesse-jackson-apple-tim-cook-fbi-shareholders-meeting">Jesse Jackson tells Apple boss Tim Cook: ‘we applaud your leadership’</a> </p>

<p>The public, broadly, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.people-press.org/2015/11/23/beyond-distrust-how-americans-view-their-government/">has a mistrust of government</a> and are looking for somewhere to place their faith. Some have drawn a connection between Apple’s role in this crisis, as keeper of the keys to citizen privacy, and the rise of fringe political figures – most significantly Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump. He is benefiting from a trust vacuum by using the wealth and power generated by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/opinion/campaign-stops/the-donald-trump-brand-win-or-lose.html?_r=0">licensing his brand</a>, experts say. </p>

<p>“People are looking for meaning,” said Josh Feldmeth, CEO of Interbrand North America, a well-known brand consultancy. “They’re looking for things they don’t just buy but can buy <em>into</em>. Trust in government is down, but that great human yearning to belong continues. People are willing to look to all corners to find leadership and guidance and something to believe in.”</p>

<p>The FBI chose this case because of its seemingly simple dynamic: our democratically elected government needs access to an iPhone for the safety of the country – but <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> is refusing to help.</p>

<p>Yet among elite media, the tone is heavily weighted toward supporting Apple; the Washington Post proclaimed that Apple is “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/25/tim-cook-protecting-america-from-itself-and-protecting-apple-from-america/">protecting America from itself</a>” and NPR described CEO Tim Cook as a “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.npr.org/2016/02/18/467253429/encrypted-messaging-app-ceo-tim-cook-is-a-national-security-hero">national security hero</a>”. </p>

<p>This allegiance to Apple shouldn’t be a surprise: Americans are suspicious of big business in abstract, but they adore the biggest one. Apple is the most trusted company in the world among “opinion elites” (ie well-informed members of the public), according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theharrispoll.com/business/Reputation-Rankings-Most-Visible-Companies.html">a Harris Poll</a> (second only to Amazon among the general population) and the most valuable brand in the world, according <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.forbes.com/powerful-brands/list/">to Forbes</a>. Tech in general is beloved: 74% of Americans trust the technology sector to do what’s right, according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.edelman.com/insights/intellectual-property/2016-edelman-trust-barometer/">Edelman’s Trust Barometer</a>. In contrast: only 39% of Americans trust the government to generally do “what’s right”.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">People are looking for meaning. They're looking for things they don’t just buy but can buy into</p>

<p>At Apple’s recent shareholder meeting, Tim Cook got <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/apple-shareholders-show-their-support-for-tim-cook.html">a standing ovation</a> from his shareholders, despite a rough couple of years for its stock price. </p>

<p>Even this week as Apple lost an ebook price-fixing lawsuit using a scheme the court described as “the supreme evil of antitrust”, the narrative in the tech industry press has been that an injustice has been done to the company. “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2016/03/07/supreme-court-refuses-to-overturn-apples-e-book-antitrust-loss/#6d6b7fc75b95">An innovative 21st-century business model fell victim to 19th-century antitrust law</a>,” a Forbes staff finance writer opened his story.</p>

<p>“Consumers trust Apple – the entrepreneurs, that funky west coast feeling – rather than big government,” said Chris Halliburton, a professor of international management and marketing at the prestigious business school ESCP Europe. “Apple’s your friend … it has your best interests.” Though this has always been the goal for marketers, they’ve never been so successful: “No one has done this like Apple’s done this. Apple’s truly a religion today.”</p>

<p>He paused. “Please don’t tell anybody but I’m still using a BlackBerry.”</p>

<p>Apple’s 1997 marketing slogan “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2936344/apple-mac/the-untold-story-behind-apple-s-think-different-campaign.html">Think different</a>” still resonates, says John Hagel, co-chairman for Deloitte LLP’s research arm Center for the Edge. “Apple’s brand narrative is an open ended call to action for the customers,” he said. “Their brand is not automatic – it depends on you. ‘Think Different’ was a call to action that spoke to something really deep within many of us.”</p>

<p>Hagel seems sentimental even just talking about that marketing campaign. “Before Apple, we had digital technology but we were all just given numbers,” he explains. “We were put in cubicles. We had all our personality squeezed out.” </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/22/snowden-government-trust-encryption-apple-fbi">We cannot trust our government, so we must trust the technology</a> </p>

<p>“The mantra of all marketers from time immemorial is our goal is to build trust with the customer, and Apple has done that,” Hagel said.</p>

<p>Government’s reputation has taken a beating, he adds, linking trust in Apple with frustration over this election. “There’s an increasing sense that our political system is dysfunctional and we’re being screwed, so we’re on a search. We will find the institutions to meet this need in us.”</p>

<p>Does he mean that in some senses, Apple is replacing the government as the overarching benevolent institution in which we trust? “It’s a strange time,” he said. “We’re in transition.”</p>

<p>To where? “I don’t know,” he said. “I really don’t.”</p>

In any case, one should be questioning authority. J Edgar Hoover is case in point for being VERY critical of "government". With brands, as linked in the beginning of the article, it does appear they have the potential to become "religion-like". While the scientific process is one aspect of the human condition which self-evidently deserves strong support, religions or corporations (or nations for that matter), ought to be seen as human designed concepts (thus flawed). Atheism Abrandism Anationalism? How can we all just be ourselves, not 'followers'?

Sorry, forgot to bring the point around. Which is that this very dictum - "believe in yourself" - is of course constantly abused by consumerist ideology, as we all know. When the latter says it, it really means "believe in yourself by advertising yourself", or "believe in yourself, you should be shopping more because you deserve it", and so on.

Quite possibly! :) But don't get me wrong: quip or not, your analogy is a good one, and therefore there is nothing throwaway about it AFAIC. But it may fall down in that one area, which is that people respond differently to captors who are fighting loudly among themselves. Or so one would assume; admittedly I am no psychologist.

Sane human beings do not need portable phones. In the past, great men ruled the earth without them and suddenly a child cannot live nowadays without them? You are being programmed to rely on delegates you can trust, but believe me you do not need to trust anyone but your own instincts. Do you want to rule your country, don't give your vote without lots of research and follow-up. You want to run your business, do not leave your employees alone. You want to raise your children, do not leave them unattended. Etc, etc. If you're too lazy to do all of this, then why do you get so mad when those you rely on are sharing your money, power and bedroom? Just be thankful that you live in a somewhat safe environment to the jungle out there. Always remember: your government is not your friend, and marketing is there to fool you rather than serve you.

Here is a little history lesson, when Reagan became president in 80', is when our nation integrity & honesty went right out the window! President Reagan de-regulated the financial industry which meant banks can sell insurance & insurance co.s can act as banks. Remember all of the mom & pop savings & loans that went under because of the new de-regulations! Banks & insurance co.s buying them left & right @ a fire sale! So when the government de-regulates & weakens all protective barriers that were in at one point in time to protect the economy, housing market from collapsing, stock market recession, bank failures.....does the have to continue on with nightmares? Welfare has increase since his term, the republican is a shambles of it was once was. The Republican Party was itself very progress according to SEN. Bob Dole for it was his bill that was passed for wic & food stamps in the 70's! Where were the democrats doing for people? The republics were the democrats of then & the democrats are republics of now! Ever since j. Edgar Hoover began spying on the American people or those he deemed in his own QUEER mind a threat to this country had their very surveillance team 24/7 on them. If the u.s. government which had a substantial head start on its own citizens on a technology jump before home pc's became aval. How is it that they are stuck behind a "CIVILIAN ENCRYPTION CODE" when the government has at least a 60yr. head start. Is Edward Snowden right that government is using san bernadino as a test case to FORCE ALL SOFTWARE cos to write for them a back donor operating system for every transmitting device for free? Forcing Apple to say here I am, I'm making a less encrypted OS. Well guess what that will invitation that some nefarious software co will write a Trojan horse, worm, virus, mole, camealion just bury it self and when the time goes off everybody will locked out of all of their devices! And the you'll have to pay for the licensing fee or purchase a disk out right. That will be the back lash, who knows maybe they'll spy on you for just as the fbi when j.egar ran the drag queen house.

“It’s a very strange thing to do [a story about] an American man, and not be able to finance this movie in America. And that’s very disturbing, if you think about its implications on any subject that is not overtly pro-American. They say we have freedom of expression; but thought is financed, and thought is controlled, and the media is controlled. This country is very tight on that, and there’s no criticism allowed at a certain level. You can make movies about civil rights leaders who are dead, but it’s not easy to make one about a current man.”http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oliver-stone-reveals-clandestine-meetings-873770

From the beginning this was always about testing the public's acceptance of having their "private" data raided, hung out and have it judged in public for the purposes of criminal conviction. As Snowden says we have known for a while now the US agencies have all this stuff if they want it - the difference is they can't yet use that data publically for convictions etc without the national security bullshit line. That is what's being tested here - our apathy towards our own privacy.

Contracts are no longer contracts when only one party writes them and you have no input. Just look at the terms and conditions you see for banks, utilities, software, and on line site.Over the last couple of years, they have expanded to 30-40 pages of legalese fine print that a simple click obligates you to give up legal right to go to court for abuses and mandate you must choose an arbiter whose entire income relies on repeat business from the very people who wrote all the legalese with no input from you. This new system does not come close to the idea of Contract Law where each party has equal input nor is coerced into acceptance with no input.
