Apple boss says virtual reality is 'really cool' – but what will he do with it?




DateTime::::2016-01-27T11:55:35+0000



<p>Apple is mulling its options for virtual reality, judging by comments made to analysts by its chief executive, Tim Cook, after his company’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/26/apple-iphone-sales-slowdown-2007-drop-holiday">latest financial results</a>.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3836826-apples-aapl-ceo-tim-cook-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single">Asked by one analyst</a> whether virtual reality is “more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream”, Cook plumped for the latter scenario. “No, I don’t think it’s a niche,” he said. “It’s really cool and has some interesting applications.”</p>

<p>He’s not the first big-tech CEO to be seduced by the technology. In January 2014, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook">Facebook</a> boss Mark Zuckerberg tried an Oculus Rift headset for the first time.</p>

<p>“Wow, that was pretty awesome,” he said, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/09/oculus-rift-mark-zuckerberg-cover-story-palmer-luckey">according to a later profile by Vanity Fair</a>. So awesome, in fact, that he went on to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality">buy the still-prototype headset’s manufacturer Oculus VR for $2bn</a>.</p>

<p>Tim Cook’s “pretty cool” suggests that <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> isn’t about to follow suit with a multibillion move into VR. But the company is clearly taking the technology seriously – and not just as an uninvolved observer.</p>

<p>Apple has been dabbling in VR for some time, in fact. For example, in 2015 the company commissioned 360-degree videos for U2, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/98556/20151022/weeknd-release-360-degree-virtual-reality-video-remix-hills.htm">The Weeknd</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://vrfocus.com/archives/24426/vrse-works-helms-muses-first-vr-music-video-revolt/">Muse</a>, under its Apple Music banner.</p>

<p>It even <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/28/apple-shows-off-its-first-ever-piece-of-virtual-reality-content/">sent a branded bus kitted out with Oculus Rifts to U2 gigs</a> so that fans could try their video out. Apple’s partnership for these projects with Vrse.works, the VR company founded by the film-maker Chris Milk, has given it first-hand experience of the process of producing VR content.</p>

<p>Apple is also investing in research into virtual-reality technology. Just this month, it <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9358ba1e-c07f-11e5-846f-79b0e3d20eaf.html#axzz3yQNuvn4K">hired one of the leading US experts in VR</a>, Doug Bowman, who had spent the last five years at Virginia Tech University researching “three-dimensional user interface design and the benefits of immersion in virtual environments”,</p>

<p>There are already researchers poking around VR within Apple. In 2008, it filed for two separate patents in the US, which were granted in 2013 and 2015 respectively. </p>

<p>The first was for a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=8,605,008.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8,605,008&amp;RS=PN/8,605,008">“goggle system for providing a personal media viewing experience to a user”</a> including “3D media”:</p>

<p>The second was for a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=(apple.ASNM.+AND+(%22head-mounted+display%22.TI.))&amp;OS=an/apple+and+ttl/%22head-mounted+display%22&amp;RS=(AN/apple+AND+TTL/%22head-mounted+display%22)">“head-mounted display apparatus for retaining a portable electronic device with display”</a> – a headset into which a smartphone would slot, much like Samsung’s Oculus-powered Gear VR, with a separate remote-control held in the hands:</p>

<p>Apple’s research and experiments around virtual-reality content and hardware have been going on for a while, then. Meanwhile, its App Store is providing it with more insight into the current generation of VR apps made by other companies.</p>

<p>Milk is also founder of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vrse-virtual-reality/id959327054?mt=8">Vrse, which has its own app on iOS</a>, for example, while startup <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://littlstar.com/">Littlstar</a> has released its 360-degree videos app for iOS and Apple TV. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/google-cardboard/id987962261?mt=8">Google Cardboard is available for iPhone</a> already, while the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/star-wars/id960108075?mt=8">official Star Wars app</a> has a “serialised virtual reality experience” called Jakku Spy within it.</p>

<p>Other experimental apps include <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/insidious-vr/id989844820?mt=8">Insidious VR</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sisters-virtual-reality-ghost/id957212695?mt=8">Sisters: A Virtual Reality Ghost Story</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/legendary-vr/id1007098842?mt=8">Legendary VR</a>. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/dinotrek-vr-experience/id1018497986?mt=8">DinoTrek VR Experience</a> gets you running with the dinosaurs, while photography company Carl Zeiss even has its <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vr-one-cinema/id945065060?mt=8">VR ONE Cinema</a> app for watching videos in a virtual cinema.</p>

<p>(Few of these efforts are iOS-only, it should be said: Google’s own exploration of VR with its Cardboard project means most are available on Android too. Some, like the Sundance Film Festival’s new <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=immersive.com.sundancevr&amp;hl=en_GB">Sundance VR app</a>, are Android-first.)</p>

<p>Apple has a ringside seat to see how quickly these apps catch on, and what that might mean for its own VR ambitions – adding that information to its own experiments with 360-degree videos through Apple Music.</p>

<p>Even if Apple holds back, iOS will still become an important platform for virtual reality thanks to two other services: Facebook and YouTube. Both added features for 360-degree videos in 2015 – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://youtube-global.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/youtube-presses-play-on-virtual-reality.html">YouTube also launched a separate “VR video” format</a> – and see their mobile apps as the main way people will watch these videos.</p>

<p>Apple can afford to bide its time, see how popular 360 and VR videos are in these apps, and monitor sales of headsets like the Oculus Rift, Gear VR, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR (and others) as they come out.</p>

<p>The company can also tinker behind the scenes with the related technology of augmented reality (AR), having <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/28/apple-metaio/">bought mobile-AR startup Metaio in 2015</a>. With plenty of hype around AR devices like Microsoft’s Hololens and companies like Google-backed Magic Leap, Apple already has a foot in both camps.</p>

<p>Apple may decide not to throw its weight behind VR and/or AR, though. In 2015, Cook was cutting in an assessment of Google Glass headsets – and by extension, devices designed to be worn on the face.</p>

<p>“We always thought that glasses were not a smart move, from a point of view that people would not really want to wear them. They were intrusive, instead of pushing technology to the background, as we’ve always believed,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come">Cook told the New Yorker</a>.</p>

<p>In the same article, Apple’s design boss, Jony Ive, described the face as “the wrong place” for wearable technology, as the company focused its attention on the wrist with its Apple Watch.</p>

<p>“This isn’t obnoxious. This isn’t building a barrier between you and me,” said Cook about the latter device – a comment that may seem hard to square with his view a year on that virtual reality is “really cool”.</p>

<p>Then again, from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/16/jobs-no-ones-going-to-buy-a-big-phone/">phablet-sized smartphones</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/10/technology/apple-pencil-steve-jobs-stylus/">stylus accessories</a> to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/steve-jobs-hated-subscription-music-services-2015-6?r=US&amp;IR=T">streaming music</a>, this would not be the first example of Apple criticising a tech trend before later embracing it.</p>

And perhaps that is why VR will probably always be a niche. AR on the other hand has a real chance to enhance some communication experiences. Technology is almost always about communication on some level. IT technology more then most - Any 'game changing moment' that VR/AR has, will be about humans connecting, just like all the game changers are...

That isn't virtual reality; you are real, the book is real, the words are real, your reading of those words are real, your interpretation of the words is real, and you imagining of those words is also real. Virtual reality would need a stimulus that isn't real, like if you started having a real conversation with the characters of the book then that would be VR, or madness.

Apart from CPU & GPU power, HD+ displays, real content and a range of affordable headsets then you are right, nothing is new - apart from everything! In The 1990's VR was an expensive and elitist concept, the range of corporate clients you list reflects that - Ford, Airbus, Harley Davidson, Eurotrain - and did you see that quality of that VR back then? Rubbish. What you are saying is a little silly, it is like saying I played a computer game of Pong on a IBM mainframe in the 1960's so what is the big deal about this computer gaming mass market? Everything is a big deal, it is the biggest entertainment industry in the world, and it didn't do that because someone played Pong on a IBM mainframe in the 1960's, it did that because super-computing became mass market.

I guess this is indicative why shares in Apple are dropping - when the CEO states he doesn't know what to do with VR - then you got a company that is headed by a man with no vision or imagination. And Ive's comments compound this, stating a VR headset creates a barrier for other people, that is the whole figgin point of an immersive environment. It is like they feel the reason for technology is reaching out and communication, that is a small part of it and not the whole concept. Clueless.

The "first use" for VR has long since been and gone. I worked for a company in the 1990s that designed desktop and immersive (headset and CAVE) VR systems for engineering companies, that were purchased by Ford, Airbus, Harley Davidson, Eurotrain and many others. It was a successful enough business that it was bought by a major CAD company who still a related line of products. There's really nothing new about it.
