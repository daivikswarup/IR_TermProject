Google self-driving car caught on video colliding with bus

<p>Newly released video shows the moment a <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google">Google</a> self-driving car learned the hard way not to tussle with a public bus. <br/></p>

<p> The collision happened on Valentine’s Day 2016, when a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/29/google-self-driving-car-accident-california">Google vehicle struck the side of a public bus</a> in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View. Footage recorded by cameras on the bus shows a Lexus SUV, which Google had outfitted with sensors and cameras that let it drive itself, edging into the path of the bus that was rolling by at about 15mph. <br/> It was the first time in several years of testing on public roads that a Google self-driving car prototype caused a crash. Google has blamed other drivers for past collisions during testing, but, in a first, accepted at least partial responsibility for this crash. </p>

We're living in the motorised middle ages | Martin Belam</a> </p>

<p> The Santa Clara Valley transportation authority released the video and post-crash photos this week to the Associated Press under a public records request. <br/> Though it was a low-speed collision, the impact crumpled the Lexus’ front left side, flattened the tire, and tore off the radar Google had installed to help the SUV perceive its surroundings. The Lexus had to be towed. </p>

<p>Neither the Google employee in the driver’s seat – who was required to be there under California law to take the wheel in an emergency – nor the 16 people on the bus were injured. <br tabindex="-1"/> The transit agency has concluded based on the footage that the bus driver was not responsible, spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said. An independent claims adjuster has not yet determined liability, she said. <br tabindex="-1"/>The 14 February crash is the first in which Google has acknowledged its car made a mistake that led to a collision. Google has reported that between September 2014 and November, its prototypes drove themselves about 400,000 miles on city streets near its <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</a> headquarters without causing a collision. <br/> Its fleet has likely driven an additional 100,000 miles since then, though the company won’t be specific. According to Google’s accounting, its cars have been hit nearly a dozen times on the streets in or around its Mountain View headquarters since road testing began in spring 2014. <br/> The Lexus intended to turn right off a major boulevard but stopped after detecting sandbags around a storm drain near the intersection, according to an accident report Google filed with the California department of motor vehicles. <br tabindex="-1"/> Photos show two small, black sandbags on either side of a drain at the curb. The right lane was wide enough to let some cars turn and others go straight, but to avoid driving over the sandbags, the Lexus needed to slide to its left within the lane. The bus and several other cars that drove straight were to the left of the Lexus, in the same lane.</p>

<p>When the light turned green, several cars ahead of the bus passed the SUV. Google has said that both the car’s software and the person in the driver’s seat thought the bus would let the Lexus into the flow of traffic. The Google employee did not try to intervene before the crash. <br/> “This is a classic example of the negotiation that’s a normal part of driving – we’re all trying to predict each other’s movements. In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn’t moved there wouldn’t have been a collision,” Google wrote of the incident. <br/> The footage shows angles from eight onboard cameras. In one clip, passengers gazing out on a sunny afternoon are jolted to attention by a scraping, crunching sound and the impact, which causes several hand straps to sway. <br/> In another clip, the Lexus RX450 can be seen bouncing off the side of the bus. Photos show a long scratch mark traversing the side of the bus. The radar unit ended up wedged in the crack where two side passenger doors of the bus join, cracking a glass panel. <br/> Google has said that safety is its guiding principle in developing the cars, and that once mature, the technology promises to reduce collisions and deaths dramatically. <br/> The software that controls the cars is programmed to follow all traffic laws and to drive conservatively, the company said. <br/> The law-abiding algorithms that rule the SUV’s onboard computer make its decision to try and slip in front of the bus surprising. <br/> Footage from a forward-facing camera on the bus shows there was not much more than a full car length between the bus and the GMC Yukon in front of it. <br/> Google said it has tweaked its software to “more deeply understand that buses and other large vehicles are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles”. <br/></p>

<p>Google submitted an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/3946fbb8-e04e-4d52-8f80-b33948df34b2/Google+Auto+LLC+02.14.16.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">accident report</a> to the California department of motor vehicles and also detailed the incident in the February edition of its monthly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//selfdrivingcar/files/reports/report-0216.pdf">self-driving car report.</a></p>

The robots are programmed by human beings, who build their own assumptions in the software. Programmers also make errors. Testers fail to find some errors.

No you are not alone. The car was in the lane and moving slowly away from the lights and the bus tried to push past. I think in the UK context of would be seen as the bus drivers fault.

And have the whole Australian transport system run by Google? Not a good idea. What happens when it is hacked or for some other reason it goes down. Transport would be grid-locked. The more dependant we become on the Google cars, the more attractive it will be for criminals to hack.

And that "out of courtesy" is immensely human. I should see (or feel) a human in that car before I give it courtesy, which I often do. I also need to get an advance signal from the car that he is looking for courtesy. As the guy said, driving involves a lot of negotiation, and that is very human.

But if I was driving the car and decided to have a kip, so took my hands off the wheel, in the hope that the vehicle would miraculously find it's way home without any hitches, but it killed some poor fucker instead, i would get hammered, and rightly so.Lets hope that if that happened to a Google car the same would happen. But I doubt it.

It's not just the fact that the software assumes the bus would give way. The car was poised to turn right, but there were some sandbags around a drain right at the traffic lights, and that caused it to steer too far to the left to avoid them.

Why do we love to laugh at this while human drivers continue to kill each other, cyclists and pedestrians en masse? If it was human driven this wouldn't warrant any interest even never mind worldwide coverage.

Fools. Meddling where Gods alone should tread. Stupid engineers at Google think they know everything, but what happens when the self-driving car becomes self-actualized and like the beasts of old decides to crush its natural competitor the wily bus?

This is not a joking matter. I must say I am completely dismayed that some so called comedians in some of our papers are questioning whether the programmer of this car may have been a lady. This is wholly inappropriate and not all funny. Thank God the Guardian at least does not tolerate such crude attempts at humour.

I never said having the right to pull out, but usually out of courtesy/common sense you would stop and allow the idiot pulling out rather than just hitting them.

That's an interesting point. On the flip side, though, if automobile accidents are significantly decreased on average, that will lower insurance company's overheads and theoretically bring down costs across the board. It's an aspect of the problem that I never really bothered to consider, though.
