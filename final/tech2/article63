Hearthstone retires 150 cards and introduces a limited format




DateTime::::2016-02-03T14:20:55+0000



<p>Hearthstone, the collectible card game from Blizzard, is about to undergo its biggest shake-up to date, with more than 150 previously released cards being declared illegal in standard games.</p>

<p>Cards from the first two expansion packs to be released, July 2014’s Curse of Naxxramas and December 2014’s Goblins vs Gnomes, will no longer be playable in normal games. They will, however, be allowed a new format, called “Wild”.</p>

<p>The move, known as “rotation”, is common among games such as Hearthstone, which have a steadily growing pool of cards being released on a periodic basis. It’s generally seen as a bad thing if the overall number of cards grows too high: it increases that outlay required to become competitive in the game, makes mastering the game increasingly about feats of memory, and ups the difficulty of managing a collection.</p>

<p>By removing old cards from legal play as new ones come out, the number of cards available stays roughly steady – in Hearthstone’s case, about 600 of them. That’s lower than most real-world card games with rotation, such as Android: Netrunner and Magic the Gathering, which each have more than 1,000 cards in their standard pool. The smaller size reflects Hearthstone’s status as a simpler, more accessible game than either of them, but also means that the rotation announcement took many by surprise, coming several years before it was expected.</p>

<p>Rotation also enables the game’s designers to explore new avenues for the game, which may interact badly with the previous cardpool, and perform soft-patches, releasing new cards that differ slightly from old ones for balance reasons without needing to rewrite the text.</p>

<p>Of course, the downside for existing players is that some portion of the cards that they have bought (often with real money, even in a free-to-play game such as Hearthstone) become less useful. Standard format is poised to be the less important of the two ways of playing the game, with solo play, adventures and the arena (Hearthstone’s name for its draft format, where a new deck is made from random card picks) all being Wild only. But it still means that players with a solid collection of cards from two years ago will be feeling stung.</p>

<p>Key cards that will no longer be allowed in Standard include Dr Boom, Death’s Bite, Darkbomb, Imp-losion, Crackle, Shrinkmeister, Flamecannon, Unstable Portal, Goblin Blastmage, and Glaivezooka. While players will still be able to craft those cards using dust, they won’t be able to buy packs or adventures from the rotated-out releases – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/43vo5t/blizzard_removing_expansions_and_adventures_from/">a fact that has sparked concern among players</a>. The decision mimics offline games, where older packs go out of print, but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2016/02/hearthstones-new-formats-and-the-rise-of-digital-scarcity/">many have wondered</a> whether there’s a better option in a world where cards are nothing more than entries in a database</p>

<p>The split in formats will likely happen alongside the introduction of the Spring 2016 expansion, and according to the company’s announcement will see <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/19995505">a major re-evaluation of the existing cardpool as well</a>. It says that “while normally we’re quite conservative about making balance changes to Hearthstone cards (and we’ll continue to be in the future), we’re planning to take the new Hearthstone year as a golden opportunity to re-evaluate a number of cards in the Basic and Classic card sets, including class cards, and make some long-considered adjustments.” Hearthstone’s lead designer, Benjamin Brode, said that the adjustments will number “more than two” and “less than 20”.</p>

<p>One sweetener alongside the news is that the game will allow players to store more than nine different decks in the game: the number of slots is doubling, to 18. Of course, with two game formats rather than one, the number of decks players will be expected to store also doubles.</p>

150 cards? On the edge of legal in Thailand then. Bridge anyone?

Well, I hate the withdrawal, but I appear to be in a minority. I've also spent a lot on cards...

This is exactly what Magic does. You see the old themes given a new spin, creating new synergies and new balances. There's always a card like Giant Growth in Magic, but in each expansion it's slightly different and sometimes it's very good because of how it interacts with the rest of the strong cards in the meta, and sometimes it's pretty poor.

I think that cards like belcher and shredder caused a kind of stickyness power-creep, and I wouldn't be surprised if being able to reign that in is something that the developers see as very positive.

Here's me thinking I'm going to use all my gold now to buy GvG packs before this takes effect, as it'll be the most efficient way to fill gaps in my collection. I don't really care if they aren't usable in standard play as I have enough fun as things stand with a fairly small collection, as I've only played for five and a bit months.

You can still play these cards in the 'Wild' format though.

The cards from old expansions will only be available by crafting, and in turn only playable in wild mode. That must mean that they will be dustable; one estimate I saw suggested Naxx will get you around 3200 dust. Its even possible that they might have a short amnesty where you can dust for more, but even so - that will get you two new legendaries, or a bunch of rares/epics etc.

If that's true then that's pretty cool. I didn't know Sludge Belcher long but I'll miss him.

As I said to someone else, I think they are going to let you dust cards from the single player games; so you might well get a whole bunch of dust for some of those legendaries you've never used from Naax (and in its turn, BRM and LoE).

I think its very likely that they will reintroduce some of the functions of those cards via new cards, but perhaps with just slightly different stats. It just means that they can keep refining the decks, without having to keep going back and changing old cards.

Also, what will now happen is that you will be able to dust all the cards from Naxx if you wish. So all those lovely legendaries, rares and epics will give you a very decent dust pile to put into crafting cards which are going to be more useful in Standard.

Actually, sod it the single player is enjoyable and now it will force me to complete the class challenges sooner rather than later so I can at least have a wildly under-powered (but complete) Naxx deck for wild aka soon to be dead mode. The Goblin Gnome packs I bought with my gold can be most likely dusted and I'll know now to focus on a strong standard as my base before faffing about with anything else.

So glad that I bought Naxx the other day, for full price, with no warning that this might happen, that was well worth it...

Yeah, if anything they're guilty of not released enough cards, or perhaps releasing them too infrequently in large gluts. So you get a short period of upheaval as people adjust, then long periods of stagnation during which few of the new cards are actually used.

Boom is a bit generic but no more belcher or shreddder is great.

That's a shame, my Mech decks will have to go. I won't miss Dr Boom though, since I never had him.



Author::::BishopKnifeTrick
DateTime::::2016-02-03T19:07:37Z
Dusting Boom?! I've not had him that long, I can't do that on principal! But I agree, this move shakes up the meta and forces new decks. Every Paladin is a Secretdin, every Druid is Combo, every Hunter Face (cos why not ;)). I would like a higher dust value too. I am a F2P player and while I have a decent collection as I have been playing a long time, I'd like to be able to replace my collection more easily. But then as a F2P I can't really demand anything, the game is already set up very well for people like me and they've already given so much.

I don't think it's a money move for them, I think it's a design move.

DateTime::::2016-02-03T15:38:38Z
It's a bold move for sure. I hope they offer a double dust amnesty period for people (like me) who just crafted a whole load of new G&G cards. (cheers Blizzard)
