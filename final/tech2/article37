Elon Musk's Hyperloop could head to Europe before California

<p>Take that Silicon Valley – Slovakia, a country at the heart of Europe, might become home to the first hi-tech <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/hyperloop">Hyperloop</a> train.</p>

<p>Dirk Ahlborn, chief executive officer of Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT), <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://hyperlooptransp.com/#!/update-detail/56e1b957ce30e1362a7b23cc">announced on Thursday</a> that HTT has reached an agreement with the Slovakian government to explore building a local Hyperloop system. A transport system capable of speeds of up to 760mph (1,223kph).</p>

<p>According to Ahlborn, the next steps will include identifying a route that could connect Bratislava, Slovakia’s capital, with Vienna and Budapest.</p>

<p>“Slovakia is a technological leader in the automotive, material science, and energy industries, many of the areas that are integral to the Hyperloop system,” said Ahlborn. “Having a European Hyperloop presence will incentivize collaboration and innovation within <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/slovakia">Slovakia</a> and throughout Europe.”</p>

<p>Slovakian newspaper Pravda <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://vat.pravda.sk/technologie/clanok/386479-z-bratislavy-do-viedne-za-8-minut-revolucny-hyperloop-ma-zaujem-o-slovensko/">confirmed the agreement</a> with Miriam Žiaková, spokeswoman for the ministry of economy, who said that the government and HTT agreed to meet within the next 270 days to continue these discussions. </p>

<p>“Hyperloop in Europe would cut distances substantially and network cities in unprecedented ways. A transportation system of this kind would redefine the concept of commuting and boost cross-border cooperation in Europe,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyperloop-transportation-technologies-reaches-agreement-with-slovakia-300234762.html">said Vazil Hudak</a>, Slovakia’s minister of economy. “The expansion of Hyperloop will lead to an increased demand for the creation of new innovation hubs, in Slovakia and all over Europe.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/slovakia-great-first-stop-hyperloop-no-joke/">According to Wired</a>, Ahlborn expects Slovakia’s Hyperloop to cost between $200m to $300m and be completed by 2020. </p>

<p>Hyperloop is a brain child of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, who hoped that the 700 miles per hour train would simplify the modern commute. According to Musk, Hyperloop would enable people to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco in about 30 minutes. Currently, that trip takes six hours by car and one hour by plane.</p>

<p>Since Musk is already preoccupied with his other projects, such as SpaceX and Tesla, he has made plans for Hyperloop open to the public allowing other entrepreneurs to make it a reality. </p>

<p>In California, HTT’s rival Hyperloop Technologies is currently in the process of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://money.cnn.com/video/technology/2016/01/06/hyperloop-technologies-web-summit-ces.cnnmoney/index.html">building a three-mile test track</a>, which they hope to complete by the end of the year. Rob Lloyd, chief executive officer of Hyperloop Technologies, told CNN that their first commercial train could be ready as soon as 2021 or even 2020. </p>

<p>There are number of barriers making it difficult to build Hyperloop in California – land acquisition is expensive, earthquakes and opposition from locals who might not want a high speed train in their backyard.</p>

And, if you pop the cap off the end of the travel tube, it makes a handy space launcher.

Far cheaper to make roads completely driverless and far more profitable. As the driverless vehicles can stay in lane like a train current technology will suffice. No imperfect drivers to avoid either.

No they intent to build a test loop, but they still have not decided on technology. There is a long way between an artists drawing and a working machine. Come back in 20 years.

They have no technology right now. They intent to develop it. This is typical US advertisement.

It makes no sense to built a hyperloop route in Slovakia. The country is too small. So the time benefit is mostly irrelevant. Either you have two stops at each end of the country or at every relevant city. In the latter case you have not enough time for acceleration. Anyway, hyperloop is not a ready to use technology, like trains or even maglev trains from Germany and Japan. Presently, they have no technology and it does not work. This a non issue and we can talk about it in 10 to 20 years.



Author::::Tim2006

It is just 40 kilometers or so from Bratislava to Vienna. Sure the train will not reach its top speed on that stretch



Author::::Lecso
DateTime::::2016-03-12T08:46:15Z
I think the benefits are felt over long distances, and this short track is just intended as a testbed. Berlin-Paris in less than an hour sounds like a much more attractive proposition, for example, and could have major environmental benefits over air travel. Still not sure I'd like to sit in the thing though.

Rubbish. This isn't a scientific journal, and many readers will be unfamiliar with the basic principles of the technology. The least they could do is add an inset, summarising this in a few paragraphs, or do it at the end of the article.

Land prices ... whilst the UK land distribution is held in so little hands ..the relative cost of land we pions can buy for our housing will always be high..homeownership may have grow in the last 30 years but the space we live in has radically been reduced..

I would assume it's electrical. It would be great if it leads to a reduction in short haul flights.

How can this be projected to cost under $300m? That is a fraction of the comparatively feeble HS2 or Crossrail!

Not really, e.g. the Airbus 330 has a cruising speed of 511mph and the Boing 737 has a cruising speed of 544mph.

In formerly communist Slovakia the government may still own/control some land making it easier to get things going. In California or West Germany they'd have to deal with hundreds of prickly private land holders - I guess, making it more expensive and more long-winded. Japan, China, France have bullet trains - I guess their land aquisitions may have been also easier than in California.



Author::::HauptmannGurski

No. I looked for it, too, then wondered if it was the same system that I knew by name only from my childhood. It reminded my of what is called Pneumatic Tube in English (Rohrpost in German). I checked on the famous encyclopaedia.

The technology underpinning the hyperloop has been discussed and described many times over the last few years, and the scientific principles behind it have been understood for decades. At this point it's pretty much down to the reader to educate themselves on the basics without being spoonfed every time it's mentioned, and any reader who can't be bothered to go to the effort of opening a second window in their browser is responsible for their own ignorance on the subject.

Vehicles on the interstates and the current trains are traveling at roughly 1/10th the speed proposed for the hyper loop. For the hyper loop to make an emergency stop in the same length of time would require rather greater g-forces. Or, longer stopping time at the same g-forces.



Author::::MakeYourOwnArrow

If designed properly the hyperloop could actually be better than trains and highway systems in earthquake zones because it can be designed to be compliant.. or to freely shift above the ground similar to the way large oil pipelines are design. The ground can move underneath like crazy and it isn't a huge deal. Building it off the ground on pillars helps reduce the footprint and environmental impact too.
