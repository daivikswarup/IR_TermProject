12 things today's gamers don't remember about old games

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">G</span></span>amers tend to glorify the past, wistfully recalling when graphics were simple, but the challenge was tough. Get two gaming veterans together and it’s not long before they’re reminiscing about how good Final Fantasy used to be, and how Jet Set Willy was better than Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>

<p>Well I was there and let me tell you, it was weird. Here are 12 aspects of ancient gaming history that we tend to forget. <br/></p>

<p>When the first games consoles appeared in the 1970s, they had black-and-white graphics. The box would often boast ‘comes with 10 games!’ – but it was 10 different versions of Pong. Football? Pong with more bats. Squash? Pong with only one wall. Still, the electricity was off most of the time anyway, so we just played with the packaging. </p>

<p>Home computers would often come with a book entitled ‘fun games to program yourself’. When you finished typing gibberish, you got to play a game called Syntax Error where the aim was to cry until your dad located the one line where you used a comma instead of a semicolon. When he finished and hit ‘Run’, you played Pong.<br/></p>

<p>That’s right, they had ONE* button! Until the Nintendo Entertainment System came along in the mid-eighties, you could forget about being able to jump, fire, strafe and open a conversation window at the same time. If you owned a Spectrum, you had to buy a separate interface to use a joystick – and they broke <em>all the time</em>.<br/><em>(*Okay, so the ColecoVision and Intellivision controllers had more buttons, but they looked like prototype mobile phones not joypads – and they were silly.)</em></p>

<p>Cassettes! Those things your mum and dad used to record the Top 40 on. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/games">Games</a> took about five minutes to load, and even then they would probably crash at the last second. During the loading process they would make weird noises like R2D2 being tortured by the Clangers.</p>

<p>Some games showed pixel art and flashing coloured lines on the screen while loading. This was to fool you into thinking that something was definitely happening. It was often a lie.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, all games came with lengthy instruction manuals. Titles like Elite and Lords of Midnight even had short novels that players were asked to read before starting. If a modern game asked you to read a short novel before starting, it would be on the pre-owned shelf at Game quicker than you could say ‘Britain’s literacy crisis’.<br/></p>

<p>A lot of the principles of action video game design came out of the immensely competitive coin-op industry of the late 70s and early 80s, when companies like Sega, Namco, Taito and Capcom were in the business of separating you from your 10p as quickly as possible. Most people have no idea that Donkey Kong has three different levels after the first one. </p>

<p>Until hard drives and cartridges with battery-backed memory were widely available, very few games allowed you to save your progress. If you died, you went back to the beginning, and if you had to go on holiday before finishing <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2010/sep/13/games-gameculture">Super Mario Bros</a>, you put the game on pause and hoped your house didn’t burn down while you were away.</p>

<p>There were no online 32-player Battlefield sessions for us. Also, we didn’t have Reddit, we had bulletin board systems, which were very different because they were full of angry anonymous men being horrible to each other. That’s almost inconceivable now.</p>

<p>If you yearn for a time before weird indie games turned up to “spoil” your fun, hard luck; they’ve been around since the beginning. In the 1984 title Deus Ex Machina, Dr Who actor Jon Pertwee narrated a story about a lifeform evolving from mouse poo, while the accompanying music tape played experimental synth pop. </p>

<p>In the olden days, if you wanted an over-enthusiastic youth to shout at you about video games for two hours, you had to go to Currys and ask a sales assistant to show you Manic Miner. Instead of YouTubers with crazy names like <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/22/pewdiepie-youtube-felix-kjellberg-this-book-loves-you">PewDiePie</a> and StampyCat, we had games magazines with crazy names like Crash, Zzap and ... Your Sinclair.</p>

<p>There was no Xbox Live. If you wanted to meet and play against other gamers, you went to the arcade, a hive of scum and villainy where all the high scores tables were dominated by local heroes called TIT, BUM and NOB. You’d spend hours uselessly staring at a screen while pathetic bullying sociopaths mocked everything you did. We’ve got Twitter for that now.</p>

Great piece. I spent pretty much every school lunch time followed up by a further hour after school from the age of 12 (when it was compulsory to leave school premises between 12:55 and 1:55 pm) until the age of 17 down at my local arcade in Bristol. Even now the name of the place "Spellbound", sends waves of nostalgia over me. Whilst the older boys who would come and blow cigarette smoke, sometimes surreptitiously, other times blatantly, trying to put me off my stride when gaming, I eventually got to the point when I could circumnavigate the room of arcade machines, take my pick and complete the game at will. My favourite, for sheer difficulty, and concentration required had to be Black Tiger which I could do, just, within the lunch hour. Anyone else remember this arcade classic? en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Tiger_(video_game)

I had this one Indiana Jones knock off that came with a ton of extra material including a small tourist guide for 1920s Paris. The extras were more fun that the game, which I could never get to work properly.

You could also tell because more of the chests had health or magic potions in them.

I remember the BBC Micros we had at school. I can't remember any of the games for the life of me but they seemed amazing at the time. The Acorn as well was a classic. I think there was a game called POD which as a 5 year old was more than amusing

Yeah, maybe it was. I was thinking of the master system as a name and for some reason instead visualised the NES; but probably is the MS. Kid was probably far too basic a game for the MD, which after a few versions after a while probably had Sonic built in.

It wasn't 64k either :D The game's source code was only 32k, the final binary a lot less

I assume you either just randomly pumped a memory location in or you are a proper nerd... as far as my commodore 64 manual (yes I have one to hand) shows 35836 seems to be in the VIC interface memory space... but I wonder if you meant 53836 which would be an undocumented function (though perfectly valid to play with)

It took companies about a decade to realize that "cheats" (especially infinite lives) should really be a part of the game. I suspect that in the early days games developers felt:a) They should follow the amusement arcade model, which entailed a game lasting around ten minsb) If they made a game too easy it would be completed too quickly, and the customer might feel ripped off

Shocking fact, once urban myth but verified:Ultimate created "Knight Lore" before they created "Sabre Wulf" (the development periods for both overlapped). However, they felt that once they'd released Knight Lore, Sabre Wulf would feel like old hat. So they sat on Knight Lore, released Sabre Wulf, made a boatload of cash from it then released Knight Lore later in the year.

Loved that Delta Mixiload. Still emblazoned in my head. It was almost like being a DJ, switching from arpeggio to funky, and from Bonham to Rumba.

All Microprose games, obviously. Elite was great, as well (both the novella and the manual itself).

The stunning thing about the Atari 2600 is that programmers had 128 BYTES of dynamic data to work with in any given game.

After the invention of TurboLoad and Novaload most C64 games loaded in around 5 mins.

Agree to some extent. The best ever football game was Sensible Soccer on the Amiga, which had a brilliant control method with "aftertouch" influencing the ball after it was kicked. One button, eight directions, utterly brilliant.

Actually, they were mainly drawn piece by piece with outlines first and then flood fill. It was the flood fill that took all the bloody time. There was one image in either "The Golden Baton" or "Heroes of Karn" (can't remember which) which took about 3 mins to draw.

I discovered a few months ago that nobody here in the States knew the names of the characters in Gauntlet. They honestly thought I was making it up. "Y'know...Thor, Merlin, Questor, Thyra...?" "WHAT? No, they were just called Warrior, Wizard, Elf, Valkyrie..." "NO they bloody weren't!" etc.

Monkey Island II on Amiga loaded across something like 36 3.5" discs



Author::::Kaitain
DateTime::::2016-03-08T19:37:58Z
Eh? Elite was a single load game. There were no "six tapes". There was an extended disc version for the BBC B, but that's about it. The core game fitted into 32k (although the C64 and Spectrum 48k used their extra memory to add more missions).

Yes, what really made 84 onwards so creative was that the number of game-playing machines, most noticeably the c-64, reached a critical mass which meant that there was a much better chance of being able to make a return from game development, and creativity really flourished. There were certainly a lot of truly bad games that perished quickly, but so many completely original concepts were first developed then, and a great many of today's games are simply more sophisticated versions of these concepts, though not always more enjoyable!

I suggest that you wait until you ARE older before declaring that change is harder the older you get. As an "old geezer" of 65, who was programming in COBOL 10 years before you were born, I can assure you that many of us don't have a problem with change. I've always been an early adopter, but as I got older I became a little wiser, and realised that blind acceptance was much less sensible than informed choices. Technology is littered with expensive failures which some people HAD to have the moment they came out. I doubt that you have much memory of the Commodore 64, which came out before you were born, and completely dominated the games market in the first half of the 1980s.

Actually, 'press play on tape' would have been on the C64, without the 'R Tape Loading Error' you had on the speccy. On the C64, you just got a blue screen for 5 minutes followed by it either resetting or just sitting there forever.

Having played it excessively on both, pretty sure the Z80 versions has the same (or similar) routines for generating the data.
