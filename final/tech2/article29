Apple's iOS needs an overhaul in the age of bigger, faster smartphones




DateTime::::2016-02-24T07:00:33+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hile every other smartphone manufacturer is trying to speed up your smartphone, providing ever snappier interactions, better links and faster access, Apple is intentionally holding the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone">iPhone</a> in the slow lane.</p>

<p>It’s obvious when you look at the iPhone and its default interactions. Everything has a smooth animation. Those slick-looking motions were interesting about three years ago, but today they’re holding users up, slowing things down that that should be quick.</p>

<p>There’s a clear reason for it: make them slow on a fast, new phone and it’ll help keep the experience consistent between generations. But when that slowness belays the power and improvement in devices, is it worth the trade-off?</p>

<p>With hundreds of million of iPhones and iPads sold each year, it is the piece of software that the majority of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> users interact with the most. When it launched in 2007 with the original iPhone, Apple’s iPhone OS (as it was then called) looked almost revolutionary compared with the clunky, unrefined smartphones operating systems that had come before. <br/> <br tabindex="-1"/>It was based on the idea of apps. Discrete silos you could tap, have the app fill the screen, do your thing, and then hit the home button to come back out. It was a step change and it was simple, effective and about as good a smartphone experience as you could get. At the start it was just Apple’s apps too, as the App Store didn’t launch until 2008, so everything had the same design ethos; interactions were universal. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/>But nine years on, smartphones have grown bigger, faster and more powerful. Tablets exist too and the app ecosystem has exploded with innovation and complexity. And iOS wasn’t designed for this. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>It may have changed aesthetically over the past nine years – from skeuomorphism to flat colour and parallax effects – but iOS’s interface paradigm has not shifted. This means as a user a primary interaction is bouncing between apps and the homescreen. The system feels like it’s stuck in 2010. </p>

<p>Take the laborious task of app switching by double-tapping the home button. Users are forced to bounce around, wasting time, when everything else around them becomes faster and all about time saving. <br/> <br/>Even something as basic as Settings no longer just works. Apple joined the modern smartphone party with Control Center in 2013 providing quick toggles for things such as Airplane mode, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. But doing more than simply toggling functions on or off requires heading to the settings app, which there’s inexplicably no shortcut to from the Control Panel. It’s at least two taps and possibly a swipe from any other app. <br tabindex="-1"/> <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Meanwhile as users we’re doing more things with a greater number of apps, each doing one thing well, which means getting around really needs to be fast and easy. But using settings as an example: connecting to a different Wi-Fi network takes four taps from any other app. Disconnecting from a Bluetooth speaker takes five taps. Activating Low Power Mode takes four taps. You get the picture. <br/> <br/>The animations have weight and look nice in isolation, but the slow, constant bouncing into and out-of apps gets old really quickly. It stands in stark contrast to the desktop operating system Mac OS X El Capitan, which Apple has successfully made faster than ever. In fact, while other mobile operating systems are faster than <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/ios">iOS</a>, none has yet cracked snappy and useful multitasking quite like a desktop computer.<br/></p>

<p>The problems with iOS aren’t limited to the change in intensity of what we do on our iPhones though. Apple’s hardware has changed its size, and the software is no longer fit for purpose. <br/> <br/>The lack of a universal back button within reach is a good example. On a smaller sub-4in screen this wasn’t an issue. But first with tablets, and then worse still with phablets, the usability has dramatically decreased. To go back one step in an app you used to have to tap a menu button in the top left-hand corner of the screen. Try that one-handed a large phone.</p>

<p> <br/>Now you can swipe right to go back one stage within an app – if you know about it – while a force swipe from the very left of the screen on an iPhone 6S will switch to the last used app or to the recently used apps. It’s difficult to pull off, particularly with one hand, with a case on your smartphone or when using the 5.5in iPhone 6S Plus. And it’s not intuitive. Instead you’re encouraged by muscle memory to double-press the home button to bounce to the recently used apps, select one and zoom back in. Rinse and repeat. <br/> <br/>The “return to the previous app” system, which places a small text link at the very top left of the screen, seemed like an upgrade. But while it works as advertised, try reaching that without using two hands. Plus, no one seems to have thought about obscuring the cellular signal indicator, or if they did, they didn’t care.</p>

<p> <br/>In the frequent signal- or data-less UK, unknowingly tapping a link and getting nothing because you haven’t got a connection is infuriating. The only way to get rid of the text covering the cell signal without going back to another app? You’ve guessed it, bounce out to the homescreen or another app and bounce back in again. <br/> <br/>When smartphones are large enough that you can’t easily reach the top of the screen with one hand or two hands in a thumb-typing position, without having to resort to some accessibility function such as the double-tap home button screen crush, it’s time to change something. Every other modern mobile operating system has some resemblance of a back-one-step button within easy reach. </p>

<p>Then there are notifications, which should be core to a mobile OS, but bring their own circle of hell to iOS. They are practically unusable. Apple still relies on badges, banners and a list of notifications in a pull-down sorted by day that is some-how disconnected from the apps that are meant to have received the notification. <br tabindex="-1"/>If you go into an app that has a notification, you’ll quickly find it doesn’t actually have the message and has to go and get it, which you can forget if you’ve just gone underground or out of range. Once you’ve actually managed to read the message the notification stays stuck in the notification shade until you manually clear it. Notifications, then, end up being abandoned like email inboxes overflowing with 10,000+ unread. </p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span><span class="bullet">•</span><span class="bullet">•</span></p>

<p>So, while Apple’s hardware has gotten a lot faster, more capable and productive, iOS feels like it’s stuck in 2010.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p> As it did 15 years ago on desktop with its transition from Mac OS 9 to OS X, Apple needs to reinvent the way users interact with its mobile OS. Fortunately this time round it doesn’t need an underlying rewrite – as OS 9 did when it bought an operating system with the return of Jobs and Apple’s acquisition of NeXT – but iOS needs more than just a lick of paint. </p>

<p>Our phones have changed, how we use them has changed, and our expectations of what a smartphone can do and how fast it can do it have changed. With more than 1bn devices that run iOS sold, it’s time the operating system changed too. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

I have an ipad (4) and a (cheap moto e) android phone. The ipad is the better hardware, clearly and is a pleasure to use. However comparing Android lollipop with ios 9.2, I feel Android is pulling ahead. The article mentions notifications, quick settings and task switching, all of which I agree with. I never use IOS notifications, I just notice the bubbles and click on the app. I use Android notifications all the time (often without opening the app). Task switching is easier in Android, and the links between apps is better (and you can choose which app opens).There are also simple things about Android which just work better - when I get to work my phone switches itself to silent (built-in moto active app) and switches back when I leave. I can't seem to do that on an iphone. The big plus about the ipad is the quality of the hardware (again) and the long-term support. My Android phone may get 6.0 if it's lucky (eventually) - my ipad is gone all the way from ios 6 to ios 9, and will probably get 10 as well.

A favourite OS of mine was AmigaDOS, a UNIX type OS with Window features before Windows really took off. Highly stable, multitasking, and super efficient on memory, with great hardware underpinnings.

As an Android user I have to admit this article is more than a bit unfair. The article confuses GUI design with underlying OS design.

Agreed iOS does need an update. The rounded square icon thing is old hat and the shitty bolt-on quick settings and notifications feels like a crappy work around, there's so much more that could be done with a multi-touch interface. Come on Apple spend some cash and innovate, it's not like you don't have any...

Ridiculously pedantic reply. A comma isn't easily available on the iPhone keyboard in a mode that the majority use. Its quite simple.

The original post, if you cared to read it was... Perhaps they could actually get round to putting a full stop and comma on the primary keyboard - something Android phones have had for years. Yes, I know you can double tap ' space' for a full stop, but having to go the sub- keyboard for a comma is Neanderthal. At least you can now use third party keyboards.

It's probably not so much for the processing but the back end databases Siri connects to. Asking Siri anything requires up to date information from the Internet, you'd need an awful lot of space on your phone to cover a range of requests. But yes in some aspects a dedicated Siri chip would be nice for actions Siri can perform locally on the phone. An offline and an online Siri.

Agree with the article, and it's why I have found a solution to the majority of the issues mentioned by jail breaking my iPhone and installing appropriate patches. If I couldn't do that, then I'd probably be with android.

Just the lack of a back button has always been enough to make me seriously dislike iOS and wonder how anyone can want to have one of these things, not to mention the generally non-intuitive user experience of pretty much all of Apple's products. Excessive prices, huge profits and the ease with which you can smash the screen are further big no-nos for any sensible person.

Agree with everything EXCEPT your comment about el capitan.The iPhone does feel dated, the reason why i switched to an Xperia running android 3 years ago. It embodies everything apple set out to achieve (seemless integration with apps and hardware) only better, and it's waterproof.As for el crapitan, yes it is fast, but nothing works any more. All my ageing, mostly adobe, software is now useless if i don't spend well over a thousand quid in upgrades.I'm not sure now what would persuade me to go back to an iPhone.

its obvious that apple are aware of certain settings and system layouts etc..what you think they just sit around and play on angry birds etc. Its important that when they do a complete overhaul it has to incorporate and be accessible to all users not just the one's who live in the fast lane...its whats great about the iphone ecosystem...you try using an android phone and although yes it has more innovotive features not many of its users use them and many dont understand them hence their fragmented take up of their latest OS.....i prefer those more intricate designs of android phones etc. but the majority of consumers couldn't care less....when apple are ready to update i'm sure it will benefit most not just the eager few.

Android is the name for the basic operating system the phone uses. It was developed by Google to be open source, meaning others can modify the system aesthetically and practically. This is similar to Linux on PCs, it also means that anyone can develop a software for those operating systems without special permission from Google (getting it on the play /app store for distribution is another matter entirely). This is in total contrast to Apples philosophy, which guards access to its basic code jealously. In pure philosophical terms that approach takes away the end users freedom, while open source allows the end user the flexibility we have come to expect from computers. This may not matter much to an end user like yourself, and isn't why people nowadays trumpet Android as superior, that's so because the user interface is quite simply easier to use and more practical. The only real analogy I can think of this morning is the improvement from a stick shift to an automatic in terms of ease of use, and intuitive features. Operating systems can be complex and so the benefits aren't immediately obvious but become apparent after prolonged use.

Yep. iOS is designed to be easy for kids and old people. Android is designed by techies for techies. Android is obviously a lot more flexible, powerful and fast to navigate around, but it is likely to confuse some people.

Context is a great thing in life. Criticizing something that takes a few tenths of a second as slow isn't quite right. What I do agree with you on is the lack of shortcut customization. That needs to happen. The rest are pretty much a case of what you're used to. I don't like back buttons while I love swiping to go back a step. It's a shame that doesn't work between apps but for bigger devices the user can always double-tap the home button and bring the display down.
