Is Dogtown and Z Boys a sports film or are documentaries a separate category? I'd have that I think.

Does Cool Runnings count as a sports film? Cool Runnings.

Author::::Scubar

Oh God, it's still Monday?!?



Author::::amipal

Why has Keef forsaken us?

All bye myself - just thought I'd pop back and leave this link it's a funny division glitch http://youtu.be/qASDQyx_IsY --- WTF ----

I'm on board with that.

Only if we are also counting Top Gun. And that's a battle you are not going to prevail in.

Are we counting Space Jam as a sports movie?

For years I thought I had seen Raging Bull, when in actual fact it was 'The Champ'. When I finally did see Raging Bull I was a bit disappointed.



Author::::Lazybones
DateTime::::2016-03-07T17:14:58Z
I'm a big fan of 'The Champ'.

I've never seen Caddyshack, however a quick google suggests encouraging things, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray? Sold.



Author::::WilliumCobblers
DateTime::::2016-03-07T17:07:31Z
After caddyshack, obviously.

I've always been a big fan of Tin Cup. Best golf film by some distance.

I'd never heard of that, it looks terrible. I can guarantee you that it's better than spawn though.

Dredd had a script?

Slapshot



Author::::FieryMeat
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:57:43Z
They were made at the same time, the script for Dredd was written before The Raid.



Author::::CunningStunt
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:57:22Z
They're doing another film. The creator of the comic is involved. I'm quietly hopeful.



Author::::alimantado
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:57:22Z
I love Any Given Sunday but I think I'd go with the first Rocky.

Author::::AngryMan13

Technically it has to be Raging Bull but that's not my favourite.



Author::::WilliumCobblers
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:54:48Z
Good crystal method tune on the soundtrack, mind you.



Author::::Scubar
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:54:36Z
Apparently someone's making a Bananaman film



Author::::AngryMan13
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:54:31Z
What's the best sports film?



Author::::Darkgoat
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:54:13Z
I've never seen Guardians of the Galaxy.



Author::::Scubar
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:53:27Z
Not Howard The Duck?



Author::::alimantado
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:51:45Z
Really? Surely Deadpool is the most for kids of any of them?

Flash Gar-don

As an NUFC fan (sobs) I feel that pain. You's can have Schteve if you want.



Author::::alimantado
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:48:30Z
Apparently they're remaking it - cherish your childhood while you still can, Socky.



Author::::Sandeman83
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:48:09Z
The worst film (never mind superhero film) ever mad is Spawn. Relentlessly horrific.



Author::::alimantado
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:45:28Z
Gordon's alive!



Author::::SockpuppetPseudonym
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:44:07Z
Sounds like a lot of people haven't seen Condorman.



Author::::PirateCaptain
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:42:19Z
Flash Gordon is the best film of a comic book. You lot are broken.
