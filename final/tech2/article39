FBI could force us to turn on iPhone cameras and microphones, says Apple




DateTime::::2016-03-10T14:33:36+0000



<p>If the FBI wins in its case against Apple to help it unlock the San Bernardino killer’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone-5c">iPhone 5C</a>, it won’t be long before the government forces Apple to turn on users’ iPhone cameras and microphones to spy on them, according to the company’s head of services Eddy Cue.</p>

<p>The FBI has demanded that Apple creates custom software that bypasses certain security features of the company’s iOS to allow law enforcement to brute force the passcode of the gunman’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone">iPhone</a> 5C.</p>

<p>But according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a>, making the modifications necessary in this case would set a dangerous precedent in offering backdoors into users’ smartphones.</p>

<p>Cue <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.univision.com/organizaciones/apple/apple-el-fbi-se-pone-del-lado-de-los-hackers-en-el-caso-del-iphone-de-san-bernardino">said to Univision</a>: “Someday they will want [Apple] to turn on [a user’s] camera or microphone. We can’t do that now, but what if we’re forced to do that?</p>

<p>“Where will this stop? In a divorce case? In an immigration case? In a tax case? Some day, someone will be able to turn on a phone’s microphone. That should not happen in this country.”</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> is trying to access the locked iPhone of one of the San Bernardino killers and insists it needs Apple’s due to the software protections built into iOS, which require Apple’s unique signature.</p>

<p>But security expert and NSA surveillance leaker Edward Snowden recently said that the FBI’s assertions that only Apple has the capability to unlock the phone is “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/09/edward-snowden-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-bullshit-nsa-apple">respectfully, bullshit</a>”.</p>

<p>Other security researchers have said that for Apple to modify the iOS software of the iPhone 5C to allow the FBI to guess the passcode via a machine without losing data would be a slippery slope.</p>

<p>Apple has the backing of the majority of the technology industry, including Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and Google, which makes the most-used smartphone operating system, Android.</p>

<p>The case will come to a head this month when Apple and the FBI go to federal court to contest the order. The US government was recently dealt a blow in a similar but unrelated case over the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/29/apple-fbi-case-drug-dealer-iphone-jun-feng-san-bernardino">unlocking of an iPhone in New York</a>, which it is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/apple-iphone-new-york-case-fbi-encryption">currently appealing</a> against.</p>

If the FBI wants hundreds of iPhones unlocked, my hope is that they're to shake down somebody running drugs for the Cartel or hurting children or things like that. The problem is that even though, without our money, these agencies would have to shut down tomorrow, there is no transparency whatsoever.

Any Goverment with all its money, can pay or blackmail its way to get someone to give them access, Any device can be hacked as fast as it comes to market, by someone in thier bedroom. This story is meant to make you feel safe, keep buying the product. Insults any hi tech thinking persons inteligence. There is only one way to stop it happening to you, Go back to a landline and sending letters. In a society land by money, greed trust no one but yourself.

Of course nobody's forced to buy an iPhone. I personally prefer a simple Cell Phone that only makes and receives telephone calls.

The government would not tolerate that, CarefuleReader. Which is why the batteries of phones made by US companies are not removable, either. Any American company that dared to challenge them would find themselves Gibsoned - as in what the FedGov did to the guitar company. The corruption and treason in the US government today is overwhelming.

Everyone should be able to see that. In light of the state of affairs on the ground, namely, a collapsing economy, rogue government with ulterior motives and that clear demand we allow them to become God himself, the attempt to stalk us as we innocently live is a bad sign.

What Sam3456 was trying to say is that a smart phone is NOT the only phone available that will make phone calls. I absolutely refuse to have a smart phone of any kind. Why should I want to peer into a piddling little phone screen when I've got an iPad or a 27 inch iMAC? My phone is a basic one that does calls and texts and that's all you need. The truth is you won't die if you can't access facebook every five minutes. People need to realise you can have a life without a phone and that people only a few years ago did just that - lived lives without being slaves to the slab in their pocket.

Get over it? What kind of defeatist attitude is that? A switch on both the mike and the camera is a brilliant simple idea, and I also put a bit of black tape over both of them on my iMAC and iPAD. I refuse to have a smart phone for this very reason. Instead of "Get over it", why not "Get in control"?

In many countries, 5 mins before a top politicians motorcade passe you, your phone will give a short beep for a missed call. You figure the reason.

Owners can easily fix this with a piece of black tape over the camera, as I do on all my devices, removing it as required. GHCQ have been able to do this for years, I am sure they either learned it, or shared it with the NSA.

And then Apple can add a second fingerprint scanner and tell us that we are twice as safe.



Author::::KattMann
DateTime::::2016-03-11T09:37:47Z
So we are agreed that the FBI have not asked for access to the camera or mic.

No it's not, it's about Apple showing concern about the privacy of its users. I'm not an Apple fan and don't buy their products, but in this they are firmly doing 'the right thing' by offering security to their users.

Exactly. They did it on September 11th, 2001. They jammed all electronic devices in Manhattan, thereby limiting 'footage' to poorly put together and horribly out-of-sync film submitted by various people who were in on the whole debacle and wanted their 15 minutes of fame. In a nutshell. There's a ton more that was done on that day, but I've offended enough truth-sensitive folks here, already. ��

How many would be willing to ditch the Apple ? Get a simple phone? They deservea boycott and the Feds deserve a mass civillawsuit for forcing false claims/advert on Apple's market. Unless, it's revealed that Apple has been lying --then go for them.
