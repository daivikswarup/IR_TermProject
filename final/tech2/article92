Google self-driving car collides with bus in California, accident report says




DateTime::::2016-03-01T07:28:18+0000



<p>One of Google’s self-driving cars has collided with a public bus in Mountain View, an accident report has revealed, in what appears to be the first example of one of the company’s prototype cars causing an accident.</p>

<p>The incident happened on 14 February and was reported to California’s department of motor vehicles in an accident report that the agency posted on 29 February.</p>

<p>The car was rolling at 2mph (3kph) and the bus at 15mph. No one was injured.</p>

<p>The report does not address fault. However, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google">Google</a> wrote that its car was trying to get around some sandbags on a street when its left front struck the right side of the bus.</p>

<p>The car’s test driver, who under state law must be in the front seat to grab the wheel when needed, thought the bus would yield and did not have control when the collision happened, according to Google’s report.</p>

<p>If it is determined the Google vehicle was at fault, it would be the first time one of its SUVs caused an accident while in autonomous mode.</p>

<p>Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman from the DMV, said the agency hoped to speak with Google on Monday about what went wrong.</p>

<p>In a detailed statement from its monthly report on its self-driving car project, Google said that the incident happened on El Camino Real, a busy six-lane boulevard with hundreds on intersections. The car was following a recent change to its programming, following “the spirit of the road” as well as the traffic code by hugging the far side of the right-turn lane to allow other cars to pass on the left.</p>

<p>“It then detected sandbags near a storm drain blocking its path, so it needed to come to a stop. After waiting for some other vehicles to pass, our vehicle, still in autonomous mode, began angling back toward the center of the lane at around 2mph – and made contact with the side of a passing bus traveling at 15mph. Our car had detected the approaching bus, but predicted that it would yield to us because we were ahead of it,” Google said.</p>

<p>“Our test driver, who had been watching the bus in the mirror, also expected the bus to slow or stop. And we can imagine the bus driver assumed we were going to stay put. Unfortunately, all these assumptions led us to the same spot in the lane at the same time. This type of misunderstanding happens between human drivers on the road every day.”</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">This type of misunderstanding happens between human drivers on the road every day.</p>

<p>Google says it has refined its software following the incident, acknowledging that buses and other large vehicles are less likely to yield. “In this case we clearly bear some responsibility because if our car hadn’t moved there would’t have been a collision.”<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>“We hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future.”</p>

<p>Hilary Rowen, a partner at the insurance regulation practice Sedgwick LLP and an expert in the issue of self-driving cars and legal responsibility, said the case is a good example of a conundrum that will soon be common.</p>

<p>“Here, the software didn’t avoid the accident, but the human could have taken over,” she said. “Who’s at fault – the driver, the bus driver, or the software? </p>

<p>Rowen said in real world situations, both the driver and injured party will actually be incentivized to blame the software which, if found to be guilty, will leave the driver’s record clear and likely have a higher payout for the injured party.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s going to be blaming the software all the time,” Rowen said. “All the time.” Rowen still thinks autonomous car insurance will be cheaper than human-driven car insurance because humans aren’t very good drivers.</p>

<p>“At a very visceral level, people will accept a higher chance of being maimed or killed by a human being than they will by being maimed or killed by software,” she said. “The self-driving car will likely be able to make better risk calculations.”</p>

<p>Google has been testing two dozen Lexus SUVs outfitted with sensors and cameras near the tech firm’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</a> headquarters.</p>

<p>Google cars have been involved in more than a dozen collisions. In most cases, Google’s cars were rear-ended. No one has been seriously injured.</p>

Don't think my previous comment (below) is anti- the idea of driverless cars. Most drivers are so incompetent that I'd rather take my chances on roads where many cars are automated. (In an example, though not a serious one - our number plate has been broken - again - by some idiot who reversed into it when parking.) I regularly see examples of crazy driving - not long ago, I was overtaken on the approach to a blind bend, when the other driver regained 'his' side only 5m from the bend - far too late, if anyone had been coming the other way.

As driverless tech becomes more pervasive, human-driving will become prohibitively expensive to insure. If you want to ride your vintage Triumph, you'll take it to a circuit.

Insurance costs will be a factor. Costs for drivers who take control on a regular basis will be higher due to the increased risk. If you let the computer drive you have cheaper insurance.

The whole point of a car is to transport people from A to B. They are IN the car and have nothing else to do but drive it. What is the purpose of a driverless car? To allow the occupants to work? Have sex? get drunk? For gods sake they may as well drive the damned thing!

Please see ISO 26262 (That is the INTERNATIONAL Organisation for Standardization).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262Safety of electronic systems in passenger vehicles is taken extremely seriously.Some systems on a modern car have four levels of software and hardware redundancy, meaning the multiple components or software functions would have to fail at the same time before the vehicle/situation would become unsafe.

I think in the end, private motoring will end up moving to closed race tracks weekends. Most people don't really enjoy sitting in traffic on the way home from work so if a robot can strive them while they read the paper or Skype their kids, fair enough.

At the moment yes but not for long. Do you know how self driving will come into the mainstream? It will start with public transport. The Netherlands are road testing robot buses as we speak. Taxis will be next. After that long haul lorries and delivery services. And then private cars.

Who said it needs to be intelligent? I have never ever talked about AI. You do not need intelligence to drive a car. You need to follow the rules of the road. Something which humans break all day every day. A city of self drive cars will inevitably be safer. If there are accidnets, most likely it will come from the human end. This has been Google experience. Before this bus incident, three had only ever been one crash involving their cars. And that was when a human drove into the back of one at a traffic light.

"The software in autonomous vehicles has been designed and programmed by humans. The people who do this are every bit as error prone as drivers."

Even if they add a new category of software error, they will significantly reduce accidents in ALL other areas. Imagine taking human error out of driving completely? Lane hogging, too slow, speeding, tail gaiting, roundabout politics, no indicator, and so on. So far the Google car fleet has never had a software error, at least none which has led to a road incident. The odds are good.

This reminds me of an accident my family witnessed where some pillock on an atv ('quad-bike') pulled out onto an outback highway in front of a road-train full of live cattle. Obvious who was in the wrong there, yes? Only the number of large mammalian fatalities different between the cases, really.

Ah, but the bus was in its own lane when it overtook the Google car. The Google car, going 2 MPH, made an unsafe lane change into the lane of a bus going 15 MPH.

I saw an episode of air crash investigation once (such a fun programme!) where the airbus had crashed because 1) the pilot had inadvertently overriden the auto pilot and then 2) had tried to save the plane himself rather than let the plane take over and save it instantly.

I meant that this is the case at the moment. Eventually, when fully autonomous systems are 'perfected' (i.e. brought to a standard that means they are significantly less accident-prone than humans) I expect no human oversight will be necessary, and we'll even have empty vehicles driving themselves around. Of course, over time they'll be continuously improved and they'll eventually be vastly better than humans. By 2050 we could have virtually zero casualties on the roads.

Thing is, I do things like navigational road-rallies and track days. Therefore I drive in what a Spock-like computer would deem to be an 'illogical' way in classic cars that will never be automated. Never killed anyone, never caused an accident, and the only time I got caught speeding it was because I wasn't slowing down at quite the rate required (46 in a 40 while decelerating in a very abrupt change from 60- to 40-zones, and I prefer to slow down by lifting the accelerator rather than abruptly stamping on the brakes). I take massive pride in my driving technique, and cover a huge mileage per year compared to the average 'casual' driver.

It is not absurd at all. Humans program computers, yes. But they program it according to the best driving principles. So, in theory, a computer controlled car can be at least as good as a very good driver.
