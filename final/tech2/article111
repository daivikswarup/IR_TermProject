Jesse Jackson tells Apple boss Tim Cook: ‘we applaud your leadership’




DateTime::::2016-02-26T20:45:43+0000



<p>Most investors might cringe at the idea of their firm going to war with the US government. </p>

<p>But these being Silicon Valley investors and this company being <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a>, those rules may not apply.</p>

<p>“It’s fantastic,” said Kamelia Cohen, a 26-year-old pre-med student who recently bought Apple shares. Chuck Savadelis, a 65-year-old photographer who has owned Apple stock for years, said, “I don’t think of it as an investor” but as a US citizen. “I admire the company,” said Lynda Gousha, a business consultant from San Jose.</p>

<p>Added the Rev Jesse Jackson, an Apple stock owner for 15 years: “Where we stand in controversy is a measure of our character.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-request-response">Apple accuses FBI of violating constitutional rights in iPhone battle</a> </p>

<p>Apple investors large and small, including Jackson, gathered on the morning of 26 February for the company’s annual shareholder meeting. Normally, the agenda at these types of gathering is pretty dry: sales in emerging markets, executive compensation and stock buybacks. </p>

<p>But this year is different. America’s largest company is 10 days into a public standoff with the US Justice Department over whether a court can force it to rewrite iPhone code to make it easier for the government to crack the passcode of San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/25/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-request-response">Apple’s lawyers argue</a> the federal court order violates the firm’s free speech rights and would set a precedent that allows the government to ask any tech firm to reengineer its products for any investigation. The government argues Apple is required to help the execution of US law if it is technically possible, which, Apple acknowledges, it is in this case. </p>

<p>During a chat with investors inside a black auditorium on Apple’s campus, chief executive Tim Cook, dressed in jeans and a denim shirt, tried to make light of the tensions while defending his position. </p>

<p>“We are a staunch advocate for our customers’ privacy and personal safety, and we’ve been in the news a bit about that,” Cook said to applause and laughter. “We do these [things] because these are the right things to do. Being hard doesn’t scare us.”</p>

<p>Nor does it scare investors, who instead raised questions about Apple’s enterprise sales, greenhouse gas emissions and how to use Apple Music.</p>

<p>“There may be some business implications, short-term hopefully,” said Gousha, the San Jose business consultant. “I’m a long-term investor.”</p>

<p>Karina Dundurs, 60 years old, of San Jose said: “Just because it’s a business doesn’t mean it doesn’t have an obligation to be ethical.”</p>

<p>Addressing Cook from the audience, Jackson, the famed civil rights leader, compared Apple’s current struggle to fights against McCarthyism in the 1950s or blowback against the Federal Bureau of Investigation for tapping Martin Luther King’s phone. </p>

<p>“We want to appeal to you in this critical hour to not grow weary of well doing,” Jackson said. “You are a man of integrity and character and we applaud your leadership.”</p>

<p>Of course, not all was hunky dory at Apple’s annual retreat. </p>

<p>Jackson also was on hand to push a shareholder resolution that would require the board to adopt an “accelerated recruitment policy” to increase diversity among senior management and board of directors. </p>

<p>Shareholders, with the recommendation of Apple’s board, voted that proposal down 94.9% to 5.1%, according to an early tally. Cook afterward said, “there’s much more work to do on diversity across the company. I can commit to you we are working very hard on it.”</p>

<p>One investor also asked about repeated reports that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/20/apple-hiring-spree-company-working-on-electric-car">Apple is working on an electric car</a> as it gobbles up staff from established automakers. Many view it as an expensive, if tantalizing, moonshot.</p>

<p>Cook compared the status of that project, which he has never publicly confirmed nor denied, to the day before Christmas when kids are looking at unopened gifts under the tree. </p>

<p>“It’s going to be Christmas Eve for a while,” Cook said. </p>

These narrow minded people who admire Apple, what if it were their children or a loved one who suffered at the hand of criminals, would they change sides. Must a bad person hit at the heart for one to realise what is the right thing to do? I sympathise for all the families who lost someone to this criminal knowing that the key to finding the culprits hides behind our desire for privacy, really?

Actually, yes, they are. If they have a specific warrant. They usually do not WANT to read them because it is hard to if a criminal in question is expecting a letter in a specific envelope on a specific day at a specific time to reseal that envelope so that they do not know that they are being monitored.

What gets people legitimately concerned over privacy over the data in a phone is that these days we're not talking about a clock, but a powerful computer. Law enforcement sometimes gets accused of fishing expeditions when they can look at everything on the phone which could now include health data, details of medicine taken, when someone ate, slept, dogged, plus private photos, location + date + time details and much much more.

The American Tax Office (whatever silly name it goes by escapes me at this 2:12am minute) should buy into this argument and have a look at the Apple exec's phones to check up on what conversations they have had about tax avoidance.Tim Cook - if you want to be admired for doing something PAY YOUR BLOODY TAXES.

I just wonder if a member of the Apple board had a family member kidnapped or child molested by a paedophile and it was believed there was evidence or information on a suspects phone, whether they would be quite so reticent to assist law enforcement?

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:In my opinion, Apple should obey a court order to open an IPhone owned by one of the recent San Bernardino terrorists or murderers, who is now deceased.The issue has prompted many articles which essentially glorify Apple Chariman Tim Cook as a guardian of the Constitution, or a champion of the privacy rights of people worldwide.I disagree with the thesis of all those articles.A good example of such articles is one by Steve Petrow, for USA Today. Mr. Petrow wrote the article below on Thursday, February 24, 2016:http://www.usatoday.com/…/got-hacked-my-mac-while…/80844720/The article is about Mr. Petrow's experience of writing and sending anti-government, pro-privacy comments or messages/draft articles on this issue, using a computer during a 'plane flight. Mr. Petrow used the airline's on-board or in-flight wireless internet service to send his anti-government, pro-Apple-privacy messages during the flight. At the end of the flight, another passenger on the flight, a stranger, stopped Mr. Petrow and introduced himself. This anonymous passenger told Mr. Petrow he had hacked into all of Mr. Petrow's in-flight wireless communications and those of other passengers. The hacker discussed his support for Apple's privacy arguments with Mr. Petrow. That is, the hacker stated he agreed with Apple's assertion that disclosing its passwords to the government for the San Bernardino investigation would easily allow worldwide hacking into Apple's customers' private accounts on an indiscriminate basis by anyone. Afterward, Mr. Petrow reflected upon the poignancy of the hacker's comments, approving them, and noting how they were vividly illustrated by the hacker's own act of in-flight hacking of his personal communications.Mr. Petrow's article is interesting not for its insight but for its stunning irony and Mr. Petrow's naiveté.The hacker, who spoke to Mr. Petrow after the flight, violated the law by obtaining unauthorized access to Mr. Petrow's communications, whether they were being transmitted or were in electronic storage, or in a stored state.He admitted he hacked into Mr. Petrow's communications or hacked into Mr. Petrow's stored information because he said so, to Mr. Petrow: "I hacked."Hacking is getting into something you are not supposed to get into. It is a slang word for electronic pilfering or electronic stealing.Hacking is electronic pick-pocketing.Intercepting electronic transmissions is a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. 2511.Obtaining access to stored electronic information is also a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. 2701.Please see:U.S. v. Szymuszkiewicz, 622 F.3d 701 (7th Cir. Wisconsin 2010)andShefts v. Petrakis, 2012 WL 4049484 (D.C., C.D., Ill. 2012)The irony in Mr. Petrow's failure to understand that he was the victim of a crime emphasizes the fallacy of his argument.He portrays the anonymous airline-passenger-hacker as an angel in disguise.He ignorantly overlooks the hacker's corrupt, evil nature and misinterprets it as virtue.He receives the hacker's words as wisdom when in fact they are mendacious.The hacker's message, and that of Mr. Petrow's article, is that we must resist any and all government access to private information even if it would save our lives.That is, we should be willing to die at the hands of a terrorist to protect that terrorist's right to privacy in his personal IPhone messages.The hacker has failed to recognize the horrible evil inconsistency in his position. Mr. Petrow has also failed to perceive that same self-evident inconsistency in his position, which is the same as the hacker's.I am not willing to die to further the aims of terrorists and murderers.We must not allow the novelty and intricacy of computers or the cachet of Steve Jobs and Tim Cook to cloud our understanding of the basic principles of good law enforcement essential to wholesome peace and safety.Sincerely yours,Caleb Boone.

At one time the FBI considered Martin Luther King a terrorist, and illegally tapped his phones and bugged his hotels in an effort to stop his "hateful message" of equality. These are the usurpations that the founding fathers fought against

But by the 1990s, Jackson was fully on board with the Clinton themes of private enterprise. And it shouldn't be surprising that his son fell victim to his father's own materialism, and ended up with a criminal conviction for it.

I feel a great deal of pity for Jackson, obviously a political man, being reduced to this. Because trying to wage political fights (in this case, fights to make society more progressive) through the shareholder meetings of a large private corporation is like trying to remove a tumour using a live ferret. The ferret might, in very rare occasions, successfully get at the tumour, but more often not and the whole thing is a bloody mess.

Let's sing the same old old song again. Damn it Americans you're lazy and want to stay with the same old thing.

At least Apple is telling the truth about the ultimate results and ramifications of what the FBI and U. S. Government request will mean for America unlike the FBI Director and the White House who have mostly been falsely characterizing (lying) about what it indeed will result in,.....which is setting a huge precedent and weakening everyone's security profile and breaking trust with normal updates given to us from Apple for our phones.
