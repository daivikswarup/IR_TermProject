Am I rootless, or am I free? ‘Third culture kids’ like me make it up as we go along




DateTime::::2016-03-09T13:26:16+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">“N</span></span>o, but where are you <em>really</em> from?” It is the question that automatically makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Like many <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/6545869/Third-culture-kids.html" title="">“third culture kids”</a> (TCKs), I panic, wondering whether the question refers to my nationality, where I was born, where I am living now, or where my parents live.</p>

<p>The term, coined by the American sociologist <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.tckworld.com/useem/home.html" title="">Ruth Hill Useem</a>, refers to a child who has spent a significant part of their formative years outside their parents’ culture. People who fit that bill have a tendency to mix and merge their birth culture with their adopted culture, creating one of their own: a third culture.</p>

<p>Depending on the person and situation, I’ll have different answers to that dreaded question. I’ll tell white lies and change my story as I go, like many other TCKs. Sometimes I’ll go for the quick answer: Finland and Senegal. Other times I’ll tell the whole story: that I was born in Helsinki, moved to Luxembourg, then to Brussels and finally to London. Or I might say that my mum is from Finland and dad from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/senegal">Senegal</a>, but that I really feel like my home is in the UK now.</p>

<p>Each time I get the question, I feel like I need to explain myself, prove my origins, and because of that I’ll often find myself omitting parts of my story in order to make my identity more palatable for others.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/19/mispronounce-name-for-americans-facebook">I always mispronounce my name for Americans. I'm reclaiming the original | Sadia Latifi</a> </p>

<p>Living like this can sometimes feel liberating: I feel as though I’m wearing different masks, and I am constantly able to reinvent myself. But this also presents a dilemma: who am I really? Which of these masks is the true me? Where do I belong? In my case, this is made even more complex as I’m biracial. Although I was born in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/finland" title="">Finland</a>, I’m aware that I don’t look typically Finnish – but seeing as I’ve never lived in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/senegal" title="">Senegal</a>, I feel strange saying I’m from there. Then again, I don’t feel very Finnish either, as I’ve lived abroad for most of my life. They’re both countries where I have family, and are places that I visit every few years – places I think of with nostalgia. But when I’m actually there, I feel out of place, like an outsider.</p>

<p>So where is home? Identity is attached to a sense of belonging, usually through family ties or deep emotional connections. Home suggests an emotional place – somewhere you truly belong, but I, like many other TCKs, never quite feel at home anywhere. It feels sometimes that I am in limbo. I am a strange mix of I-don’t-know-what, and sometimes I feel as if I’ll never find that one place where I belong 100%. I just feel blessed to have had the privilege of experiencing so many cultures.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Being rootless has given me a sense of freedom. I feel grateful for the experiences I’ve had</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder whether my life would be different if I had grown up in one place. I wonder what it would be like to have lived in a house where there were ruler marks beside a doorframe, documenting each of my childhood growth spurts; to have a friend who’s known me since nursery; not to feel like a tourist, wandering around with a map in a country that I’m supposed to embrace as my own.</p>

<p>Sometimes I resent the fact that I have to give complicated answers to seemingly simple questions. At other times it all seems rather trivial: as I watch my nieces and nephews growing up, and laying the basis of their identities among multiple cultures, I cannot help but feel proud. What an amazing opportunity, to speak multiple languages and see so many countries.</p>

<p>Being rootless has given me a sense of freedom. I feel grateful for the experiences I’ve had, and I am proud to feel, above all, like a citizen of the world. The possibilities for the future are endless. The sense of being at home anywhere, yet feeling that home is nowhere, is part of who I am.</p>

<p>I love being able to choose to be whoever I want, wherever I go. My many masks are a storyboard of all that I am. I’ve gradually built myself an identity that is a collection of pieces, each of which I’ve handpicked; choosing the best bits in order to create a whole. I’ve realised that those pieces are not mutually exclusive, but that they are all dependent on each other. Being rootless doesn’t mean I don’t belong to any one place; it means I choose to belong to many.</p>

Norman, Breton, English, possibly Irish for me, as far as I know. There may be some Spanish, courtesy of the Armada and its reckless naval tactics, from what I gather. That's about it.

I think you are rather missing the point. The author is not talking about just having parents from different countries. TCKs often grow up in multiple locations, with most or all of them not being countries/cultures to which they are ethnically tied. Imagine, if you can, someone who has, say, one Scottish parent and one Chinese one, who was born in the US and lived there until age 5 or so, then lived in the Philippines for three years, then moved on to Dubai until age 12, then completed secondary school in Germany and now is a university student in England. This young person has no single national identity - they may hold a US and/or UK passport, but they feel neither American nor British per se, despite the fact that one is where their life began and the other is where they now reside. So the answer to the question "Where are you from?" is complex and yes, probably more interesting than that of someone who has lived in one place all their lives. Their identity can be exactly as that sentence describes - a patchwork quilt of experiences pulled together.

Americans are the worst for that. I got stuck behind one at German passport control once who was telling the (very bored) immigration officer that he was really German, not American, because his great great grandfather had emigrated from Germany.

I do think though that if you are white you get asked the question "where are you REALLY from" a lot less often. I'm a third culture person (I guess, never really considered I needed a term before) but I appear British so only really get asked if I give my full (non-British) sounding name.

I'm from a mixed Celtic background, Irish and Welsh, and I can't trace back much because my paternal great- grandmother arrived in England single, pregnant and illiterate.I know very little about my roots, but I don't obsess about it.I'm an individual.People's roots and genes are no match for a good personality, so I don't choose friends on what their culture is or was, I choose because I like them.Identity politics just causes division, IMO.

Britain is so at ease with it's self as a mixed ethnicity country that it still imposes the identity of "Black" on Mixed Race people who are half black and half white. The day I see the media only refer to the likes of Louis Hamilton and Thandie Newton just as "Mixed Race" then I will say Britain is at ease with the mixed ethnicity of this country.

I read this with interest as someone who has never felt at home in my native country. Born of two English parents, moving around England during WW1 I didn't develop a loyalty to a place. As an adult I have lived in the US, Finland and the UK. But the place I feel closest to being 'at home' is Spain where something about the culture just feels right. There isn't always a match between where you are born and what suits you even in a monocultural family.

Identity politics has certainly incited us to agonise over what once would have seemed fairly trivial to most people, in the context of their daily lives.

Ndéla Faye is at the end of a long spectrum of people whose parents hail from different cultures. One of my parents is from Europe and that has distanced me from my local English culture. We celebrated Christmas and Easter a little differently. Our food was a little different and, more importantly, some British traditional things like tea and Marmite did not exist in our household. Small fry! Tiny fry - but significant.

Surely it really does not matter where you are from , how you define yourself, even how you live your life but what does matter is that you respect the society and the myriad of people in that society that you, or your parents, have chosen to live in. I suggest that questions regarding your background are far more likely to be an expression of friendly interest rather than anything sinister, and, given the equolence of the article, I'm sure you are well equipped to defend yourself should the need ever arise.

So if you were in the clarts in a desperate situation abroad, and your British passport was your only viable means of protection (Oh, I don't know, RN evacuating British nationals from a suddenly erupting war), would you use it to get on the boat or voluntarily stay behind with the artillery coming down singing: 'I'm a citizen of academia. I don't believe in nation states and flags'?

It comes from years of experience not little instances here and there that those from outside with a few snapshots may garner. I probably have a far more optimistic viewpoint on this topic compared to many other minorities in the country.Show me an ethnic minority in this country (and crucially those who visually look different... i.e. not Romany gypsy, not Irish etc), one born and raised in the UK as British but one who also feels that society as a whole accepts them as such and i'd be very surprised if you found any. I for one know many persons, friends, family, colleagues of such from all backgrounds and know of none who agree with this. Its a fact of life. People like myself just want to get on with life in general. We don't look for a step up nor preferential treatment and certainly don't get it.

I appreciate the writer's expression of personal freedom, it is refreshing. I am beginning to accept the term as a metaphor for freedom, by that I mean that an individual, like Ndela Faye, who has lived outside of their home country, is free to experience new cultures and also free from whatever limitations national identity present. I hope that I can conceptualise transformation and understand the connections between people and places in teaching and learning. This is also connected to the article: So Where is Home? https://vimeo.com/41264088

Diversity is an abstract about the material between, as here, cultures. One culture, for example, rates women as property, another does not. How do the two cultures do the diversity? -tolerate the intolerant? Should the police turn a blind eye top women being locked up in one 'culture' , turn a blind eye to the men regarding women of other cultures being of no worth than a dropped ice-cream, and thus rape them, or turn a blind eye to the killing of a daughter for not obeying a father, or the marriage of a child to an elderly man, need I go on? (all reported in the Guardian over the last few years). You cannot have 'multiple cultures in one country. these are the consequences of bringing them in and pretending you can. It ends in violence and the rise of the most violent. No country has survived bring in other cultures in such numbers as we have in the UK.

The reform of education means just this, a cohort who have no knowledge of their past, thus they can be lead anywhere as they are rootless. malleable, will take up the fad of the moment, This is the triumph of 'modern' education: the uneducated. Those who know nothing, believe anything. In some ways this triumph of ignorance is amazing, considering the education of their grandfathers and great grandfathers. The multicultural mantra, that all cultures are equal, none superior removes the ability to judge right from wrong, all is to be considered no better than anything else, A thousand years of English developed democracy and moral position eliminated at a stroke. The picture above shows how this was achieved.

Being asked where you come from is tiresome after you've been asked it a few hundred times, even if you've got nothing to hide. I appreciate that people are genuinely interested, but being asked the same thing time and again can get wearing.
