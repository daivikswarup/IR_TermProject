How new money has ruined Sesame Street

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he world changes at warp speed, but some things remain timeless: gourmet crisps never taste good, Sarah Palin is always absurd, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.pbs.org/parents/programs/sesame/">every week since 1969</a> Sesame Street has aired on PBS, the US public television channel that is as associated with the show as the BBC is with Blue Peter.</p>

<p>Now, in its 46th season, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/14/sesame-street-hbo-pros-cons">Sesame Street has been sold to HBO</a> and a lot of people are very unhappy. On the surface it would seem to be an insignificant move, worth commentary only on the media pages. But PBS is free and HBO is a premium channel, and even though nine months after first airing Sesame Street repeats will be available for all, this has left a bad taste – yet another example of the stratification of the culture, this time starting with three-year-olds.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/14/sesame-street-hbo-pros-cons">Sesame Street at HBO: do the pros outweigh the cons?</a> </p>

<p>Then there’s the show’s redesign. The new season has only just started, so outrage is a little premature, but on the basis of the first two episodes there is a growing sense that, in spite of HBO’s image as the gritty channel you can swear and be rude on, something unforgivable has been done to Sesame Street: it has been cleaned up.</p>

<p>Most of the evidence for this is in the opening credits. In its new format the show’s theme tune is a little brighter and the street scene a little ritzier than one remembers from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnUoYKCKU1w">earlier versions</a>. The charm of Sesame Street was always in its scruffiness and allegiance to the theory that kids like dirt – or rather, don’t dislike it the way adults do – and Sesame Street’s row of brownstones was clearly the pre-gentrified version.</p>

<p>Now, as the camera pans over Big Bird’s new-look neighbourhood, and in keeping with the times, those houses seem to have been remodelled by developers. It doesn’t look rich, per se, but it does look cute and bijou, like renditions of London that crop up in Hollywood films. There is a striped awning over a cafe, and bubbles and glitter float in the air. (Compare this with the 1970s version, when Joe Raposo’s famous theme song was accompanied by Toots Thielemans on the harmonica – a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1dU31XCJUI">flourish so melancholy and downbeat</a> it is hard to watch it now without weeping for one’s lost youth.)</p>

<p>There are other modernisations. Elmo is in a clean new apartment and Oscar the Grouch has moved from his dilapidated trash cans to a suite of recycling bins. In the second episode, Alan Cumming saves the day as a muckraking guest star, but I’m braced for future storylines in which Bert and Ernie dig out their basement and Grover puts in a wet room.</p>

<p>Over on Showtime, a new show called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/17/billions-showtimes-power-mad-wall-street-drama-is-worth-investing-in">Billions</a> just got going in which Damian Lewis plays hedge-fund manager Bobby “Axe” Axelrod, with Paul Giamatti as the US attorney eyeing Axelrod for insider trading. The obvious characterisation would have been to make Axelrod a villain, the embodiment of the world’s intolerance for financiers. Instead, he is a sympathetic version of an Alan Sugar type, a kid from the wrong side of the tracks made good. Perhaps his psychopathy will emerge, but for now the show has pulled off a very tough feat and made one root for the billionaire.</p>

<p>Television shows invoke real people at their peril, and as I was watching season two of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/10/us-tv-series-the-affair-dominic-west-ruth-wilson">The Affair</a> this week – another show with a load of Brits talking to each other in American accents – they really blew it. As Dominic West and his onscreen wife, played by Maura Tierney, prepare to divorce, she says of their mediator: “He’s very highly recommended. He did the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2661701/Extremely-quiet-incredibly-amicable-Literary-power-couple-Jonathan-Safran-Foer-Nicole-Krauss-SPLIT-following-secret-year-long-separation.html">Jonathan Safran Foer/Nicole Krauss</a> divorce, and now they live in adjacent brownstones.” The show’s fictional veil falls away and the whole thing is suddenly more fake than puppets on strings.</p>

While I agree with some of Emma Broke's opinions I don't believe she went far enough. It is okay for some things to die. Sesame Street has long been the best educational television show for children. Recently, someone saw the potential for profit and it was sold to HBO. I agree with the author's opinion that new money has ruined Sesame Street, but I think it is okay for some things to be just a memory. Watching them as reruns or YouTube videos wouldn't be a problem. It is actually better that they die than changing them for the worse, which would be making Sesame Street, for example, just about entertainment, and not education. Not everything needs to be sold to make money. Somethings are more important than money . . . like education.

The people producing shows for public broadcasting are often private entities operating for profit, whether it's This Old House or some other show. The local station carries The Lawrence Welk Show, which ran first in broadcast commercial television. Others started on UK television. Why does it matter what the first showing is on, or when, or where, or that the producer seeks to profit from it? The kids get to watch it for free on a broadcast public television network. Everybody wins.

My favorite thing about early Sesame Street was the way the short films and some of the animations had no obvious "point" that was being hammered home. Presented was simply an appreciation for the beauty of life, a combination of music and images that did not always feel the need to include some kind of testable "educational" content. Even a lot of the letter and number pieces were really about interesting combinations of sight and sound, including the astonishing counting cartoons with Grace Slick (if you didn't catch these to begin with, or haven't seen these on youtube --- you aren't doing anything more interesting right now I assure you!!) These cartoons have come to be tagged "Jazzy Spies", go, watch and listen. I crack up when I read commenters who say "I don't think these are really for kids." You're right, dumbass, kids should be dumbed down, you know, not exposed to cool stuff like this.

You evaded the substantive issue of privatization of a "brand" (if as with most things it must be thought of as a product) created almost entirely with public funds and donations by a non-profit entity using public broadcast organizations. The question of when kids will see the show is trivial. Privatization has always worked to enrich the people and organizations that already have more than their share of the pie. It's part of the notion that government is an unnecessary annoyance - preventing all the good folks of means from grabbing as much money as they can.The "false outrage" comment is simply stupid.

It is on the premium channel for nine months, and thereafter it will be available on the broadcast channel. There is likely not a single five year old who will know, or care, whether the show they are watching is on a paid channel or free channel, first run or re-run, new or twenty years old. The adults getting their undies in a bunch are the same people who get misty while an old Simon and Garfuncle album is playing, or settle down with beer and popcorn for a Gilligan's Island showathon. The term "false outrage" gets tossed about rather often in these sorts of circumstances, and the response often comes down to "think of the children!" It's the old class stratification by who gets first look game. My bet is if you actually asked the children, they wouldn't particularly care. These things only matter to those people normally expected to be the tolerant grow ups in the room. In the real world, the producers get enough resources to continue the show, and everybody ultimately gets to see both the old shoes and their modern counterparts.

It will be on PBS too. I don't see why it appearing 9 months after air on HBO is an issue. PBS is still showing plenty of educational kids shows in the meantime, and without HBO, Sesame Street was in danger of being demolished.

It is, at once, unbelievable and believable that Sesame Street has moved to a premium cable channel. Unbelievable because it is one of the few really innovative, child-centered pieces of TV production in the history of the US. Believable because the US is the home of the greed paradigm - it migrated there with the Puritans and scourged westward with the pioneers. The Brits are only in second place on the world greed index. This is just the capstone on the domination of American culture by those people controlling the wealth of the country. Everything is individual. The Austrian School is triumphant even without Ron Paul being elected President. There is no room in public discourse for the "common good" in the US. Everything will work out if only the rich can get richer. Hook, line and sinker Americans have bought the shaky, utterly-unprovable notion that money trickles down. The US is now the classic example of an upper class, hegemonic phenomenon undoing any notion of self-interest among working people. The theme song of Sesame Street will now only be licensed to be played in auditoriums charging $100 per seat or more. ASCAP will be vigilant to insure that it is not sung in American school classrooms without paying royalties because, after all, Sesame Street moved to HBO because it hadn't sufficient revenues on the public broadcasting system.

There are two main complaints here: 1. The programme has been cleaned up; 2. It is no longer free of charge in the US (I don't know if is still shown elsewhere, I'm out of touch).

In 1971 I worked in a TV shop in Cardiff and watched every day. We had just had colour TVs in and it was on to show-off the colours. I loved it and later my kids did too.

That's right all those kids in families too poor to subscribe to TV channels can just wait or watch old episodes if they can afford a computer and access to the internet.It isn't the end of the world but it is a shame.

I doubt that'll be much of an inconvenience. As the article points out, free repeats of the newest ones will eventually be available. And anyway there's vast amounts of free Sesame Street on YouTube.

The gentrification of Sesame Street?! Surely the inner-city setting, and appealing to Black and Hispanic children, was the whole bloody point. Another brick in the wall separating 'them' and 'us'.

Sesame Street first aired in the UK on 22 March 1971 (HTV - Welsh independent television) and on Granada (where I first saw it) on 8 July 1972. However it wasn't seen nationally until 1982, so it depends where you lived.



Author::::Erny .Roamer

No because it has moved from a free channel to a pay to view channel.

I see, the children won't watch it any more because brighter theme tunes and ritzier streets are against their politics.

I keep thinking of Chris Rock in 'Jay and Silent Bob STriek Back' when he spoke of being the originator of Sesame Street calling it 'NWP' which was a great gag on how culturally important it was to the groups who watched it. NBC is taking that away.

Why are you writing about this as if it is really part of British culture ? I am a Canadian and watched Sesame St in 1970. Came to live here in 1975 and no one had heard of it. A shortened version - not the hour long show- appeared over here sometime n the mid to late 1980s but it was nothing like the original.
