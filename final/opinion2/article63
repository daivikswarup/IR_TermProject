'It's death by bacon for me' – our readers on listening to health warnings




DateTime::::2016-02-03T15:30:01+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hat do you do after work – head home, hit the gym, have a glass of red? If your evening involves the latter you won’t welcome chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies’ warnings that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/03/drinkers-risks-alcohol-related-deaths-rocket">we should consider the risks of cancer before having a glass of wine</a>.</p>

<p>But it’s not the first time we’ve been given advice on our drinking habits, although <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/wine-good-you">it always seems to vary</a>, and alcohol isn’t the only area that comes with health warnings; we’ve recently been given tips on everything from our red meat consumption – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/26/bacon-ham-sausages-processed-meats-cancer-risk-smoking-says-who">apparently bacon is a no-no</a> – to our exercise habits (hint: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/10/06/new-study-for-optimal-heart-health-americans-should-double-or-even-quadruple-the-amount-of-exercising-theyre-doing/">30 minutes of fitness a day is no longer enough</a>).</p>

<p>So what do you make of all this health advice? We asked our readers to tell us whether they follow it, or whether they have found their own recipe for better living:</p>

<p>I am a trained nurse, though now retired, and I specialised in heart disease. My late husband was a doctor (and my daughter and son-in-law now are too) so I do have access to professional journals but I don’t listen to them for health advice – instead I use common sense.</p>

<p>There are no clear rules to living longer. I lost my husband three years ago to cancer and he was almost a teetotaller; very rarely would he have a glass of wine with our meal. He was slim and active and we ate very healthily, but he died two years after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. I also know two others who didn’t drink, and have cancer. Another friend of mine is in her late 90s, drinks gin every day and is still going strong. These days the health advice is so conflicting. We are told red wine in moderation can ward off dementia and heart disease as it contains flavonoids, and the chief medical officer says all alcohol is deadly. So what are we mortals to make of it? I have always believed in everything in moderation and I am fit and healthy, and happily getting old. </p>

<p>– Sabina Ahmed, a retired nurse</p>

<p>Clinical medicine is an extraordinary thing. It has helped us live longer, healthier lives than ever before. It has ensured those of us in the west can confront what were once deadly biological crises with confidence. Who would willingly ignore advice from its practitioners? Not me. I make sure to get regular gentle exercise. I’ve given up meat.</p>

<p>Yet for all the wisdom of announcements such as considering cancer with every glass of wine, there is a problem with clarity and nuance. It wasn’t so long ago we were advised that wine in moderation could be good for you. Even now, it is my understanding that the risks associated with the occasional drink, under the new 14 units a week limit, are tiny. </p>

<p>Viewed through that lens, such comments appear confusing, needlessly alarmist and more about nannying than affirming life.</p>

<p>Most of us want to do the right thing. We’ll heed health advice from professionals when it is consistent and makes sense. Distilling the vast and sometimes conflicting data of modern medicine into media soundbites is a near impossible task. Yet if they want to be heard, doctors need to do it better and with greater understanding of human nature.</p>

<p>– Matt Thrower, a writer and former clinical scientist <br/></p>

<p>I tend to go beyond most of the health advice I hear: I eat a plant-based diet, I exercise, do yoga, meditate and sit for no longer than 90 minutes a day. I live free from alcohol and don’t smoke either. I don’t drink sugary drinks and have eliminated as much sugar as possible from my diet.</p>

<p>Obviously, these choices are not always easy to maintain, especially since I travel so much and because some of the norms of expected behaviour are so strong still – for example, there are rarely vegan options on the menu in restaurants and sugar seems to be in everything.</p>

<p>I try to be up-to-date with the latest research and scientific studies. I work for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://iogt.org/">IOGT International</a>, a network for preventing and reducing the harm caused by alcohol, so I deal with so-called chronic or lifestyle diseases and so I see a lot of research about healthy diet, alcohol harm, tobacco industry tactics quite easily.</p>

<p>I definitely feel much better living free from alcohol, cutting down on sugar and not eating meat. I can talk and write about this topic for hours, but in short I sleep better, have better self-esteem and feel more in harmony knowing that my choices not only benefit me personally but are also good for the planet.</p>

<p>– Maik Dünnbier, director of strategy and advocacy at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://iogt.org/">IOGT International</a></p>

<p>There is no pleasure quite like the aroma of sizzling pig bits lobbed with Nigella-esque carelessness into a hot pan. Even our veggie-loving comrades struggle to resist the olfactory siren call of trans-fats, lashings of MSG, and a healthy glug of 10% added water for extra weight.</p>

<p>Of course, as with any little joy that makes life remotely worth living, the things we tend to love often have the unfortunate effect of slowly murdering with every delicious mouthful we cram into our mouths with the gusto of a Dickensian orphan. That once-great panacea for every conceivable heart complaint that was a glass of red wine has been soundly debunked as an “old wives’ tail”, while processed meat products – probably never that good for us in the first place – now sit comfortably alongside the decidedly less appetising finger buffet of asbestos, plutonium and other group 1 carcinogens.</p>

<p>But you can’t serve those on a brioche bun so it’s death by bacon for me, thanks.</p>

Surely the point is not to believe everything on TV and in the media , they used to call it common sense aided by education, as u said most parties have vested interests Ie , to sell u something , if it's of interest to u and ur lifestyle do a bit more digging and if u find something is harmful to u stop eating eat it but don't ignore it that wud b stupid!!

Unfortunately, I was one of those who followed the advice of the health advocates championing the advantages of low fat spreads. As a result I spent twenty odd years from the mid 80s depriving myself of the superior taste and nutritional benefits of butter until reports of the superiority of dairy products started to appear. However, what I felt really vindicated my switch back to tasty butter was when on some TV documentary it was found that when some butter and margarine was spread on some surface and exposed to flies, they did not land on the margarine ! If its not good enough for flies then its a no brainer as far as Im concerned.

We are at the mercy of modern witch doctors who point the bone and tell us that we are going to die for so many reasons that some of us simply do as we're told, and dutifully die. But is is all just nonsense. Of course, if we eat or drink or smoke to excess, we are likely to damage our bodies and may die, but some won't, and you have to question why not, while others who take care of themselves fall ill and die long before their time. The way to deal with this is simple; do as you wish with all that you want, but in moderation. The rest is down to your genes, and there is nothing much you can do to change that....

I am the sole survivor of a family of four. My mother was 59 when she died of cancer; my father was 62 when he died three days after mum from an aortic aneurysm; my younger brother died in October, aged 57. I am 62 and plan to enjoy life and live it to the fullest. That includes an occasional bacon butty and drinking wine.

The only reason to be healthy is to avoid pain or the loss of bodily functions. But if you're following government advice on nutrition but there are other factors causing you to be miserable, bored, jaded or resentful - a bowl of vitamin rich kale won't add to the quality of your life.

What grieves me most severely about 'chief medic advice' or the state telling us 'do not do this' is the inherent quixotic falsehood that the state 'knows best'. We are treated like children, as regards our private lusts, fetishes and habits - blamed and condemned for smoking, drinking, fornicating; yet every four years, as adults in a 'democracy' of sorts, we are allowed to dabble at the ballot box. We can't be trusted not to eat bacon, but when it comes to electing a government which has direct access to X billions and nuclear weaponry, we are trusted absolutely - 'almost'. MP's with one hand, defraud their expenses, employ spouses and children on 30k a year in a 'part time secretarial' role; then condemn us for drinking two glasses of wine a week! We give them a mandate to govern in the nations interest both domestic and foreign, nobody said 'now please lecture us, endlessly from your pious pulpit of moral authority'. Europe really has become a despairing place; somehow Liberal Lunatics have assumed command of our moral, ethnic, religious, dietary destines, without permission to do so. The notion 'we know best' is offensive to me - because they literally do not; so from a contradictory report on 'lifestyle choices' to the gargantuan balls up that is the 'immigration fiasco' the Liberal Lunatics have not only taken over the asylum they are also burning it to the ground. Yet, voters appear enamoured with this ritual of abasement; what is wrong with people, to vote so persistently for idiocy?

No, I don't expect you to respond to a question I didn't ask. That would require imaginative powers that are given to very few among us. On the other hand, my comment did offer you, indirectly it's true, the opportunity to explain why you have no difficulty eating decaying fruit and vegetables, while decaying pork nauseates you. You've twice avoided explaining how you resolve this paradox so I suppose you can't. Fair enough...

There is an easy way of telling what is, and is not, good for you. If it tastes even slightly pleasant, never mind delicious, it's Bad For You and you should avoid it. It if tastes horrible, it's Good For You. This rule has the added advantage that eating only horrible tasting foods won't be enjoyable, so you will eat as little as possible and avoid obesity - achieving the desired lean and hungry look instead.

Use common sense. I am tired of all this so-called "advice" which in all probability will be contradicted in a couple of months. The difference probably lies between those who enjoy a good meal, with glass of wine for instance, and those who eat without any interest or enjoyment.

I'm bringing it up because you wrote that you find the smell of "rotting pig's flesh" being fried, nauseating. I wondered why you don't find it equally nauseating to eat rotting fruit and vegetables. Seems a reasonable enough question but feel free to avoid answering it.

I was in Tehran in 1977 ,in the days of the Shah, where possession of hash or any other illegal substance would earn you a lengthy prison sentence. Imagine my surprise at discovering that if you reached retirement age 65 ( I think) you could then buy government opium to smoke from the pharmacy.I thought it was a good idea then and still do today. Incidently I don't take any drugs illegal or legal if I can help it. Then again I am 63 and beginning to feel my age and would like the option of smoothing out my twilight years with a few nightly pipes of opium if I choose to.

"You've got to laugh at old Corbyn...". Why? It could just be that he doesn't like smoking (he is far from alone in that respect), prefers not to eat meat (ditto) and can live without booze. Cycling around London "a poor lifestyle choice". Why? Are you suggesting that driving around London is a good one? I would suggest, based on a lifetime of doing just that, that cycling everywhere is one of the best lifestyle choices one can make

Those who die before 70 that drank, smoked and were couch potatoes proves this is a poor lifestyle choice.Those who live beyond 70 but have that same lifestyle proves that it isn't a bad lifestyle choice.Go figure.
