Would you buy a used housing estate from David Cameron?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>ne of the things you’re warned to expect as you get older is the feeling that you’ve seen it all before. I certainly had a distinct sensation of deja vu when I read that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/09/david-cameron-vows-to-blitz-poverty-by-demolishing-uks-worst-sink-estates" title="">David Cameron is committed to demolishing or refurbishing “sink” estates</a>, those well-known lairs of rioters, gangstas and other criminals. Many of us who grew up on inner-city council estates and spent our childhoods visiting relatives on some of the most notorious examples of the genre will be thinking – this again? It sometimes seems that almost before the architects and builders had finished constructing these estates, they were back again, fixing their original mistakes. Walkways came down or were lit up, playgrounds built, gardens planted, security doors and entry phones installed. Some of the worst high-rise estates were demolished pretty much before they’d got their own postcodes. After <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/16/newsid_2514000/2514277.stm" title="">the Ronan Point gas explosion in 1968</a>, some tower block residents were left more worried about lighting matches in their kitchens than criminals loitering in stairwells.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">While many of these estates were improved, the social and economic environment of residents went into steady decline</p>

<p>But while many of these estates were improved or brought down, the social and economic environment of many residents went into steady decline. I left school in the eighties, went to university, into the professions, bought a home and ended up writing and doing media work. It’s a common subject for discussion among people of my age who did similar things from similar backgrounds – could we do it today? Many doubt it.</p>

<p>And there’s a grim irony to Cameron’s announcement. Many of the estates he wants to knock down were built as a previous generation’s answer to slums and tenements. Older readers might find my own suggestion on the subject gives them a distinct sense of deja vu, but is it possible that Dave, as he dons his hard hat and heads for the bulldozer, might factor in some of the other issues that blight lives on these estates? Could he offer practical solutions on social mobility, skills, access, opportunities and, above all, offer hope, instead of the usual waffle? That really would make for a happy new year.</p>

<p>There’s a fascinating exhibition on display at the Museum of London called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/london-wall/whats-on/exhibitions-displays/the-crime-museum-uncovered/" title="">The Crime Museum Uncovered</a>. The exhibits range from a pistol used in an attempted assassination of Queen Victoria to executioner <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Marwood" title="">William Marwood</a>’s business card (no Twitter account, unfortunately). But the most interesting feature is that, rather than playing into the popular notion that crime is a “sink estate” phenomenon, it’s a useful reminder that law breaking goes on at all levels of British society. The American police and court system is under increasing scrutiny, not least thanks to the massively popular documentary <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/jan/07/making-a-murderer-the-netflix-documentary-beating-tv-drama-at-its-own-game" title="">Making a Murderer</a>, with its plausible claims that justice has been botched, but the US is ahead of the game in one respect. The fact that a suspect wears a suit and tie and works in a plush office is not necessarily regarded by the American cops as a persuasive alibi for crimes in high finance.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>If the first week of January is for counting calories, the second week is for the postmortem into what went wrong. But this year, nature has handed me a helpful card. In 2015 I finally discovered that my various aches and pains were due to a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/25/gluten-free-diet-life-saving-fad" title="">gluten allergy</a>. At first I wasn’t that bothered as I’ve never seen gluten for sale in the shops nor have I ever sprinkled any on my chips. It’s only subsequently that I’ve discovered that gluten is an ingredient in nearly everything. We’re told that fat shaming is wrong and doesn’t work either. But the prospect of having to pay for tucking into my favourite foods with painkillers is having a Pavlovian effect on my eating. There’s only one problem with my new wonder diet. My preferred alcoholic spirits don’t contain gluten; they’re also effective painkillers. I’ll see over the next few weeks how this works out.</p>

It would've helped if lazy journos in the '70s and '80s, who'd never actually lived in a tower block, hadn't persistently peddled the urban myth that the proles are forever pissing in their lifts.

I was surprised at how on a freelance income of £60K per year how I was having difficulty saving a deposit to keep up with price rises in 2000. So I bought with a reduced deposit in 2001, and was predicting a bust then because it was simply an impossible situation.

You do realize by "improvement" he means sell the land off to luxury devlelopers and evict the tenants a few hundred miles away where they cannot be seen or heard.

That is what he is proposing to do. Do you SERIOUSLY believe it will affect your taxes? Just more of the endless opportunities to make the rich richer. He will have to build a new prison, of course, private no doubt - so there is another jammy contract up for grabs.

Replace sink estate multisotery flats by 3 storey terraced houses with own front door , little green in front for kids to play in sight and roof garden One of depressing thing about London is the abysmally low visual standard of design of new buildings ( try the depressing view from Tower of London towards S Bank and shoot the archicitects ) and the failure to make London a garden city by requiring all buildings to utilise roofs for gardens or resident community purposes .... istead of wasted space rain collection.

They are at least trying to improve the worst housing areas, where people are trapped in poverty. I can't recall Labour in all their 13 years coming up with a similar scheme. A cynic might think they were happy for people to stay poor and dependent on welfare, calculating that it would mean they continued to vote Labour.

No, no, johnny2bad's point was that ex-local authority homes are highly sought after, unaltered. Loads of people live in ex-LA properties and they don't degenerate into social dysfunction, just as most council tenants are not dysfunctional. I recognise the architecture isn't the same in all cases, but it's not far off in many. And some of the high rises aimed at the rich are awful, soulless places as well.

When our plane broke down at Varadero in Cuba, we had to spend the night in a hotel described by Rough Guide as a "Stalinist edifice, more in need of demolition than renovation." That's the way I feel about the soul-destroying tower blocks into which arrogant middle-class town planners herded their working-class "inferiors" in the '50s and '60s. To do so they continued the Luftwaffe's work, demolishing perfectly good terraced houses, which they sneeringly dismissed as slums, and with them the sense of pride and community they'd engendered.

Cameron's announcement may be dismissed as politicking and perhaps even a pretext for social cleansing. There are more serious approaches to the problems of sink estates that could be explored. One is the benefits associated with proximity to green spaces that have been studied extensively. These include reduction of long-term noise annoyances and stress-related psychosocial symptoms, reduced mortality from circulatory diseases and increased survival rates of urban senior citizens. The main beneficiaries appeared to be the elderly, the youth, and secondary educated people, partly related to outdoor activities and healthy modes of travel. Stress relief from even short-term visits to nature has been objectively demonstrated with reduced salivary cortisol and mere exposure to views of nature improved health and well-being by providing restoration from stress and mental fatigue or improved feelings of neighbourhood safety and has also been associated with decreases in aggression and crime rates.

DateTime::::2016-01-12T13:04:20Z
No it does not work. I am lucky enough to have worked in a "Neighbourhood Renewal Scheme " in the 90's and the causes of sink estates are mainly about the people living there, not the bricks and mortar. These causes are deep rooted and will not be eradicated by planting a few trees and painting the walls. So this is just a scam to free up social housing for speculators. the residents would be turfed out!

You may be right, although I was brought up in a 10-storey, 30-flat block with no disturbance whatsoever, until some herbert decided to throw himself from the 10th floor, whereupon the Council became anxious and fitted glass to the previously open frontages. Fortunately he didn't hit anyone before the ground broke his fall.
