A war of the generations is not a solution – hope is

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">H</span></span>ere’s a nightmare for those of us who want a more just and equal society. The right, in Britain and the rest of Europe, finds a strategy for eternal political dominance: in an ageing society, it simply nurtures the support of the older generation, securing the votes of an expanding, highly politically engaged demographic. The young, it abandons. Far less likely to vote, they can be condemned to a future of job and housing insecurity, debt and falling living standards, with few political consequences.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/young-single-people-bear-the-brunt-of-generation-ys-economic-woes">Young single people bear the brunt of Generation Y's economic woes</a> </p>

<p>That is not a dystopian future. This is the political present being constructed, at least in Britain. In every general election since 1997, the number of older people voting Conservative has increased; since 2001 more have plumped for the Tories than for Labour. Young voters <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/101/How-Britain-Voted-Since-October-1974.aspx?view=wide" title="">decisively backed Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives in 1983</a>. By contrast, when Labour last secured a crushing victory among voters under 25, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide" title="">57% still didn’t turn out to vote</a>.</p>

<p>The Guardian’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/revealed-30-year-economic-betrayal-dragging-down-generation-y-income" title="">study of the plight of millennials</a> paints a bleak picture across much of the western world: of younger Europeans’ and Americans’ living standards struggling to keep up with those of older citizens. In Britain, young people face a battery of attacks on their wellbeing: a lack of affordable housing and secure, well-paid jobs, the decimation of youth services, soaring university debt, a discriminatory minimum wage, cuts to social security, and so on. So much pain, so little political engagement. How can it be reversed?</p>

<p>First, a war of the generations is not a solution. I occasionally see millennials on social media cursing the alleged selfishness of their grandparents’ generation. This may be cathartic for some, but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/war-generations-destroy-left" title="">it is political poison</a>. Generations are not homogeneous, for a start, and cross-generational alliances have to be built. In an ageing society, if the left does not win a substantial proportion of the older vote, it will never rule again. If young are decisively pitted against old – in a society already riven with divide-and-rule conflict, from private- and public-sector workers to the low-paid and unemployed – then it will be the left that loses.</p>

<p>Low turnout among young people is not inevitable. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fsK4H9lh-sgC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=1983+turnout+18-24&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib9bWH_bDLAhVFOhoKHa08DpEQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1983%20turnout%2018-24&amp;f=false" title="">Over 73% of 18- to 25-year-olds voted in 1983 </a>; it was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide" title="">a derisory 43% last year</a>. Different explanations will be offered for this trend; here are mine.</p>

<p>Ever since the late 1970s, the dominant philosophy has been one of rugged, unabashed individualism. The obstacles we face in life are no longer collective injustices that need collective solutions; we as individuals need to deal with them ourselves, or so the mantra goes. We are supposed to get on life through our own individual effort; if we succeed, that is testament to our own abilities, if we “fail”, that is our fault. The role of government is minimised.</p>

<p>Second, what the state can do seems rather limited. The government has gleefully surrendered much of its own power to the market. As it is, politics seems abstract to a lot of young people, divorced from their everyday lives and experiences. Apathy: that’s the word often bandied around to describe their attitude, as though they simply don’t care. But young people do care: they have aspirations and hopes, insecurities and fears. They just don’t make a link between formal politics and these dreams and worries; it often doesn’t seem relevant.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Organising in the community, on issues relevant to younger voters’ lives, is critical</p>

<p>And then there’s the low esteem in which politicians themselves are held. A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1049666/vast-majority-people-distrust-politicians" title="">study a few years ago found that 81% of 18-year-olds</a> had a negative view of political parties and politicians, while 66% of them felt government wasn’t honest or trustworthy. It is unlikely to have improved since. The bad behaviour of politicians – such as the expenses scandal – doesn’t encourage a righteous anger to clean politics up. Instead it encourages people to write off all politicians, and politics as a vehicle for meaningful change.</p>

<p>And so here is the tragedy: many young people understand that they face a difficult future, but are utterly resigned to it. If there is hope, many are left to believe, it is up to them alone, as individuals. That isn’t the case with all young people, of course. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/03/why-ill-never-regret-my-bernie-tattoo" title="">Bernie Sanders</a> may not win the Democratic presidential nomination, but his political phenomenon has been driven by the determination of alienated younger voters. Over half of the young people who voted in Britain last year opted for either Labour or the Green party. And then there’s Spain, where the relatively new progressive Podemos party <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/jfalbertos/status/695216074862825473" title="">disproportionately takes its support from younger voters</a>.</p>

<p>Note, though, that it’s not only the left gaining from the frustrations of the young. Over a third of French voters under 34 opted for the far-right Front National in local elections last year. Similarly, many Danish, Dutch and Polish young voters <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dw.com/en/young-people-vote-far-right-in-europe/a-18917193" title="">are opting for hard-right parties too</a>.</p>

<p>If the left is to succeed, it has to do two things, neither of them easy: inspire more young people to believe in collective action as a means to change their own lives; and reverse the shift to the right among the growing grey vote. Spain shows how mobilising younger people is possible. Podemos owes its success to a range of community-based movements, beginning with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/21/spanish-election-mandate-indignados" title=""><em>indignados</em></a> in 2011, when disproportionately younger voters <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/what-i-learned-from-podemos-bdb7245d2cbf#.px42ddbb9" title="">filled central city squares</a>.</p>

<p>Organising in the community on issues relevant to younger voters’ lives, such as housing or youth services, is critical. That doesn’t simply mean protests and rallies, which tend to attract the already politically engaged. It means going to where young people are. Why aren’t trade unions and labour parties setting up youth community centres, for example?</p>

<p>It means having a sense of fun too: at Podemos rallies the song blaring as their leaders march on stage isn’t The Red Flag or The Internationale, but the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4aNuj9t5Y0" title="">Ghostbusters theme</a>. Why not mix comedy, music and sports with community organising? It certainly means abandoning rhetoric and jargon that are familiar to leftwing activists but which utterly alienate most younger people.</p>

<p>Younger people should expect a better lot in life than their parents. The tragedy is not simply that much of the next generation are robbed of this optimism: it is that they are resigned to being so. But what is the left other than a rejection of the idea that injustice is inevitable, and a belief that it can be overcome with collective determination? Unless the left succeeds, the next generation will be written off – and it is society as a whole that will suffer.</p>

My own family's experience goes some way to explain this. My great great grandfather was your farmer, except in a different business. During the war he took advantage of the Government's need to build a sizeable business empire. Sure enough he passed it down to children. That generation, my grandfather's, carried on reasonably altruistically expanding the business a little, diversifying and employing more people. Things started to go wrong in my father's generation. By this time the shareholding was split among four sons. One was a lazy greedy idiot. One was a determinedly independent professional. The other two we semi-competent businessmen with large families. The empire was basically divided into four and frittered away with more or less morality, depending on the morals of each son. I was a lucky child, I got a very good education at a well known girls public school, thanks to my great great grandfather's efforts mainly, and the fact that my Dad was a decent guy.

2. So without the profit motive will farmers or employers even exist? I draw on my own first hand experience here of starting three small businesses, the first two of which failed and left me bankrupt and temporarily homeless. It's arguable that my hubby and I may have started the first one, being young energetic and naive without the prospect of rich rewards, but no way would we have tried again after the heartache and stress of the first failure.  I always smile when I see people (the vast majority) glibly referring to people starting their own business (the way you talk about the farmer for instance in your example). Unless you have tried yourself to borrow money, take on employees, persuade people to buy your product, deal with all the admin, the tax, the supply chain, and all the other myriad responsibilities – you are in no position to comment really. In my life I have been a business owner and employee, and there is a reason why most people end up as employees, and it has little to do with lack of money or luck, and a lot to do with the huge stresses that owning your own business places on you – just worrying about my staff and my next tax bill used to keep me awake night after night. And the hours that an average start up business owner has to work make junior doctors look like they are on permanent holiday.

Of course. My comment was really intended to show that there are other kinds of collectivism at work in the world apart from the State's initiatives. However, family 'sharing' is unfortunately invisible in the recorded data (indeed, we are not supposed to gift our families more than a certain sum). I think this makes us look far more individualistic than many of us are. The generational gripes often fall away when you examine the concrete realities of people's lives.

Ratedrichy you have got it wrong. Free Trade with countries that do not have similar human rights, rule of law, environmental protection, democracy and worker rights is a receipt for one sided disaster and it has failed to curb corruption, increase human rights / rule of law or workers rights, promote democracy and has indeed led to increased inequality (rise of the plutcrats and oligarchs), falling wages, a race to the bottom, the despoliation of the environment. It is this Labour and parties of the left want to stop and avoid. Free Trade Agreements can be beneficial and have their place but only with countries that have taken their place in the world as responsible rule of law, right abiding democracies. They should also be debated and negotiated in public or do you know something about TTIP that nobody else does? The fact they are negotiated in private, presented as a fait accomplit and promulgated into law without the input or consultation of the public (and mostly adopted script handed down from special interest groups' lawyers) says a lot about why the left is in favour of "free trade" but not in it scurrent form.

Corbyn's leadership campaign and the subsequent shift to the Left in the Labour Party is largely predicated on the massive surge in new members, most notably amongst the young. The policies most obviously associated with Corbyn - Peace, housing, student grants, equality - resonate much more fully with the young.

My husband, from a poor Irish working-class family, put himself through University (no grants) by working and with the assistance of his parents, who prioritised saving for their family needs. We did not expect to own a house, but managed to do so when we were in our 30s, which was also when we could afford to have children. Throughout our lives we have saved to be able to assist our children and grandchildren with housing/education etc. Money has always circulated freely within the family — distributed according to need, regardless of generational considerations. Both myself and my daughter were able to stay at home to look after our children because the men in the family did not consider themselves as 'individuals' but as part of a family unit whose concerted efforts benefited all. The State has inserted itself in our lives more and more since the 70s and has made it much more difficult to run our lives in this way, but I still believe this 'family' modus vivendi is a tried and tested way to achieve contentment and meaning in life. We try to depend on the State for as little as possible. We may need its assistance in periods of great hardship but, in the last analysis, it can never be anything but a 'mechanism' of survival.

Good post, and thank-you. Like you, I started with nothing, much extreme hardship and much effort and going without and frugality - last year's school uniform at age 13, is just one example. Only now can I consider myself 'comfortable and secure, both relative terms since I am still quite frugal. So I deserve the comfort and security I have now. Non-the-less, I consider it fortunate that all my efforts actually eventually paid off; because I know of many circumstances where all the effort in the world has not resulted in such good(ish) fortune. I myself went through a period where every effort I could possibly make still did not reap any reward, any benefit, any improvement. Nothing I tried, nowhere I looked, nothing improved matters, not because I was undeserving, not because I was lazy or profligate, certainly not because I was ignorant, just bad luck. So when I say "lucky" it is with this in mind - lucky that the effort paid off eventually.

That's another good point. The worst thing is that the younger generation only knows this side of Labour - especially the majority less clued up on politics. John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron have been the PM's of my lifetime... it's not hard to see why people of the generation are somewhat disillusioned by politics altogether. We've only been old enough to vote in an election or two, Labour don't offer a worthwhile alternative and the Tories can get in with little more than a fifth of the electorate. I'm not surprised just insisting that you 'need to vote' isn't cutting it any more.

You have to be careful about conflating different data sources. I make it closer to a 16% increase, using the ONS's data.

Yes because the one statistic you have avoided is house price inflation. House price average 172k in March 2010 according to the independent now 288k according to the Guardian. So up 116k in five years. or close on 45%. hell of a lot more than wages.
