<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">B</span></span>abylon is back <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4908940.stm">in the news</a> as a US military spokesman said that he would be willing to apologise for the military occupation of this ancient heritage site. When asked if he would offer an apology to the director of antiquities in Iraq, Col John Coleman said: "If it makes him feel good." But he insisted that anything the military had done at Babylon was carried out in close consultation with the Iraqi state board of antiquities and heritage (SBAH). He explained that, before setting up camp, the US command had "made an analysis" and had come to the conclusion that it would be best for the site, because it would protect it from looters. This excuse of "protection" is now being invoked in various contexts across occupied Iraq. In fact, the damage done to Babylon by coalition forces is both extensive and irreparable, and even if US forces had wanted to protect this ancient city, placing guards around the site would have been far more sensible than bulldozing it and setting up the largest coalition military headquarters in the region.</p>

<p>The idea that the military occupation of Babylon was for its own protection simply beggars belief. The US did nothing to guard any heritage site, museum or monument in the country in April of 2003. While the first air strikes of Operation Iraqi Freedom left historical monuments undamaged, the US led occupation has resulted in a tremendous destruction of history well beyond the museums and libraries looted and destroyed at the fall of Baghdad. Babylon is the most famous ancient site occupied as a military base, but it is certainly not the only one. At least seven or eight heritage sites have been used in this way by US and coalition forces since April 2003, one of them being the historical heart of Samarra, where the Askari shrine built by Nasr al Din Shah was recently bombed.</p>

<p>The use of heritage sites as military bases is a breach of the 1954 Hague convention and protocol, chapter one, article five of which covers periods of occupation. The United States has not ratified the convention, but a number of the coalition countries (Italy, Poland, Australia) and Iraq are contracting parties. Since "sovereignty" was returned to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</a> on July 1 2004, the United States has been in the country at the invitation of the interim Iraqi government, and may be subject to the Hague convention as well as to the Iraqi antiquities and heritage law, which forbids any construction or use of a heritage site without prior permission of the SBAH. But at several heritage sites across the country, the US and coalition forces disregarded Iraqi antiquities and heritage laws, and the pleas of both the SBAH and international archaeologists and historians.</p>

<p>It is not only that museums and libraries were plundered after they were left unguarded in April 2003, and that hundreds of ancient sites are now pitted and destroyed by looters, although that damage is certainly extensive. The occupation of heritage sites, and now the deliberate targeting of monuments can be added to the list of the general destruction of history in the past three years. Obviously, none of this matters, in comparison to the daily slaughter and suffering of the people, but international conventions and laws that protect cultural heritage exist because people's identities are linked to historical monuments and landscapes and this is precisely why monuments become targets of war.</p>

<p>As an advisor to the SBAH and the ministry of culture in Iraq in the summer of 2004, I was a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1293931,00.html">witness</a> to much of this disregard of antiquities laws. During that time, my Iraqi colleague Dr Maryam Moussa and I made the preliminary archaeological assessments of damage to Babylon that became the basis of the SBAH report. We surveyed the damage at the site and documented it with extensive photography over several months, so that the continuing construction by KBR (the American contractors that provides all logistical services for the military) and the coalition command can be seen in an archive of dated photographs. The helicopter pad built by the US was bulldozed into the very heart of the site, between the Hellenistic theatre dating to the era of Alexander the Great and the Palace of Nebuchadnazzer. Parking lots and living installations for the troops were dug into the ancient layers, and hundreds of sandbags had been filled with archaeological earth.</p>

<p>The observations that Maryam Moussa and I had made at Babylon were later <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/news/babylon.html">corroborated</a> by Dr John Curtis of the British Museum, who <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1391042,00.html">went to Babylon</a> for a three-day inspection in December of the same year.</p>

<p>If Babylon had been occupied for its own good, the military commanders would certainly have listened to requests that they stop construction and put an immediate end to helicopter flights. But for 18 months they dug their heels in and refused. I recall the surreal situation of standing in front of the commander of the base and being told that no damage had been done, while behind his head a crane or a bulldozer could be seen working away into the Babylonian temple precinct. It reminded me of the PR methods of the former Iraqi minister of information, al Sahhaf, who, while Baghdad was burning, continued to claim that there were no troops anywhere near the city. This method was nicely summed up by Groucho Marx when he asked: "Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?"</p>

<p>It was only after a long and arduous campaign by archaeologists, that the coalition commanders agreed to work on a schedule for the removal of the base known as Camp Alpha or "the Ruins" in military jargon. "The Ruins" was no small base. It was the south central headquarters of the multinational forces. During 2003 and 2004 the archaeologist in charge of the site made numerous complaints and wrote letters to the commanders stating in no uncertain terms that she refused permission for any kind of construction, the use of helicopters, or the use of the site as a military base. The coalition forces consistently stated that the site was needed for military reasons. For me, the battle for Babylon has always been a metaphor for the occupation of Iraq. The idea that the US took Babylon for its own protection is perhaps similar to the idea that the US invaded Iraq to bring it freedom. If you believe in the second statement, you are likely to believe the first.</p>

Sorry, my mistake -- *her* last sentence, etc.

Interesting. While I disagree with the political stance of the author, this is a very unfortunate location to set up a base. Hopefully, the planned relocation of American troops from this area will be carried out carefully and reasonably quickly. I'm not quite clear just what aspersion Bahrani is trying to cast in his last sentence, however -- surely he doesn't think the United States is just destroying Iraq's archaeological sites for the fun of it, does he? Or was this all a Bushite plot to control the world's richest deposits of Sumerian ruins?
