Don’t moles have a right to life too?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">R</span></span>ecently I treated the neighbourhood <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/apr/15/case-chaffinches-go-bad-signs-teachers-shoe-scanner">chaffinches</a> to a bag of RSPB sunflower seeds so tasty that my toddlers try to hang from the feeder to scoff the food.</p>

<p>I bought it at the local garden centre, and next in the queue were a nice couple who were asking for “something to kill <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/14/pass-notes-moles">moles</a>”. Between me and them, this perfectly illustrates our bizarrely polarised attitudes towards wild animals.</p>

<p>“Eat a robin? I would sooner eat a child,” exclaimed a 19th-century traveller when he witnessed the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/26/conservationists-appalled-at-illegal-killing-of-25m-birds-a-year-in-the-mediterranean">Mediterranean taste for songbirds</a>. The fate of the velvet-furred <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.poetrynook.com/poem/mole-catcher-0">“little hermit” – as John Clare called the mole</a> – shows there is no logic to the creatures we cherish and those we slaughter.</p>

<p>My nice couple would once have employed a mole-catcher: as recently as 2002, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1383267/By-appointment-the-Royal-mole-catcher.html">the Queen revived the tradition </a>of a royal warrant for a mole-murderer. Landowners used to slaughter moles on an industrial scale: one East Anglia estate caught 80,000-90,000 moles in 20 years. Years after the poison strychnine had been banned for other animals, it was still legally deployed to kill moles because no one would see a mole dying in agony underground.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/14/pass-notes-moles">Moles</a> may be heroes of children’s literature – from the everyman Mole in The Wind in the Willows to the fighting, romancing moles of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncton_Wood">Duncton Wood</a> (massive in my childhood) – but we can’t seem to form a close bond with them, unlike another garden resident, the hedgehog, which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/31/hedgehog-uk-natural-emblem">routinely tops most-loved animal polls</a>.</p>

<p>According to Rob Atkinson, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nhbs.com/title/185276/moles">author of Moles</a> and the country’s leading (perhaps only) mole ecologist, their excavations are equivalent to us pushing an elephant out of a tunnel with one hand. “They have many qualities that humans admire,” he says. “They are very industrious and they work very hard at looking after their children.” Role models in their own way.</p>

<p><strong> <br/></strong></p>

<p>Britain looks like a detached limb of Europe in more ways than one, as the continent-wide <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.treeoftheyear.org/Uvod.aspx?lang=en-US">Tree of the Year contest</a> reveals. While Hungary’s oak (44,000 votes) is going trunk-to-trunk with the Czech Republic’s thousand-year-old lime (31,000), <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/08/pear-tree-hs2-woodland-trust-cubbington">England’s pear tree </a>– a gorgeous old thing threatened with destruction by HS2 – has garnered just 5,013 votes. The trees representing Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland haven’t even got 1,000 votes yet.</p>

<p>I refuse to blame our trees – a Salford tree that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/jasonjdrake/status/700946707857674240">looks like Ian Brown of the Stones Roses</a> must be in the running next year – or voters, because we are indisputably a nation of tree-lovers. The competition clearly enjoys a much higher profile in eastern Europe (French and German trees are similarly overlooked), but perhaps we could learn from our European friends. The Czech Republic has a national register of “memorable trees”, a fabulous concept that protects individual trees because they are amazing nature reserves in miniature. But also because human meanings and memories take root in them.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see Gautam Malkani, whose debut novel, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/06/featuresreviews.guardianreview23">Londonstani</a>, won many fans 10 years ago, crowdfunding his follow-up, The Story Distorted. The first chapter – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://unbound.co.uk/books/the-story-distorted">published via Unbound</a> – is gripping. Is this another miss by conventional publishers, who also overlooked Paul Kingsnorth’s prize-winning <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/12/paul-kingsnorth-crowdfunded-novel-the-wake-wins-book-of-the-year-award">The Wake</a>? We often breathlessly wonder if crowdfunding is the future of publishing – but wouldn’t it be better to jettison the tedious cliche <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/22/uber-slick-but-not-disruptive">of “disruptive technology,” </a>and recognise that “the past” and “the future” usually coexist for a long time in the present?</p>

I think moles are cute. They obviously have an important role to play in the web of life or they wouldn't have survived thus far. Humans are basically just arrogant assholes that think they are gods because they can kill other creatures at will for their own trivial purposes.

Though chronic lung disease and a weak heart (he was asthmatic) were what finally did him in: the injury wouldn't have been fatal in a healthier person. He got pneumonia and a blood-clot.

Very well said. I have been privileged to see moles up close and they ARE beautiful. Their 'hands' are absolute marvels. I find them totally endearing. Killing them is brutal and cruel.

As an animal lover, I am appalled that we use poison to kill anything, including rats. What a horrible way to go! I don't know what the solution is to moles, perhaps some type of birth control, but we don't want to see them go extinct. Who wants any animal to go extinct? In this advanced society of scientific research, surly something could be done for the lowly mole. It's just that no one cares because they don't see them. I do.

If there is a use for a lawn that's one thing, but most are purely ornamental. Leaving the grass longer helps a lot.

You could also look up 'silage soil contamination', which is bugger all to do with fox hunting!

So what does not have a right to life? The E ?coli bacillus? A rat carrying the plague bacillus? Mosquitoes carrying malaria parasites? The fungus that causes potato blight? Wood Pigeons eating grain? Moles? I think we have a spectrum of damage to human interests. All species respond in their own interests, if we are 'at one with nature' , why the hang up about doing so ourselves? Judging by the number of molehills I see on my walks, the wee buggers are hardly endangered.

Moles only make molehills when their tunnels collapse and they have to construct new ones.

The mole exercises its choice. It is free to avoid my lawn, yet chooses not to do so. These choices have consequences.

The moles near me seem to be doing very well and looking at the damage they are doing to the grass in the local nature reserve I do sympathise will those farmers who are trying to feed sheep on grass .

Londoners could solve their housing problem and save the moles by turning their lawns into sites for more homes.

It's curious how certain subjects can be practically guaranteed to stir up spittle-flecked rants, even in The Guardian. Moles, evidently. They're a new one on me. Cyclists and migrants too, provoke reliable responses. Elsewhere, gun control is the work of the Devil, Kurds send Turks into a frenzy, while apostates, Christians, Yazidis, womens' ankles, and other Muslims send ISISists crazy. Funny old world...

You can't play croquet on a bumpy lawn with longer grass. Simple.Nowadays, kids play on lawns and similar requirements apply -- until they wear away bits of it, which doesn't matter much.

Yes, it wouldn't feel right battering a blind animal to death. Much better to let it die in agony out of sight.

DateTime::::2016-02-23T11:24:36Z
Actually intellectually you're very wrong and ignorant. Human rights are a social constructions, they have no basis in fact. Rights are natural, the right to life is the same for humans, animals and even plants. The fact that we have invented our own mercurial rights systems to destroy there's shows how selfish we are and that you are.

Actually they do. It ain't great one though being blind and battered by an intolerant gardener trying to keep their well manicured and otherwise ecologically barren lawn.

I can cope with the molehills, it's the tunnels so close to the surface that they push up the grass, which results in the lawnmower slicing the top of the tunnel off and leaving open veins of soil throughout, that piss me off.

Or something like that, because lawns have no purpose, and yet waste a huge amount of needless time with their upkeep.
