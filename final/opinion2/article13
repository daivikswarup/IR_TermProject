The Guardian view on millennials: a deepening age divide, and the growing pains of Gen Y




DateTime::::2016-03-11T19:05:35+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he big story of progress since the Industrial Revolution is reflected in the tales we tell about our own families. Stories of the father escaping tumbledown housing that is quite unimaginable to the son, or of the grandmother going without in a way that the granddaughter has never known. Accounts of extraordinary scrimping, narrow horizons and punishing toil, and quips to the youngsters about how “you lot don’t know that you’ve been born”. There were better years and worse years, occasionally a sharp passing squeeze. But over the decades – gradually, imperceptibly sometimes, yet ultimately remorselessly – things really did get better. And the sure way to see it was to compare successive cohorts.</p>

<p>The profound question underlying the Guardian’s exploration of the lives of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/millennials-the-trials-of-generation-y" title="">millennials</a> this week, and now made explicit by the government’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/uk-faces-permanent-generational-divide-social-mobility-tsar-warns" title="">mobility tsar Alan Milburn</a>, is whether this familiar narrative of generational progress has now been upended. It isn’t that members of Gen Y, with smartphones and cheap air tickets in hand, are about to edge back into the Dickensian workhouse. The tide of technology is not about to go into reverse, and the young as well as the old can be grateful for that. The concern is rather that all the old paths that allowed their parents to get ahead – careers with prospects, home ownership and decent pensions – are one by one being blocked off. Today’s young adults enjoy greater social, sexual and cultural freedom than any before them. But in hock to debts, to landlords and often unstructured work, the one freedom they are lacking is the freedom to make their own luck.</p>

<p>Pop sociology generalisations have made for some eye-catching headlines over the years – the political muscle of Mondeo man, the consumer clout of the empty nester – but they rarely survive a collision with the data. The developing gulf between the fortunes of different age groups in western economies is different: the more numbers you look at, the plainer it becomes that there is something serious going on. Even before the financial crisis, examining the two ends of the British age spectrum suggested an important divergence. Pensioners in their 70s, a poor group historically, notched up impressive average growth in disposable income of 20%, over the years 2001 to 2007, while the twentysomethings whom we might call their grandchildren, actually saw their pre-crisis incomes drop very slightly, by about half a percent. Then came the great crash, which hammered the young without mercy: their already-higher unemployment rate rose three times faster than that for older adults, and even after the jobs began to come back their incomes remained depressed, down a full 10% on 2007 in the latest data. Meanwhile the great storm charted a course that blew away from the old, pensioners in their 70s experiencing a continuing 7% rise in living standards over the same post-crisis years. And the story here really is about age, as opposed to inequality between rich and poor, which was stable during most of these years.</p>

<p>Squeezed incomes are only the first of the problems of the young – and not the most serious. The inadequacy of earnings is compounded by an increasing lack of reliability. The record number of workers on zero-hours contracts, which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/contractsthatdonotguaranteeaminimumnumberofhours/march2016" title="">official statistics</a> uncovered this week, are merely the most exposed tip of a workforce where rising insecurity falls disproportionately on the young. Even more fundamental than the divergence between what the young and old “get”, is the growing gulf in what the generations are “worth”.</p>

<p>Having had time to save and buy homes, people in their 50s and 60s will – in the ordinary course of things – own more than those who are just starting out. The twist is that the stock of accumulated wealth has, as the economist Thomas Piketty has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/05/piketty-capital-big-picture-economics-editorial" title="">made waves pointing out</a>, been tending to grow much faster than the economy. This pushes us away from a world where position depends principally on what you earn, and towards a world where it’s what you own that counts. That is almost bound to advantage those who have had long years to save at the expense of those who have not, and when you turn to the most important of all forms of wealth – housing – this is especially stark.</p>

<p>Over the entire course of the 20th century, a new census each decade would reveal a growing number of owner-occupiers, a facet of a continually expanding middle class, and something that once seemed no more reversible than the spread of education. Since the millennium, however, this tide has turned, and most especially for the young. Home ownership rates for 25-year-olds are now half what they were a generation ago, and, as property prices float ever further out of reach, renting is spreading back up the age range. For millennials, who struggle to save at all with high rents, the passing of the years is not, and likely never will, automatically conferring a deposit.</p>

<p>The lucky few can rely on a rope ladder of inheritance being tossed down from heaven at some point, but this is no substitute for a staircase of opportunity that is open to all. Even those babies shrewd enough to be born to parents who own a valuable home could see all the wealth go in care costs before they get their hands on it. For others, raised in cheap or rented homes, there is no chance at all of an inherited hand-up. If the door is increasingly bolted on home ownership, it was long ago locked on decent pensions. The sort of half- or two-thirds of final salary stipend which supports the superlative grandparenting of some baby boomers will never be there for any private sector worker in their 40s, still less their 20s. Add in student debts which will take decades to repay, and it becomes hard to see any way to make the arithmetic of the life cycle stack up for Gen Y.</p>

<p>George Osborne’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/inside-westminster-george-osborne-s-housing-boom-will-echo-into-the-future-8869835.html" title="">reported quip to cabinet</a> – “we’ll have a little housing boom, and everyone will be happy” – is only the coarsest case of the young being written out of the political script. From restricting home-building to property-puffing quantitative easing, all sorts of public authorities make decisions with generational consequences, which are rarely factored in. Within Whitehall, pensioner perks and healthcare are given some protection, whereas housing, employment and youth services have all endured crippling cuts. What young adults need is not some single whizzy policy, but the expectation that their interests will be properly weighed in every decision. There is one thing they can do to see to it that it happens, and it is something that they haven’t been good at doing until now. Vote.</p>

That UCL report paid for by the EU is widely discredited - for example it doesn't take into account how those immigrants will affect supply and demand. House prices became disconnected from wages around 2003 in the SE of England inc London - just at the time that immigration soared. This was also the time that wage rates stopped rising - again supply and demand.

I know that is a good argument but in our society we just don't/won't do it. A massive influx of immigrants tied to the care sector is likely the only solution.

Not only the young, but many Middle Aged as well. Perhaps anybody not yet on a decent old-style pension.My guess is it started in the late 70s/80s, when the then government smashed the traditional apprenticeships, replacing them with Ponzi scheme training schemes. resulting in an underachieving population ever since

Actually, it's not a case of under-investment, it's a case of over endowment. The welfare system was established to help with the belief it would improve the health of the nation, requirements would diminish and the multiple of over 100 in terms of real time spend increase we are faced with just on the NHS was never conceived.

Alternatively you can take a three year pension contribution holiday as an employer and then fill the huge hole in your fund by unilaterally deciding that I have to work 7 years longer and pay more before I can draw down anything. Also you conveniently forget that the majority of public sector pensions are for less than 4k.

love the fact their telling us to get ready to vote when the government is trying to make it as hard as possible to vote, and preventing 16 years old voting and constantly refuse to allow their right to vote by claiming that there disinterested. Hard to keep this line looking at the recent 77% turn out for the referendum in Scotland and the fact 16 years old in the crown dependencies can vote, why not here?? maybe because the youth will become to powerful for the current establishment

Wait a minute. If your grandchildren ( who still live at home) can't get good jobs to afford to get on the houseing ladder, -- why shouldn't they be live-in careres of their grandparents? The agreement would be that grandparents who own property would will it to their carers. (But these things need to be said and written down and agreed to-- not assumed, because children won't get it otherwise) It is very recent post-modern thinking that it is unthinkable to ask or expect children / grandchildren to take care of their elders. However, this depends on how you raise your children, and the example you set of taking care of your own elders. Young carers develop more maturity and dependibility than those who have no responsibility, but are merely indulged by their parents.

The cleverest young Brits would be those learning German. In fact, I can think of nothing that can better safeguard a young British child's future than for the parents to put him or her in a German-immersion day school (if any such exist in the UK). The German-speaking economy in Europe encompasses over 90 million people and there is a wealth of opportunity.

because immigration actually helps the economy, EU immigration actually helped the economy grow by 5 billion, which means more tax revenue to support things like the welfare state, and why can't you have the best of both worlds. Just people seem to engorged in themselves and think its okay to blame things on immigration because often they find it exceedingly hard to find their own voice.

Slightly hard considering now Australia has one of the strictest immigration laws in the world.By telling us to get on our bike I assume you mean move around to a place with better job opportunities which is a bit hard if all your income has gone onto paying for somewhere to live and food leaving no disposable income, also by the fact your referencing a post war incentive and I'm fairly sure in those days university education was free!!! and of course instead of trying to improve the country your brother left this country in the hands of the rest of your generation witch has caused the biggest amount of debt to occur at any point during the UK's history which I have to say bravo, learnt something today if you want it , ship the cost to the next generation
