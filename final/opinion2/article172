Who’d make the least dangerous Republican? I’m thinking Trump




DateTime::::2016-02-24T19:31:34+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> year ago in these pages I made a confident prediction that, through no fault of my own, has come to seem exceedingly rash: that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/feb/24/ted-cruz-donald-trump-nevada-video" title="">Ted Cruz’s presidential bid</a> would amount to nothing. When he announced his candidacy in March I painted him as a cranky Tea Party fringe candidate who would never trouble the pollsters. “Write him off,” were, I believe, my exact words.</p>

<p>This lack of prescience is even more glaring in light of the fact that Cruz’s current tied-for-second status is by no means the weirdest thing to have happened in the presidential racein the intervening 12 months. On Wednesday I had a serious conversation with my eldest son, who will be voting in his first US election, about which of the top contenders – Cruz, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio" title="">Marco Rubio</a> or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/23/donald-trump-wins-nevada-caucuses-results" title="">Donald Trump</a> – would make the least dangerous Republican nominee, and was forced to concede that it might be Trump. A year ago this would have been tantamount to debating whether Rush Limbaugh would be a better president than SpongeBob. A year ago you still could have said, “Don’t be silly. Donald Trump isn’t even a real person.”</p>

<p>Now we’ve reached the stage of counting delegates, things aren’t looking too hopeful for Cruz. Even the people who are meant to like him – evangelicals, ultraconservatives – appeared to prefer Trump in Nevada. But I’m not going to say “Write him off” again. Even if I had the confidence, my heart wouldn’t be in it.</p>

<p>A warning from the chairman of Surrey county’s youth football league – that touchline violence is out control, and could lead to a fatality – does not quite chime with my experience. In all my time on the touchline, the most violent thing I saw was bad weather. Coaches tended to conduct themselves with dignity, and the players were remarkably disciplined.</p>

<p>The trouble, when it happened, invariably concerned linesmen. They were very often parents who’d stepped in at the last minute, usually reluctantly, because someone hadn’t shown up. In such circumstances accusations of incompetence shouted from the other side of the pitch are understandably poorly received. I once witnessed somebody’s dad lose his temper completely after another father questioned an offside call. They got into a screaming match that stopped the game completely. The linesman dad then stormed off, throwing the flag over his shoulder. After he’d gone about 100 yards he turned around, came back, picked up the flag, held it out to me and asked if I wanted to take over. “No thanks,” I said.</p>

<p>On further reflection, I’m tempted to think that my rash election prediction simply wasn’t rash enough. So here’s a rasher one, ready for demolition at some point in the coming year, something I’ve always secretly hoped would happen in my lifetime: the outcome of the US election will be determined not by voters but by the electoral college.</p>

<p>The 538 designees who actually elect the president of the United States are not constitutionally bound to vote the way they’re pledged to. Those who defy this convention are known as “faithless electors”.</p>

<p>It doesn’t happen very often, but it happens: sometimes in protest, sometimes in error. In 2004 a Minnesota elector wrote the name of the vice-presidential candidate on a presidential ballot by mistake, granting John Edwards a single electoral vote. More than half the states now have laws designed to punish faithless electors, but slightly less than half don’t.</p>

<p>It’s not difficult to imagine a Republican elector refusing to cast his vote for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> as a matter of conscience, and it’s not impossible to suppose – if only you will indulge the kind of reckless speculation that might have predicted the current state of affairs – that an organised group of faithless electors could for the first time affect the outcome of the election. This would be amazing even if you think it’s a stupid system – we’re never going to fix it unless it breaks at least once.</p>

<p>In the extremely unlikely event that this actually occurs, remember: you heard it here first.</p>

Sorry Tim but you never actually explained why you think Trump would be the least dangerous? I was expecting an article explaining how awful Cruz and Rubio are but the media aren't focussing on them or something.

Guardian commentators do not faithfully represent the general stance in the UK much less the rest of the world. I mean, last I heard there are quite a few EU governments the Guardian readership disproves of but which somehow got elected... including the UK one.

If he is smart he will dial up the Act Presidential control. He just needs to reduce the idiotic statements (a little) and starting sounding generous to everyone (a little) and you are right: they will vote him in. Happily. Because the alternative is far far worse.

The electoral college would likely only ignore a numerical victory by Trump if it (a) was close in the elector count and (b) was almost too close to call in the popular vote tally. To think it would ignore a plebiscite win is fantasy.

Damning with very faint praise. This is about the bestwe could hope for at the Guardian.Cruz is a religious nut-bar and will not get the nomination.Kasich might be the most sensible of the lot but doesn'thave the national appeal, at least not yet.So, it's still looking like Trump. I wonder who the Guardian will be endorsing for the general election?

Ugh...you don't "win" the candidacy; the "elders" select you, depending on how much they spent on you, which they expect to be paid back - with interest. Trump hasn't been bought, so he can't be selected. Get it?

You're still worrying about the actors in the play, not the playwright(s). Any fool can say the words. This charade is about audience acceptance, not policy. And the audience, quite frankly, is now irrelevant. You'll take it and like it, that's been proved.

Suckers! You still believe there's a choice, that your votes count, that the POTUS actually does stuff? The Electoral College, not the voters, selects presidential candidates, so shut up and wait to be told whom you'll "vote" for. Even then your vote doesn't count because the machines are rigged, in case you vote against the result. The US voter is a mere spectator in this ridiculous circus. No-one does crass crudity like the Americans.

I can only guess, but I don't think that Petraeus would allow a few insulting remarks made by someone who throws around insults like confetti stand in the way of his ambitions. If Trump had actual policies that were detrimental to the military, that might put off Petraeus, but remarks can be shrugged off.

You could offer your soon-to-be-a-voter elder son a valuable political lesson on "whip-sawing," a pressure tactic in which there are two or more parties which are bound to reach a consensus on some matter--as voters must do when they come to choose between competing candidates--and are offered only a Hobson's Choice for candidates.

I appreciate your reasoned reply, truly, but it possesses a certainty naivety as regards to being able to disprove or prove one thing or another. I can for a fact find leftwingers who dislike Jews and Christians the same way you can find rightwingers who dislike Jews and Muslims. But there is a distinction in that the right has never pretended to care about equality, religious protections etc. It is the left that openly espouse themselves as the champions of humanity when in fact they are often very selective in who they choose to support and very aggressive to any who disagree. (See the childish rage thrown my way on here, for example.)

Cruz is a freak sucking up to the most evangelical of the evangelical. Rubio is half-assed. Kasich is irrelevant. Carson dull and not much. Trump is the least war-mongerer compared to the first two. The audit the fed is a serious proposal. He is not sucking up to fragments of the republican base nor driven by a stitch up the segments approach. at the end of the day the middle class losing because of the inflate assets policies of the Fed and the trade agreements that are sucking jobs out of America.

The really scary thing? All Trump has to do after he wins the Republican nomination (which he certainly will), is to move about 5% to the left, and tone down the rhetoric by 5%, and bam he beats Clinton. Voters will simply need to see that he is capable of being reasonable at times, and that's it, they will vote him in.
