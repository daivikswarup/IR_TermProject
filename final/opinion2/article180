What can match the eccentrics of the funfair?




DateTime::::2016-02-16T17:56:35+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span> went to the 812th annual <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/oyez_oyez_the_mart_given_traditional_opening_in_king_s_lynn_1_4418069" title="">Kings Lynn</a> Mart on Monday, a sentence it makes me disproportionately happy to type. There we all were, gathered at noon on a bright, freezing February day in the marketplace listening to councillor Elizabeth Nockolds read out the proclamation that first granted its right to be held there in 1204. Our smartphones aloft to capture the moment, we huddled down inside our hollowfibre-filled jackets against the wind and were effortlessly connected back to the time of King John.</p>

<p>There is something ineffably comforting about the weight of history at your back. The Kings Lynn Mart was originally one of two trading fairs but evolved over time into a funfair – the first in the showmen’s calendar and a time to dust off old favourites and try out new inventions before the onslaught of the summer season. Perhaps this tradition explains why the greatest fairground engineer of the Victorian era (and therefore any other age) also emerged in Kings Lynn. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.klmagazine.co.uk/2012/02/frederick-savage-genius-of-fun/" title="">Frederick Savage</a> applied his previous experience of developing and improving farm equipment to the invention of increasingly fantastic steam-driven rides, especially carousels.</p>

<p>Savage is basically the man behind everything we think of when we think of fairgrounds. He made the curlicued horses on his Platform Gallopers rock as well as circle, thanks to a series of eccentrics (the wheels mounted on revolving shafts to change rotation into back-and-forth motion, not a crowd of weirdos brought in from West Dereham for a day’s hard labour) under the carousel floor. The galloping horses were followed by racing peacocks, jumping cats and flying pigs, and then he gave the switchback to the world. Eight baroque gondolas, dragons edged in gilt, and simulacra of the new motorcars began to appear on the road powering round an undulating track. Imagine the glory.</p>

<p>Everything is electric at the modern Mart, of course. The lights are brighter, the music louder – but some of the glory remains. It is faded but, like the heavily worn gilt on the older rides, it is there. It is impossible to be cynical at the fairground. The very fact that it is not perfect – that you can see the joins, the nuts, the bolts, the hard graft holding it all together, – makes it real. Modern disaffection falls away. It is still impossibly exciting to spin round on a horse or sit on a golden dragon. It could be, in all important ways, 800 years ago again.</p>

<p>I have a new phone and it has been as dreadful a learning curve as you would expect. The thing that baffled me most has been the smallest. On the side of the magic box is the switch that turns it to silent. If you flick it one way, a red patch appears as a warning. The other, it does not. It has taken me weeks to realise that the red patch does not, as I assumed, warn you that your phone’s ringtone is on, rather that it is off.</p>

<p>I have never felt so out of my time. Of course, the danger is that you do not hear your phone, not that you accidentally disturb others and are crushed by the embarrassment. Of course. I am remembering a time as ancient as that of the first Mart. If you need me, I shall be in the tavern by the market place, watching the world wag past and wondering where all the monkeys and barrel organs went.</p>

<p>In view of all this, it should come as no surprise that I am delighted to hear <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/15/lords-overruled-recording-laws-vellum-goat-calf-skin" title="">that vellum is likely to be reprieved</a>. We are still to inscribe our laws on goat and calf skin as we have done for 1,000 years instead of, as proposed, moving to archival paper <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/10/uk-to-stop-printing-laws-on-vellum-to-save-80000-a-year" title="">to save £80,000 a year</a>. I cannot explain my delight, except to say that, like a fairground’s continuance down the ages, the survival of our ancient documents is a comfort. I wouldn’t like to deny either to generations yet to come.</p>

Yea but the animals aren't killed for their skin. It wouldn't be used otherwise.

It's a Derbyshire tradition which is said to have its origins in the days of the plague. Many of the villages in Derbyshire were plague free and it was believe at the time that the wells providing the water were the reason, so the locals started decorating the wells and giving thanks for their plague free status.At least that's what they told us back in the Seventies when I was at school and it was well dressing season.

Well-Dressing is alive and well every summer in C of E and RC Churches in Derbyshire ! I myself take part with my fellow- parishioners every year for a week in helping to pressing petals, bark, pepper-corns, and cloves, into a clay-covered sheet of plyboard overlaid with computer-generated diagram of whatever picture has been voted on by the parish for that year. The local Catholic school has a smaller, simpler flower picture done by the school children. The elaborate flower pictures are always placed by an ancient spring decorated with garlands; there is a procession and blessing each year of our well on the banks of the River Etherow; and then a luncheon and tea in a rented pavilion where every one enjoys the weather, rain or shine.

There is a trading fair in the small market town where I went to school. So old it is written into the town charter as a right. It was also the first time I realised I was too old for something when my mate and I was on the dodgems with some pissed 14 year olds, and were the only people of our age at the fair. Woops!

Some things just shouldn't change - they've attained a kind of accidental imperfect perfection. Fairs are one such. You can find videos of actual steam calliopes (fairground organs in the species memory AKA YouTube. And should. Music by steam, by God!

Quite right! Tattooing laws onto the skins of live animals, which are then allowed to roam the streets of our cities, towns and villages will encourage people to read the laws as part of a vibrant campaign to increase a greater familiarity with their civic rights and responsibilities.And when the animals die and are recycled as fod, it will provide us all with fascinating topics of conversation over the dinner table.Laws could also be carved into tubers for the benefit of vegetarians, or inscribed on the nuts of fruitarians.

The artwork on modern fairground rides is so vibrant, colourful and dynamic, it speaks to the inner child in all of us and is a modern form of folk-art, esp the pics of hot girls with big tits.

Author::::RobinGoodfellow

This will probably come as a surprise to you, so you might want to sit down. The animals are not killed specifically to make vellum. The skins are a by-product of animals killed for food.

Where I come from funfairs were owned and managed by dodgy gypsys who, when they weren't out selling rubbish hash, were forgetting to build their rides properly which resulted in a schoolmate being permanently injured when the Waltzers collapsed.
