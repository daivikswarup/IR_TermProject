From London to Delhi, air pollution kills. Why do we do nothing?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>fter a week in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/08/cars-choking-kolkata" title="">Kolkata</a>, blessed with mellow sunsets created by the yellowy haze that hung over the city, I flew back to Britain via Delhi on Friday. Our descent into Delhi was delayed because of fog, we were told, but the nicotine-coloured blanket smothering this dynamic Indian city was a malignant smog.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/08/cars-choking-kolkata">Cars are choking Kolkata, even though only a tiny minority in India can drive | Ian Jack</a> </p>

<p>Delhi, a city of 25 million people and nine million vehicles, routinely experiences fine particulate pollution above 300 micrograms per cubic metre; <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/standards.htm" title="">the EU’s legal limit is 25</a>. These figures are not abstract even for visitors. After just a few days in Kolkata and minutes in Delhi, I developed the dry hack known as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/delhi-pollution-cough-children" title="">“the Delhi cough”</a>. Exert yourself outdoors and soon your eyes are streaming and your lungs aching.</p>

<p>Fifteen of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/16/winter-smog-hits-worlds-cities-air-pollution-soars" title="">20 most polluted places</a> identified by the World Health Organisation <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/airpocalypse-now-china-pollution-reaching-record-levels" title="">are in India and China</a> but winter smogs have hung over Barcelona, Milan and Naples, and this month <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/08/london-takes-just-one-week-to-breach-annual-air-pollution-limits" title="">some London streets breached annual EU limits for nitrogen dioxide in just a week.</a> A recent study in Nature found that more people – 1.4 million people a year in China and 650,000 in India – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.mpg.de/9405012/mortality-air-pollution" title="">die from air pollution than malaria and HIV combined</a>.</p>

<p>Clean air should be a global priority, and it is puzzling that it is not. Unlike, say, climate change, toxic air is identifiable by the layperson, indisputably of the here-and-now, and kills rich as well as poor, which should make it a seductive subject for problem-solving by politicians.</p>

<p>But Britain is avoiding decisive action to scrap diesel vehicles, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a> keeps the home fires burning because it is growing at 7.4%, faster than any major economy. Kolkata is plastered with government adverts urging investors to “ride the growth”. Presumably they mean in an SUV. We should be so much smarter.</p>

<p>Perhaps air pollution hasn’t been solved because no one makes a fuss: scarier than the smog in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/delhi">Delhi</a>, Kolkata and London is the stoicism of residents for whom bad air has become part of daily life. I suppose it’s understandable why they’re not taking to the streets.</p>

<p>I visited Kolkata as part of an exchange organised by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.writerscentrenorwich.org.uk/" title="">Writers’ Centre Norwich</a>, in which writers from East Anglia and Kolkata swap cities and stories. Both places possess a rich intellectual past – but my most inspiring encounter was with the future, found on a dusty side-street.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.seagullbooks.org/" title="">Seagull Books</a>, a highbrow publishing house, is a book-lovers’ fantasy. It translates into English exciting new writers from around the world as well as previously untranslated works by the likes of Roland Barthes, and sells these beautifully designed books globally. It makes London’s publishing scene look narrow-minded and blandly commercial. But Seagull is commercial too, tapping into its global audience. Kolkata, where students buy books by the kilo from hundreds of street bookstalls, sparks an uplifting thought: the future of English-language publishing, and literature, lies in India.</p>

<p>After five years avoiding long-haul flights, I was amazed by the transformation of the aeroplane in my absence. I flew to India in a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2015/jun/12/boeing-787-dreamliner-take-off-vertical-video" title="">Boeing 787 Dreamliner</a> whose high internal ceilings reduce claustrophobia and large windows offer panoramic views – of the smog stretching to the Himalayas.</p>

<p>These windows no longer have blinds, and I pressed a little button to turn the pane from opaque to clear to admire the snow-capped peaks of Afghanistan. Suddenly, a central switch was flicked and all windows were forcibly darkened. Airline passengers are already denied almost any autonomy and the possibility of gazing at our planet is the most joyful freedom in flying. It also calms my nerves. How sad that technological advances are so often accompanied by an intensification of control.</p>

The reason why air pollution hasn't been solved is that no-one can make any money from solving it. The free-market can never protect the environment and as long as we kow-tow to its doctrines we will remain on course to environmental disaster.

Is coal burning power generation the main source of pollution? One was brainwashed into this belief – India and China bearing the brunt. Probably the contribution of automobiles is equally serious. There is a case to research this independently without sponsorship or oil industry funding

Yes that's the answer. Paint. We can keep clogging up our urban areas with machines running us over and pouring out toxic fumes while we get fat and sick, as long as we use some magic paint.

An average American breathe 2 gallons of air per minute which means around 3400 gallons of air each day.Procter & Gamble recently released a report that polluted air can contain over 200 chemicals that age the skin. This becomes a big issue in larger cities with more pollutants; in fact, in a study of over 200 urban and rural women aged 30 to 45, pollution from city life added as much as 10 percent to perceived aging people who live near high traffic roads face greater risk of cancer, heart disease, asthma and bronchitis as these places contain more concentrated levels of air pollution.

Air pollution leads to conditions which in turn leads to deaths among the "weak, the young and the terminal". The death certificates documents the direct cause of deaths but not the indirect.

Young people don't care about cars the way the older generation did. They are no longer desirable status symbols - just a tiresome expensive way you often need to get around. Plenty of young people don't even bother to learn to drive - not until they have to. Things are changing, slowly.

Malta has the highest numbers of cars per person in the world IIRC. And it's a tiny place, with a very good bus service. It's bizarre - they really do love their cars!

If all the people that lived in cities didn't drive around them, that would be a very good start. Children do not stop you using a bike, unless you've got a completely unsustainable number of them (more than 3).

So they should get a bike trailer, or get it delivered, or buy a bigger rucksack, or buy online, or go shopping more often (less stuff per trip). It's not a very hard problem. Maybe a couple of times a year going to collect shopping by car/van is the best plan, which is fine. It the people for whom this is the default means of moving that are most of the problem. My car moved off the drive 8 times last year.

Vehicle ownership is fine so long as it's a bike. All the same advantages of autonomy as a car (door to door transport, come home after the last bus/tube/train, no waiting) but no pollution or congestion.

You can see someone drown in a flood you can see polluted water or soil where nothing wil grow but does anyone know someone who died from air pollution? Not a single death certificate wil state "air pollution" as a cause of death. The people that die are the weak the young and the terminal. London's air is much better than then in the 70's but still room for improvement.

The pollution levels in Indian cities are beyond alarming. There are 9 million cars in Delhi versus 6 million in Bejing, the capital of a more developed country. How many cars will there be, when India reaches the Chinese income level? This is just not sustainable. There has to be a fundamental rethink of how we live and work, and how "development" is going to happen.
