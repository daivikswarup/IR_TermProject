Happy Valley has become Britain’s version of The Wire

<p>This should come as no surprise given that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/07/sally-wainwright-writer-happy-valley-second-series" title="">Sally Wainwright</a>, the show’s creator, has been responsible for what feels like every British hit save for Downton Abbey in the past few years: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/nov/03/sally-wainwright-last-tango-halifax" title="">Last Tango in Halifax</a>, which also played well in the US; and the crime drama <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/apr/03/scott-and-bailey-british-cagney-and-lacey" title="">Scott and Bailey</a>.</p>

<p>She should be mentioned in the same breath as Matthew Weiner or Aaron Sorkin or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/why-i-love-shonda-rhimes-screenwriter" title="">Shonda Rhimes</a> or Jenji Kohan, or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/02/the-people-v-oj-simpson-ryan-murphy-american-dream" title="">Ryan Murphy</a>, who is a terrible writer but still signed a reported $24m development deal with Fox a few years ago, because that’s how the US treats star showrunners.</p>

<p>Wainwright, meanwhile, only won her first Bafta in 2013 and was turned down by ITV a few years ago for a second season of Unforgiven, her three-part drama that was as good as everything else she writes. Well done, chaps!</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Compared to Happy Valley, even Broadchurch looks thin and phoney</p>

<p>One of the reasons for Wainwright’s success in the US is that, perversely, she isn’t courting it. Americans I know who love Happy Valley do so because it is a window into another world, just as British viewers felt transported while watching The Wire. It’s a quality that draws attention to the inferiority-complex under which so many British dramas labour – the fake American gloss of Luther, say, or Line of Duty. Compared to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/happy-valley">Happy Valley</a>, even Broadchurch looks thin and phoney.</p>

<p>The show’s success is also, of course, down to a superlative cast – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/03/happy-valley-end-of-series-tv-review-mark-lawson" title="">Sarah Lancashire</a> is, at this point, inching into Dame Judi territory – and a lot of great writing. A tiny example: two women parting company after a night out and one says to the other, “text me as soon you get in”, which is a thing women say to each other in real life and not on TV, unless one of them is about to be murdered by the cab driver.</p>

<p>And the scene between Catherine and the therapist, which in lesser hands might have been played for laughs but was instead real, awkward and fraught with moral complexity.</p>

<p>I’m sure Wainwright does very nicely indeed, but, looking across the international TV landscape, it’s hard not to feel she isn’t getting her dues. If David Simon gets a 10,000-word profile in the Paris Review, so too should Wainwright.</p>

<p>With one episode left, I asked American friends how they were coping with the Yorkshire accents. Most said they’d gotten the hang of “’appen I did” and “us” as a possessive pronoun, as in “Us dad died when we were tiny.” But there was still a lot of confusion. I ask a friend to have a stab at, “down at cafe that does us butties”, and he said: “Something to do with his ass?”</p>

<p>“Whose arse?”</p>

<p>He looked panicked. “I don’t know. I heard the word butt.”</p>

<p>“It’s about a sandwich.”</p>

<p>“OK, I’m not getting sandwich.”</p>

<p>“What about ‘Up Ripponden’?”</p>

<p>I then had him pronounce “Sowerby Bridge” over and over, which was better comedy than anything I’ve seen for a long time.</p>

<p>This week was the Downton finale in the US. A few months ago I heard <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/julian-fellowes">Julian Fellowes</a> interviewed by an American journalist, who asked him: “Where are you in the hierarchy?” To which, after a long pause, he replied: “I came, I suppose, from the sort of bottom of the top. We didn’t have much money, my grandfather was a younger son.”</p>

<p>There followed more caveats, no little pain at the vulgarity of having to articulate all this, and a final assessment of his family’s aristocratic position as a “minor one, but in the books”. Great drama.</p>

The last season of Justified was good again, though S2 is the best. Overall it was a terrific series. Some of the plots are far-fetched, but personally I much prefer it to Happy Valley, as I have a very limited tolerance for Sarah Lancashire (and I'm afraid I think Sally Wainwright's a bit over-rated).

Do they need subtitles I wonder? This is the only show that I have needed to put them on, it isn't the accent, it is the mumbling diction that renders it incomprehensible at times.

It is pronounced Sorby Bridge. Correct. Where people, particularly actors get tripped up is assuming the "s" in " ' dad" stands for us. It doesn't. It's really used as a contraction of "our". There again I've only lived here seventy years so what do I know?

"no offense" is an interesting one. I have seen it advertised outside the uk as "so british". In case anyone is expecting it to be midsommer murders, Don't. It is very funny at times, although it is about a serial killer who attacks Down's syndrome prostitues.

Downton was highly entertaining, mainly because it sent itself up and wasn't meant to be taken seriously. Happy Valley is much better written, certainly in terms of dialogue, and takes itself more seriously; perhaps, sometimes, too much so. Both are enjoyable and well acted but, despite its failings, HV has the edge on quality, detail and durability.

But you were petty. It was rude (and silly) to pick up somebody's grammar. It's silly because you do now need to watch your back, 'cos there ain't no room to make mistakes. Okay, I accept your point that you thought it was apt because we were talking about writing. And maybe I jumped the gun too quickly. And no I'm not nice.

Happy Valley truly excellent as one form of tv drama, I agree. Downton however (which I deliberately declined to watch for all the years it ran because I told everyone I was sick of hokum 'social histories' about upstairs and downstairs), has surprised me with how addictively good it is, and I'm catching up now - again, down to superlative script and direction and a truly wonderful ensemble cast.

The dialogue has a realism to it that Corrie and Eastenders script teams can only dream about. Wainwright has an acute ear for the way people speak, especially in the North and especially the women.

The only parallel I can find between Happy Valley and the Wire is that it's quite difficult to understand what the actors are saying in both shows. In the Wire this is because of the authentic Baltimore dialect and argot used - often with unknown actors from Baltimore. This is ultimately rewarding reinforcing a sense of place and location. In Happy Valley it's because the BBC couldn't afford better microphones, rendering the Brit drama identikit cast (bit of Corrie, some Downton and just a dash of Benidorm) unintelligible.

Happy Valley is great - but comparing to the Wire - really? The strength of the Wire was the quality of writing - the years of research - the depth of the story and the reality that a US show can extend to multiple series and still keep its freshness. No UK drama has ever come close and that has much to do with how channels such as HBO operate.

Actually, I'm writing this again as The Guardian took away my original. I'm quite sure because of the language. I was, in fact, quoting David Mamet. And usually the Guardian is very good at permitting bad language. But maybe in fairness to the paper, I have to say it is fairly relentless - but I love, it's poetry.And my point is that you are on the button. Simply copying 'the way people really speak' is, as you allude to, empty.David Mamet is a good example, I believe, of a writer who takes the language of the street and turns into poetry. The result is language that is vibrant, something missing in bucketfuls from this turgid work much admired by Ms Brockes.

This article quotes a script, claiming it's great. I take issue with that quote. You tell me I can't because I've not seen the programme. If I see the programme, will that 'text me as soon as you get in' be any different to my having read it? No, it won't. So you have missed the point, 'cos there's absolutely no need to have seen the show to make the comment I made.

Nice maxim. Does it not extend to getting personal and calling people petty? Sorry if I offended you by pointing out the irony, but as the discussion was about writing and the importance of words I thought it was entirely within the point. I'll try to be nicer like you.

I haven't seen series 1. I'm not entirely sure what you have already been told in that.For example, earlier in series 2, I had the impression that the bloke in prison was a "jump out of the bushes" rapist rather than someone who actually had a relationship with Sarah-Lancashire-character's daughter that turned violent. Was that dealt with in greater detail before?

Sarah Lancashire is very good.But, for me, Siobhan Finneran quietly steals every scene she is in. The subtlety in her early scenes with her boyfriend and the full-on explosion when she fell off the wagon were both brilliant.

Get the feeling Brockes has been dying to write something like this. I love Happy V abd it's clearly the best thing British TV has done for a long long time. But it isn't as complex or as realistic or as poetic as The Wire. It doesn't quite have the depth. But that doesn't matter and maybe we should stop trying to find something as hood as The Wire. I said this to many friends way before The Wire took off over here - during the 3rd season, but there will never be a show like the wire again....

Sorry, I do understand. I should have put its instead of it's. So now to your 'missing the point' you've added 'pettiness.' Indeed, if you were to read my pieces, you would realize that my English is generally okay. There are errors and mistakes. Imagine 'errors' to be momentary lapses and 'mistakes' to be something somebody doesn't know. It's much nicer to assume the former and ignore the latter.

Thanks for your help James, but actually I don't. At least I think that's what you were trying to say. Criticising dialogue based on a newspaper article rather than watching the show could be seen as.....irrelevant.
