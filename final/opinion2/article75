The Guardian view on Libya: yet another messy frontier in the war on Isis

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">F</span></span>ive years after the start of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, Libya is fast becoming the new frontier of the western war against Islamic State. This turn of events has now become clear, after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/19/us-airstrikes-target-islamic-state-militants-in-libya" title="">the US recently carried out airstrikes against the jihadi group</a> which has taken control of large swaths of Libya’s coastline and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-libya-security-oil-idUKKCN0VV0RJ" title="">targeted the country’s oil facilities</a>. US warplanes struck an Isis training camp in Sabratha, north-western Libya, last Friday, killing dozens of militants, according to the Pentagon. US officials said the operation targeted a Tunisian operative responsible for terrorist attacks against tourists in Tunisia in 2015, including the assault on a beach resort in Sousse in which 38 people died, among them 30 Britons. What is much less clear is how this strategy will play out, and how it can be sustained in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/16/libya-gaddafi-arab-spring-civil-war-islamic-state" title="">absence of a national unity government in Libya</a> able to establish its legitimacy over a war-ravaged country.</p>

<p>The US and its allies have grown increasingly worried about the expansion of Isis in Libya, where the insurgency has an estimated force of 6,500 fighters. Despite the messy aftermath of the west’s move against Gaddafi in 2011, there are signs that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/uk-considering-military-action-against-isis-in-libya" title="">several European states are contemplating a fresh military intervention</a> in Libya, alongside the Americans, with the aim of preventing Isis from establishing a launchpad for more attacks in Europe and in North Africa. But although such plans seem to be under consideration in Rome, Paris and London, no decision has been taken – nor is there any clarity as to whether this would be limited to an air campaign, or involve ground forces. On Tuesday, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/italy-okays-protective-us-drone-strikes-libya-sicily-1778682846" title="">Italy announced it had authorised the US air force to use a base in Sicily to carry out drone strikes</a>.</p>

<p>One problem is that any international military operation would require a clear legal basis. With a UN mandate highly unlikely at this point – because that would require Russia’s approval – there would need to be an official request from Libyan authorities themselves. But there is no agreement in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya">Libya</a> on who the government is. UN mediation efforts have failed, so far, to produce an agreement between factions. Libya’s territory has been carved up by two competing sets of local governments and parliaments – one based in the capital, Tripoli, and the other, which the international community recognises, in the eastern city of Tobruk. The resulting chaos has created a vacuum which Isis has stepped into.</p>

<p>American officials say last Friday’s airstrikes were not the beginning of a new international air campaign. But that may perhaps be only a question of time. There is no doubt that Libya must be prevented from becoming a springboard for Isis. The consequences of that for the whole region, and for Europe, would be devastating – not least because Libya has been a major route for refugees and migrants. But the prospect of a new “war on terror” in that part of Africa surely deserves more public debate than is currently happening.</p>

<p>The intervention of 2011 was purportedly aimed at Gaddafi’s open threats to carry out what sounded like a massacre in Benghazi. But there was a wider idea too: to protect whatever hopes existed for the Arab spring – including in neighbouring Tunisia and Egypt. Since then, Egypt has fallen back into military dictatorship, and Tunisia’s democracy struggles on. Some will now see Libya’s slide into warlordism as the result of nothing but Gaddafi’s overthrow and the misguided intervention of 2011. But that narrative overlooks something important. Libya had no meaningful, functioning state institutions even under Gaddafi – only a tyrant’s rule.</p>

<p>Libya’s disintegration has been largely due to a lack of international focus and of diplomatic follow-up after 2011. UN-sponsored stabilisation efforts were dismally insufficient. Libya is today a mess that the west cannot, and should not, turn its eyes away from. But getting the policy right will require honest and open debate.</p>

These women are stupid and they'll soon realise once they get there, but it will be too late by then. That doesnt change the fact that ISIS want to inflict there evil on all women, wether they choose it or not, and they must be stopped. If you regard that as 'rubbish' then you arent much different form them !

Believe I mentioned about 6 months ago if ISIS get their hands on a Nuclear Warhead or similar. We could be in for a whole heap of trouble. Except the Government of course as they have handy bomb proof bolt -holes.Not that there will be much left, (watch 'Threads" good people.)Since then all they have done is bicker like school children, and attempt to bring the lash down on the N.H.S., allow 'torture' for uncontrollable prisoners and do nothing to address the suicides of disturbed teenagers.Do these fools understand the word priority. ISIS came out yesterday, and said 'anybody with a spare bomb please give them a call', or words to that effect. They don't care if they live or die, for some strange reason they believe torture, rape, and killing qualifies them for a place in Paradise.

Agreed. Well said. Libya was not like the others at the time--It's not even IN the Middle East. Gaddafi was not much influenced by anyone but himself, and the revolt has no actual proof or evidence other than pure speculation that somehow the West was to blame for the Arab Spring. In fact, the Arab Spring was in many ways a reaction and a symptom, not a creation of the West.

Thank you. Finally, someone's memory is intact, and not obsessed with attributing the reason for the Arab Spring to the USA or the West.

Right, and it was such a great melting pot that there was no reason for the rest of the country to revolt. You lived in Tropoli. I doubt you ever got very far outside of it.

NATO lied about a massacre to get into Libya. NATO removed Gaddafi. The blame lies squarely there. A nightmare your government created. In Iraq, in Syria, in Libya.

What is the point of this article ? Trying to push the blame, yet again, onto the incompetance of the West, rather than the nightmare that the Arab world creates and seeks to enforce on everyone, their own people aswell as us, which seems to be working as far as the Guardian is concerned.

Mussolini, Franco, Stalin,The Portuguese until the bloodless Revolution gave them Democracy. Rumanians are still arguing about whether life was better under Ceausescu Everyone had a place to live, a job, (perhaps not great wages etc). You could even sling in De Gaulle.Perhaps the lesson to be learned is butt out, (unless of course they have bundles of Oil).

Can't say the mad Dog didn't support the underdog, I have only heard of about a third of this bunch. I take it he told you this personally. Don't tell me he set up The Nation Of Islam and the I.R.A. as well. The other lot must have killed ooh, about 12 people so they must have been pretty rubbish.In other words not a patch on the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken, disrupted, finally culminating in the blood drenched ISIS.I suppose he would have supported them as well?

The Guardian loves to tell everyone it did not support the Iraq war. It is less keen on admitting it supported the Libyan invasion and Kosovo, both of which were total disasters.

"Libya had no meaningful, functioning state institutions even under Gaddafi – only a tyrant’s rule"? Two words: Dog`s bollocks. Libya had a literacy rate of almost 100%; including mandatory schooling for all girls up to the age of at least 16, free medical insurance for all, large Saharan greening projects and above all, a blooming oil industry that was just about to go off the US dollar...and which proved at least partially to be Gaddhafi`s undoing.

NATO strafed Qaddafi's convoy with combat jets, and there is no evidence that the rebellion against Qaddafi was widespread, just like in Syria, a few thousand "protesters" in nations of millions of people suddenly "acquired" military-grade weapons out of thin air. Mm, manportable antiaircraft missiles, heavy antitank rockets.. Those look like the tools of choice of real protesters to you? Utilizing violence to achieve political aims is called TERRORISM, aka the favorite boogeyman of Western governments. And yet, the west arms bandits and mercenaries and calls them "protesters" or "freedom fighters", an act of doublespeak that no doubt would have impressed Mr Orwell.

Yes, it was thoroughly sensible to dismember his country, provoke civil war, and invite DAESH into the vacuum created. It's really sensible because it's an ideal place from which to wage war upon Europe.What stuff and nonsense. Typernotfighter is either a bad person or a fool.

"Libya had no meaningful, functioning state institutions even under Gaddafi – only a tyrant’s rule."seriously?So, we should not believe "simplistic" narratives that the western-backed coup on Libya directly led to the Somalia-like statelessness of today and the rise of DAESH (why do you insist upon calling them ISIS?) in North Africa.But we can trust our author when in one short sentence he/she reduces all thought to an impossibility. Trust. Believe me.

First of all. let's get the facts straight. The West did not kill Gaddafi. Libyan rebels did that. Secondly, Libyan's rebelled as a result of the Arab Spring. Gaddafi, chose to respond to that event by massacring his own people.
