The EU leave campaign has dishonesty at its core – and it hasn’t convinced us

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>e represent three different parties and three different political philosophies. In our adversarial political culture, we have spent our careers disagreeing with one another about the big issues. But there is one that transcends the political divide: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/08/the-guardian-view-on-europe-and-the-economy-size-isnt-everything">Britain’s future in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>The choice facing us in June will determine the direction and status of our country for decades to come, deciding the basis on which UK businesses are able to trade with our largest and nearest partner; the employment opportunities available to workers; the prices in our shops; and whether we protect our national security and natural environment together with our neighbours, or apart, by ourselves.</p>

<p>Campaigners on both sides have <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/mar/09/websites-sort-the-facts-from-the-fiction-for-eu-referendum-voters">a duty to be honest with the British public </a>and not to exaggerate: we are entitled to our own opinions but not our own facts. </p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">We must reject the impossible promises of those whose obsession with leaving Europe blinds them to the risks</p>

<p>There is a particular problem with the Brexit campaign in as much as it involves different individuals who have clear but distinct views of what the alternative arrangements might be, which are more often than not inconsistent with each other. We are variously told that free of the shackles of Brussels we can have free markets, including free immigration, closed markets including less immigration, unrestrained capitalism or unrestrained socialism, a continued single market or an end to the single market. </p>

<p>The most widely promoted version of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/07/brexiteers-star-power-no-clear-message-leavers-testy-boris-johnson">the leave campaign</a> claims that Britain could retain its place in the EU’s free-trade single market while not paying a penny into the EU budget, ending free movement and ignoring EU rules. No other country has such a deal or anything close to it and the French and German governments have been clear that they will not make such an exception for Britain. They do not hesitate to remind us that the single market – involving not just free trade in goods and services but free movement of capital and labour – was a British idea (launched by Margaret Thatcher and implemented by Conservative, Labour and coalition governments).</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/11/brexit-campaigners-accused-of-dishonesty-over-eu-budget">Brexit campaigners accused of dishonesty over EU budget</a> </p>

<p>One particularly dishonest claim is that the UK could enjoy continued membership of the single market, while abandoning contributions to the common budget. On the strength of this assumed saving a wild orgy of public spending and tax cuts is being promised. New analysis shows that the leave campaign has made 20 separate financial commitments, costing a staggering £83.6bn. </p>

<p>The leave campaigners claim that if Britain leaves Europe we will be able to fund new infrastructure projects, tax cuts, accelerated deficit reduction and bailouts for domestic industries. From boosting pensions by £18.25bn to cutting taxes by £7.9bn and filling in potholes to the tune of £53m, leave campaigners claim the solution to every domestic public policy challenge is to leave Europe.</p>

<p>But if Britain leaves Europe there is no guarantee that we would make a saving at all. Leave campaigners never acknowledge the billions we receive back from the EU in payments to British farming, support for our poorer regions and investment in scientific research, which is fundamental to EU universities. They forget the budget rebate won by Margaret Thatcher, which stands to this day. And other countries that belong to the single market but remain outside the EU, such as Norway and Switzerland, make net contributions on a per capita basis similar to the UK today.</p>

<p>There are of course costs as well as benefits to membership but Britain is clearly a net beneficiary. It has been plausibly estimated that the economic benefits arising from our membership are equivalent to around £3,000 a year to the average UK household – roughly ten times the net contribution.</p>

<p>Our membership of the single market attracts investment from around the world. The big British success stories in motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals, financial services and creative industries are based in significant part on overseas investors locating here and creating jobs, on the basis that they can trade freely within the EU single market. BMW, maker of Rolls-Royce and the Mini, has made it clear that its commitment to the UK rests on that continuing. And the EU creates greater competition between companies, which drives down costs for British consumers.</p>

<p>Britain can either be in the EU’s free-trade single market, with the tariff-free trade, regulatory influence and full market access this brings. Or we can have limited access, zero influence over regulation and risk tariffs. There is no alternative that provides equivalent benefits. Attempts to find one by exiting without an agreed alternative risks prolonged and damaging uncertainty and upheaval.</p>

<p>Britain is stronger, safer and better off in Europe. Together we will carry on making that patriotic case for our continued membership. We must reject the impossible promises of those whose obsession with leaving Europe blinds them to risks of cutting ourselves off from our partners and neighbours.</p>

Correct. But if you think the Germans and French don't want access to our market think again.We will trade with the whole world.

The core of the Brexiter campaign is xenophobia, pure and simple (at least Farage has the honesty to be reasonably up front about it). They may try and dress it up with other 'concerns' like 'loss of sovereignty' (showing they haven't read the NATO treaty or any other of the numerous international treaties to which the UK is a signatory) but the fact is the bottom line is a fear of being 'swamped' by 'foreigners' with their strange smelling foods and even stranger languages.

Good point. Why can't a body similar the OBR be set up to judge the veracity of claims?Andrew Neil did a good job shredding the claim that we will be £3,000 worse off. Similarly with the idea that the jungle would re-appear in Kent. On the Brexit side the claim that the EU costs us £350 million a week Neil found it was a huge exaggeration. It now appears £200 million a week is a better estimate.Why can't the question of immigrant numbers be definitively settled?Why can't more details of the Canada deal be exposed? How many negotiators were involved?What were the hold ups that caused it to stretch out to 7 years?Why has the EU - Cuba deal only taken 2 years?Lots of questions unanswered - that leaves the field clear for biased reporting and BS.

Yes the fact check report suggests the actual figure is probably half that however you have conveniently forgotten that that is five times the net cost of our membership.In the spirit of honesty I am sure you will now acknowledge that Britain's membership of the European union is financially beneficial.

It would seem very clear that both sides of this campaign are not being very forward with the true advantages and disadvantages as to what would come about from our voting for them .I fully agree with you , we need to have a lot more honest debate on the effects of our decisions, at the moment all i could honestly say will happen after the referendum is: We will see no change to our struggles no matter what the result. That makes me wonder if it is honestly worth taking part in the vote at all.

All of these people came out in support of the EU well before the campaigns started, and were therefore never open minded about thinking through both sides of the debate. As for the quality of their argument, Anna Soubry, in particular, has been truly awful when she's been debating people on this issue from what I've seen.

The whole notion of further separation in this century is reverting to tribalism. We need politicians to endorse further unity with humanity on a tiny planet instead of the violence of one against the other. Unless we learn to bridge barriers, cooperate, teach and learn that we truly are one humanity, we are bound to live in further fear, violence and insecurity.

yeah but give it 5 or 10 years and UK will be as rich as Croesus again. Budget deficits a thing of the past, national debt eliminated replaced with 1/2 trillion surplus. No homeless, no ZHCs, house prices back to 3 or 4 times annual salary. NHS properly funded and staffed despite a population of 75 or 80 million. We can then afford to bump up our EU net contributions so we can help southern and eastern european states get up to speed.
