Why I'll never regret my Bernie Sanders tattoo




DateTime::::2016-03-03T12:31:56+0000



<p>There are many ways to show your support for a candidate.</p>

<p>Some buy bumper stickers or T-shirts. I, however, took what some might think was an extreme path. </p>

<p>Aartistic Inc, a tattoo parlor in Winooski, Vermont, is giving away free <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> tattoos to anyone who wants one. I took this as an opportunity to show my support.</p>

<p> A question that I get asked daily is: “Will you regret it if he does not win?” </p>

<p>The answer is simple: no. Because even if he does not win the nomination, this is just the start of something very big – a movement, more than just a campaign. And, surprising as it may seem, Bernie Sanders has influenced me greatly, even before his candidacy for president of the United States. </p>

<p>I lived in Vermont for 18 years, and I have personally experienced Bernie’s contributions to our state. While mayor of Burlington in the 1980s, he took our waterfront railyard and transformed it into a beautiful landmark of leisure and tourism in for those living in the community and the surrounding area. In May 2015 I had the pleasure of viewing Bernie Sanders announce his presidency on the waterfront. It was an incredible moment for anyone who had Vermont and Senator Sanders near to their heart. </p>

<p>This is why it was so simple for me to do something others might consider so “drastic”. Sanders is truly an iconic figure to me, as I believe he will be so to many others in our country’s future. He will go down in history for starting an uprising of Americans – prompting us to stand up and saying enough is enough. The billionaires own our country’s political system and we want to reclaim our democracy. </p>

<p>I’m 24, but I have never voted in a presidential election before. To tell you the truth, Bernie Sanders is the first candidate who has ever gotten me excited about politics. He is the first candidate who has ever made me feel like he truly cared about the people and was for the people. He doesn’t attack his opposing candidates, and instead focuses on the issues. He has not only opened my eyes, but those of millions of Americans. </p>

<p>My tattoo not only symbolizes my support for Bernie, but also serves as a reminder to myself for years to come: he started something big, a revolution in people’s thinking, that I am so proud to have been a part of. <br/></p>

Bernie Sanders isn't a politician. His campaign is something for our country to be proud of. It's been way more than a few decades since we had a real democracy, and we may never have one again, but at least we had this moment when a person running for president told the truth and really cares about democracy.

Never, ever get excited about politicians and certainly don't get their tattoos. Your view should be to vote for whomever you think will harm you least. But, you'll grow wiser and you'll always have a reminder of when you weren't.

"Unregulated"?You must mean the 80,908 pages of sec rules and regulations in place in 2007.OrThe 125,216 federal banking and charter rules and regulations in force back then.

The US political system is in a crisis because most people do not participate in their electoral system for many reasons. The system NEEDS MORE YOUNG PEOPLE to vote, to introduce new ideas, to argue and demand to be heard.

You should read his "Outsider in the (White) House" where he explains his methods. They resulted in his overcoming deadlock in Burlington - in the teeth of a Democrat/Republican alliance to derail him - and they have made him the "Amendment King" in the House and the Senate. I think he'll be one of the most effective Democrat Presidents ever.

Sanders is the longest serving Independent in US history, voted against the Iraq war, voted against the Patriot Act, etc. I know Ron Paul well, my roommate is a Libertarian and Progressives are by nature social Libertarians (and social Libertarians are by nature Progressive). Bernie Sanders is the Left's Ron Paul. Motherfucker has been fighting against the establishment for fifty years, marched with MLK, arrested for protesting segregation, etc. I know Ron Paul fans tend to think they have the only real anti-establishment figure in their pockets, but sorry, bro, Bernie Sanders is the fucking king of anti-establishment.

Government is not an individual. The way governments get revenue is through people making and spending money. When demand is low the government tries to increase it. This goes back all the way to Keynes, and well before that, really. We've got any number of countries, even from this last recession, to look at. The ones who spent money and made cheap credit available are doing much better than the ones who went with austerity.

Ron Paul appealed to low information liberals who liked his rhetoric on war and empire and the war on drugs. They never would have voted for him if they knew he opposed Medicare, Medicaid, the FDA, the EPA, any and all regulations and government assistance programs, and thought federal income taxes were unconstitutional. Add to that the fact the he only opposed empire and war because they were too expensive, and not out of any moral or philosophical opposition, and you've got a candidate who's anathema to the young people.

The left betrayed them by going to the right. Social Darwinism is the model of the right, and that's what they're protesting. Along with unfettered capitalism plundering the individual for the benefit of the corporations.

Social democracy is not socialism. The US govt is already largely democratic socialist (social security, medicare, police, welfare, education), and presidents cannot become authoritarians, thanks to a system of checks and balances enshrined in the constitution. Read a book, troll.

I couldn't agree with you more! I am a 26 political philosophy/economics graduate and the movement that has started with Sander's campaign has every potential to grow and make a difference in the political landscape of the U.S, whether Sanders wins the nomination or not. I haven't been around for many election cycles, but it truly makes me happy to see people my age so actively involved in the political process. Perhaps it may have been that I was only 18 when Obama first ran and the my crowd of friends were much different then, but the level of enthusiasm that I see from my peers for Sanders is almost overwhelming compared to the 2008 election.

When are you going to realize that it is the left that betrayed you? Will it take ten yours of you life to go around the political spectrum and come around to the ideas of the right that you cannot fathom to accept now because of peer and academical pressure as a solution to the real problems you're facing at your start in life?

I am of a similar generation to this girl and I don't think some people realise just how deep rooted the progressive movement is amongst the millennials. We have well and truly been screwed over by the establishment; riddled with student debt, high unemployment (regardless of how skilled one is), a wage structure that is not conducive to living costs and a property market that has priced us out.

First, Ms Rhoads is willing to make a commitment to her beliefs and should be commended for it. Young or old, it is apathy that allows wrongs to exist. Second, as Ani Difranco says, "my tattoos are only as permanent as I am." Enjoy your tattoo Ms Rhoads and any more you may choose to add as, I hope, you live a full life. You're well on your way on the right path: your own!

That is one of the conspiracy theories of the Sanders campaign. An earlier one was that the Clinton campaign bribed Black Lives Matter members to publicly embarrass Bernie Sanders at a rally in Seattle last year. Now that Black Lives Matter is targeting Hillary Clinton, Bernie supporters cheer them on and deny that they ever believed in their earlier conspiracy theory. Conspiracy theories are silly and for the intellectually lazy.

Free health care is not an outrage. The issue is how to manage costs so it doesn't go broke. Obamacare faces some serious problems because cost management was not considered in its implementation. Though it may help, taxing the rich is not the solution. Folks who have done the math claim (based on data from the IRS) that you could tax the rich at 100% and still not generate enough dollars to do all the things that taxing the rich is supposed to do.

This is a not a comment about Mr. Sanders. It is a comment about youth. Saying "never" when you are young is like saying "everything will be ok" when you have no clue as to what will happen. You have no idea how you will feel/think at, say, age 50 or more.
