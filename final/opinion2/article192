When it comes to parenting, Americans reach for the cotton wool

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>f all the things Europeans living in the US like to look down on – the politics, the portion sizes, the lack of socialised public healthcare – the greatest and most long-standing is probably American <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting" title="">parenting</a>. It starts before birth, with a level of prenatal fussing that even the most neurotic Brit would find oppressive, from whence it’s a quick ride through every shade of hand-wringing to this: more than once in New York I have heard a mother admonish her child mid-tantrum with the words, “You’re making Mommy feel bad.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/feb/20/child-safety-packs-social-housing">Child safety packs help protect vulnerable children in social housing</a> </p>

<p>One manifestation of this approach is the parenting consultant. Since there is almost nothing in this city you can’t outsource to someone else, consultants naturally exist for everything from lactation to sleep, food, speech, clothing, crying and movement. When my children were 11 months old, I remarked to an acquaintance that they weren’t yet walking, causing her to widen her eyes, tear a page from her notebook and advise me to take them forthwith to her movement guy - “a good paediatric physiotherapist”.</p>

<p>Still, it is impossible to live in a country for more than a few years and not feel one’s compass readjusting. After reading one too many Facebook scare stories about <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/23/ikea-safety-alert-after-two-children-killed-by-falling-chest-of-drawers" title="">Ikea drawers falling on toddlers</a>, I bit the bullet last week and called a safety consultant to come and fix up my apartment.</p>

<p>Yes, I know; why not just take a handful of $100 bills and set fire to them in the street? A friend from upstate <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> once paid a man to safety-proof her house and only came to her senses when he concluded that she needed to “move the staircase” and quoted her $5,000 for the job.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with some resentment that I opened the door to a man I was sure would, within the hour, be advising me to rip out my bath and build a wall around the oven. But then he opened his mouth and I burst out laughing. French! If the American parent of popular imagination spends her time duct-taping cotton wool around little Johnny, the French equivalent is letting Jean-Jacques play on the motorway, throwing him bits of unpasteurised cheese when he’s hungry.</p>

<p>I asked Monsieur if the job he did existed in Paris and he looked sad. No, he said; whenever he went home they mocked him for pandering to American neuroses. When he pointed out to his brother-in-law that had he fixed the sharp corners on his coffee table his son wouldn’t have ripped open his forehead when he tripped, the man shrugged and said, “But he won’t do it again.” (He did do it again, said the consultant; a few weeks later.) In spite of this professional caution, he was still, at the end of the day, French, and after fixing my bookcases and TV to the wall, suggested I leave the door to the play-yard open, so the babies could crawl out and explore. “Falling is learning,” he said, wisdom so soothing it should have its own branch of consultancy.</p>

<p>I flew to Colorado for a night last week, which meant that, for one 24-hour period, I was more in the air than on the ground. That kind of turnaround is grim, but this trip came after a fortnight of back-to-back illness in my household such that for a few days there wasn’t a clean sheet or pair of pyjamas in the house. It’s a measure of sleep deprivation when eight hours on United feels like a spa break. Happiness really is drinking coffee while no one throws up on you.</p>

<p>This has been a bad week for caving in to impulses. After holding out for a year, I finally bought a “lifetime membership” at the baby gym, cheaper than individual classes but still eye-wateringly overpriced given what it is – a soft play area presided over by some git with a tambourine. To get our money’s worth I will be insisting my children attend once weekly until they’re at least 45. If it screws them up – there’s a guy for that.</p>

No, in fact it was Roosevelt bending (to the point of breaking) the Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1937. The US population did NOT want to get involved in yet another European war.

I think what this is about is a certain demographic type of Brit associating with their US equivalent and assuming they are as representative of the US as they (mistakenly) imagine themselves to be of the UK.

As the children get older, the parents redress this 'cotton wool' treatment by giving them access to guns.

Anyone can skew statistics by excluding certain groups. Want to see what the UK statistics look like if we exclude say, all people on lower than median income? Or all people from post-industrial towns? Your comparison is meaningless because you are comparing a single group from one population (white Americans), with the entire population of another country.

So what? In the UK, obesity is primarily a problem associated with poor people. Should we exclude them from our statistics too and see who 'wins' then?

Of course I know about the Balkans wars, which is why I explicitly referred to them (the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade). To quote you -- Did that not ring any bells with you? Seriously? But how US/ NATO bombing and no-fly zones in the Balkans (it really is a reach to say the US 'sorted Europe out' on that occasion) -- render unacceptable snide commentary by a British journalist about US parenting remains obscure.

For an American to complain that the US is constantly lectured by Europeans seems a touch hypocritical bearing in mind how America lectures, acts and is perceived around the world.

Lend-Lease was Roosevelt chucking a few crumbs at the UK while waiting for the moment to join the war when it suited him.

Are you talking about the Lend-Lease Plan, where we "leased" material for pennies on the dollar, and loaned you the money to pay that at ridiculously low interest rates? FDR resorted to that because the country had absolutely no interest in all in getting involved in the never-ending European war.

Tens of thousands of the wealthiest. About 50% of the elite in politics, law, the military etc boarded. How many would do do if they could afford to? Ten times as many, perhaps. However, the numbers are only partly relevant - my point is this is a country where it is often considered a great thing to send your kids off to board from 9-18 years old. It speaks volumes about certain, widespread, national attitudes to parenting.

The one thing clearly wrong with that meme is that the people who ran round taking risks as children and living to tell the tale are the same ones who are exercising extreme caution with their own children. So by the meme's own logic, we shouldn't be rushing to congratulate them for their supposed risk-taking qualities.

Under NHS care and monitoring of developmental milestones, your kids wouldn't be not walking at 18 months or not talking properly at 3 without being picked up, and specialist help put in place long before that.

It's not about distance in miles. It's about distance in language, culture, way of life, how a country works, politics ........... Anywhere you go in the US they speak English (mostly anyway) the culture is similar, the attitudes are similar, the education systems don't differ much, the people are "American." Travel widely in Europe and do half the mileage and you find enormous differences between countries.

The differences in standards of parenting, even within a couple, can be a real eye-opener. I'm a believer in the "Well, they're still alive, aren't they?" method of parenting.

The high obesity rate in America is because of our large Black & Hispanic population -- which represent about 1/3 of our total population.

Seeing as Emma Brockes has used her own experience to describe American parenting, I am going to use mine to prove she is wrong. A good friend of mine (Scottish) lives in the USA with her husband (American) and their two children. She is the worrier, reader of every manual going, frightened by the latest health scare and fretting if she thinks the children have not reached every developmental and educational stage when the experts say that they should. He is much more relaxed and worries far less. So, Americans don't reach for cotton wool any more than anyone else. I've proved the writer of the article wrong.
