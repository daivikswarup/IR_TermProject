Buoyant SNP faces down the economic apocalypse

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>henever it seemed during the independence referendum campaign that the lights might go out on the union, many of its supporters in the UK commentariat deployed a well-worn strategy. They all began to spin a well-rehearsed narrative that talked of blood on the streets of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a> teetering on the brink of anarchy as mobs of violent Nationalist extremists roamed from town to town seeking out the first born of unionist families.</p>

<p>That a state of martial law was not declared and that tanks didn’t appear once more in Glasgow’s George Square was only down to the kind indulgence of prime minister David Cameron. At any moment during the frenetic last few days of the campaign I was expecting to be offered counselling to help me come to terms with the distressing scenes around me.</p>

<p>The reality was somewhat different. A two-year festival of democracy took place in Scotland that resulted in the highest turnout ever for a UK political vote and thousands of people having scales lifted from their eyes. It was this that seemed to perturb unionist-supporting commentators most. The very idea that politics might be conducted from below and not from above and that they weren’t the sole arbiters of what was good for the rest of us was causing attacks of apoplexy to break out in the palaces of the right in this country.</p>

<p>Supporters of a Yes vote were routinely depicted as tribal and unstable, while the unionists were coolly detached, rising above the chaos with their calm reasoning. Often though, as the weeks ticked down towards 18 September, it was unionist supporters I witnessed beginning to lose touch with reality. It was during these crucial last few weeks of the referendum campaign that the Labour party in Scotland began to wither and die. The sight of Alistair Darling, Gordon Brown, John Reid and Jim Murphy seeming to display more passion for preserving the ancient rights of the Westminster privileged few than they ever did for social justice was distressing.</p>

<p>To observe Labour supporters rejoicing with Conservatives as the outcome became clear sealed the party’s fate for at least a generation to come. It seems that this party has learned nothing from the lessons of the independence referendum. And the fanaticism that they routinely ascribe to independence supporters seems now to have become the preserve of the opponents of Scottish nationalism.</p>

<p>As the SNP headed for the banks of the river Clyde this weekend and its annual spring conference its gas ought to have been set at a peep. The year thus far hasn’t been kind to the SNP government. The absence of anything radical and innovative in its policy-making has been manifest most starkly in big departments such as health, education and justice, each of whose hapless ministerial incumbents looks like they are being overwhelmed by the sheer scale of its responsibilities.</p>

<p>Its role in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/08/government-faces-sunday-trading-defeat-after-snp-flip-flop" title="">defeating extended Sunday opening hours in England and Wales</a> while permitting the same in Scotland is breathtaking in its hypocrisy while its proposed n<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/15/nicola-sturgeon-big-sister-criticism-named-person-scheme" title="">amed person legislation</a> is simply sinister. Last week’s GERS (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/12/scotland-deficit-12bn-alex-salmond-damages-case-independence-economy-oil-revenues-fall" title="">Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland</a>) numbers seemed to deal a significant blow to the economic case for independence.</p>

<p>Instead of feeling downbeat and subdued however, the party was approaching Glasgow’s Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre with a spring in its step, much of it caused by the misjudgment and absence of critical awareness of its main opponents in Scotland. The SNP performs best when its dander is up and when its supporters believe it is the victim of the usual unionist mass hysteria when any economic forecast does not exactly predict a bowl of cherries.</p>

<p>To observe the reaction to the GERS figures was to wonder if the end of the world had been averted by the vote to remain part of the United Kingdom. The figures, which were first published as a Tory wheeze in the early 1990s to show that Scotland exists only via the benevolence of London, showed that North Sea oil revenues fell drastically between 2013-14 and 2014-15, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-35757787" title="">leading to a deficit of £14.9bn</a>. Depending on how deep your unionism goes, this was either a cause for wild rejoicing or an opportunity to gloat. Some in the Scottish Labour party (Standing Up For Scotland) filled their boots and did both.</p>

<p>In the media, there was a contest among splash headline writers to deploy the most apocalyptic word with which to greet the GERS figures. Some economic snake oil salesmen actually make money selling street corner analyses of the figures to the foaming wing of the unionist cause. Nowhere in the so-called analysis was it pointed out that these figures are for a single year; that economic forecast is better conducted over 10 years; that Scotland’s economy over the last 10 years has been robust and that they are, as Dr Neil McGarvey of Strathclyde University’s School of Government and Public Policy pointed out, “by no means definitive measurements of what Scotland’s public accounts would look like”.</p>

<p>Preceding the economic forecasts had been another extended bout of Scottish self-loathing as columns of the usual suspects emerged to suggest that this politically vibrant, outward-looking and educated country was incapable of producing a nightly, one-hour BBC news bulletin. Meanwhile, <em>Question Time </em>on Thursday night seemed to have tracked down every Tory voter on Tayside when it visited Dundee and shoehorned them into what passed for a “balanced” audience.</p>

<p>The Scottish Labour party haemorrhaged support to the SNP because, thanks to Brown, Darling and Murphy, it morphed into the Conservative party for the two years prior to the referendum. To witness the unrestrained cheerleading for the union that broke out on Labour’s Holyrood benches when the GERS figures were being debated at first minister’s questions last Thursday was to know that this party is still scrabbling about in the dark, looking for its moral compass.</p>

<p>Would that many of them had shown as much passion about the deep social inequality and real divisions in society that their beloved union has brought to the lives of Britain’s poorest and most vulnerable citizens.</p>

The unionists and nationalists are never going to agree on the case for independence, that is obvious!Mainly this is due to the lack of information due to the fact that the figures are able to be twisted and limited in their production!When UK companies publish annual figures they have to internally know the figures for business and profits on a regional basis!All companies have these figures so make it law that they have to publish them!Seems like a solution not only to the indi issue but also to the situation of non payment of tax by Multinationals.Indeed westminster is calling for this clarity from multinationals to declare profits in the UK,but not within the UK!I wonder why?For example are Scottish exports being counted as ruk exports because they leave from an English port?

The named person thing is actually part of a progressive set of social policies that puts the principles of child-led care and early intervention at the heart of the Scottish legal system. The message is simply this: children's rights to a safe upbringing trump parental rights to parent entirely behind closed doors. It also accepts the truth that sometimes parents are not best placed to spot abuse when it is taking place. It will hopefully help prevent all sorts of horrible crimes against children, from Jimmy Saville to Rochdale child abuse ring to Catholic Preist child abuse. It will also help protect the many invisible victims of neglect who currently slip through the cracks. This is about transparent parenting and preventing children becoming isolated and vulnerable. Not so much "If you have done nothing wrong you have nothing to fear" more "Take responsibility for being a parent, because if you don't, someone else will". The middle-class fears of the policy echo the working-class fears of the old Social Services. But we all know "they took my children, I didn't do anything wrong" was an excuse almost exclusively used by bad parents who didn't look after their kids.

The reaction to the recent GERS figures of those who insist that Scotland had a lucky escape when it voted against independence seem to have missed one vital point which is of course that the state of Scotland’s economy is actually a direct consequence of the existing constitutional settlement.

It is not the last ten years that are important for the Scottish economy, it is the next ten years,interest rates and oil prices will remain low for the foreseeable future.It remains an inconvenient truth for the S.N.P. and Sturgeon but Scotland needs the rest of the U.K. if only to keep paying her salary of £144,687. to allow her to portray herself as one of the ordinary Scottish people.

The first, is the actual situation.The title accidentally gave the Unionist Right scope to misrepresent and go to town on their fake agenda.However, it is not to do with judgments. The scheme is to stop officials shrugging shoulders, buckpassing, dodging duties, assuming others should act etc etc. Theold problem of everyone's responsibility being no one's responsibility. It simply makes sure that (only) as and when a child has formal contact with the system - at any time - someone is defined as having the responsibility and accountability of discharging the system's duty of care.

There is absolutely no issue with scotland using the £. There never was. The issue was with scotland using the £ IN A CURRENCY UNION WITH RUK. There was never going to be a currency union. When i want to go to France i have to buy the euros i want to use, France doesnt just give them to me. Similarly, an independent scotland would have to buy the currency reserves to use the £ if thats what it wanted to use. That has a set up cost of £140 bn. There would be absolutely no problem rUK selling you £140 bn worth of sterling. No problem whatsoever. Carney was 100% right. Your problem is you dont understand the difference between using the £ and using the £ as part of a currency union. It isnt within the governors gift to give away currency unions to foreign states. If you remember, every potential chancellor said no. And with no oil revenue there isnt a single economic case for rUK to enter a currency union with an independent scotland. There was never a remote political argument.

You just continue waiting for something which I suspect you don't really want. The rest of us former SLabour voters will continue to vote for social democratic based parties like the SGreens and the SNP - the latter who have been proven to be far more competent in government than Labour ever were, and who also have an unerring knack of 'doing the right thing' to benefit the Scottish people as a whole rather than first considering what is best for the respective UK London-based party apparatuses before proceeding.

Oil, good for Britain, bad for Scotland. This argument is trotted out regularly. Unfortunately it does seem that oil is over and unlike the Norwegians we have no sovereign wealth fund to help us fondly remember the good times. Our oil was squandered in order to lubricate Mrs Thatcher`s economic miracle. The "hordes of crypto-Fascist" nationalists narrative was wheeled out again at the general election by the likes of Laura Kunnesburg and Alex Thomson, that is wearing thin too.The direction of travel is toward independence I believe though it may take a few more years. The economic arguments are important. The effects of Globalisation on Scottish industry ( and the north of England ) are of little importance to the Tories and they continue to protect the City of London and the spivs.I have no idea what the Labour Party in Scotland are up to, Kezia is a Blairite like her predecessor Jim Murphy and she seems very uncomfortable with Jeremy Corbyn. Labour in Scotland are associated with the Big Money which Tony, Gordon and Alistair have enthusiastically embraced. People around the Western world are alive to this poison and that is what the new politics is about, Labour don`t seem to have grasped that.

It is always amazing the blindness with which Unionists arguing that Scotland is dependent is some kind of positive argument for the Union. If the Union can only do this well after 308 years, it is time for Scotland tt resume doing better itself. Not hard to improve on Westminster and Whitehall blundering incompetence, corruption and paedophilia.

Welcome to the new Greece ran by the same people who invested and managed the Darien. NHS spending would have to be cut by 30%, Schools would only open 3 days a week pensions slashed by 30%. Welcome to the new world, Oh as there is no real constitution its a one party state backed by a single police force. Scotland was very, very lucky on the 18th September 2015, the Scottish electorate are not stupid they can see a good deal when they see one. As for the argument that you have to look over the whole economic cycle, garbage what would happen the Nats would spend all the cash in the good years and run a deficit when the bad years occurred there would be nothing left in the bag.

I think that what the majority of posters here are missing is that Scotland voted No to allow our economy to managed by Westminster. So, they're doing a poor job, what's new?, comparing the economy in Scotland to say Denmark (per cap GDP) shows our economy since the demise of our industry since 1945 has been badly managed with continual decline.Who's surprised?...I'm certainly notThe UK economy has a set of economic policies designed to suit the financial services industry that's why the North and Scotland are in decline, Scotland less so as it also has a strong financial sector.I voted yes too...not because as the unionist parties accused it would be a land of milk and honey, Xanadu etc but one where we could have economic policies bespoke for Scotland's businesses. Nothing has changed. If Scotland isn't fit to be an independent country then either us the UK given the deficits it has a rung up and debt of what £1.6trillion?Scotland needs to find a way to get rid if the tories permanently if that means Scotland has one bad year out if 30......with indy I'd say that was a result I'd be pretty happy with given the UK economy has been in deficit for 28 of the last thirty years.
