The decline of Germany’s SPD is a stark warning to Labour’s Blairites

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>n Monday morning the oldest German political party, the Social Democrats (SPD), will awake to disastrous local <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/german-voters-to-give-verdict-on-merkels-refugee-policies" title="">election results</a>, unsure what to say. This should come as no surprise because it hasn’t known what to say for the past seven months.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/german-anti-refugee-party-afd-political-earthquake-state-elections">German anti-refugee party targets 'political earthquake' in elections</a> </p>

<p>It has moved so far from their left-of-centre past that it looks like becoming an electoral irrelevance. For those British Labour rebels who are critical of Jeremy Corbyn’s leftwing revolution, there is a warning here of what can happen when a party loses track of its purpose.</p>

<p>Germany faces its biggest turmoil since the post-unification years and after the elections a new political landscape is expected. The youngest German party, the far-right Alternative for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany">Germany</a> (AfD), is likely to celebrate a big victory, and Angela Merkel’s ruling CDU will have lost a lot of voters. But it will be the old aunt, the SPD, that has the biggest electoral hangover. Even if they win the state of Rheinland Pfalz, where they currently govern alone, there are still two big disasters on the horizon: the elections in the eastern state of Sachsen-Anhalt and in Baden Württemberg in the west; in both the SPD is a governing partner. On Monday they are likely to be left as a minor party with around 15% of the vote, in fourth place behind the CDU, the AfD, the Green party in the west and the Left party in the east.</p>

<p>It’s a big drama. In 14 of 16 federal states, the SPD is part of the government; in nine of them, head of state. So historically it has been not only the oldest but also the most powerful party. Not for much longer. One reason is that all other parties, apart from the AfD, now speak like Social Democrats when it comes to the hot topics of gender equality, racism and immigration. Left and right have both shifted to the centre, a space the SPD used to occupy, so it is left with nowhere to sit. Currently it keeps staggering from one policy to another, with no clear direction.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel</a> has placed her CDU, formerly known as a conservative party, a little left of centre and she is still well-respected because her politics are perceived as distinct and consistent. Her famous one-liners – “we will manage that” and “nothing will be closed here at all” – are striking in their simplicity. Next to her, the Social Democrats come across as clowns.</p>

<p>Andrea Nahles, the secretary of labour, seems intent on saying exactly what voters don’t want to hear from a Social Democrat: “Basically, I am a conservative.” And the vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, twists himself in knots to the point where it’s unclear if even he knows what he is trying to say. When he visited Heidenau, where the first clashes between militant demonstrations and police took place over refugees, he managed to make even rightwing militants look smart by playing to mob mentality.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/german-voters-to-give-verdict-on-merkels-refugee-policies">Merkel faces key test of refugee policies in German regional elections</a> </p>

<p>His next intervention was to say that it was up to German voters to decide how many refugees the country should take in. This new-found love of direct democracy was a surprise – Gabriel had never thought to ask voters how much the minimum wage should be or how much the government should spend on football for public television. And just as it seemed his desperation to attract rightwing votes could sink no further, last week he proposed a new care programme for German citizens – to demonstrate that the government was not just concerned with the wellbeing of refugees.</p>

<p>The SPD could be facing the same situation as Merkel’s previous coalition partner, the FDP: first it was voted out of state governments, then out of the national parliament.</p>

<p>The problem is whether anyone would care? Since the SPD government of Gerhard Schröder the party has been hardline even on social issues. It was the SPD that created <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/01/germany-hartz-reforms-inequality" title="">the highly controversial Hartz-4-programme</a>, slashing benefits for the long-term unemployed, which was even criticised by the UN. Now the SPD is a nothing, an empty shell of a party. And being a nothing at a time when the far right is growing is not something anybody wants to cheer for. The SPD is left to hope that the hysteria of the AfD politicians fades before they do.</p>

<p>Perhaps – looking at the history of rightwing parties in the last 25 years – they will get lucky.</p>

the real cause of the suffocating consensus in German politics is the domination of politics, the media and academia by a sanctimonious and self-serving elite of persons with higher education (a lot like Britain ;-) ..... this has lead to a disengagement by those outside this charmed circle, reflected in the low participation in elections.... in the 1950's and 1960's there were still many SPD politicians who were of and from the people

German politics is consensus driven to a degree that is unimaginable in Britain, all the parties (the CDU, SPD, the Greens and die Linken) have the same positions on immigration, gender politics, the environment.Organised labour and the traditional working class, the traditional mainstays of the SPD, are a declining electoral force and many indigenous working class persons have little in common with SPD activists who are way to the left of them on issues like immigration and gender politics.However, Krap should not gloat prematurely...the same fate awaits the Greens, die Linken and the CDU if they continue to alternately ignore and browbeat large sections of the electorate

Agreed. Labour does need to do a lot more to make itself electable, however, in my opinion, there is a balance to be had here. Two principle points made in the article are that 1) the SPD 'has moved so far from its historical purpose; and 2) that Merkel's message is both distinct and consistent. Bearing in mind that Labour was born from the Trade Union movement and socialist parties, it would be fair to say that Corbyn is returning Labour to its historical purpose. There was nothing 'distinct' about what Blair did to move the Party to the same ground as the Tories and make it 'much of a muchness' with them. However, where Labour is making its mistake at the moment is that their policies currently lack coherence and so the message is lost (not distinct), they're not opposing effectively and raising their game accordingly and their approach is not consistent. So, yes, there is a lot for Labour to learn from this article and the German experience - much work is needed to prevent them from being an irrelevance at the next election. Sometimes it's not what is being said that matters, it's the way that it's being said that matters more!

Although the conditions for this to happen need to be very extreme. In Spain the 'radical' left is struggling following their not so good performance at the general election and in improvements in the Spanish economy. In Greece, well it's a very Greek specific issue as we know and the reality is they have kowtowed to the ECB and Merkel I the same way as any Centre Right or Centre Left would have.

I don't see taking in migrants as irrational. I think there are sound geopolitical reasons for Germany to do so, as long as you keep the numbers at a manageable level. I do agree with you that the German elites simply don't care enough about the poor, about wealth disparity in their own country, and their way of interacting with poorer people who feel threatened by the migrant influx is absolutely dysfunctional, if not dangerous. The levels of dissatisfaction are simply not high enough in the population yet. Most people have work, even if it is less well paid and less secure than a generation ago, the streets are pretty safe, food, housing, public transport, education are affordable for most people. In this climate, most people will tolerate an additional mosque or two. But the government has to wake up to the concerns of the poorer part of the population, and the squeezed middle class, before the next economic downturn. And they need to stop talking down to AFD voters. That's the road to a German Donald Trump.

I can't believe the SPD was still the strongest force in Bremen though. They did not lose badly enough. I understand that the AFD is not popular in Bremen, but they could do with a change of leadership after voting for the SPD in EVERY election since the war. Bremen is lovely, but the local government could probably learn a thing or two from Greece.

The German SPD has nothing to do with socialism, the working class or the poor. Its founders and heroes are spinning in their graves. The SPD's march to the Right has been a long one (Schroeder, mini Blair, too, has to do with it): but it has speeded up in the last eight years. The party today is led by the same crowd, the same rigid, narrow minded, German provincials, which dominate the Green Party. What used to be a mass party is rapidly becoming an irrelevant religious sect (like the increasingly right-wing Greens). The SPD is pro-free market; supported the banks' bailout and the colonization of Greece; loves the NATO; has not problem with German military involvement in Syria and Afghanistan; supported and most likely participated the coup in Ukraine. It has contributed mightily to Germany's international isolation. The SPD is behind Germany's disastrous immigration policy, which has destroyed the EU; the stifling of debates at home, the kind of censorship and self censorship, which does not exist anywhere else in Western and East-Central Europe.

Fully agree with Suleika. Der Spiegel is not a broadsheet. Their international edition is somewhat better than the quality of their other online content, but Sueddeutsche is still the best left leaning paper out there. As for moving with events, the other German papers had similar headlines about Germany being isolated in Europe due to Merkel's handling of the refugee crisis.

Schroeder's reforms at least reduced unemployment. I agree about Gabriel, though. "What do I care about the nonsense I spouted yesterday" (Nietzsche) could have been written for him.

That Labour, beginning with Attlee in 1946, have made the running, against the interests of the class they claim to represent, in supporting mass immigration, firstly from the Commonwealth, latterly from the EU, has meant that Conservative Party has, up to now, been unfairly blessed with the mantle of being an anti immigration party. The rise of UKIP has shown that many voters are beginning to see that the Conservatives are not the anti immigration party they thought it was. Shame that Labour have not learnt the lesson either.

This is what bothers me. Why would a country treat outsiders better than its own citizens? Germany is not unique in that, although they seem more extreme. Helping outside world is charity, taking care of one's own should be primary responsibility.

My late brother had paid into the system for 35 years - but then he became unemployed, on Hartz 4. There was nothing for him, he died in unclear circumstances in Berlin in 2008. When I look at the billions spent on immigrants I wonder why my brother was a second class citizen in his own country, used for paying only. Was hard to find this all out after the event - and If I hadn't been so sceptical with the lawyer who contacted me, I might have had to repay Hartz4, despite the fact that the government had already pocketed the value of our land in the former East Berlin. Germans have no sense of fairness and proportionality, but then again I knew that in 1981 when I filled in the forms to come to Australia.

Unfortunately itstwo parties under one umbrella: the oldfashioned SED of yesteryear a n d a pro-gressive leftist party. So as long as theydon't agree on a common ground they'llremain a splinter group with no chanceto attract more voters for its progressives!
