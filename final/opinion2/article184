Just what we need: an emergency service for dieters




DateTime::::2016-02-11T15:51:10+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> friend just started a diet called the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ffactor.com/" title="">F-Factor</a>: a low-carb, high-fibre programme a little like the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/feb/11/health.medicineandhealth" title="">Atkins diet</a>, but revolving around “eight Scandinavian crackers a day”. It’s not a new thing – its inventor, Tanya Zuckerbrot, has been running her Manhattan diet clinic for almost a decade. But the F-Factor book is powering back up the charts this month because it is the regime we have to thank for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/27/megyn-kelly-donald-trump-fox-news-debate-roger-ailes" title="">Megyn Kelly</a> – Fox News presenter, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y9_LJj7A68" title="">Trump-vanquisher</a> and unlikely heroine of the hour, who is also quite thin and likes to talk about why.</p>

<p>Every few years a new iteration of the diet industry comes along that, as reliably as hemlines and house prices, tells us something of the age we live in. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/18/paleo-diet-critics-science" title="">The Paleo diet </a>is finally starting to wane, and in its place comes a slew of raw detox diets, smoothie cleanses and, I see, something called the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/12/16/bone-broth-benefits.aspx" title="">Bone Broth Diet</a>, which is doing very well in the US and promises to erase your wrinkles as well as help you lose weight. (Who knows, if it’s as miserable as it sounds, perhaps it works by throwing the rest of your life into joyful relief.)</p>

<p>The F-Factor, when you look into it, is more like a branch of life-coaching than a diet. You can buy the book and make the recipes. Or, for $10,000, you can access the premium service, which comes with a raft of counselling sessions, a walk-through of your local supermarket with a dietitian, and a home visit by someone who will go through your cupboards and confront you with the half-finished jar of Nutella you’ve hidden, the curve of a spoon mark still in it.</p>

<p>It also offers 24/7 access to Zuckerbrot herself, should you find yourself in a dieting emergency. For example, if you’re in a restaurant, you can call her in a panic and she will scan the menu online and tell you what to avoid. This service genuinely exists.</p>

<p>There are, you might think, cheaper and more sensible ways to decide what to eat; but one of the hallmarks of gym and diet culture at the moment is having a person on hand to hold you accountable. Meanwhile, I tried one of the crackers this week and it wasn’t that bad; like industrial Ryvita. Worked well as a vehicle for peanut butter.</p>

<p>For most of us, the pendulum swings wildly between self-denial and self-indulgence. When I first moved to the US nine years ago, the most decadent thing I could think to do was to ring the deli at two in the morning and ask for a can of Coke to be brought to my door. (I never actually did it; I was far too hung up on what the delivery man would think of me. But the idea that I could do it boggled my mind.)</p>

<p>How old-fashioned that now seems. Door-to-door delivery is the universal standard; the premium service is delivery inside a two-hour window, which is what the Amazon Prime Now app promises within certain zip codes in Manhattan. You’d think it would only cover a small list of items, given the price of warehousing in greater New York. But no. I’m ashamed to admit this, but I recently bought a child’s pink, Minnie Mouse-branded sofa, which arrived at my door 90 minutes after I ordered it. I’m inclined to eat bone broth for a week to atone.</p>

<p>Overheard on a cell phone yesterday, a woman who started her sentence with the word “honestly”, intoned as a question in a way that could only spell trouble for whoever she was talking to. It is one of those openers one uses when trying to contain rage within a shell of civility. “Don’t take this the wrong way”; “Can I just say?”; “I’m not being funny, but”; and, the mother of all passive-aggressive intros, “with respect”, which is only ever followed by a piece of monstrous impertinence – the empty calories of human exchange.</p>

You realise that there is a difference between someone with a disease (diabetes, which interestingly has a huge genetic component regardless of diet) and normal functioning?

Not all calories are the same - and different source of calories have different hormonal responses from the body. This is a very important point which you're missing.

You realise that there is a difference between someone with a disease (diabetes, which interestingly has a huge genetic component regardless of diet) and normal functioning? The vast majority of the population regulates their temperature between 36 and 38 degrees incredibly well. A small proportion with hypothalamic disease don't. That doesn't mean we aren't incredibly good at controlling our body temperatures. There are 3 million people with diabetes in the UK. There are 65 million people. That means 96.4% of the population regulates their insulin and glucose perfectly despite eating biscuits, sugar and cake.

We are incredibly fine autoregulators of insulin and glucose.

Oh good god, have you ever actually been outside and observed nature? Go for a walk in the countryside in summer and you'll see horses, cows and sheep fat as barrels from overeating grass. A wild ruminant that doesn't turn grass into fat stores during summer is going to starve to death in winter. Go further afield (or turn on your TV) and see the Serengeti- there are female lionesses that look like portly labradors during the migration because food is so easy to get hold of. I'll email you a picture of my cat if you like- who as I said has only ever eaten biologically appropriate food and has to now be fed measured portions in a cage because otherwise he wolfs his down and eats the other cats food too (and then he bellow all day for more food, even though he's in no way starving). Every part of us is designed to seek out and store extra calories, because the animals that could do that survived when there was food scarcity and the ones that didn't died (google the "thrifty gene theory"- it will be a revelation for you). The only limitation in the wild is how easy it is to do that in terms of the constraints of eating on your other daily activities and whether (if you are a predator) you can still hunt and if you can still escape danger (if you are prey).

I didn't say the gut but the digestive system as a whole. 



Author::::latenightreader
DateTime::::2016-02-12T22:18:45Z
A cow's gut isn't capable of supporting such a high insulin load? Your digestive system doesn't have to support insulin, because hormones are released into the blood not the gut in response to raised glucose levels in the blood (again not the gut). And insulin is released in response to anything that produces glucose (including your body's own internal gluconeogenesis) not just "inappropriate food". If a cow's pancreas couldn't deal with producing enough insulin for the food it was eating, it wouldn't get fat, it would get thin- very fast, and very dehydrated as without insulin you just pee out all the glucose (causing an osmotic diuresis) instead of using insulin to help you store it as fat. That's why one of the symptoms of diabetes is weight loss.

A cow gets fat because it eats excessive calories. Not because it is eating food that is biologically inappropriate for it-



Author::::latenightreader
DateTime::::2016-02-12T21:02:10Z
No, you still don't seem to understand it. A cow gets fat because it eats excessive calories. Not because it is eating food that is biologically inappropriate for it- in fact if you eat something completely inappropriate for your species, for example if I sat down and ate a kilo of hay, I'd gain no weight at all because I completely lack the facilities to break down cellulose.

'd suggest you visit the definition of grass (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass) which includes cereals. And also the definition of grains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain) which includes things like beans which chimpanzees eat.

OK, if you want to talk about animals and their diet, I recommend you look at what BARF means. It stands for biologically appropriate raw food. Which means my cat eats no "junk" cat food, no "processed crap"- he eats raw meat, bones, green tripe, heart, liver, kidneys. And he's still overweight and has health problems, because there is no magic diet that can override genes and environmental factors.

When I was a child, I used to ask for "Popeye food" all the time. My parents still tease me about it now. They especially like to do it in front of house guests, with a really weird voice. (Come on, I am sure I didn't sound like THAT!)

My cat is overweight, asthmatic and has severe dental disease. He's also been on a grain-free BARF diet all his life. Unfortunately the theory that grains are the source of all evils in modern life (for animals or people) just doesn't pan out either anecdotally or in decent studies.

Wrong some people are more at risk of getting fat due to genes, some people have slower metabolism some people ,e have larger appetites, some people's brains crave sugary or fatty foods more than others. Some are disabled so can't exercise or are on certain medications that encourage weight gain. Yes self discipline and exercise are laudable and we should probably all make healthier choices, and certainly most of us need to be more active but it really isn't as simple as you infer.

But most people crave foods that are not good for them. I have yet to hear someone craving a plate of spinach. I love spinach and eat it nearly every day. I don't crave it though. Fortunately I have pretty much lost my sweet tooth but when I had it I would often crave something sugary. If we only craved healthy food we wouldn't have an obesity epidemic.

To be fair we all chose to spend our free time as we see fit, you play in a band, others will decide to work out, if playing in a band is more enjoyable and important to you than exercise that is fine. But that is also a choice you have made. We can all make excuses but really it boils down to is what we prioritise.

People might consume artificial sweeteners because they think it will help them curb real-sugar consumption and prevent weight gain, but the chemicals may actually have an opposite effect. A new study has found that zero-calorie sweeteners may alter metabolism and increase blood-sugar levels, at least in mice and some people.

So unless someone eats exactly the same as you you won't cater for them? What about people with food allergies or people who dislike shellfish. I didn't realise we all had to eat exactly the same. I don't expect anyone to cater for me, just don't be offended if I don't eat what's on offer.

Working out takes maybe 45 minutes out of your day. You don't need to be living a life of leisure to fit it in. Get up an hour early or stop playing Candy Crush or Farmville or posting on here or FB etc. Go for a run instead.

Good sarcasm.Dieting is all a pile of shit. People coming up with get-rich schemes, portraying them as no-fail diet answers to idiots' neuroses. The answer is simple. Exercise self-discipline. Eat less. Move more. There are no excuses. If you are eating more than 2000 calories a day, and spending the day sitting on your arse, it will definitely get fatter.It isn't your genes. It isn't fate. It's down to your personal responsibility - or lack of it!There are no easy solutions. Put down that kebab. Put down that big bar of Galaxy. Put down that family bag of crisps. Put down those chocolate Hobnobs. Put down that glass of beer/wine/alcopop. Take control of your life. Don't rely on magic solutions. All they do is further enrich already-rich people who are ripping the piss out of you.

What is silly is claiming the paleo diet is 2 million years old. It's not. It is basically taking a principle (grains are new therefore grains are bad) and trying to fit science (of which there is little reliable data- and I say that as someone who studied nutritional anthropology as part of my undergraduate) around that.

Too true. I once shared an office with a lady who was on a permanent quest to lose weight, but never seemed to, which puzzled me as she always had such healthy lunches. She said once that she was OK in work because there was nothing else but her healthy lunch to eat, but confessed that at home, if she got a craving, she could demolish whole packets of biscuits, complete boxes of chocolates - and the one which amazed me the most as I struggle to even eat a whole one - a box of 3 magnums in one go. I'm glad I seem to have an in-built off switch and feel sorry for people who don't, or don't feel sick when they eat a lot and can't resist eating a lot. They must be miserable a lot of the time. She was, she though about food almost constantly.

I sincerely doubt you eat a paleo diet as eaten 2 million years ago. The geographical range of Australopithecus (which is who was around 2 million years ago) was pretty spread out across Eastern, central and southern Africa (so whose paleo diet are you following? The Ethiopian end or the South African end?) so unless you spend your life eating kudu and chimpanzee, you aren't eating a paleo diet as per 2 million years ago. Not to mention the fact that the "early" human diet shifted enormously as evidenced by huge changes to the skull and teeth.
