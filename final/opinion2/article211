Have we reached the spoiler statute of limitations on Making a Murderer?

<p>An international debate about the efficacy of America’s criminal justice system is taking place, online and in print, under the same two-word heading. Those two words are: spoiler alert.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/11/how-making-murderer-tapped-our-weakness-true-crime-steven-avery">Guilty pleasure: how Making a Murderer tapped into our weakness for true crime</a> </p>

<p>Whether or not you’re taking part depends largely on whether you’ve binged your way through all 10 episodes of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/MakingAMurderer?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author" title="">Making a Murderer</a>, the Netflix documentary series centring on a Wisconsin murder trial (two trials, really, but I’m giving too much away already) that took place almost a decade ago. If you haven’t finished watching it – or haven’t started – then you’re probably going to great lengths to avoid any information that might ruin it for you. If you’re all done, you will almost certainly want to find out what’s become of the main players in the true-crime drama.</p>

<p>I crossed into the latter camp this week, after a three-day marathon, and only now do I realise quite how much of the internet is taken up with the subject. The debate is certainly a compelling one – it’s not so much about who did what, it makes you wonder exactly what the American criminal justice system is for. But it seems like we can’t discuss it openly until some kind of spoiler statute of limitations is reached. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix">Netflix</a> released the whole series in one go last month. How long should we give everyone to catch up?</p>

<p>I have a great urge to divulge all the new stuff I’ve learned in the last 24 hours, but I will settle for passing on two disturbing statistics. The first is that in a country where most local prosecutors are elected officials – and therefore supposedly accountable to voters – around <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4usTpo6fKAhUChQ8KHeGkAh8QFggfMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoritzlaw.osu.edu%2Fosjcl%2FArticles%2FVolume6_2%2FWright-FinalPDF.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgAjkltq8aXmUFerqtyOaUV3m0xQ&amp;sig2=xn3Te5FmWUQJHMkOr1xfCA&amp;bvm=bv.111677986,d.ZWU&amp;cad=rja" title="">85% of incumbents run unopposed</a>. The second is that a quarter of wrongfully convicted people subsequently exonerated by DNA evidence also <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/causes-wrongful-conviction/false-confessions-or-admissions" title="">made a false confession or incriminating statement</a>.</p>

<p>If you feel such prior knowledge may impair your future enjoyment of the series, let me just say that two days ago I would have completely sympathised. Now I’m just impatient. I don’t just recommend Making a Murderer – I recommend you get on with it.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>I went to the local surgery last week for my first routine health check since, well, ever. There was nothing in particular wrong, but I’ve reached an age when it’s embarrassing to have no medical records to speak of.</p>

<p>My wife, who goes to the doctor more consistently, assured me that a modern health check is more like a job interview: you and a nurse sit together at a desk, trying to allay the suspicions of a computer program.</p>

<p>The computer was happy with my blood pressure, and the amount of exercise I pretended to take. When I divulged the number of units I drank weekly it was prompted to ask further questions about my relationship with alcohol. It was a little galling to have to answer them in the middle of a dry January (or mostly dry – I started late and mean to finish early), but I said enough to satisfy the machine.</p>

<p>The computer wasn’t at all happy with my pulse, though. The number “99” brought up a whole new screen. “We’ve just got to go through this checklist to make sure you don’t have sepsis,” said the nurse.</p>

<p>“Sepsis?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Are you on the verge of losing consciousness?” she said. “I’ll just put ‘no’; I can see you aren’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m probably just anxious,” I say. “I’m often anxious.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, slipping a monitor over my forefinger. “But it won’t let me past this screen until we’ve ticked everything off.”</p>

<p>“OK,” I say, thinking how coincidental it would be if my first ever health check landed on the day that all my organs decided to shut down. The monitor on my finger was now saying my pulse was 82.</p>

<p>“Confused?” asked the nurse.</p>

<p>“A little,” I said.</p>

<p>“Slurred speech?”</p>

Tim, your pulse appears to be a case of White Coat Syndrome. Blood pressure and pulse measurements vary greatly during an exam. All of the talking you do with the nurse actually drives up the pulse. But good for you; you actually went in for a health check up! Please make that as regular as the visits to the dentist - you do go, don't you? I need your column to retain a bit of sanity.

Once again, very well stated! For all the reasons you list here, I fail to see how GreenLake's prosecutor friend can blithely state that Avery probably did it. Her prosecutorial bias must be showing, especially given that we're told she'll only admit that there "probably" was room for acquittal on reasonable doubt. Probably? FFS. If her opinion is interesting, to me it's only that insofar as it's an example of how people in the system can be blinded or at least biased.

I know! How the judge did not accept Brendan's request for a new lawyer was mind boggling!! Brendan is asked in court why he wants a new lawyer, and he says "because he does not believe me"! And the Judge is all like "nah, seems legit to me." Whaaaat? Surely, having a lawyer that believes your testimony when you say you are innocent, or fights to have your side heard even if you are pleading guilty is of tantamount importance! How the hell can you win a case if your lawyer himself thinks you did it, sets you up to provide evidence to corroborate the prosecution case, and then says you ought to take a plea? Not to mention allows you, a 16 year old kid, to be interviewed twice (at length) without being present!! That alone should be grounds for a mis-trial.

Absolutely agree with you on your last point; Dean Strang and Jerry Buting, in my opinion, have the kind of integrity and due diligence that you would expect from accomplished, reliable professionals, and I completely concur that I very much doubt that they would so vociferously accept Avery's pleas of innocence if they had a shred of doubt that he could have done it. I just wish Brendan Dassey had such counsel, too. That, for me, was so utterly heart-breaking to watch. How can your own Defence Counsel throw you under the bus like that and effectively do the Prosecutor's work for him (don't even get me started on the D.A)? Len Kachinsky's creepy, smiling face will forever haunt me.

Yeah, I think you and I are pretty much in agreement. Whatever his past conduct and despite some of the facts not mentioned in the documentary that suggest some pretty shady behavior on his behalf, I couldn't see anyway you could say the case against him was proven without a reasonable doubt.

I don't think you can totally dismiss these acts of violence either, however, I absolutely do not think you can use threatening a woman with a gun (allegedly, we only have the word of a woman who happens to be the cousin of the arresting Officer, who are both known to dislike Steven Avery), and an incident of animal cruelty (I've already voiced how horrendous this is) some 20 years prior to give a presumption of guilt in a murder trial. It's absurd to think that these crimes naturally follow on to someone committing murder in the 1st degree.

That was one of the things that made me really angry watching the trial; that the police officers and the guy that drew the picture of Avery, even after knowing the DNA evidence exonerated him of the assault on Pam Beernstein, and because erm hello he was released from prison on the basis of that evidence, when they were being questioned by Avery's lawyers on that, they were still like "ehhh, maybe, but you know, he still could have done it." What in the ever loving fuck??? DNA evidence from a hair collected shows it definitely could NOT have been Avery, and you are sat there, under oath, still trying to insinuate it may have been him!!!! As far as I'm concerned the Judge should have held them in contempt or something. It was deplorable that they were allowed to insinuate that reliable DNA testing could still somehow be wrong and for a Jury (from the same town, with obvious bias against Avery) to hear that. Argh!!

I think the point is cases are only meant to be brought to trial when the prosecution actually believe the accused is guilty and the judge has ruled their is sufficient evidence to warrant a trial.

Good point, and that's not even taking into consideration situations where a defense attorney is not even representing his client's interests, and may even be in cahoots with the prosecution. Does this ring any bells for anyone who's seen the series?



Author::::JohnTy66
DateTime::::2016-01-14T16:05:02Z
No, there is a statute of limitations. Can there never be an article discussing plot points of a movie that's years old, without a blaring "spoiler alert" flashing at the top? At a certain point, surely it's the responsibility of the person trying not to know something, to stay away from certain articles/sources, provided that the title of the work in question is at least in the headline of the article. If I'm recording the Liverpool v Arsenal match but slip up and open the Guardian app and see a scoreline, that's my fault, isn't it? Having said that, since this series has been out less than a month, I suppose spoiler alerts are probably still appropriate.

Exactly! A fire on Halloween night. Who would have thought it? I grew up in the South of the US, where bonfires weren't a big thing, but spent many years living in the upper Midwest where I found it was very common, not just on Halloween, but to have a fire in the backyard on cold nights, especially on the weekend, everyone gathering around with a brew or libation of their choice and bulls****ing or pondering on the meaning of life.

OK, I'll bite. You're the first I've heard in a long time making a joke that American English is not English. Good one. A more obvious question than yours that this poses is this: why does your client persist in asking you questions about a show you haven't seen? Anyway, the answer you can give him is: They live in the US, so they speak American English. It's really not a lot harder to understand for ESL folks than a lot of the thick Brit accents, honestly.

Okay and while you are at it post the jury transcripts from the first rape trial he was convicted of and the Sctt gov. can post the appeals rulings for the rape trial too.This will show us all how the judges skew the verdict any way they chose to protect the system unless they can,t get away with and then they will take credit for doing the right thing.

One of the things that has always confused me about the American (or anglo-saxon) judicial system is how it is run along a for/against set-up. I am not sure this is the best way to go about things, in so far as you have two individuals (lawyer v prosecutor) trying to win their case it resembles a debate where a person's life hangs on the balance. We could move towards a system that is impartial and attempts at getting to the truth of the matter without this for/against framework.

Exactly! They had their sights on stringing him up ever since the incident where he ran his cousin off the road. Admittedly, this was a pretty crazy thing to do, but it's not true as some claim that this was "evidence left out of the documentary." If I recall correctly, it was stated in the doc that the reason Avery chased her in the car was that she had been spreading rumors that he had been exposing himself in public, when apparently it was someone else doing that. I can't picture myself running someone off the road over that, but I can certainly imagine being very angry about it. From that point on with the initial rape case, it's stunning how little regard the authorities, let alone the current-day "he's guilty because the police say so" crowd, apparently had for finding out what really happened to the victims in each case. There were numerous other possible suspects in Halba h's death, including the suspiciously alibi'd pair, Brendan's stepdad and brother, as well as the creepy ex-boyfriend who deleted her voicemails and "guessed" her email passwords, and others. You can easily find about some of these online if you're curious including a violent German man who is alleged to have made incriminating statements to his ex before going back to Germany.

I don't know if this happened to anyone else, but about halfway through episode 2 I became convinced that this was a meta-documentary, actually fictional, parodying the direction in which America was going (news interviewing random people on their reaction to allegations etc) and actually started thinking "oh come on, I can see what you're doing here but it's a bit heavy-handed and unrealistic"

Completely agree. I used to hide my number as a rule when I was abit younger, mainly because I just didn't want everyone I might have to call knowing my number. People do this all the time. And if I had something important to say to someone and they weren't answering, then yes I might withhold my number to see if the reason they weren't answering was because it was my number showing up on their display. I did that loads of times, doesnt make me a murderer though.

Well put. My sentiments exactly. Plus, why was there a couple of smears of his blood inside the car and yet none of his fingerprints? They said the blood must have came from a cut on his finger, so that would indicate there should be his finger prints and handprints inside the car as well. And yet the lack of prints suggests he was wearing gloves - well then how could he have bled onto the car? "Oh wait a minute, I'll just remove my gloves to wipe a couple of drops of blood on the dashboard."

Colborn, whilst working as a corrections officer, took a call from a police detective (the same police whose words you question "at your peril") essentially exonerating Avery. Colburn put the phone down, threw the detective's message in the bin, picked up his sandwich and carried on watching Touche Turtle.

I don't think you can call spoilers on real events. That would be like writing an article on some aspect of history and worrying that the readership mightn't know how things turned out. Also, whatever your opinion on Steven Avery and others, it does them something of a disservice to wait until interest has died down to talk about it.

There is no statute of limitations. Spoilers are always bad. However, if you announce that there will be spoilers in your article... that's fine. So you can talk about it now, just warn those who've not seen it all that they shouldn't read your article. It's not rocket science.

This whole thing is a string of lies from all concerned, starting with why his female cousin and her cop husband went to such great lengths to frame him for the rape/gbh and get him locked up in the first place? Why? What did he do to her? I noticed when he was asked how he felt about the trial, he was not able to describe an emotion, only what he thought was going to happen and he seemed remarkably 'cold' a lot of the time. Couple this with the animal cruelty and are we looking at a sociopath here? Is that what the police and close family 'know' but don't want to say? In which case he may be guilty, but the actions of the police have been so corrupt and inept. Was he framed? We will never know now, but in a system that allows life based on an obviously coached and fabricated confession and no other evidence (Brendan), Avery will likely never be released.

Besides which, did you actually watch the series? The fire pit was not hundreds of yards away, it was much closer than tha at, just behind the home. You say, what if he'd been seen carrying the body? Well, given the short distances, he's be just as likely if not more so to be seen loading the body into a vehicle, just to drive it to the other side of the house. Sorry, it doesn't make sense. It would have been more inconspicuous to just drag the body out the back door than to take it to the front or side of the home for loading into a vehicle for a journey of a few feet. You can keep just saying "he did it", but it doesn't make it true.
