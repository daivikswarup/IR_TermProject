The Guardian view on Europe and the economy: size isn’t everything




DateTime::::2016-03-08T19:56:24+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here comes a point in any squabble when you stop rowing about the substance, and argue about the way you’re arguing instead – a smirk, a smug tone of voice, or a refusal to let this or that lie displaces the original bone of contention. It took no time for the UK’s EU referendum campaign to escalate from a debate over serious issues into an ugly spat about the rules of engagement. The details of the prime minister’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/02/the-guardian-view-on-europe-big-arguments-not-small-beans" title="">“reform” package</a> are now forgotten by everybody who is not either obsessive or paid to know about such things. The airwaves are instead abuzz with anti-Europe ministers being <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/eu-referendum-stop-personal-attacks-on-anti-eu-tories-duncan-smith-tells-cameron" title="">blocked from seeing particular papers</a>, charges of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/12177006/Dont-be-taken-in-by-Project-Fear-staying-in-the-EU-is-the-risky-choice.html" title="">“Project Fear”</a>, counter-claims of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/29/camerons-project-fact-brexit-to-leave-us-weak-worse-off-and-dead" title="">“Project Fact”</a>, and a blundering, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/08/boris-johnson-city-hall-staff-will-not-be-gagged-over-eu-referendum" title="">half-abortive attempt</a> to stop London officials from contradicting Boris Johnson’s pro-Brexit line.</p>

<p>In this context, there is little room for a cool appraisal of the complex consequences that would flow from a decision to pull out. Pragmatic measures to “be prepared”, such as the Bank of England’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fedc3f6e-e491-11e5-bc31-138df2ae9ee6.html#axzz42Jg6ZnS0" title="">readying of funds</a> to keep the cashpoints ticking over if a leave vote triggers panic, are interpreted as a sign of an establishment conspiracy. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/08/boris-johnson-abandons-city-hall-eu-referendum-gag-after-hypocrisy-claim-politics-live?page=with:block-56dec660e4b0b7476e1beb8f#block-56dec660e4b0b7476e1beb8f" title="">Facing MPs on Tuesday</a>, the Bank’s governor Mark Carney strained every sinew to avoid coming across as partisan, but it did him no good with determined anti-EU MPs who sense that this globe-trotting Canadian former investment banker is close to George Osborne, and possessed of the sort of economistic worldview that would regard any nationalistic impulse to disrupt a cross-border market as a form of madness. He provided <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/other/treasurycommittee/other/governorletter070316.pdf" title="">the analysis</a> that the parliamentarians had asked for in such measured prose as to render it almost impenetrably dull, but that did not stop the determined Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg from getting excited. He disputed Mr Carney’s commonsensical claim that a pancontinental market tends to increase openness, and even found fault with his <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/Written_Evidence/Letter-from-Mark-Carney-to-Andrew-Tyrie-7-3-16.pdf" title="">straightforward claim</a> that considered “[a]s a single bloc the EU is the largest economy in the world”.</p>

<p>But shonky economic arguments are not an exclusive preserve of the leavers. Pro-Europeans have sometimes bandied around an old estimate for the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://fullfact.org/europe/uk-jobs-and-eu/" title="">3 million jobs</a> linked to trade with the EU, as if all of these would disappear – and all such trade cease – the day after a vote to leave. In reality some exports would make it over tariff walls, even if these were built, which would be pretty unlikely given WTO rules, and doubly unlikely given that Britain and the EU would have every incentive to hammer out some form of UK access to the single market. On the other side of the argument, the tendency is to blithely assume that such access could be costlessly achieved. In reality, there would be messy negotiations. Nobody can be sure how these would play out, and so everybody can believe what they like about trade. Nobody knows, either, exactly how many foreign firms would pull out headquarters or investment. Whether or not the benefits of remaining within the shrunken EU would be sufficient to overcome the cost of switching locations, and perhaps languages, would also depend on the unknowable exit terms. Furthermore, determined anti-Europeans will imagine that any losses would be more than made up for by deregulation and a supposed British flair for making independent trade deals. Forty-three years after it joined the EEC, this is not a talent that the UK has been practising to perfection. But no matter. When so much is up in the air, all sides can find an argument that suits their case.</p>

<p>The debate we ought to be having is less about what Europe does for the size of the economy, and more about what it does for the way the fruits are shared. As Nicola Sturgeon came to London to argue last week, in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/events/scotland-and-the-uk-in-the-eu-a-keynote-speech-by-nicola-sturgeon/" title="">a powerful speech for the Resolution Foundation</a>, without shared European standards on minimum holidays, maximum hours and temporary contracts, every state would face a temptation to start a race to the bottom. This is the serious progressive case for Europe, but too few at Westminster are making this with the force of the Scottish first minister.</p>

<p>Part of the difficulty in making the case may be that the euro has translated into brutal austerity on parts of the continent’s south, tainting the EU’s claims to be a levelling force. But the particular flaws in the design of a single currency must not be allowed to bury a more basic economic truth. Namely, that workers will fare better against companies that can skip lightly across borders when their arm is strengthened by rights that hold good across borders too. In the argument about how to make the economy bigger, everyone will believe what they want. But when it comes to making the economy work better for people, the logic of the pro-European case could be a winning card, if only it were played.</p>

So let's talk logic!,since the crash of 2008 EU has has little growth & if you take Germany negative GDP,in this same period UK largest private sector employer Indian Tata Group sold 1 Jag for every 6 made to EU,again mostly to Germany of these 3 sold to our commonwealth. Indeed if UK did not have this historical trade footprint UK and only had EU as it's trade UK would be a similar position to that Spain is facing such with 20% youth employment . The commonwealth is and projected to have up to 5%GDP growth over the next 10 years and EU at best 1%. So the logic is rather the sending billions to EU let's develop trade to the commonwealth and we many get many more like Tata's investing in UK. So we can keep bailing out failed EU trade block of develop or commonwealth, already UK has allowed China and US to take adventage in many of histirical trade with commonwealth.

The conflict between the overbearing EU and the interests of its citizens is only a small part of it. The main conflict is between different countries whose citizens have different interests and want different things. So if you offer people in the whole EU a chance to get the Europe Britain thinks is ideal, they will not jump at it. They will refuse it. The free movement that for Britain means loads of undesirables swarming over its borders, to Poles and Roumanians means that they can look for a better life and a better job anywhere in Europe and nobody can keep them out. The social chapters, working time directives etc. that you see as damaging and unwarranted interference, people in France see as a guarantee that they can decide freely and democratically for a 35 hour working week, without all their companies being outcompeted by Brits who work 45 hour weeks.

The "accomodation" that we make back to the EU is free trade or something similiar by which millions of their citizens make a living. If we make the "accomodations" you suggest and also believe it is the EU's right to demand, free movement, budget contributions, allowing for the primacy of EU law then what would be the point in Britain leaving? We are leaving *precisely* because we don't want to live in or under such a political system. This startlingly obvious point seems to totally elude you because, though you wish to appear reasonable, you are in fact rationalizating in your mind the EU's right to punish Britain perhaps in a quite serious way, so as to give a warning to other countries of the dire consequences if they decide also to leave. It is quite possible that you are unaware of the longer term consequence of your attitude having not really thought through what it is you actually believe. But what you are actually arguing is that the EU first duty is to protect the construct of political union rather than protect and advance it citizens livelihoods. It shows that the experience of the Euro has taught you nothing.

Yes, it would be perfectly possible for the EU to reorganise Europe so that it fits exactly with what Britain wants - if the EU wanted to. The problem is that the EU does not want to. They want something else. So for the EU to give you some of what you want, you must give them some of what they want. If you refuse to accommodate them, they will refuse to accommodate you. If you promote an alternative model - that the rest of the EU does not want - the rest of the EU will try to make sure your alternative is not a success. Because that is in their interest.

Yes, you've got your "this is all very sad" routine down pat but the vindictive streak is wholly transparent. The "pesky obligations" are undertakings for those that wish to be part of a political union - "pesky obligations" that miğht include Germany democratizing the Eurozone and restoring the idea of democratic plurality. There is no reason either the British or the EU should be out of pocket by Brexit, and the threat of "consequence" -which will be borne by both sides - is solely to do with Britain representing an alternative form of government to the EU that the people in other countries may soon wish to follow and the EU putting up a "more in sorrow than in anger" charade to disguise its retalitory malice. Illiberal, undemocratic and bullying. Germany's back in the European saddle.

The 'maximum influence' argument can be summed up very easily: This is the best you can get, out of the EU. Push for more, and you will fail. I do not like it either, but political decisions should be based on reality, not wishful thinking.

So, you are basically saying that the EU will give Britain a good deal, beause the EU needs Britain much more than Britain needs the EU. That sounds very doubtful to me - in fact it reminds me of Varoufakis. He calculated that a Greek default would be so disastrous for the EU that they would be forced to bail out Greece, on Greeces terms. I would strongly advise you to plan, as Varoufakis did not, for the alternative scenario where the other side is not forced to give you what you want.

You cannot really know, no. But surely a deal broadly similar to what Norway or Canada have got already should be reasonable possible to achieve. The question is whether anybody would be satisfied with that.

The EU will regret the exit of the UK for the loss of (most of) the UK's net contribution and some other instinctively sceptic states may see it as the loss of an ally within.

Whats pathetic surely is that no 'progressive' gov has made the changes you've asked for. So when the same type of people talk about 'reforming' the EU when its plainly against thete own and the wider political classes interest to so, what credibility do they have? About the same amount as someone who believes the democratic shortfall in this country is addressed by being in the EU. Its a joke argument, and shows the absence of true radical intent.

Democracy democracy democracy... and everyone shouting about it the most don't even live in one... not round here anyway. Next election our local MP will be elected with 30 something percent, just like him and his predecessors have been for a hundred years. He'll probably cheer democracy to the rafters as well, seeing as he's a Tory, although Labour can't talk wither.

Yours in a sensible tone. Canada is a 2% tariff which would mean Britain would end up paying 5.4 billion on yearly trade of 270 billion. The 2% coming the other way from EU imports would be over double that amount. There are complicating factors to do will global trade agreements, but the point is a equitable deal could easily be struck if both parties entered negotiations in good faith and a friendly & business like way determined to minimize risk to both economies and give a dignified account as to what democratic public service is about, serving the public. Brexit Britain will be taking this attitude the question is will the EU? And if not, isn't are differing idea of what public service should actually mean further grounds for us saying its time to Leave?

No, a 'leap in the dark' is not a proper description of the choice in front of us. In the 'worst case scenario', that there is no agreement with the EU we would fall back to WTO rules, which involve modest tariffs on goods (as there are on Japanese or Chinese goods currently). We would seek to negotiate a deal that is better for both the EU and ourselves than this. But we do not have to be in the 'Single Market', and indeed, we should decline a deal like Norway has.The lights are on , we can see where we are going. If someone went to a good new restaurant, he may not be sure exactly what he was going to eat, but he might be fairly confident he was going to get a good meal. You wouldn't call that a 'leap in the dark' unless you happened to have shares in the rubbish restaurant where the customer currently went.

Well said. Any democratic reform the EU may conceivably undertake will only be in response to a nation leaving on democratic principle. But the truth is it won't reform even then, for the endgame for EU democracy entails the German people accepting the democratization of the Euro which in turn would mean they'd have to accept Tsipras, Hollande & Podemos intermittently running their economy, something they'll never willingly do. Workers right? Its democratic rights that the Left & the journalistic Left most of all should be fighting for. But its too cowardly and compromised to do so, idly hoping the 'Eurocrisis will end soon that something will turn up. What is going to happen to European politics when it doesn't is another, far darker, story than the 'race to the bottom' prigs cant served up by this paper as serious European politics. What have the Europhile 'dreamers and visionaries' got us into?

As a left-winger, TTIP has to be the biggest issue here. We can probably take a small economic hit, we can probably take the hit to human rights, we can probably handle the loss of connection with Europe, but TTIP puts the state itself in jeopardy as an agent of change to protect us (from plutocratic corporatism). Could we even expect to have state money to build infrastructure if the likes of TTIP holds sway?

You can look at it in any number of ways. Here's another. The Euro has been weaker which has helped UK importers, travellers and holiday-makers. Don't forget Lamont's great devaluation 'victory' where Sterling fell by aprox 30% against the DM bloc. How low would you like the pound to go?

USE - on it's way - for EZ Members definitely, and then pressure on the remaining non-EZ Members to drop their currencies and join too. So.....it's simple.....you either want UK to stop being a Country that prints its own money, controls its own interest rates, makes its own laws, controls its own border, and generally makes its own way in the world or you'd rather we stay independent. How many times must it be said ; this is about POLITICAL Union....which means its about POWER. The Economic aspect is actually a side-show. Trade goes on without POLITICAL UNION.....How much does japan pay to trade with the EU ? How much does America ? 40 years ago we voted to join something called the Common Market - we got the EU. Vote to Remain this year, and it's the USE for you sonny Jim......bye bye Sovereignty....hello decisions made in Air-conditioned rooms in Brussels.

Might be all a mute point. At the moment the EU is being done greek style by the Turks. The same Turkey that backs Isil to screw the Kurds and the same Turkey that refuses to acknowledge the genocide of the Armenians. How will such a Turkey fit into the EU? How long would the EU last with Turkey on the inside? And now the EU has to pay Jizra to Turkey to, well what? Nothing if you add it up. This is what European "soft power" means on the world stage - nothing. The leaders of the EU look kind of pathetic in all this and I am sure Erdogan has nothing but contempt for the whole lot.

But we will still have to have freedom of movement, if Norway and Switzerland are anything to go by (and they're the model always quoted by outties), which means EU citizens will still come here. As they're a net contributor they aren't really the problem, and non EU immigrants won't be affected... so here we sit, where we started from.

Just read an economic argument from the States that the € is doomed. It goes something like this:China is on a huge downward path. One estimate is that they could lay off around 7 MILLION industrial workers by 2020. Their cheap labour is being undercut by robot advancements, etc etc. The ME has no cash to spare as cheap oil means it has to pay for its vast social programs to keep the Islamofascists happy. These 2 markets are Germany's main export markets. So expect Germany to suffer hugely in its exports.But the only thing holding the € together to subsidise the Greeks etc is Germany. So the € is doomed.Q.E.D. We shall see, but this favours Brexit.
