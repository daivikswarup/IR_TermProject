Have I kissed too many guys? You asked Google – here’s the answer




DateTime::::2016-03-09T08:00:15+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>et’s be honest. “Have I kissed too many guys?” is not a question that mature, sexually active women are likely to be asking <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google">Google</a>. They have other things to worry about, like the pay gap, thrush and whether or not to do an engagement ring selfie (my advice: don’t bother – if you stare at your own hand on a screen for long enough it starts to look like a weird autonomous fleshy claw and you will become too disturbed to upload it).</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/19/history-of-kissing-lips-love">What’s in a kiss? Nothing less than the very essence of what it is to be human</a> </p>

<p>That is not to say that the problems of mature women are worse or more worthy of attention than those of their juniors. Being a young woman can be brilliant, but it can also feel hideously embarrassing.</p>

<p>Even without a cursory look at the search results, the anxiety and self-doubt inherent in this question reveal much about the demographic of the asker. It is clearly someone who is highly concerned with their peers’ perception of them, who is worried they are not doing this “growing up” thing quite right. In this strange, pubescent world of uncertainty, what the inquirer wants is a black-and-white answer she can rely on. Something like, “By the age of 18, you should have kissed no more than 36 boys” (figure courtesy of Yahoo! answers). Alas, this is not a service I can provide. But I do know what it is like to be overly anxious about this stuff.</p>

<p>It’s fairly obvious that, because of the way gender roles are assigned in our society, this question mostly pertains to teenage girls who are worrying about what constitutes an “acceptable” (read: non-slutty) number of boys to have kissed, so the remainder of this column is addressed to you, teenage girls of the world.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">The number of guys you have kissed doesn't matter, just why you are doing it</p>

<p>You’re worried you’ve swapped saliva with too many boys? I understand your concern. At my school people treated French kissing like an Olympic sport. There were actual competitions to see who could make out with the most guys in one night (you wouldn’t know it from watching her charge around hospitals delivering babies these days, but my friend Sally once won a Snickers for her record-breaking effort of 15). When there were rumours that a kiss was going to happen, audiences would congregate outside the geography block to cheer the participants. Your reputation as a good (or bad) kisser determined how tolerable your school days were. Glandular fever was a badge of honour.</p>

<p>Perhaps you were involved in one of these competitions, or perhaps you’ve just spent one too many afternoons behind the canteen with half of Set 4 maths. Whatever, you’re worried you’ve overdone it a bit. Perhaps people are starting to talk. You’re getting what your grandma might call “a reputation”. Everyone knows that being a teenage girl is like walking a tightrope between “frigid” and “slut”. You’re worried that you might be a slut. You are not a slut.</p>

<p>You know that bit in Mean Girls where Tina Fey says that girls need to stop calling each other sluts and whores because it just makes it OK for guys to call you sluts and whores? Actually, maybe you don’t because I’ve just realised that Mean Girls is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/apr/19/mean-girls-10-birthday-tina-fey-comedy" title="">over a decade old</a> and I need to go and see about my pension. Anyway, the point stands: you must not call yourself a slut, and you must not call other girls a slut. Also, you must watch Mean Girls.</p>

<p>The number of guys you have kissed does not matter. I can guarantee that while half your class are worrying that they may have been too loose with their lips, the other half are worried that they haven’t kissed anyone and are about to be sent to an ugly home. That is the joy of being a teenager.</p>

<p>No, what actually matters is why you are kissing so many guys. Are you kissing them because it’s fun and sexy and you like it? If so, cool – keep it up. A girl has to get her kicks when shoplifting and low-level psychological bullying become boring.</p>

<p>However, if you are kissing them because you have low self-esteem and want to feel better about yourself, or because you feel under pressure, or because you want to make someone else jealous, then maybe it’s better for your own sake (and theirs) that you have a rethink.</p>

<p>Your teenage years are a strange time in your life, and while kissing someone might feel big now, by the time you get a few years down the line most kisses will barely feature on your list of formative experiences. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sex">Sex</a> – the next big frontier – probably feels like it is (or will be) life-changing, but there will come a time where you may even forget the names of boys you’ve done that with. A person with whom you have shared your body might become but a niggling feeling, a vague, persistent nagging in your mind that you’re forgetting someone, until you wake, bolt upright, in the middle of the night six months later and say simply: “Ian.”</p>

<p>What I’m saying is, basically, this stuff is not as big a deal as you think it is. Engage in as much physical intimacy as you like with partners of either gender, provided you consent, provided you are safe, providing you are balanced, and providing you aren’t hurting anyone. For that you need never apologise and never feel guilty. There are people who will try to judge you for how you choose to deploy your body and who will continue to do so as you age, but in my experience 99.9% of the sad people who feel they have something vital to say about any given young woman’s sexual habits are not worth listening to.</p>

<p>So basically, kiss who the hell you want, with a few caveats, which I will leave you for future reference. It is generally not a good idea to kiss any of the following: ex-boyfriends; the ex-boyfriends of friends; the current boyfriends of friends; boys your friends have really liked for ages; your A-level history teacher; your friend’s dad; your friend’s older brother who is home from university for the weekend and sees you as a piece of fresh young meat; your work colleagues; your best male friend who you only view platonically – but hell, you’re drunk and feel lonely; anyone with a cold sore because, let’s be honest, that is basically herpes; your boss; your university lecturer; guys in the second year who use the term “bantz” non-ironically and think it’s funny to hump items of furniture; guys who think rape jokes are hilarious; other people’s husbands; and possibly Conservatives (on your own head be it). Everyone else is pretty much fair game.</p>

University College Cardiff (as was) 30+ years ago .... possibly the best snogging I had in all my time there was with Christine, the Chair of some ?Catholic Christian society. There was no need for words. We would see each other at an event or in the Union bars and head over to each other and snog for what seemed like ages. No words exchanged before or after. And that was all there was to it, no other hanky-panks aspects.Where is she now, now that I'm a long-term single in the horizontal rain of Cardiff? Sic transit.....

Yes - but your answer can easily lead to the response - that's too many. So, before you pick a number, check with google what the right response should be....

Yes, and that's the question: how many. Not "have I kissed too many?"

Kissing is great if the partner is any good at it AND healthy. If you're a germaphobe, stick to the one person you like/trust.

You are right, you are ten years out of date. All this may have been true then. However now you have teenage boys being branded sex offenders for kissing a five year olds hand as well as texting any pictures or possessing any pictures of their girlfriend. It is a very bad time to be the mother of a teenage boy ( which I am) and I thank god daily that he is an extremely nerdy kid who gets his kicks obsessing about phone apps. Otherwise I don't know how I will cope. As for shoplifting, that also goes on your record. I have friends who have been unable to find jobs after having a job as a checkout girl and swiping loyalty cards too much to favour their friends. We are fast lurching towards Victorian Britain.

Not that unthinkable. One of my daughter's teachers flirted with me once when I went to parents evening and asked me to meet him at the pub over the road for a drink afterwards.Too weird and of course I didn't go. A few years later it was common knowledge that he was having a relationship with one of the six formers at the school. He was in his 30's and she was 17.That was in the 90's so not that long ago.

I think I might have to revise my estimate down. I am going to say closer to 50. Like 10 before college. 10 after college in total. And like 30 in college. So like, 7 during the school year, three in the summer. Senior year I dated a guy.

Oh, I love kissing! Sadly most guys I have locked lips with have needed serious training in this sensual art. Certainly was my litmus test as to whether things would progress any further. Was sadly disappointed though with one, who whilst being extremely easy on the eye, and an excellent kisser, turned out to be the worst shag ever ...no rhythm. I kept trying again thinking it would get better...it didn't. Still, I now have the best kisser in the world in my life, so all that hard field work finally paid off......
