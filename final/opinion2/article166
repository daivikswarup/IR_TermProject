Hollywood, take note of Jenny Beavan: this ‘bag lady’ is what creativity is all about

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here was a time when proving your good faith as a rebel in Hollywood required serious effort and some real risk-taking. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/20/jane-fonda-hanoi-jane-photo-was-a-huge-mistake">Jane Fonda went to Hanoi</a>, while Kirk Douglas insisted <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/oct/10/kirk-douglas-mccarthy">a blacklisted writer got the writing credit on Spartacus</a>. But in these more sensitive and conformist times, you can get away with doing a lot less. Indeed, if <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars-2016">the Oscars</a> this week are anything to go by, you can rock all those showbiz squares by turning up and collecting an award in a Marks &amp; Spencer jacket.</p>

<p>Fresh from being called a “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/14/stephen-fry-hits-back-at-criticism-of-baftas-bag-lady-joke-she-got-it-derrr">bag lady</a>” by Stephen Fry at the Bafta awards, the costume designer <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/feb/29/jenny-beavan-oscars-ten-conspiracy-theories">Jenny Beavan was at it again</a> at the Oscars. As she went up to collect her gong, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/mar/01/string-of-stars-fail-to-clap-for-oscar-winner-jenny-beavan-video">horror on some faces in the audience</a> suggested they were watching The Exorcist for the first time rather than admiring a well-deserved winner [see footnote].</p>

<p>Perhaps this reaction was understandable. Not only was there no leg-flashing or cleavage on display, but she also had the effrontery to be wearing something anyone can buy on the high street. Yes, Hollywood people – civilians out there really are wearing this gear.</p>

<p>What’s baffling about the reaction to Beavan from some guests is that they work in an industry where sticking to the rules, doing what everyone else does and playing it safe are supposed to be a no-no; where creativity isn’t meant to be a 9-5 job attracting 9-5 people. Traditionally this has been embodied by stars who are “difficult” to work with, or driving fast cars. But if you want someone who can think outside the box and truly shock an audience to its core, Beavan has given us a whole new definition.</p>

I disagree - she's part of Technical, & they have a very different reason for being there than the FOH folks - actors, directors, etc... her work doesn't require her to be eye candy, so why should she spend 5K on a gown?

I'm so glad she wore that outfit. Glamour and "princess dresses" are quite boring overrated. Tuxedos are quite boring too. #stupidSocialConventions

All these articles on what Jenny Beavan was wearing at the Oscars and the perceived reactions of people are just perpetuations of sexism. I watched the Oscars and honestly if there hadn't been articles about the shocking response of people to her outfit I wouldn't have even noticed. It's not like anybody clapped their hands over their mouths and heaved or anything. What I did take note of on the night however was what this woman said in her acceptance speech - that we should take note, a dystopian future similar to the movie she worked on could happen. That is always my thought when I see Mad Max movies, not only could it happen, similar things are happening in Syria where woman are being auctioned off and in areas terrorised by groups like Boka Haram. Meanwhile Leo is getting lauded by media for his acceptance speech, which is fair enough I guess and he did say a few more words, but both of these oscar winners had similar messages.

Agreed. No crime at all. But neither should she be portrayed as some kind of rebellious artist sticking it to the Hollywood establishment.

Look at the video of it, they did applaud. It was just strange, maybe they were surprised about her outfit given the usual dress code.

Point taken, but I still feel that "the glamorous side" is overdone. Like the stage set itself, which once again this year made St Peter's in Rome look like a Portakabin, the garments worn by most of the nominees are ostentatious where they aren't simply skimpy. The blokes just wear DJs...

Only Jared Leto is allowed to dress differently at the Oscars.I know, it's a weird rule and no-one knows how it came about. But a rule is a rule and Beaven should have known that.At this level she's an effing disgrace.If she ever wins again and that's a big if, then she will have to have a disabled Muslim girl child refugee accept it for her.If she can get another job now..cow!

Discoplant- Absolutely. She came across as someone being purposely petulant and resentful of the customs, tradition and history of this event and organization that is connected to her earning fantastic sums of money, having an amazing job and being lauded on the biggest TV show on Earth. One could argue that the Oscars & Hollywood biz have a lot of unnecessary and gratuitous hype and fluff, but her action here was akin to attending a big fancy wedding or a royal event involving The Queen wearing beat up clothes for an off night at the pub, or perhaps hiking the woods.

You once again make the point! People, especially in Hollywood, place too much importance on looks. But this is true in society as well. I do think Donald Drumphf would agree with you.

The women's faces were equally stony!! i thought Beavan had an unusually unkempt look for an evening that normally brings out the glamorous side of the nominees!! Since she chose to go that route, I'm surprised that anyone is surprised by the reaction of the audience to the duds she wore to the Oscars!!

The fact is dressing up is something of a uniform in those circumstances, if you were graduating in full regalia and one women turned up wearing pretty awful clothes you'd do a double take. She looks pretty rough given the circumstances, I don't think you can really deny that, I think they are just shocked, rather than disgusted.

She was singled out and rewarded for the excellence of her work. She accepted the award without fuss . Where is the crime? Tell you what, let's just agree to disagree.

Looking again at the clip, I think that most (not all) of the men's faces were pretty stony as Jenny Beavan walked past them, including Iñárritu's. What that implied on the night, I cannot guess. But stony they are.

Because it signifies you as part of a group, and possessing some care for proper rules and decorum that should remain unspoken. Ceremonies like this are supposed to set an atmosphere of being special, as being different than ordinary life. To show up dressed just like any person on the street is signaling to this group, "I have no respect for you, your traditions, or your ceremony" or "I simply don't care." If enough people take that attitude, it will de-elevate the awards ceremony to the realm of the common, thereby devaluing it. It is also a snub to the countless attendees and their stylists who have fretted and fine-tuned their look all year long, and devalues those efforts as well. If you have so little respect for the ceremony, just stay home and don't be a part of it. You can wear sweatpants and be a horrible slob at home or on the street and no one will really care. Don't expect to be lauded as a "rebel" or something special just because you don't care. It is easy not to care, but hard to follow the rules and create an aesthetic and atmosphere that is outside the realm of the everyday.

A creative, gifted and witty woman with nothing to prove. Her acceptance 'speech' at the BAFTAs was tremendous, no obnoxious gushing, no political agenda. What a breath of fresh air. Our showbiz folk here in the US could learn a thing or two from Ms. Beavan like humility and not taking the whole shebang so seriously. Cheers Jenny!

If you look at the clip they all start clapping by the time she reaches the stage. I suspect that that only the big awards (best director etc) get a big clap and you basically sleep and booze through the rest unless you happen to know the person.

MMFR was, however, awesome, brilliant, visually stunning and potentially prophetic. Jenny Beavan's creativity made it so. She does not fit the "beautiful people" (boring) stereotype --- good for her & her creativity. Cannot wait to see what the brilliant Jenny Beavan does next!!!

I was absolutely delighted for Jenny Bevan that she won her work on Mad Max was excellent. There are not many awards given to designers of fantasy or Sci Fi films yet these are the very pinnacle of design. The ability to invent and create in costume makes the world on film come to life. Jenny Bevan's work has done that many times. That is the only thing that should be considered in this. What she wears to an award ceremony is her choice alone and that is the mark of the true individual well done Jenny
