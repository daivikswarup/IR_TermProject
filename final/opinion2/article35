The Sunday trading win was a blip – the weekend is slowly dying




DateTime::::2016-03-10T20:14:39+0000



<p>Monday blues. That Friday feeling. Easy like Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how we cling to the idea that each day of the week has a distinct personality, even when the myth falls apart under the lightest scientific prodding. People don’t invariably all return to work on Mondays feeling depressed and miserable, for a start. Although that’s perhaps unsurprising, given that for millions Monday isn’t even the beginning of the working week any more, and Sunday mornings are often far from easy.</p>

<p>Children’s lives still divide relatively neatly between five days of school and two of freedom; but for adults the boundaries between working week and weekend are starting to collapse. We live in an increasingly round-the-clock world where work merges with play, and in the case of shift workers at least, nights bleed into days, which soon start to seem much of a muchness.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Teenage mall rats now trawl Asos together instead of spending giggly hours in badly lit changing rooms</p>

<p>So the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/cameron-defeated-in-commons-over-plans-to-relax-sunday-trading-laws" title="">government defeat over plans to extend Sunday trading hours</a> felt like a genuine surprise, an almost quaintly countercultural moment – and not just because, for once, Labour got one over the government. George Osborne’s plan to let us all spend longer wandering mindlessly round the shops was thwarted by an unlikely alliance of devout Christians, Tory champions of corner shops (being allowed to open later than the big boys on Sundays gives them a much-needed competitive advantage), Labour MPs rallied by the shop workers’ union USDAW, and the SNP. And so for now we’re all going to Keep Sunday Special, if not in the churchgoing sense then at least in the sense of a day that isn’t just like all the others.</p>

<p>Well, fair enough. Why should shelf-stackers miss Sunday dinner with their families just because some people couldn’t get it together sufficiently to buy a pint of milk during the previous six hours (not to mention six days) that Tesco was actually open? This vote hardly plunges us back to a time when there was nothing to do on the Sabbath but watch tumbleweed blow down the street. In big cities, at least, the shops and cinemas, the pubs and restaurants and theatres, are all open on a Sunday, even if it’s not for quite as long as usual. And nobody ever died of not being able to try on a dress at 9am.</p>

<p>Millions of people already work weekends, of course, without the luxury of politicians intervening to stop it. For nine years as a Sunday newspaper journalist, I was one of them, and the great eye-opener was how many people were doing the same; trudging to the office on a Saturday morning, past wide-eyed clubbers heading home from the night before and mascara-smudged girls doing the walk of shame.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/01/week-amazon-insider-feature-treatment-employees-work">My week as an Amazon insider</a> </p>

<p>And mostly, I didn’t even mind. I was 29 when I started, young enough to change clothes in the office loo at the end of a shift and still catch the end of everyone else’s drunken Saturday night. So what if Monday became the new Sunday? Having a day off when everyone else was working seemed almost luxurious.</p>

<p>But journalists are paid well to do something they love, which is more than can be said for many working antisocial hours. And everything changes once you acquire a spouse, children, and the sudden desire to live in the same time zone as them. Working when everyone else is taking their kids to the park, or prowling round an empty house while they’re at school, doesn’t feel quite so liberating.</p>

<p>So all power to the junior doctors who want recognition for working like this, or the shop workers reluctant to give up their Sunday mornings, or indeed the MPs defending them. But nonetheless, there’s a powerful sense of parliament spitting into the wind. For Sunday opening will probably soon be the least of shop workers’ problems.</p>

<p>Osborne didn’t pick a fight with his own party for no reason; he was responding to big retailers spooked by the threat from online shopping, which can of course be done round the clock in your pyjamas. Lobbyists had argued that letting stores stay open for longer on Sundays might give them more chance to compete, conceivably bringing in another <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/osbornes-changes-to-sunday-trading-laws-could-generate-203-billion-2015-7" title="">£20bn in sales over the next two decades </a>– presuming, of course, that the high street actually survives that long.</p>

<p>Because online shopping is eating the bricks-and-mortar behemoths alive. Teenage mall rats now trawl Asos together on their phones instead of spending giggly hours in badly lit changing rooms. Why would they go back to the days of nagging for a lift into town and traipsing round in the rain, when they can press a button on the tablet editions of fashion magazines and “shop the look” instantly?</p>

<p>That’s why public spaces are filling up with services that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/millennials-the-trials-of-generation-y" title="">millennials</a> want but can’t get online – nail bars, hairdressers, gyms, coffee shops – while the surviving stores morph either into places to try before you buy, or into glitzy shop windows for the real operation. Want the skirt you saw on that mannequin? Sure, but we’ll have to order it in for you, from the unglamorous warehouse where the heart of this operation now resides.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/cameron-defeated-in-commons-over-plans-to-relax-sunday-trading-laws">No 10 concedes Sunday trading defeat after Commons rebellion</a> </p>

<p>And it’s rather less clear what MPs can do for the invisible army working in those warehouses for online giants such as Amazon, whose management practices were memorably described this week by Management Today magazine’s editor as “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35763908" title="">standing over the rowers with a whip</a>” like something out of Ben Hur. Amazon recently began delivering on Sundays, a logical response to customers moaning about stuff arriving when they were out. They’re just giving us what we say we want. But at a price.</p>

<p>Weekend workers still get weekdays off in lieu, of course. But it’s not quite the same, because there’s something about having your free time at the exact same time everyone else is having theirs that makes a difference.</p>

<p>Sundays off are still for leisurely pub lunches, five-a-side football, family walks, and over-analysing the events of Saturday night with your girlfriends, because that’s when most other people are around. Mondays off are more likely to be spent alone, ticking off errands while answering emails from people who assumed you were in the office.</p>

<p>The slow death of the weekend isn’t just about feeling busier or resentful, but about yet another step away from collective life into a more individualistic, less hidebound but potentially lonelier future. Blue Mondays, indeed.</p>

I guess the rationale would be that having a day free from work is a good and institutionalised value ie a time set aside from work. You can argue with that but its a value premise.

I'm not picking on retail workers I promise. I've no children at school and have an Israeli employer - so could happily do Sun-Thurs as my working week. US clients (currently), I could do 12-8 for those days I do work etc etc.I just want to work and live efficiently.

I don't deny any of that - my point was simply that most of us currently can't shop the majority of hours shops are open.

Scotland's big shops don't appear to bother opening for a full trading on Sunday anyway? If it was that magical a day, they'd copy Saturdays hours, Shirley?

I kind of agree with what you're saying, and in some ways it's probably better that we distribute people's days off throughout the 7 days, rather than almost everyone having Sat & Sun off.

Author::::rh53w7br
DateTime::::2016-03-11T14:37:13Z
you're missing the point. you can do that any day of the week. the point of this sunday argument is that everyone has off at the same time, so they can spend valuable family time together. keeping shops open on sundays doesn't imply that people have to work 7 days per week - although if they felt like it then great. legislation could very easily mandate that every worked has to be given two (or even two consecutive) days off per week. that can either mean that a business staffs itself enough such that it can stay open 7 days while rotating staff, or it means that it shuts on two days, which don't have to be saturday and sunday. if you happen to have Monday and Tuesday off instead of Saturday and Sunday off then you can ALSO shut yourself in a room by yourself or go for some walk.

It's nice to have the option of nothing to do on Sundays. Working on Sundays is more depressing if you have a family, I suspect, than for those who don't.

I don't buy for a second that poor people, and in particular those who worked the land, were resting on Sundays. And that is beside the point anyway: this author is arguing that the historical tradition of Sundays must be kept. The true historical tradition of Sundays as "rest day" is not "rest day so I can have some time for me and my family away from the grind" but "rest day so I can go to church and devote one day a week to the 'lord' ". That is not a tradition that I personally need to follow, and my guess is that it's not a tradition that this author would like to follow. Moreover, having Sunday trading laws would not prevent people from taking one day per week and devoting it to their God.

That's very true - if you work weekends with two days off during the week (not always together) days worked in a row can be an issue.

I presume the "prisoner's dilemma" scenario here would be that "all shops close on Sundays" would be more profitable than "all shops open on Sundays".

Sorry these arguments are incoherent. Why is it ok for people who work in small shops,pubs,restaurants,cinemas,nightclubs, newspapers, public transport,TV, leisure parks to work Sundays but not people who work in Supermarkets? Is that rational? We the concept of shift work and I'm sure many students wouldn't mind the chance to make a bit of extra cash. When I was a student I worked as waiter at weekends and on holidays such Christmas day. It was my choice not yours - so stop being parsimonious. Its not like other countries all shut up early on a Sunnday so your claim its essential for our mental well being is easy to rebut.

I'm old enough to remember Sundays before supermarkets could open and I have to say the religious folk were right for once. Sunday was special when there was bugger all to do.

No doubt. But God would rather that they were devout every day, not just on Sunday. And not by forcing HIM on others, either.

I wasn't suggesting we just expect Tesco etc. to do what's right. I was thinking more that there must be some kind legislative option that allows larger shops to remain open without reducing workers' standard of living.

generally you can phone for insurance, banking and similar at the weekends anyway. There are services that don't have phone lines open at least partially during the weekend.

My point is, if shop workers are forced to work Monday to Friday hours ( I know a lot who are) then who is actually shopping in those shops if most people are at work. Doesn't it make more sense to have a much more flexible, round the clock view of shopping instead of making people work at the same time.

As long as you get to keep the Monday - Friday hours, and everybody else has to do the antisocial hours?
