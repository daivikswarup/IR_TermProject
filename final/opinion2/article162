Whether it’s Ali G or Tina Fey, ironic racism just isn’t funny any more

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he surprising thing about <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/01/sacha-baron-cohen-oscars-ali-g-academy" title="">Sacha Baron Cohen’s appearance as Ali G at the Oscars</a> on Sunday, wasn’t that it was unauthorised by the Academy, but that it was so unfunny. The comedian’s decision to revive his almost <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_os2S7O9EtU" title="">20-year-old alter ego</a> was, obviously, part of the evening’s commentary on race, but even in a room full of people selling something, it seemed highly self-serving – a way to say: “Hey, guys, I was doing spoof race-baiting before some of you were even born!”</p>

<p>It appears that it went down better in Britain than in the US, where the jokes about “little yellow people” largely fell on deaf ears. I think this is partly a case of American audience-fatigue with a certain type of naughty British comedian. But it’s also the fact that Baron Cohen’s satire seems outdated and heavy-handed, a party piece that has been over-used in the past few years and that everyone is a little tired of.</p>

<p>We had Amy Schumer doing her <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amy-schumer-apologizes-racist-joke-807066" title="">jokes about Latinos being rapists</a> (“I used to date Hispanic guys, but now I prefer consensual”). In Britain, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/may/11/jimmy-carr-funny-business-review-dorking-halls" title="">Jimmy Carr</a> is still labouring away at the coalface of “unsettling” comedy, fearlessly confronting taboos and upsetting people with no sense of humour who don’t understand the real targets of his jokes. Even Tina Fey and Amy <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/11/amy-poehler" title="">Poehler</a> have done it– not just with Fey’s Asian and Native American characters in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/05/unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt-tina-fey-netflix" title="">Kimmy Schmidt</a>, which came in for criticism from some minority groups, to which she responded haughtily: “There’s a real culture of demanding apologies, and I’m opting out of that.”</p>

<p>But also with their <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/11/tiny-fey-amy-poehler-bill-cosby-golden-globes" title="">Bill Cosby segment at the Golden Globes last year</a>. The two were applauded for taking him on, but as a rule of thumb it seems to me a bad idea for a white person to do an impression of a black person, even if it is Cosby.</p>

<p>Everyone gets it. Most of these jokes are sending up racists and white supremacists. But they also gratify the comedian’s intellectual vanity, signalling to the audience how sophisticated the act is for posing as a bigot. It’s not that it’s lazy. It’s not even that it’s backhanded racism – although it often is. It’s that, a generation after Ali G first said “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jan/09/broadcasting" title="">booyakasha</a>”, it’s simply an exhausted approach to making people laugh.</p>

"but as a rule of thumb it seems to me a bad idea for a white person to do an impression of a black person, even if it is Cosby". My goodness what a tortuores thought process. Is it now equally unacceptable for black actors to play Hamlet, men the pantomime dame or women the boy lead? What a dull grey world where we mustn't step on the cracks in the pavement. Jonny Speight and Alf Garnet wpuld hit today's lily livered columnists like an overdose of heroin while failing to recognise the real message.

I always understood Ali G to represent a white boy pretending to be black. This used to be a common pretence among a certain class of white boys, maybe it still is. Therein lay the 'comedy'.There used to be a name for such lads but I'm not going to chance it on here.This rather depressing conceit never made me laugh but SBC made a decent living at it so good luck to him.

Emma Brockes does seem to be on a search for something at the moment. Last three articles: Tina Fey in Afghanistan isn't funny, 90s TV isn't funny and now ironic racism isn't funny.

Ali G was a brilliant satire of identity politics and how it has supressed intelligent debate.Members of the great and good were reduced to compliant, gibbering wrecks by an ignorant and stupid individual putting forward moronic views. He got away with it because he used two stereotypical markers of black identity, clothing and speech, that put him beyond the rules of their normal discourse.So strongly did they react to these markers that it never occurred to them that he was not black.To less effect he worked the same trick with anti-Semitic Borat (possibly Muslim?) and Gay Bruno.

How is Ali G racist?



Author::::blackieconnors83
DateTime::::2016-03-05T08:30:20Z
Ok I see your point I suppose, although, as you allude to its a clear thread that runs through all his characters like Bruno. I don't feel it is a questionable character at all. I find it hilarious. Question though, how on Earth could you know whether or not he has been on the end of anti-semitism? As a Jewish man he may well have been, that is an assumption on your behalf.

SBC loves putting the boot into poor white people tho (probably the only racial stereotype it is still ok to abuse). They all dress up in shell suits and are utterly stupid. Wealthy ex-public schoolboys always target white poor people. Little Britain springs to mind.

I always thought he was taking the piss out of poor white working class people too. Sort of like Little Britain. It seems to be what wealthy ex-public schoolboys see as the best target.

And so, Ms Brockes, are you saying we must all hear or see a joke the same way for it to be funny? Surely the best jokes are the ones that reveal layers of a truth that tickles and hurts us at the same time, if you get my meaning.

Surely life would be so much better if we all got over ourselves a bit more! This faux sensitivity to even the slightest interpretation of any race or culture (except American - you can freely rip that shit out of that one) as being racist and xenophobic is dull.

Ali G, Borat, Bruno; Sacha Baron Cohen's 3 most famous creations are all united both in crude ethnic stereotyping and in being crushingly, toe-curlingly, sphincter clenchingly unfunny.

I hate this argument. It's basically saying you can be as cruel and nasty towards certain groups of people because they haven't been enslaved. I don't care that Lenny Henry did a David Bellamy impression. It was probably done with affection. And that's the point. If I shouted 'I'm the greatest' a la Muhammed Ali, who are you to judge that I'm racist? I might well be a massive fan of the man and have no intention of ripping the piss out the guy's skin colour, just copying one of his catchphrases.

I don't think the politics of the Fey/Poehler joke revolved around race but sex: two successful women performing rhetorical revenge on someone who appears to be a serial rapist who relied on his power and notoriety to thwart justice. The other part of it was that every US comedian has a Cosby impression, and they're usually terrible, but there is an awkward frisson to using something hammy to excoriate, again, a possible serial rapist.

It is both offensive and extremely patronizing for Brockes to assume black people took offense at the Cosby impression because they like her also share the view that he's a sort of black everyman and woman figure. Thus implying that his lascivious tendancies are genetic, rather than opportunistic.

In the eye of the beholder though, isn't it? Who are you to set yourself up as the authority on who is qualified to critique comedy? Maybe they understand it better than you do? People have a right to critique and you are free to critique their critique, but just declaring them unqualified isn't a particularly convincing response.
