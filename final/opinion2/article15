‘I am well-spoken and not an addict’: how homelessness can happen to anyone




DateTime::::2016-03-10T08:00:12+0000



<p>My story of homelessness is not one you usually hear. I am not the type of person you’d expect to sleep rough. I am educated, well-spoken and was not an addict. People didn’t believe a guy like me could end up with nothing: no friends or family for support.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">I decided to fake a mental illness to have somewhere warm to stay</p>

<p>It all started after my father died 10 years ago. I had been working abroad in commercial advertising but came home to bury him. Then I made the decision to move back to London, but I ended up losing contact with a lot of people I once knew. I was also estranged from my family, so I didn’t know a soul in the city. Over the next few months I used up all my money, failed to get a job and – because I’d been away for a while – struggled to reintegrate into the social welfare system.</p>

<p>I ended up on the streets. There are very few shelters where you can walk in without ID and get help. I had my passport but didn’t know my national insurance number or my address (I didn’t have one) so I couldn’t get the necessary documentation.</p>

<p>When I first started sleeping rough I didn’t know what I was doing and ended up in hospital with pneumonia. When I recovered, the social welfare person at the hospital told me – once again – they could not help. So I found myself back on the streets.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a particularly harsh winter I came up with an ingenious idea – to fake a mental illness to have somewhere warm to stay. I walked into a fire station and behaved as if I was having a psychotic episode, pretending not to know where I was. I was admitted to hospital and eventually diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and being marginally bipolar (which was partially true and partially made up on my part). But because I was not a danger to myself they discharged me.</p>

<p>At this point I was so desperate I swallowed some pills and was found by the police in Hyde Park the next day. I was back in hospital and told I needed immediate surgery (the pills had ruptured ulcers in my stomach). The nurse arrived and asked for my address. I told her I didn’t have one. Next of kin? None. A friend? None. There was nobody to contact.</p>

<p>This was when things finally changed for me. In hospital I met someone visiting a relative who offered me help. Then, a month later I ran into the same guy in Hyde Park. He once again told me to stay with him, but I had become very suspicious of people.</p>

<p>Finally, after much persistence on his part, I agreed. He had a spare room and said he’d help me get paperwork. He even helped me open a bank account. I started to make my way back into the world. I even got a job. </p>

<p>I will never forget my time on the streets. I spent my life trying to achieve my dreams. Then, one day everything was gone and I couldn’t get it back. I did nothing wrong, but there was no room for me in the inn and I was on my own. </p>

<p>The reason I am homeless is complex: people would class it as a “relationship breakdown” but I get on really well with my mum. The only problems we’ve had have been caused by my autism, which has only recently been diagnosed. Before either of us knew about my condition some of my behaviour – linked to my autism – left my mum in severe financial difficulties. I don’t want to go into too much detail about what happened specifically, but my autism means I often struggle to understand the social rules of the world around me.</p>

<p>I<strong> </strong>felt awful and couldn’t really understand why my actions had caused so much pain. My mum and I understandably needed time and space; she wanted to understand, learn about and gain support for my autism, and independence is also something social services have always wanted me to consider. That’s why last summer I filled in my application to try to find alternative accommodation<strong> </strong>through the council.<br/></p>

<p>I have been living in emergency accommodation in Brighton ever since, at a place that is terrible. Daily challenges include having no heating and living in mouldy and damp conditions. My autism also makes things a hundred times harder for me: the noise, the drug-dealing and screaming children at night mean I barely sleep any more. I also have obsessive compulsive disorder, which mainly manifests in a contamination phobia. I cannot eat or drink where I live and I only get hot food when I see my mum. You might think I should just go back home, but change is very unsettling for autistic people and the thought of this fills me with anxiety. I worry it might send me<strong> i</strong>nto a downward spiral. </p>

<p>Autism causes a multitude of communication and social difficulties. When I get upset it can often come out in the form of anger, and then people won’t interact with me. A student social worker is raising my concerns about the property with my local council; it feels like he and my mum are the only two people fighting for my interests.</p>

<p>I was evicted from my southeast London flat in 2014 because I had lost my job. I had been working for a charity I set up two days a week but then it folded and I couldn’t afford my rent. I had been in my house for 12 years, but despite this the council were not particularly helpful in relocating me. They said, “Here is a list of private numbers. We cannot help you because of your age and your gender.” I was a low priority. </p>

<p>I ended up buying a £300 old tin caravan with no heating, electricity or running water and parking near my old home. I had a small camping stove for cooking, but that was about it. Local residents, councils and MPs knew where I was but no one gave me any help in finding better accommodation. They seemed to think that l wasn’t someone they should be supporting as I had a place (even though it was a mess – I ended up putting green tarp over my van because it leaked so much).</p>

<p>I was in my van for 11 months before the council found me a new place 30 miles out of the capital. My dog helped keep me sane during that time, as did the kindness of strangers. It was the elderly community that really supported me – they would come by the caravan on a daily basis to make sure I was OK and take the dog walking with me.</p>

<p>I was trying to get work at this time but it was hard without a permanent address. This was my first experience of being homeless. Bizarrely I had previously worked for a homeless charity. More should be done for single, male homeless people – those who slip through the net as they don’t have drink or drug dependencies.</p>

Thank you so much for this article. I live in the town where in the last week a homeless person named Matt has gained international notoriety. He was pilliored quite aggressively on local social media. I've posted this article on several of those sites and hopefully its gone some way to balancing the debate.

or able to help - e.g. for the man whose mother could not accommodate him because of the terms of her tenancy. So many tenancy agreements restrict who is allowed to live in the property or even stay there in the shorter term. It is one thing for landlords not to want overcrowding, subletting etc. But to prohibit one or two extra family members from staying when they have an accommodation crisis is outrageous. In other countries I have lived, landlords would not be able to ban one or two family members - or even friends for that matter - staying even in a one bedroom flat. Reform needed here on tenants rights.

Of course not, with the best will in the world and all the support some people will fall through nets. However the point is what exists now is being eroded plus rents and the cost of living are escalating ... along with sanctions, zero hours contracts etc.

The American subprime mortgage crisis shows it doesn't go any better if you are beholden to a mortgage you can't pay- instead it's worse as it leaves more of a stain on your financial record than walking away from a rental contract

It's not the Cons - it's council housing departments and HA's who prioritise children. Turn up with three or four kids, you have a better chance of being housed than a single person.Which is why in my area many flats are occupied by families who have not been in the UK very long but have kids, while old and young single Londoners can't get housed.

It's not a choice. I hate London. It's also where most of the jobs are in my field and where I need to be for medical treatments. 'Move out of London' is just not realistic for a lot of people. Obviously you can save if your income is significantly more than your living costs. Who needs to be told that? Again, you don't get it. A lot of people just earn so little that they can barely even survive. Outside London too.

Yes, pretty much. I don't have a car, an iPhone or any of the other 'things' people like to say Generation Y waste their money on. I make a packed lunch every day for work. I buy teabags at Aldi and use the office kettle to make tea. I live in a very cheap room in London (compared to most), which I was very lucky to get, sharing the house with 4 others.

It is indeed shocking to read about such instances of homelessness/In this age OF GREED/UNCARING ATTITUDES something has to be done either at local or state level to alleviate such hardship/ Why has this divide between haves and have nots become so accentuated and nothing is being done to alter such a social situation/ How is it that this particular phenomenon is so prevalent in only Britain and America, supposedly the richest countries in the world/ These situations are extremely rare in Scandinavian countries/ WHY?

Yes, you can't get a balanced view on a country by living abroad and reading sensationalist newspaper reports. I wouldn't tell you how things really are in whatever country you live in. Crime is down, teen pregnancy and drinking/drug taking are sharply down, in what measurable sense is this country a "nightmare"?

Spanish society still features plenty of family cohesion, yet homelessness is as great a problem (if not greater). The main reason (aside from the weather) that, if I had to be homeless, I'd be homeless in Spain, not the UK, is the difference in attitudes. People would still be assholes to you but without affecting the same degree of moral superiority. What British society really suffers from is the belief that the social order is basically good and just. Changing these attitudes would not halt homelessness (more housing, especially more social housing, is a more practical concern) but it would blunt the peculiar vindictiveness with which we treat the homeless.

Its so easy to become homeless and fall into a hole that just deepens with depression or whatever else may have brought on the decline in ones circumstances. Once their its so hard to climb out when all reason goes out of the window. The only people who understand are the voluntary organisations who are now underfunded.The government has created a problem by bad management of the benefit system which is making the situation worse. One of the richest countries in the world and still homelessness persists its a disgrace..

I believe it's ended now but many women were imprisoned for not paying the tv licence a few years back.Often the licences were in their name but it was their husbands/partners with the money who decided which bills got paid.People can end up taking the fall for others' mistakes and what about those wrongly convicted?Or those committing minor crimes when they were young and stupid?Obviously there are categories of violent criminals who don't deserve a second chance but you can't just tar everyone with the same brush.

To be honest I don't see it making any difference. If they're anyway active in the Tory party its unlikely they're going to give a crap about people in this position. After all, their party caused a lot of the problem in the first place with cuts to services that should be there to help them. It's wishful thinking they might suddenly develop a conscience over this.

I think there are many out there, a few posting here, who have no idea with the struggle to make ends meet for many. That people might actually have anything left after bills and food, that they just spend it all without thinking about saving it! And that loss of a regular income could mean being thrown out and having nowhere to turn. They just have no idea and are so judgemental.
