And the Oscar boycott award goes to Spike and Jada and Snoop

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>iming really is everything in showbiz. Idris Elba had hardly finished giving a select audience in parliament <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/jan/17/idris-elba-black-actors-lack-of-diversity-uk-television">his steer on diversity in the media</a> when up popped a sequel in Hollywood. Cynics might prefer to give the weepy stars and their extended list of thankees at the Oscars a miss. This year they can do so with good reason: the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/19/michael-moore-joins-oscars-2016-boycott-lack-of-black-nominees">boycott by luminaries such as Spike Lee and Jada Pinkett Smith</a>, who will absent themselves over the lack of diversity.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour">How to fix Hollywood's race problem</a> </p>

<p>The statistics are damning, but in a sense they’re irrelevant. Everyone knows there’s a problem, from Oscars boss Cheryl Boone Issacs – herself an African-American – downwards. She professed herself “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://variety.com/2016/film/awards/oscars-diversity-academy-statement-1201682500/">heartbroken and frustrated about the lack of inclusion</a>”. We have all seen initiatives, programmes and commitments come and go. Everyone’s fed up with it.</p>

<p>The stars involved are probably well aware of the stick they are inevitably going to attract and what form it will take, even as they bask in support from A-listers <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-35352218">David Oyelowo and Don Cheadle</a> and outriders such as the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/al-sharpton">Rev Al Sharpton</a> (“Hollywood is like the Rocky Mountains: the higher up you get, the whiter it gets”). Not to mention a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/01/19/snoop-dogg-oscars-boycott-video/">profanity-strewn message of solidarity from Snoop Dogg</a>. There is a simple answer to all of this, of course. Hollywood could stop talking about change and start (ahem) acting.</p>

<p>News of more redundancies <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/tata-job-cuts-union-calls-for-government-action">in the steel industry</a> resonated with me, for on arrival in the UK in the 1950s my grandad got a job as a steel worker in Sheffield. As everyone knows, foundry work is hard, and it isn’t greatly rewarded. But what he liked about it helps explain why industries like steel are so much more than just economic units. For a recent arrival in Britain, living in a small, isolated Caribbean community in a northern city, the workforce provided a ready-made social environment where he could interact with others. He was able to build relationships and share in the gossip, jokes and laughter, participate in the common culture.</p>

<p>Environmentalists might not like large-scale works belching smoke and noise, but they are a sign of towns and cities that are alive and active. When these sites close, when silence falls, it blights everything.</p>

<p>My grandad stayed in the north in the 1970s, but my mum and dad moved south from Sheffield to London in the 80s. That was another great migration. They were looking for work of course, but they were looking for something else too: the opportunity to participate and to have a future denied them in the places where they were born. That’s all that most people want. In many parts of Britain, alas, they’re still waiting.</p>

<p>At least my grandad never had to worry where he was in the perennially fascinating British class system. For some of us, though, things have been more problematic.</p>

<p>Last week, after years of denial and self-deception, I decided to confirm to some supportive friends what they will have suspected for a while anyway. The mask is off. I’m no longer working class: I am now identifying as a member of the metropolitan middle-class community.</p>

<p>And don’t talk to me about othering and abuse; my community has been there. “House price obsessive” and “dinner party invitee” – these are just two of the printable examples. But I’ve got a message for all the haters and the trolls. Anyone who shouts “latte drinker” at me on the street can expect to get called out on it.</p>

This boycott would be akin to White athletes boycotting because there were no whites on the podium for Olympic 100m. Or not a representative numbered players in the NbA/NFL etc. No black managers in the Premiership = racism, yet an over representation of players is not! There is pattern here that even those in the depths of denial cannot ignore.

It is the point, because it sounds like some black actor's outstanding performance has been massively overlooked and that is simply not the case [this year]. And if you would go strictly by artistic achievement then ideally the best should win, whatever colour. You could however, argue that if mediocre performances from white actors are going to be honoured, why not a mediocre performance from a back actor instead.

African-Caribbean has replaced the term Afro-Caribbean to refer to Caribbean peoples and those of Caribbean origin who are of African descent. There is now a view that that the term should not be hyphenated and that indeed, the differences between such groups mean the people of African and Caribbean origins should be referred to separately.

I'm honestly struggling to think of any Canadian films. I remember a Canadian comedian joking in an interview that he was appearing in "this year's Canadian film". I think Paul Gross (Due South) stars in each one.

Calm down and stop being so sensitive (not to mention rude). It's an easy mistake to make. Afro-Caribbean/African American. None of us are perfect and we all make mistakes. What most people do usually avoid, though, is being gratuitously rude and humiliating complete strangers in public. You should try practising this yourself.

IIRC, Spike Lee made a very good point in an interview I saw a few years back, stating that there aren't enough black 'gatekeepers' in the movie industry, i.e. too few black people in positions of sufficient power in the business to help get more black-oriented movies greenlit. He knows more than I do about the industry, so I'm prepared to accept his take on that one.

There is no such thing as correct terminology for describing the general physical appearance of people originating from sub-saharan Africa (yeah yeah yeah pendants, I know technically that's all of us). I'm pretty confident in stating that most of these peeps refer to themselves as, and are content to be refered to as, black. Some people in the USA may prefer African American. Some people might prefer 'People of Colour'. But until every single member of this demographic agrees on one particular term, nobody can claim that any one term is correct.

As long as people continue identity politics to describe the past in terminology such as African American as descriptor there will always be a show of alienation in the politics being espoused where groups refuse to relate to each other.

It doesn't make any sense to try to create a 'perfect' distribution of minorities, because every ethnic group has his own subculture, and therefore a different view on art, sports, work etc. etc. 



Author::::Charmant_mais_fou

The US population is approximately 13% black and there are 24 Oscar categories. Assuming this % is also representative of the movie industry as a whole, then any year when 3 or more black people received nominations (as happened in 2013), they would be over-represented.

Please don't bracket Pinkett Smith with Spike Lee. The latter has made some fantastic films and is a true Hollywood innovator.

Yeah old Spike's career is in the toilet. That is why he is doing those dumb commercials. Trying to get his ugly face out there. And what is with the colored glasses. Those went out with the 80s. The man is pathetic. A real loser at this stage of his little life.

That means that realisticly of the 20 nominations for acting, on average 3 nominations can be expected to go to a person of Afro American origin (and a bit more to the aforementioned Latino's and Hispanics)

Nobody has been white-bashing with regard to this subject. Nobody has claimed that black actors and filmmakers should be winning the Oscars. Nobody has said the existing nominees are are all undeserving. Nobody has rubbished 'white artefacts'.
