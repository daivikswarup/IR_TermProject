Be warned – I really don’t give a damn

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>n Wednesday I waited with the front door ajar, freezing wind whistling through the gap and chilling the hallway and me to the brick and bone, for the postman, who had just delivered a parcel into my hands, to be out of earshot before I closed the door, lest the sound of the latch clicking behind him make him feel rejected.</p>

<p>The parcel turned out to be my copy of the book called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/01/drowning-commitments-stop-giving-a-damn-sarah-knight" title="">The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck</a>, by Sarah Knight.</p>

<p>Sometimes even the most rational of us must accept that the universe is trying to tell us something.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/01/drowning-commitments-stop-giving-a-damn-sarah-knight">Drowning in commitments? It's time to stop giving a damn</a> </p>

<p>Now, I have long believed that Marie Kondo’s decluttering bible, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/life-changing-magic-of-tidying.html" title="">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying</a>, ’pon which Knight’s book self-evidently riffs, is essentially the guiding text of a death cult (your stuff is you! Tidy yourself away! Fold yourself into oblivion! Seek annihilation by sock drawer!). But Knight’s paean to mental decluttering is a much more life-affirming prospect. (She is American, of course. If she were British, her book would have been called The Life-Changing Magic of Nothing: Just Get on With It.)</p>

<p>The key practice she advocates is devising for yourself a “fuck budget” – deciding how many times each day you feel obliged to care deeply about something, and then making sure you use your allocation sensibly.</p>

<p>Say, life is good and you have 10 in your emotional arsenal today. You maybe want to give one to sending your child to school in a presentable uniform, three to going the extra mile at work, and one to small talk with a colleague or someone on the train; you still have five to distribute among the many demands on your time and resources when you get home.</p>

<p>On a bad day, you may have three, and you had better husband your resources accordingly (and, probably, warn your husband that your resources are not to be depredated by enquiries about the location of his phone/socks/tax forms).</p>

<p>It’s a beautiful way of streamlining your psyche – actually a worry, anxiety, neurosis and guilt budget all rolled into one. Stick that in your sock drawers, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/23/konmari-tidy-your-house-tidy-your-life" title="">Konverts</a>, and you might find you don’t fear life so much after all.</p>

<p>The reception staff of 90 GPs’ surgeries in Bradford are being sent on a three-hour course to learn how to be polite to patients. More than 800 staff will retrain. This is, on the whole, a mistake. Power-mad, full of unspoken bitterness and a fathomless desire for a nameless vengeance, terrifying doctors’ receptionists are a British institution. And, like most British institutions, they perform an unrecognised but valuable service. They make people stop and think. Am I ill? Yes. Am I ill enough to convince Brenda/Jean/Margery that I need to see a doctor? Not by some considerable margin. And so a good 30% of people pop a couple of aspirin and go to bed without ever bothering their overworked GP.</p>

<p>Some of them will turn out to have quite serious, possibly even fatal, conditions, of course. But no British institution was ever perfect. Brenda, Jean and Margery will write their own chapter of The Life-Changing Magic of Nothing: Just Get On With It.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Japan, McDonald’s has launched McChoco Potatoes – french fries drizzled in milk and/or white chocolate, promising “a wonderful salty and sweet harmonious taste”. Really? To me, chocolate and chips are two things that should never be brought together. Like carpet and tiles, man and bun, homeopathic and medicine. Shut it down, Maccy D. Shut it down.</p>

The local surgery receptionists have been holding the line against 'unneccessary' visits to my GP for years. So well, I suspect, that 'You should have come and seen me ages ago about this' is a familiar GP saying round here. The latest wheeze is "I don't have a doctor here today" and suggestions that you try a branch surgery ten miles away. "But they are terribly busy..."

You might be right. I can't say I understand why Buddhism combines a principle of "unattachment" with a principle of "compassion". I see these principles as being largely independent, but with some degree of opposition - if we're allowed to think of an earnest commitment to compassion as being a type of attachment.

What limited cultural horizons you have! I was brought up on a range of mythologies – Greek and Persian as well as Celtic and Norse, and studied Latin, Greek, French (Oïl and Oc), Italian and Russian; my cultural world includes French, Spanish, Italian, Greek and Russian literature and art. I see myself as primarily a European. 'British' is too small and restrictive, as is the concept of nation-states in general.

With the omission of the central teaching of compassion your description of Buddhism sounds rather like nihilism.

Might want to get your money back from wherever you learned "Buddhism and mindfulness means caring for nothing" - various branches of Buddhism preaches detachment from superficial material value and possession, instead focusing on the fundamentals of equality - they cared not for big mansions, they cared for the vulnerable and disadvantaged who were deemed useless by a material society.

Well done with Frosty Receptions Lucy, it would make a great skit. Characterisation and forensic humour for e.g. Monty Python, Eric Idle, John Cleese or um, Mr Bean, John Bishop ... the receptionist would though always get the upper hand. Please do that someone.

I'm broadly in agreement, but I note your own proviso about Britons who hate Britain. These people, many of whom subscribe to an extreme form of Islam utterly unrelated to the religion of the vast number of Muslims here, make our surveillance society just that bit more paranoid. I hope that many of the poor folk from the middle east, fleeing the incompetence and worse of their own governments, will realise that our form of easy-come easy-go attitude which Brits normally portray, can be lost very quickly when dealing with Islamic stupidity, especially with sex equality. It's a hope, anyway. Nice talking, especially within Lucy's ambit.

You can tell when somebody has finished loading their shopping because their trolley or basket is empty. What really pisses me off is when they've finished loading, but just stand in the way of the belt so you can't get to it. There is only a limited number of times that I can be polite to morons each day, so it grieves me to waste one of my 'excuse me please' on some fuckface who can't think of a reason that they need to move up in the queue.

Apropos McD's. My best experience was in China. For an unusually early breakfast (and the assumption that most of us were from the UK) we were served is a gigantic salver full of beautifully cooked fat chips. That was it. They looked really great and we were are hungry. Till we discovered the chef had evidently sampled his efforts, thought they tasted cr*p, and sprinkled an enormous amount of sugar over the whole lot to improve them. Waaaaahhhhh.

I've been called a social democrat by communists and Trots, a communist by my Empire loyalist father who fought for six years, a Unionista by pro-Scottish independence supporters, an English bastard at a football match (both of which epithets are correct by the way, although the caller was not to know one of them), a traitor by a member of the military when trying (successfully) to stop the false imprisonment of a young naval recruit unjustly accused of a crime, and finally, and truthfully, a member of the Labour party for nearly thirty years this time. (I left because of Benn). I hate labels, indeed, many nouns; what does centre-left mean, for example? What does 'indigenous people of Britain' mean? I ask these questions sincerely, without irony or sarcasm or special pleading. So, in a nutshell (!), this is me, a mass of inconsistencies in an ever-changing world. I'd like to see the Labour party back in power sorting out the social morass into which this country has fallen. Thanks for your post.

Having travelled around the UK a bit and needing to use a Ventolin inhaler I have been a patient at a fair number of surgeries. I have noticed a definite link between the ferocity of the receptionist and the general efficiency of the practice, the more dragon-like the resident of the front desk the worse your experience is likely to be. Maybe these ladies (and they are always ladies) just get angry and frustrated because they lack the skills to do their job properly.

Others have said it no doubt, the ironic contradiction in caring enough to buy a book to teach you not to care. (All these books seem like self-deception, delaying tactics to signal your intentions to self and others without actually actioning that which is straightforward in principle and doesn't need a book).
