<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he Israeli-Palestinian conflict and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/at-least-10-israelis-stabbed-tel-aviv-israel" title="">the recent wave of violence</a> are widely covered and discussed. In contrast, there is very little awareness of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/11/israel-domination-palestinians-violence-inevitable" title="">Palestinians who are also citizens of Israel</a>. Despite representing a sizeable minority – 20% of Israeli society – and holding a unique position of deep connections with both, our complexity remains an untold story.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">It’s time to embrace more complex identities that struggle with conflicting narratives and embody contradictions</p>

<p>As a native minority living in Israel, we are tossed on the waves of political whim, and given hope only as a charade, as it is dashed before our eyes. This seems to be our fate. In the past month we have experienced a pendulum swing of extremes, from the Israeli government passing <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/government-okays-nis-15b-upgrade-plan-for-arab-communities/" title="">an economic plan to inject almost $4bn</a> into Arab society, and narrow some of the most stark disparities; to prime minister <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.695099" title="">Binyamin Netanyahu’s speech</a> at the site of a murderous attack in Tel Aviv where he held all of Arab society accountable for the actions of a madman. This is far from an exception, rather the rule itself. Palestinian citizens of Israel are at best a political pawn, more often a forgotten or dismissed entity.</p>

<p>Only yesterday, I received a phone call from an Israeli newspaper, asking me to comment on a survey showing that 50% of Israelis are pro-transfer – moving Arab Israelis from their homes. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Kahane" title="">Meir Kahane’s ideas</a>, outlawed in the 1980s for being too extreme and inhumane, are back on the table. I don’t think this survey reflects reality – a yes or no question in such a matter is a very simplistic way of treating it – but it is striking when given that simplistic choice half of Israelis answered yes.</p>

<p>As a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://" title="">Palestinian musician and artist</a> living and working in the heart of Israeli society, I am often torn. Between loyalty to my individual passions, my artistic freedom and my national responsibilities. Between integrating into Israeli society, yet remaining true to Palestinian culture and the struggle for equality. When I represented Israel at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RN8B1xvCxI0" title="">Eurovision Song Contest</a> in 2009 together with the Jewish-Israeli singer Noa, the pressure from my Palestinian compatriots to withdraw was overwhelming. And, when I voiced my feelings against the escalation of the Israeli army’s actions within Gaza at the time, I was branded “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.miraawad.co/#!My-TEDx-talk/cx4y/46300C09-49AB-472D-93F0-528D096F207E" title="">an enemy from within</a>” by Jewish-Israelis. My <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.facebook.com/miraawad/" title="">Facebook feed</a> labels me both a fig leaf for the occupation or a terrorist, depending on which day of the week it is, sometimes both at the same time.</p>

<p>Recently Israel’s minister of arts and culture threatened to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/01/israel-loyalty-in-culture-bill-debate-fascism-miri-regev-art-free-speech" title="">withdraw state funding</a> from the only Arabic-speaking theatre in Israel, as the plays were deviating from the Zionist narrative. I voiced my protest, and joined a delegation of Arab and Jewish artists to meet the minister in question at president Reuven Rivlin’s residence and challenge the accusations. Once again, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.jewishnews.co.uk/israeli-arab-singer-mira-awad-ive-been-attacked-from-all-sides/" title="">I was hit from both directions</a>, accused of being a “fifth column” by some, for supporting non-Zionist content, and a “collaborator” by others, for simply agreeing to meet Israeli officials.</p>

<p>Within this flux of complexity and criticism, I have a vantage point of both Israeli and Palestinian society, which might enable navigating a road map out of a conflict that is seemingly unending. It is for this reason that my work offers a bridge between the arts and promoting peace. I sit on the board of a major Arab-Jewish NGO, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.abrahamfund.org/" title="">the Abraham Fund Initiatives,</a> symbolically named after the father of both nations, and increasingly find my work providing a backdrop to discourse on conflict mitigation and tolerance building.</p>

<p>Yet these are stormy times, and discussing peace only seems to breed a greater suspicion, as if each side should play its role and radicalise in reaction to the other. As if this needed further complication, broader Arab society in the Middle East refuses to recognise my existence. A glaring illustration has been the refusal of the Arab version of the TV show The Voice to credit my music, which they are <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://esctoday.com/107193/israel-mira-awad-sings-for-dialogue-and-coexistence/" title="">currently using for their adverts</a>. The show is no stranger to Palestinian Israelis, and there have been contestants from within the Israeli borders who have performed under the Palestinian flag because their Israeli passports would not allow them entry into Lebanon where the programme is recorded. However, my case is not so simple to solve. Maybe it is my open identification as both Palestinian and Israeli that has created a subconscious justification for the show’s producers to use my music without permission; maybe it’s just that they can – after all, a Palestinian Israeli appears to be a second-class citizen in every setting.</p>

<p>The little solace I find in having my music stolen by the most popular TV show in the Arab world is that the song they chose to use is called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuLtQDs1Gb0" title="">Bahlawan</a>, meaning acrobat. It is a song that discusses among other things the complexity of a Palestinian Israeli: “Walking on a tightrope<br/>My arms stretched to the sides<br/>No guarantee, no shield<br/>An acrobat with no safety net.”</p>

<p>We’re living in complex times, yet our discourse is becoming less sophisticated. It’s time to embrace more complex identities that struggle with conflicting narratives and embody contradictions. I know of no better place to start than the Palestinians who are also Israeli citizens. Hearing our voice could be a linchpin in redefining the Israel-Palestine conflict.</p>

<p>It is time to recognise the acrobats.</p>

No. The reason Israel is in the UEFA is because the Arabs wouldn't play them and the Israeli teams would have to fear for the lives of their players.Thus its in the UEFA.

Well said. I lived there for 13 years, and would just want to say that it's not perfect; there are barriers to absolute equality. But yes, I'm sure anyone who knows Israel at all well recognises your description.

I would have replied sooner to some of the people who have no idea at all about what apartheid is, but I had to go to the mall, which since it is Thursday means that the Arab Israelis are there in force so we had to wait our time behind them in several queues, because they were waiting for service in front of us, and since there is no racial discrimination here we did not get several service.

Sorry, mate, but let's not be too clever about it: we both know that the charade of independence that Israel has granted the West Bank and Gaza is purely and solely to keep Arabs off the Israeli electoral roll. The IDF can march in and out of either territory whenever they please, and they often do. These territories are merely corrupt and badly-governed puppet states, as remote from true independence as any apartheid Bantustan.

There are too many extremists on both sides of the issue. Until Netanyahu and Abbas can speak to one another in a civil manner peace will never come to the area. Who knows, maybe deep down neither side wants to change the status quo. Hate begets hate love begets love.

Peace means living together as good neighbors, with all the problematics of being a minority. I live in the North of Israel. It ain't perfect, but I can tell anyone that Arab and Jews mingle alot--where else can we go say, where I live in the Nazareth-Upper Nazareth region, and I dare anyone to walk in any of the Malls, or the Cinemas, or restaurants, or any of the public places. Then too, where is a Anab Moslem kid with "more traditional" parents going to drink a bottle of beer, or show some independance, "like the Israelis".

A better place to be a Jewish Israeli rather than a Palestinian which is the point! You seem to accept that rights should be allocated on the basis of ethnic or religious background.

Where did I say that exactly? I've never denied that Israel is sometimes roundly deserving of criticism. But the situation as presented by you above - and a tiresome number of people on the left in the UK (of which I count myself a member) - is fatuously one-sided and counterproductive. But you probably know this.

Are you saying that the West Bank is actually part of Israel then. Please try selling that at the next hate israel event you attend and report back what your cohorts view are. The West bank is governed by the Palastinian Authority who are in a unity government with the lovely hamas.

"Your singing partner has justified the indiscriminate killing of Palestinians, actions which led the UN agencies and human rights organizations to call for war crimes investigations. What is worse, now you will be a partner in this justification, in front of the entire world. Whether you like it or not, your performance will be used to help Israel whitewash its atrocities in the Gaza Strip."

Mira Awad represents the essence of the conflict in trying to deal with her own in a sane and unfortunately atypical way, but as long as Arab Israelis continue to define themselves as Palestinians first and Israelis second no resolution of the conflict is possible.

Oh yes? No illegal settlements on stolen land, no chopping down of Palestinian groves, no apartheid highways, no forced evictions in east Jerusalem, no nuclear weapons? Not even a tiny little one? It doesn't sound like the place I know at all.

The sight of an Israeli Jew and an Israeli Arab performing together drives the BDS bigots into apoplectic fits. I doubt the jihadists in Gaza take it too well, either.
