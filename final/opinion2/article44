Happy Valley has become Britain’s version of The Wire

<p>This should come as no surprise given that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/07/sally-wainwright-writer-happy-valley-second-series" title="">Sally Wainwright</a>, the show’s creator, has been responsible for what feels like every British hit save for Downton Abbey in the past few years: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/nov/03/sally-wainwright-last-tango-halifax" title="">Last Tango in Halifax</a>, which also played well in the US; and the crime drama <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/apr/03/scott-and-bailey-british-cagney-and-lacey" title="">Scott and Bailey</a>.</p>

<p>She should be mentioned in the same breath as Matthew Weiner or Aaron Sorkin or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/why-i-love-shonda-rhimes-screenwriter" title="">Shonda Rhimes</a> or Jenji Kohan, or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/02/the-people-v-oj-simpson-ryan-murphy-american-dream" title="">Ryan Murphy</a>, who is a terrible writer but still signed a reported $24m development deal with Fox a few years ago, because that’s how the US treats star showrunners.</p>

<p>Wainwright, meanwhile, only won her first Bafta in 2013 and was turned down by ITV a few years ago for a second season of Unforgiven, her three-part drama that was as good as everything else she writes. Well done, chaps!</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Compared to Happy Valley, even Broadchurch looks thin and phoney</p>

<p>One of the reasons for Wainwright’s success in the US is that, perversely, she isn’t courting it. Americans I know who love Happy Valley do so because it is a window into another world, just as British viewers felt transported while watching The Wire. It’s a quality that draws attention to the inferiority-complex under which so many British dramas labour – the fake American gloss of Luther, say, or Line of Duty. Compared to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/happy-valley">Happy Valley</a>, even Broadchurch looks thin and phoney.</p>

<p>The show’s success is also, of course, down to a superlative cast – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/03/happy-valley-end-of-series-tv-review-mark-lawson" title="">Sarah Lancashire</a> is, at this point, inching into Dame Judi territory – and a lot of great writing. A tiny example: two women parting company after a night out and one says to the other, “text me as soon you get in”, which is a thing women say to each other in real life and not on TV, unless one of them is about to be murdered by the cab driver.</p>

<p>And the scene between Catherine and the therapist, which in lesser hands might have been played for laughs but was instead real, awkward and fraught with moral complexity.</p>

<p>I’m sure Wainwright does very nicely indeed, but, looking across the international TV landscape, it’s hard not to feel she isn’t getting her dues. If David Simon gets a 10,000-word profile in the Paris Review, so too should Wainwright.</p>

<p>With one episode left, I asked American friends how they were coping with the Yorkshire accents. Most said they’d gotten the hang of “’appen I did” and “us” as a possessive pronoun, as in “Us dad died when we were tiny.” But there was still a lot of confusion. I ask a friend to have a stab at, “down at cafe that does us butties”, and he said: “Something to do with his ass?”</p>

<p>“Whose arse?”</p>

<p>He looked panicked. “I don’t know. I heard the word butt.”</p>

<p>“It’s about a sandwich.”</p>

<p>“OK, I’m not getting sandwich.”</p>

<p>“What about ‘Up Ripponden’?”</p>

<p>I then had him pronounce “Sowerby Bridge” over and over, which was better comedy than anything I’ve seen for a long time.</p>

<p>This week was the Downton finale in the US. A few months ago I heard <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/julian-fellowes">Julian Fellowes</a> interviewed by an American journalist, who asked him: “Where are you in the hierarchy?” To which, after a long pause, he replied: “I came, I suppose, from the sort of bottom of the top. We didn’t have much money, my grandfather was a younger son.”</p>

<p>There followed more caveats, no little pain at the vulgarity of having to articulate all this, and a final assessment of his family’s aristocratic position as a “minor one, but in the books”. Great drama.</p>

I love my window into British culture through television (I include Scotland, Wales and Ireland shows as well). And thus, it's very annoying to have an American actor or character inserted. What for? I should wonder why anyone at ITV or BBC thinks that Americans take the trouble to watch their shows to see Americans? And for some reason the Americans they choose have horrible accents or fake southern ones like a character had on MI-5. And, Netflix does have English subtitles if you need it. I just don't think it's a big deal because some of the expressions are a bit different. We will get it. And, I wish they hadn't killed off Joe Armstrong's character in HV. He could have been a real fly in the ointment for Catherine.

I think this season has been wildly overdone, soapy and some of the acting cartoonish to say the least.

Never seen Breaking Bad or The Wire, missed out on both I'm afraid, though I am a great fan of the nearly a Yorkshireman and Crucible supporter Dominic West.

pardon? I'm being serious. I dont have access to TV, only netflix as I live in Latvia now... but see much about these shows.After watching Broadchurch, I have struggled to find a show that grips me... so I want to know if The Wire or Happy Valley would suffice.

Do you know 'Winter's Bone'? Films like that and 'Dead Man's Shoes' could so easily be interchangeable as to location.

I think we're both fans of both, and it's good that there's so much excellent stuff on tv. No one, incidentally, seems to have mentioned Breaking Bad in this pantheon of tv dramas - I thought it better thanThe Wire overall.

No, he will steal a motorcycle combination, Sarah Lancashire will give chase and jump in the sidecar, at some point the sidecar will become detached, go the opposite way around a tree, the miraculously re-attach itself, the whole plot will run into the canal, and they will emerge handcuffed together with ducks on their heads, how's that?

When the ditzy Raquel did a scene in the room at the back of The Rover's Return when she had found out her then boyfriend Des cheated on her and she told him what she felt - I literally sat up and said "my God she is brilliant". For me, it was the first time I really took note of Sarah and have followed her career since. If you can get to see this episode on YouTube or somewhere - it is certainly worth another look.

I must say that Siobhan completely fooled me when she was in Downton - I did not realize it was her as the horrible maid to Cora, Countess of Grantham until I checked the cast list. I had seen her for years in TV shows like Heartbeat, Clocking Off, etc but was completed floored when I realized she was O'Brien in Downton - she too is a great actor.



Author::::FrannyV

What about Last Tango In Halifax? That's not doom and gloom and also written by Sally Wainwright. HV is a police story so it is likely to be pretty grim wherever it is set.



Author::::FrannyV

Don't forget he is also in War and Peace if you get this show in your area - James is really a brilliant actor.

I don't think of Happy Valley any more as social history than Downton though I suppose as period vs contemporary drama both have a focus that distorts in different ways, one giving a warm glow, the other the horrors of the 'grunge' of its setting; just one awful event on top of another. HV is not entirely low life though insofar as it rubs up against the superficially respectable and marginally more middle class side of the valley. I'm surprised it has not caused more upset with the residents of the locale and doubt it will encourage as much tourism as Last of the Summer wine did for its neighbours on the other side of the M62.

Well, Downton is a very highly skilled product and, unlike many, I don't downgrade it because it has a gloss, is beautifully dressed, has wit and is mostly nonsense as social history. Happy V. may look more convincing as social history possibly, but the grunge factor is only another device tv writers use for their fictions, and most lowlife tv dramas are utterly bogus. Also, the fact that dialogue is more demotic or regional-sounding doesn't necessarily make it more authentic (or better-written). Good dialogue is actually almost NEVER how people actually speak. . .

Absolutely love this show. Complex, interesting characters. Amazing bad guy in the first season - can't believe it is the same actor who plays Reverend Sidney Chambers. He did such a good job, that I had to double check the credits to make sure it was the same actor. I cannot wait until my local library gets the second season.

I should add that I do really like the show. It's just that it's very clear it's written by a woman with its generally negative depiction of male characters (of course there are many dramas where the opposite is true as well).



Author::::Paul Finnigan

I wasn't using confirmation bias. Feel free to highlight the show's many male characters who are not murderers or emotionally weak.

The Wire treated it's intended audience as mature viewers,who if they followed the show attentively would be rewarded by the greater understanding of the topics embraced in the story. That meant quite a bit of work required by the viewer. No missed viewing minutes,as a concious decision was made by the writers not to repeat them selves ever.

The last season of Justified was good again, though S2 is the best. Overall it was a terrific series. Some of the plots are far-fetched, but personally I much prefer it to Happy Valley, as I have a very limited tolerance for Sarah Lancashire (and I'm afraid I think Sally Wainwright's a bit over-rated).

Do they need subtitles I wonder? This is the only show that I have needed to put them on, it isn't the accent, it is the mumbling diction that renders it incomprehensible at times.

The one false note in the dialogue of 'Happy Valley' I heard was when a police spokesman was quoted on a radio broadcast referring to 'the community'.

It is pronounced Sorby Bridge. Correct. Where people, particularly actors get tripped up is assuming the "s" in " ' dad" stands for us. It doesn't. It's really used as a contraction of "our". There again I've only lived here seventy years so what do I know?

"no offense" is an interesting one. I have seen it advertised outside the uk as "so british". In case anyone is expecting it to be midsommer murders, Don't. It is very funny at times, although it is about a serial killer who attacks Down's syndrome prostitues.

Downton was highly entertaining, mainly because it sent itself up and wasn't meant to be taken seriously. Happy Valley is much better written, certainly in terms of dialogue, and takes itself more seriously; perhaps, sometimes, too much so. Both are enjoyable and well acted but, despite its failings, HV has the edge on quality, detail and durability.
