They call this Ghostbusters reboot feminist. Not for black women

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen Twitter began to buzz that the first <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw" title="">Ghostbusters reboot trailer</a> had been released, I was anxious to see if it would soothe my uneasiness over the casting of three white female leads and one black woman as the sole representation of “diversity” among the eponymous heroes.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the trailer eviscerated my oh-so-low expectations by sinking to the racist low of the 1984 original. Leslie Jones’s character, Patty Tolan, is presented in the film’s first trailer next to three “brilliant” white female scientists as the seemingly intellectually inferior token black woman with street sense and a Cadillac.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s progress that Jones’s character is afforded the opportunity to be featured in film advertisements at all. In 1984, Ernie Hudson and his character, Winston Zeddemore – also the only team member who wasn’t an academic – was completely excluded from the trailer’s actor credits and character introductions.</p>

<p>Zeddemore first appears at the 1:13 mark of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vntAEVjPBzQ" title="">original trailer</a> with his face halfway cut off the right side of the screen. Then he mysteriously appears in five more frames without any explanation of who this sole black man in costume is.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ew.com/article/2014/11/05/ghostbusters-ernie-hudson" title="">Hudson penned an editorial</a> about his experience with the Ghostbusters franchise. He found himself being negotiated out of his deserved pay, his role later gutted, and was excluded from the marketing.</p>

<p>As a daddy’s girl, I often found myself snuggled up next to my father and laughing at the ridiculous high jinks of the original pair of movies. I had some hope that Columbia Pictures would bring us a reboot that I could enjoy now I’m aware of the racial issues at play. Instead, the studio squandered an opportunity to rebuild characters in a way that provides a more inclusive representation of women than its male-centred films.</p>

<p>With three leading female characters, the film features no Latina, Asian or Indigenous women and simply opts to fulfil its black quota as a nod to the original storyline. Jones’s sassy black character is a transit worker for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, providing her with the skills necessary to track down ghosts across New York. But as the only representation of race and class commentary in the trailer, it ultimately pathologises the working class and blackness by making the two synonymous with a seemingly inept character.</p>

<p>The trailer juxtaposes Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon as three experts in each of their scientific fields, then we cut to Jones. She enters with: “I’m here to join the club. You guys are really smart about this science stuff.” This limits her character to an academically aloof, street savvy black woman who is apparently only allowed in the crew (and in the film) because of her familiarity with New York City.</p>

<p>I wasn’t the only viewer to be offended by the characterisation of the sole black character in the trailer. Jones has since <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/07/ghostbusters-leslie-jones-defends-remake-racial-stereotyping-criticism" title="">defended her role</a> asking her critics: “Why can’t a regular person be a ghostbuster?” And she is right, a regular person should be able to be a member of the Ghostbusters team. But we have to ask why the only “regular” ghostbuster has to be black. Again. Why is blackness conflated with “regular”, essentially designating the white characters as irregularly exceptional people?</p>

<p>It’s reassuring that Jones does not feel misrepresented in the editing of her role, which commonly happens to black people in film. However, we cannot ignore how racism and sexism limit the representations black women see of ourselves to characters that fall far too flat in comparison with our real-life, wide-ranging intricacies.</p>

<p>The 2016 reboot has been hailed as a new, feminist <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a>. But praising white women’s access to roles that challenge patriarchy yet simultaneously harm black women through perpetuating racist tropes can only be feminist if the word has no meaning.</p>

<p>Where white women stand on the backs of black women, and other women of colour, to gain success and power, feminism is not present. And the claim that the film somehow represents the practice of feminist casting and characters can only hold true if you do the mental gymnastics necessary to deny the fact that black women are women, too.</p>

<p>Although this trailer is the first we have seen of the film, and we have yet to see where the character development or storylines will lead, I won’t be heading to the theatres paying to watch a film that shrinks black womanhood for the ease of the white gaze in its marketing.</p>

True dat, apparently people are now offended because other people have a problem with black stereotypes.

I don't think the claim is bogus with this one though: the black character is even more of a stereotype than Winston was ( a character in a film made thirty years ago). It isn't a big issue for me but I can see what the author is getting at.

I don't think it really has anything to do with political correctness: it is simply asking the question of why wasn't the black character also a scientist? It isn't PC gone mad to point out that the black character is a bit of a stereotype. It would've been fine for the black character to be an average Joe like Winston provided she wasn't also a stereotype to boot.

Your comment doesn't really make sense, the author is saying that the black character seems like a stereotype and she has a point. What we have is a character who seems like more of a stereotype than Winston was (a black character in the original movie from thirty years ago.) It doesn't evince Hollywood has made much progress.

Murray's in the film. Personally, I think he wants the franchise to be left alone to die, so he stops getting pestered about it. I think he saw this script and thought

Janessa E Robinson, the original film had the 3 white men as the main characters and only Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) came in later in the film as extra help as the Ghostbusters workload increased....hence why in the trailers, he has a "bit" part. The official trailer shows many clips of him, even though his role for the team was to be a skeptic / un-believer with no paranormal /scientific education...hence a small acting role.

Statistically, white women are more likely to be care workers than scientists - should the team have been made up of them to be representative as well?

Representation matters. When female, black, disabled, LGBT children grow up never seeing themselves represented in the media, or only in certain stereotyped roles, it makes them feel invisible, unworthy, and limits their dreams. Is this boring?

An article written by a person who has clearly not seen the original. At the very least they've not understood it, which would make them a bit dumb in anyone's book. It's not racist. The character in the original was black without issue. Black Bond and White Shaft next? Not because it would be novel, but because we should have balance, because clearly Commander Bond was clearly not white or British and Shaft went to Eton. Perhaps Damian Lewis could play him?

The thing is, most regular people are quite happy for minorities and gay people to be on tv and have leading roles. It's this concept of the 'moral police' looking for any excuse to scream racism that annoys us.

Oh my, my, my seems that this lady struck a nerve with the whiny brigade of butthurt white folks! Because as we all know movies with white people are ALWAYS good and ALWAYS worth the money and all the actors are ALWAYS talented as least more talented than the whiners[ they said as they whined to get their point of privilege across] oh the irony!! I meant HYPOCRISY!

well statistically, if you have four people and one is african origin and three are anglo-saxon origin, the african origin is much more likely - if randomly selected - to be less intelligent than the other three. Look up the many many studies into IQ levels in different demographic groups.

It seems like every major new film gets scrutinised under the lens of how many women/ethnic minorities there are in it and whether they reinforce stereotypes. I understand that these aspects can be a part of genuine film criticism, but I'm starting to get tired of articles declaiming this or that movie to be racist, sexist, or guilty of 'cultural appropriation,' especially when the claim is bogus. Let's tread back to the good old solid ground of talking about acting, cinematography and themes of films.

The thing that white women forgot about social justice is that they lose power and privilege along with white men. Suck. On. That.
