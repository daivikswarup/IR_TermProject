The Guardian view on Seamus Heaney: Virgilian farewell




DateTime::::2016-03-11T18:49:16+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen Seamus Heaney died in 2013, his last words, to his wife, were <em>Noli timere</em> – be not afeard. He sent them in a text message to his wife. This simple gesture – the ringing phrase of St Jerome’s Vulgate Bible transformed into a tender comfort to the woman he loved – seems completely characteristic of the poet. The mythical mapped on to the personal; the poetry of ages traced on to the human trials of life, illness and death. There was, too, a hint of humour: the poet’s daughter <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b072hlnt" title="">Catherine has recounted</a> how her father, who studied Latin at school and university, would trade quips in the language with his family (the exclamation “holy smoke” became <em>sanctus fumus</em>).</p>

<p>At the time of his death, Heaney was working on a translation of the sixth book of Virgil’s Aeneid, which Faber &amp; Faber is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/376350/s/aeneid-book-vi/" title="">now publishing</a>: BBC Radio 4 listeners have been treated to Sir Ian McKellen’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qftk" title="">imposing readings</a> of it through the week. In his introduction, Heaney wrote of the endeavour, playfully, as “classics homework” – the long-nurtured desire to honour the memory of his boyhood Latin teacher who taught him not this section of Virgil’s great epic but the ninth book, and who would occasionally exclaim, “Och boys, I wish it were Book VI.”</p>

<p>In this part of the poem, the hero Aeneas finally makes landfall in Italy, after numerous reversals and disasters. Arriving at Cumae, he grasps the golden bough that grows among the woods of Avernus and descends to the Underworld. There, amid the frightening sights – the crowds of the unburied dead clamouring to climb aboard Charon’s boat across the Styx, the grim fortress where wrongdoers are punished, the writhing Titans chained in the cavernous depths – amid all this wonder and terror Aeneas encounters the shade of his dead father, and the lines are loss encapsulated. “Three times he tried to reach arms round that neck./ Three times the form, reached for in vain, escaped/ Like a breeze between his hands, a dream on wings.”</p>

<p>If poems as refulgent and generous as the Aeneid can pour out fresh meaning to readers in every generation, the Aeneid of now, Heaney’s Aeneid, is the poem of exile, of migrants forced from a war-ruined city to seek an uncertain future, with all the loss and terror, and faintest pricklings of distant hope, that that entails.</p>

Your point being? (Reads like something parachuted in from an undergrad essay (itself reliant on 'secondary sources').

Heaney falls short, I think, of Virgil’s image in writing “a dream on wings”. That would be, more naturally, “uolucri somnio”, but Virgil writes “somno”, not “somnio”. It is rare for “somnus” to mean a dream and I don’t think it does here. Virgil is saying that the ghost of Anchises slips though Aeneas’s hands “like winged sleep”.

Why no meaty excerpt from Heaney's translation, so we readers can get a taster?

But he also claimed too much at times. The Irish do, it's part of the self-mythologizing. I was surprised recently to come across the place-name 'terfyn' twice in my own newly adopted parish in north Wales. I recognised the word immediately from the Heaney farm and from its roots in the Latin 'terminus'. Whatever he claimed to be, Heaney was also cross-referenced. After all, 'everywhere being nowhere who can claim one place more than another?'

And apart from that, even when Heaney was writing directly about what was happening in Ireland, the poems were resonant and had a far wider application that any emphasis on politics would allow and of course he was like Yeats in that. S, I could think you were right to talk about spin because that's journalism for you; it looks for an angle that misses so much out. I've been to Aleppo twice and I've seen them 'besieged within the siege, whispering morse'.

No, I agree, I have a lot of empathy for those who have to endure or fight or escape from Assad's rule (or his barrel bombs) and Islamist incursions in Syria, it must be a terrible situation (the same goes for those from other trouble spots or those who are daily crushed by poverty). At the same time, I don't believe that mass migration to Europe can be a sustainable solution to the world's many problems in general or to the Syrian civil war in particular; if it could, I'd support it. Nonetheless, it's happening whether we support it or not.

Seamus Heaney was born near Castledawson, County Derry in Northern Ireland on 13 April, 1939, the year W.B. Yeats died. Yeats remains the greatest of all Irish poets and, with T.S. Eliot, the most iconic and influential modernist poet in English. Although the American poet Robert Lowell esteemed him as "the most important Irish poet since Yeats," Heaney may look back more to Wordsworth than to Yeats in terms of affinity and influence, while he also engaged with and learnt from poets from eastern Europe like the Pole Czeslaw Milosz. By 1995, when he received the Nobel Prize for Literature "for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past," Heaney had already become one of the greatest poets of the postwar period and, with Derek Walcott and Christopher Okigbo, one of the three most distinguished poets to appear in English during the 1960s. By the time of his death in Dublin, Republic of Ireland on 30 August 2013, having suffered a stroke in 2006, he had already created the most remarkable body of work by any poet to emerge from the British Isles since the Second World War. Yes, he once bristled at being included in an anthology of British poetry with this poetically expressed quip:

An excellent review encouraging readers to "listen again".

Many if a minority of those escaping the hellhole created by Darsham and Assad tried to resist, rebel and fight before escaping and migrating. Not everything in the world fits into neat "either/or" schemes. Heaney, as with his writing during the Troubles, was able to draft something that makes sense in isolation but is much richer when the allusions are recognised. It seems a pity to use such negative language ("political spin") instead of engaging in respectful debate.

But Aeneas is not so much a refugee (he didn't flee from the Trojan War, he fought in it, only making his escape when Troy was defeated) as a colonist, founding Lavinium which would later become Rome (and thereby providing a grand origin myth for the city, along with that of Romulus and Remus), despite local opposition and conflict with the Rutuli. If he were merely looking for safety, he could have lived quite happily ever after with Dido in Cathage, instead of leading her on and subsequently shafting her in favour of the "manifest destiny" that led him onwards to Hesperia [lit. the Western land, i.e. the Italian peninsula].

Seamus Heaney's ability to explore great themes in a language we can all appreciate shines through this final text. We should be grateful for the pleasure of reading it.Chris McDonnell

A fitting epitaph might also be his poem "postscript", which says as much about being in the moment as anything else I have read.

Thank God it has been translated into something I will understand. In school in the fifties I had no idea what it was all about. I will get the book when it 's available.
