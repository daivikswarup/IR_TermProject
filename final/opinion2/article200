Don’t knock dead whale selfies

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen a sperm whale was washed up on the Norfolk coast, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Browne" title="">Thomas Browne</a> raced from his home to inspect the animal. Braving an “abominable scent”, Browne took samples and roasted some flesh in an attempt to discover the secret of the “oyl” or spermaceti after which the whale is named.</p>

<p>This great polymath and 17th century scientist wasn’t the only disrespectful whale poker. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2009/08/06/jan-saenredams-whale/" title="">A 1602 engraving by Dutch artist Jan Saenredam</a> depicts crowds around another stranded whale: people clamber on it; one holds up a toddler to see it better. Our curiosity when these deep-sea mammals are washed into our shallows is timeless. But our condemnation of such sightseers is a very modern phenomenon.</p>

<p>There has been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3414438/Tragic-pictures-three-dead-sperm-whales-washed-UK-beach-hours-caught-low-tide-died.html" title="">anger over the fact that a few people took smiling selfies</a> by three sperm whales found dead on Skegness beach this weekend. Particular rage has been directed against a dad and his toddler son, grinning together, in front of a mighty jaw. The authorities erect cordons and warn that dead whales are a health risk but these dead creatures still apparently made Skegness as busy as a bank holiday. In Hunstanton, where <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/24/three-dead-sperm-whales-skegness-beach" title="">a fourth whale distressingly died on Friday night</a>, hundreds of people clambered over rocks to view it. A fifth washed up today in Wainfleet.</p>

<p>I think it’s heartening that we are still so curious about a dead whale – it would be more tragic if one was stranded and no one took a look. What if that smiling toddler’s cetacean encounter bequeaths a lifelong love? He’s far less likely to acquire a fascination for the wild by watching a documentary on TV.</p>

<p>Obviously <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/25/fifth-whale-reported-washed-up-on-lincolnshire-beach" title="">we shouldn’t spray “CND” on a whale tail </a>(as has happened in Skegness) or ride the carcass (as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17285112" title="">people did on a minke whale washed ashore in Barry in 2009</a>). It is right that only scientists are allowed to cut away the jaw or flesh to discover why these animals died. But can’t we admire these whales without inhibition? The reason we are expected to behave in the presence of a dead whale with the same decorum as when attending a funeral is because the whale is such a powerful symbol of the harm we are inflicting on our wild world.</p>

<p>As Hugh Aldersey-Williams <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.hughalderseywilliams.com/" title="">writes in The Adventures of Sir Thomas Browne in the 21st Century</a>, whale strandings were considered an ominous symbol of squandered riches 400 years ago. “We read a different loss,” he writes, “the loss that we are inflicting upon nature, and the loss that this in turn threatens to inflict on our own species. The vast, ungainly mammal, crashing blindly round the planet, is us.”</p>

<p>I’ve discovered a new pleasure on a midwinter Sunday evening. A small band of obsessives have designated 8-9pm as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wildflowerhour" title="">#wildflowerhour</a>, when they post their latest photographs on Twitter. I assumed it would be a few snowdrops, gorse and the odd early crocus but no, there is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/lisa_scouler/status/691356802248790017" title="">cherry blossom in Sunderland</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/maezymare/status/691355565096833025" title="">campion in Cornwall</a> and a delicate nodding red flower called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/Ians4AD/status/691352689385553920" title="">water aven</a>, which Wikipedia tells me is supposed to flower between May and September. I never imagined social media <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/NTMatthewOates/status/688101075459551232" title="">could be such a nice way to dream of spring</a>.</p>

<p>Shiny car showrooms need 15,000 new mechanics to cope with a soaring demand for repairs, according to the National Franchised Dealers Association. This is because Britain’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nfda-uk.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/" title="">new car boom</a> (a record 2.6m new cars) is based on three-year contracts which tie drivers to main-dealer servicing. It’s not hard to see that this spells doom for independent garages. My local garage has superbly, and cheaply, nursed along my 13-year-old car. Shiny overalls don’t guarantee anything.</p>

A dead whale washed up on UK shores is the personal property of the monarch (along with all smaller cetaceans, and sturgeon).

There is inside the sperm whales high forehead a contained bubble of oil , it is slightly milky , hence the name "sperm" whale i think it is the finest grade of oil available even manufacturing and refining other whale oils cannot equal it , it is thought to be part of its "sonar" system but this is not proven as i don't think other whales have this .

This behaviour is a symptom of the attention-seeking and/or voyeuristic degeneracy that is endemic in our progressive society. Not that I'm complaining. Personally I find it useful for identifying and avoiding trashy people.

I think you may have missed the idea that my comment was not serious. It was just that if you look at it logically (and you shouldn’t apply logic to language), you might say that the opposite of “nothing wrong” was “nothing right”. The danger of taking it so might have been the reason for changing the headline. In fact, it’s hard to say what the opposite of “nothing wrong” is or whether there even is one. We might be able to define what is true if that statement (the original headline) is not true, but not necessarily what is true if the opposite of it is true.

I care about the fact that a large pod of young whales has been lost in the shallows. I do not give a hoot about the shallow people who focus on the selfies issue. I don't suppose that would be the whales main focus either, a whale may be offended by death at the hands of man, I doubt in death they are offended by a man's selfie.

Go see the spectacle, record it for posterity, discuss it with other onlookers, barbeque its flesh if you're curious to taste it... Great. But when you pose for a selfie, grinning like an airhead, whilst encouraging your kids to follow suit? I wonder what the Inuit would think of such pillocks.

I remember reading that the teeth are aged , then engraved and sold as antiques as scrimshaw , apparently hard to detect without destroying the object itself . There are plastic fakes but you put a hot pin to those and are soon detected .In Nottingham there is a pub that has on display in the bar a shoulder blade of a sperm whale . This used to hang outside but was taken down as it was deteriorating and became unsafe it was claimed , health and safety gone mad if you ask me as if you were to be killed by a dead whale your name will live in legend forever , It dates i think from the 19th century brought home as a souvenir by some sailor .The pub was i think "The Royal Children " ,

I will be upset when it's time to take the dog down the the lower orchard with the 12 bore and put him in the ground. Other than that I don't have any emotional pain when animals die. I'm shooting pheasant tomorrow if it's not too windy.

Disagree - having a selfie in front of something very much puts you alongside, showing interest in and value for, the experience or object of the photo. It's just a modern way of doing it.

Of course, in my grandfather's time and space, the picture of the 'big men' - the teacher, the priest, the big local farmer - in the mouth of the whale would have carried a loud echo of the story of Jonah.

1. My grandfather was a schoolteacher in the remote west of Ireland in the early years of the twentieth century. One day a large whale washed up on the beach, and the locals were so impressed that they propped the beast's jaws open with pillars (driftwood), put a small table in the mouth with a few chairs, and got a photographer to come all the way to the village to take a picture of a few local 'big men' (including my grandfather) sitting inside the mouth. Someone in my family still has this photograph. This was sometime in the 1910s, so it was a major effort to get this photograph.

One may admire without taking a selfie. One may even create a photographic record of tragic and terrible events without including their own face in the foreground! Imagine that! I will continue to knock distasteful behavior, thank you very much.

As the article points out, dead whales have washed up on North Sea coasts since time immemorial. Like other beings, some whales contract communicable diseases, pass them on to their companions, then die. Let's wait and see what the biologists have to say before we don our tinfoil titfers.

So long as it was a grey one, you were performing a public service. You should have taken it home and eaten it, assuming it wasn't actually flat.

For years we've been dealing with these anti-nuclear zealot, terminal thickos in the climate change debate who think shouting "FUKUSHIMA" constitutes an argument. What more proof do we need that they deserve to be ignored than that they think it's clever to tag a beached whale!? If this won't suffice, nothing will.

From a scientific standpoint that's like asking the same question about chemtrails. Fukushima radiation contributed something like an extra 1/500th of the level of background radiation in the Pacific, never mind the Atlantic.

Kids naturally like animals and are curious. Seeing something up close like that is so educational. You can watch whales and elephants on TV, but it isn't until you are face-to-face that you understand how large these animals are. It is very sad for sure and some people will behave badly, but those children will likely remember this for the rest of their lives. Naturalists and biologists love to find dead things--maybe this will stimulate one kid to study whales.

It is not unreasonable as a hypothesis - but without investigation can not be stated as fact. Your link showed where someone had hypothesis that sonar mapping of seabed could be a problem, research was done and confirmation - I don't know if other studies have been done or if not, result would be replicated if repeated.

It would depend on what they wrote.As for my dead body, it's an object. I am either no longer using, or just am no longer; either way it's of no concern to me.I'd not like it used to express political or emotional sentiments that I don't share.Or as a billboard for advertising Beer.I never liked beer.Maybe a decent single malt.

I understand your viewpoint but it may be less distasteful than allowing them to become extinct, which is likely to happen unless the minds of as many people as possible are reminded (in however a small amount) that they even exist.

I find it a bit odd that people need to take selfies in all sorts of circumstances - like here and in front of a plate of food they're going to eat. I'm old and out of touch I guess - I'm still someone who would use conversation directly to let someone know what I did yesterday rather than Instagram it...
