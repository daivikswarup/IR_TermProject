In a new era of official nastiness, it’s suddenly a crime to be homeless




DateTime::::2016-03-10T19:14:50+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> week ago, a case involving a homeless man called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14320943.Prosecutors_drop_court_case_after_furore_over_homeless_people_being_fined/">Ashley Hackett was thrown out of court in Brighton</a>. He had been arrested by a plain-clothes police officer for asking a passer-by for 10p, an episode that triggered reports about Sussex police arresting 60 people on similar grounds in 2015 alone.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/live/2016/mar/10/a-night-on-the-streets-britains-homeless-crisis-live">A night on the streets: Britain’s homeless crisis – live</a> </p>

<p>The story exploded in the pages of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/brighton">Brighton</a> Argus: local MP Caroline Lucas said she could not see “how criminalising desperate people for begging is helpful”; 30,000 people signed a petition decrying the policy responsible – and then, in the final denouement, prosecutors decided that the case was not in the public interest, and a district judge called time on the whole pathetic affair. In among the small print, there lurked truly Kafkaesque details, such as Hackett’s lawyer’s insistence that “he pleaded not guilty to begging because the offence says you’ve got to place yourself in that location to beg. He says he’s homeless and that’s where he lives.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the end of that case will probably have no effect on a monstrous shift in policy and official attitudes towards homeless people being rolled out around the country. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness">As in-depth reporting</a> in the Guardian this week has highlighted, rough-sleeping in England is up nearly a third year-on-year, and the figures have doubled since 2010: a plainly shameful fact that underlines the sense of a government locked into a grim re-enactment of the 1980s. Meanwhile, all over the country, police and local councils are criminalising begging and rough sleeping, seemingly trying to push such mounting problems out of sight.</p>

<p>Which brings us to a particularly horrible policy instrument known as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/08/pspos-new-control-orders-public-spaces-asbos-freedoms">public space protection orders (or PSPOs)</a>, brought in by the coalition government in 2014. As with New Labour’s antisocial behaviour orders, this new legal invention creates opportunities to criminalise hitherto non-criminal behaviour – but instead of Asbos’ focus on individuals, PSPOs are defined by particular areas.</p>

<p>The basic idea is simple enough. Designate a particular area, specify the behaviour you want to outlaw, and you’re off. In certain areas of Nottinghamshire, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.worksopguardian.co.uk/news/local/new-anti-social-behaviour-order-now-in-force-at-gateford-s-celtic-point-is-first-of-its-kind-in-notts-1-7279263">Bassetlaw’s Labour council has prohibited</a> people under 16 “gathering in groups of three or more”; in Hillingdon, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/london-councils-pass-rules-to-ban-people-from-standing-in-pairs-a3191651.html">Tories who run the borough have criminalised</a> feeding pigeons in the park and, for young people in certain places, “gathering in groups of two or more persons unless going to or from a parked vehicle or waiting for a scheduled bus at a designated bus stop”. Obviously, those actions look comically draconian. But when PSPOs are applied to homeless people, the sense of punitive nastiness goes off the scale.</p>

<p>We are essentially talking about the policy equivalent of those spikes now affixed to modern buildings as a matter of course, in case anyone thinks of bedding down for the night. In Folkestone in Kent, a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/shepway_first_council_in_kent_to_use_new_order_to_crack_down_on_anti_social_behaviour_1_4125876">PSPO covers drinking, rough sleeping and begging</a>; the latter is also a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/news/top-stories/concerns-expressed-over-impact-of-new-public-space-protection-order-passed-by-kettering-council-1-7136451">potential criminal act</a> in Corby, Swindon and Oxford (where <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/13793165.Begging_crackdown_in_Oxford_relaxed_after_city_council_re_think/?ref=mr&amp;lp=16">the council says</a> it only applies to “aggressive” begging, though that includes simply asking for money near a cashpoint). In <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wrexham.com/news/pspo-to-see-zero-tolerance-approach-to-anti-social-behaviour-at-rhosddu-park-107536.html">Wrexham, similar sanctions</a> now apply to sleeping in a town centre park. Failure to comply entails a possible on-the-spot fine of £100 – this is for homeless people, let’s not forget – and, if the case goes to court, a penalty of up to £1,000. It is seemingly too early for cases to start colliding with the judicial system, but when they do, the waste of public money and chaotic fallout will speak for itself.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the idea is catching on. Recent <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/local-councils-across-england-and-wales-are-criminalising-the-homeless?utm_source=vicetwitteruk">Freedom of Information requests by the Vice website</a> discovered that at least 36 local councils in England and Wales “have introduced or are working on PSPOs which criminalise activities linked to homelessness”. In some places, there has been loud <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Comedian-Mark-Thomas-leads-big-protest-plans/story-28715534-detail/story.html">controversy about what is afoot</a>: protests in Exeter, a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/24/ban-homeless-people-sleeping-newport-proposal-droppde">U-turn in Newport</a>, and another successful campaign in Hackney, east London, that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/05/hackney-council-drops-threat-to-fine-rough-sleepers">last year forced the council</a> to back down.</p>

<p>But all too often there’s a sense of dull inevitability: in the absence of any real local or national scrutiny, councils do what they like, and no one really cares. Put another way: these days, if something happens in Corby, Swindon or Wrexham, can it really be said to have happened at all?</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/10/i-am-well-spoken-and-not-an-addict-how-homelessness-can-happen-to-anyone">‘I am well-spoken and not an addict’: how homelessness can happen to anyone | Sarah Marsh</a> </p>

<p>Moreover, as the Brighton case proves, the story runs much wider than PSPOs. Aside from London and Bristol, the city I visit most often is <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/manchester">Manchester</a>, where rough sleeping has exploded and, despite a more enlightened attitude to homeless people than you see in some other places, the city council and local landlords spent some of 2015 locked into an on-off game of injunctions, clearances, and ongoing bad feeling.</p>

<p>As a dry space long used by homeless people was suddenly cleared and fenced off – which is how it remains – and protest camps set up by homeless people spread across the city, the council won an injunction against anyone pitching a tent, which went as far as listing the items (sleeping bags, cardboard boxes) that were still permitted, and led to homeless people facing fines of up to £5,000. When I last visited, a new canvas encampment had sprung up on land owned by Manchester University, close to Piccadilly station: a fragile mini-shanty town, symbolising the fact that in the surrounding regenerated wonderland, scores of homeless people seem to have been reduced to an inconvenience.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Fines and arrest back up the rightwing idea of character failure; George Osborne sleeps that bit more easily</p>

<p>At the heart of all this, there is often a kind of municipal Trump-ism, whereby police and crime commissioners, senior officers and politicians of all parties affect a crass language of crackdowns and zero tolerance, while doing little to get to grips with the actual issue. Obviously, they can account for their actions in terms of austerity: if average local authority funding for services helping people avoid homelessness was cut by 45% between 2010 and 2015, and homelessness and rough-sleeping are reaching such uncontrollable heights, what else can they do?</p>

<p>The answer to that is simple enough: whatever your intentions, once you start blankly criminalising people who need serious and wide-ranging help, you surely risk shutting down any argument for that kind of assistance ever returning. Fines and arrests back up the rightwing idea of character failure; George Osborne sleeps that bit more easily.</p>

<p>Here, though, is perhaps the most awful aspect of what’s happening. If the official attitude to people who sleep on the streets looks like cold contempt, we shouldn’t be all that surprised if that is reflected not just in public indifference and hostility, but in outright acts of inhumanity.</p>

<p>Back in Brighton, this week brought news of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14334150.Homeless_man_set_on_fire_as_he_sleeps_in_doorway/?commentSort=score">homeless man suffering burns</a> after his sleeping bag and cardboard shelter were set on fire. Vulnerability to violence is often at the heart of living without a home: if we reduce people to being annoying untouchables, maybe that’s the kind of terrible thing that will happen more often.</p>

All of that in a vacuum without people is senseless.It must ultimately be for the good of the people of the realm. Laws govern benefits and responsibilities that are applied to people and this government is clearly missing a point in thinking tht because it makes something legal it is right.The two are not the same.

I suppose it's inevitable really, when the notion of what society is has changed to the extent it has done over the last generation.Why should anyone be surprised that, during an era in which self interest is the prime motive, the effects of austerity policy in protecting the resources of the majority at the expense of the majority has simply increased the number of casualties. The fact that they are now being criminalised in order to keep them from public view

How about this idea: we ask every person in the country to pay a percentage of their income towards social causes. Then, instead of leaving individual people to decide how it is spent when they don't have all the information, we ask trained health and social care professionals and housing specialists to administer this according to need, so that everyone has the housing, health and social care support that they need.

They say that scum rises to the top. Well the conservative scum responsible for this assault on humanity don't give a damn about the homeless. Homeless people rarely vote and they are certainly unlikely to vote conservative. In the eyes of the conservatives, homeless people are an inconvenience that should go off out of sight and die quietly. Conservative policy is deliberately geared to achieve that end.

The basic role of a government is to establish the rule of law, internally (so that (1) there's less likelihood of your being assaulted or robbed than there would be without a government, and (2) contracts you enter into can be enforced) and to secure the country against foreign invaders.

Author::::Junkie99
DateTime::::2016-03-11T19:49:24Z
I agree. The logic is simple.If there were a huge surplus of detached 3 bed houses then prices would be forced down.You don't have to build crap, just build enough and stop pandering to shareholders and private providers.But of course this is not the Tory way is it!



Author::::Junkie99

Well put.Affordable homes need not cost many thousands of pounds but they will if they are being erected by the private sector who have shareholders to answer to.A market economy is not alway the best way.

What is the role of a government if it is not to look after the people of the land?Will the government speak up for those who have no voice or who cannot speak up for themselves?Will the government care for all the people of the land?Who does a government look after if they are not looking after the citizens of the country?These are not difficult questions but they are big questions.If anyone cannot answer these questions in a positive manner then do they have the right to be in government?

So...you walk round asking for ID. And if given you check with who exactly? If they refuse, as, in a free country they have a right to do you? Arrest? How long will that take and what do you say when an innocent person charges you with harassment? All a bit complicated but not a problem if you live well away from the situation. And the people of Ardwick living in one of the alread most deprived areas? They must really welcome more rough sleepers but eh, the liberal, sleep well at night with a clear conscience, do gooders, are happy.

Climate change is inevitable, and may well kill millions if not billions of people, in the not too distant future, as the worlds climate returns to full glacial, which is the norm."Global Warming" is just a smoke screen to conceal the reality.Governments will do nothing, except look after themselves, and use the military and the police to control the starving populations, as they are doing with the homeless now.Only self help will provide effective relief.The secret basement pot growers have the required techniques, look to them for help.

"UNAFFORDABILITY is not solved by building more of the same."In this case it could be.If there was a glut of available cheap accommodation, the problem would be solved.

It could be argued that if the homeless were arrested, and put in jail, then they would no longer be homeless, if you were a cynic.There have been a number of programs showing how cheap and effective housing can be constructed from shipping containers. Given that they are stackable, a fairly small amount of land would be required to house quite a lot of people.Surely that would be a more humane, (human) solution.Councils are formed to look after peoples welfare in the area, NOT turn them into criminals!

They can be made inhabitable for less money than it costs to build more council hosues and it is a win/win. People don't have to sleep rough and the council doesn't have as many associated problems to deal with (begging, low-level crime committed by people who can't afford the basics).

Lots of people care. I see people giving money to rough sleepers all the time. The trick is to set up smaller local based charities I think. People are becoming weary and cynical of big charities bugging the vulnerable and because of chief exec salaries.

That's all your lies are, Mary Poppins, opinions.

And on that, just for the record, I think those 'Favourite Topics' are commendable, the record of an honourable and principled person intelligent enough to think beyond narrow self-interest. Unlike you. A Tory. A Tory masquerading as a "concerned" Labour voter. It's obvious.
