The Brexiteers have star power, but no clear message

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">“Y</span></span>ou wouldn’t believe how little gets done. We go through the motions, but it all gets sucked into the European vortex,” admits one notionally busy cabinet minister. I rather like the idea of the European vortex, a black hole into which policies and committees vanish in a shimmering swirl that might have come from the pages of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/may/15/guardianobituaries.books" title="">Douglas Adams</a> or the annals of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/dec/05/doctor-who-series-35-episode-12-hell-bent" title="">Gallifrey</a>.</p>

<p>Yet this is no time to be whimsical. There is, as this cabinet member went on to lament, plenty for the government to do. Take a look at the inventory of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2015/may/27/queens-speech-what-it-means-analysis" title="">measures promised in the Queen’s speech</a> on 27 May last year: free childcare, a boost to home ownership, expansion of the troubled families programme, enhanced devolution and much else. Committees meet, papers are circulated, the business of government proceeds, at least officially. But all the energy has been diverted elsewhere.</p>

<p>In normal circumstances the Westminster village would already be fizzing with speculation about <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/06/wage-growth-george-osborne-budget-obr-pay" title="">George Osborne’s eighth budget</a>, which he will deliver nine days hence. But these are not normal circumstances. The chancellor’s speech will be interpreted primarily as a spin-off drama, a subplot to the main event of the EU referendum campaign, in which Osborne will seek to restore his political position relative to Boris Johnson.</p>

<p>That particular task was made somewhat easier yesterday by the London mayor’s testy and decidedly wobbly performance on the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-andrew-marr-eu-referendum-interview-bbc-put-in-his-place-a6915191.html" title="">Andrew Marr Show</a>. If the Leavers are to prevail on 23 June, they have to be able to deliver straightforward, compelling answers to the obvious questions. In answer to an inquiry about the impact of Brexit upon the economy, it is not enough to say, as Johnson did, that the level of employment “might” fall (“Well, it might or it might not”). If the nation is to cut its ties with the world’s largest single market, there must be a plan in place to reassure those who fear for their livelihoods, for whom the bottom of Johnson’s “Nike tick” – the image he deployed to illustrate his economic projection, in an earlier interview – could mean the dole.</p>

<p>Worst of all was his attempt to explain away what was happening to him as evidence of BBC bias. To Marr’s perfectly reasonable questions he cried: “BBC claptrap!” God knows, the mayor can turn on the charm like no other politician. But this was the captious side of him, furious that Marr was not playing by the rules, or, more accurately, respecting his usual exemption from aggressive cross-examination.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">It was a smart move by Vote Leave to adopt pointedly optimistic language</p>

<p>This should be an early warning to Vote Leave, and the impressive duo running the campaign, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/04/vote-leave-deputy-chairman-condemns-damaging-bickering-mills-cummings-referendum" title="">Matthew Elliott and Dominic Cummings</a>. Is it true that in politics, as was said of Iain Macleod and Harold Macmillan, one can be “too clever by half”? Let us hope not. I prefer a narrower maxim: namely that complex, over-nuanced political messages stand little chance of gaining traction, for the simple reason that most people have lives and do not agonise over the details that so absorb politicians and the commentariat. The overwhelming majority of voters are not afflicted by what Freud called “the narcissism of small differences”.</p>

<p>So: it was a smart move by Vote Leave to adopt pointedly optimistic language, resisting the Remainers’ charge that they are reactionaries and blimpish enemies of modernity. Iain Duncan Smith’s claim that escape from the EU would be “a stride into the light” may not persuade you but it suggests decent, progressive motives. It is a deft contrast to the Remainers’ warnings of the perils and uncertainties intrinsic to Brexit – a strategy the Leave campaigners scorn as “Project Fear”.</p>

<p>But the out camp has gone a step too far with its latest counter-strategy: namely, that, as Vote Leave’s website insists, “a vote to remain is the riskier option”. To put it mildly, this will not be an easy claim to explain on the doorstep given the high level of indifference towards the EU outside the factions and groupuscules of the Conservative party.</p>

<p>In yesterday’s Sunday Times, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove">Michael Gove</a>, a truly scholarly man as well as a talented politician, noted that “the far right is stronger across the continent than at any time since the 1930s – Golden Dawn in the Greek parliament are explicitly Hitler worshippers”. It was not clear from the report whether Gove was explaining the horrific rise of neo-Nazism as <em>primarily</em> a response to the depredations of the EU. It would be out of character for so subtle a thinker to attribute such a complex development to Brussels. I have too much respect for Gove’s intellect to believe that this is what he meant. Clarification, please?</p>

<p>Yet there is another undignified pattern of behaviour among the prominent Leavers. They present those who oppose them as bullies and themselves as victims. On Friday, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/04/iain-duncan-smith-damns-bullying-and-threats-of-anti-brexit-campaign" title="">Duncan Smith complained of “spin, smears and threats”</a>. His fellow cabinet Brexiteer, Priti Patel, accused Sir Jeremy Heywood of “unconstitutional” behaviour, after he ruled on the forms of material concerning the referendum that will have to be withheld from cabinet ministers who want Britain to leave. Instead of thanking the PM for suspending collective responsibility over the referendum – so that she can in effect call her boss useless, a failure in the greatest challenge of his political career, and still keep her job – Patel says that his most senior official is stitching the whole thing up.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/04/british-chambers-of-commerce-boss-suspended-in-brexit-row-reports-say">British Chambers of Commerce boss suspended in Brexit row, reports say</a> </p>

<p>In similar spirit, Johnson has taken up the cause of John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/04/british-chambers-of-commerce-boss-suspended-in-brexit-row-reports-say" title="">who was suspended on Friday</a> after he spoke in favour of Brexit (which 60% of his members oppose). No 10 concedes that its officials have routine contacts with the BCC but denies categorically that Longworth was the victim of a political assassination: or as Johnson put it, “crushed by the agents of Project Fear”. If it’s all an establishment conspiracy, it cannot be long before the Illuminati get a namecheck. Perhaps they already have.</p>

<p>None of this contrived paranoia will get the Leavers anywhere. If last year’s general election has a single lesson it is that simple, repetitive messaging works. The Remainers have found their message: Brexit is a leap in the dark, don’t risk it. The Leavers have energy, a stellar line-up and unexpected momentum on their side. They believe, with good reason, that they can win. But, unless they settle upon a single, unforgettable message, that chance of victory will disappear, with everything else, into the great European vortex.</p>

Appreciate your effort to make such a lengthy reply here. Your initial post did invite a bit of ridicule though. I can see you are proud of your cause and that is laudable. I dont mind debating with the other side when they are genuine believers in their cause. You are wrong about some of this though. The LSE is going be taken over by DB if the merger goes ahead. A merger is never a merger it always a takeover one way or another. It may not go ahead and the Yanks are trying a counter bid. But the German one has the legs at the moment. The target is never in a position to call the shots and the LSE is the target. You need to be more cynical than you are. I know thats a bad situation to have to be in but it is how the financial world works and if you want to understand it you have to be. If you dont think there is no underhand stuff going on here, check out the German press which broke the story today that the LSE's Chairman will have to agree to stand down after three years as part of the deal. My comment on asylum centralisation was not misleading. It was reported in all the press. I am just passing on what has been reported. And thats not same as saying it is not true. It is true. Whether it will happen is of course not certain. But the fact that it is being discussed is news.Look at how many likes my comment got compared to your response. No one views the Brexit lobby as Tory Toffs, apart from those who are against it and as a result wish to publicise it as such. The biggest surge to the Brexit vote in the last few months is coming from Labour core working class voters and JC voters. Dont just stick up for the EU because it represents the status quo. The age of the status quo is gone. What appears to be radical change today will appear the norm once that change has been established. Those who fought to keep the failing system, and it is failing, will then in hindsight appear out of touch. Your comment about Muslims is also wrong. Many Muslims in the UK actually support Brexit. There is a group called Muslims for Britain which wants out. They know that the UK is not able to maximise its ties with Indian and Pakistan because it is forced to concentrate on taking immigration from the EU. You are just making assumptions without having actually read any of my immigration focused posts or spoken to the communities involved and are again wrong. The EU is good for most of Europe. And I want it to succeed and to integrate. That would be in our interests. I don’t want it to break up when we leave. But we should no longer be a member. And indeed we put a brake on it succeeding with our constant vetos. The UK and the EU are both pulling in a different direction and we would both realise our full potentials if we left. Re-examine your view about the UK in the EU.Join us. Your passion will then not be wasted on the Remain campaign the interests of which are the world’s largest banks, the continents biggest tax avoiders, and the establishment Tories at No.10. You will be surrounded by 25 million individuals, everyone of whom is passionate about their cause not just their money. Join us.

It's been an awful week for the remain camp, now it's been made worse by the Queen backing Brexit. Anyone from the left who wants to stay in the EU (which is not a natural leftist position) cannot truely call themselves a liberal. Prop up the Tory toff Cameron all you want, but don't claim you hold any liberal values.

I should have responded to your claim yesterday that the destruction of local jobs has nothing to do with the EU by pointing out that, were we not in the EU, the UK government could prevent global corporations from trafficking huge numbers of Eastern Europeans into the country with the sole aim of destroying local jobs markets and reaping the profits of offering lower wages and worse conditions.

You can distort the statistics as much as you like (eg by including a Westminster-subsidised contribution to GDP to dress up performance) but the reality is a Scottish economy that is not paying its way with a deficit of £14.9 billion for 2014/15.

Cameron and the Remainers speak in high level platitudes that mean very little when you come down to detail. All this mother and apple pie sounds great to the gullible but in reality it means that the UK no longer has control of anything. Borders, fishing rights, agricultural policy, working times, our NHS, etc. etc. All of our great institutions and yes that includes our justice system and our Banking systems will be ceded to an unelected group of unaccountable people who incidentally have never been publicly scrutinised. They are not held accountable and everyone knows that is a perfect breeding ground for corruption. People should not think twice and vote Leave otherwise we will be travelling towards oblivion at an ever increasing rate. There is only one decision to make and that is do you want to live in a self-governing democracy or give over everything that made this country great to foreigners.

I don't think I have it backwards I think that Brexit is a more a calculated risk than a gamble - and I believe that the same is true of remaining in the EU. The circumstances of the EU are bound to change over time for the better or for the worse. The decision is of one set of risks and uncertainties against another.

It is Jean Monnet actually. You are not living in the real world. You are living in a false paradigm that you haven't realized just yet. You talk about economic zones as if they were a bulwark against the globalist plans. Do you not realize that economic zones does not mean economic freedom? But the that is besides the point: a zone can be used as a tool for corporate hegemony. China do this by buying up land in other countries and setting up special economic zones to promote global trade.

Don't be so obtuse. Appeal to the customer can vary and price is one of them so if the trading agreement makes one item more expensive than others of course that is going to count. It s quite clear you have no idea what trading agreements entail so you try and fight your corner on the very silly idea it's down to the appeal to the customer that's of primary importance when it isn't.
