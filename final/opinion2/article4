I’m proud to be young, British and Muslim. Why should I change my name?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he other day I was searching for a place to stay in Paris for a weekend break with my sister. I tried to make a reservation via <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/airbnb" title="">Airbnb</a> at a small studio flat and was surprised when the host replied saying that she didn’t feel comfortable letting me stay because she didn’t trust me. I tried another apartment and received another message saying pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>Having never had any problems with previous hosts, and having gained good reviews when I’ve used the service outside Europe, I couldn’t understand their distrust. The only thing they knew about me was my name.</p>

<p>There are no official figures about racial or religious discrimination in France, owing to laws that prohibit this type of data being collected, but studies have shown that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thelocal.fr/20151009/muslim-men-in-france-see-cv-discrimination-study" title="">applicants with Muslim names are significantly less likely to be called in for job interviews</a> than those with Christian names who have the same qualifications. Similarly, research in Britain has shown that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-muslims-face-worst-job-discrimination-of-any-minority-group-9893211.html" title="">religion now faces more prejudice than race</a> in the workplace. Recently I’ve started to hear first-hand stories about its impact.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/01/muslim-woman-britain-paris-attacks">As a Muslim woman I was never fearful in Britain. But today I’m afraid | Masuma Rahim</a> </p>

<p>Growing up, I was encouraged by several friends to use the nickname Immy because it was less identifiably Muslim. I was told that on a professional level it would serve me to be ambiguous about my background, especially in emails, because judgments might be made about me. While I largely resisted this advice, many friends did change their names for exactly this reason. There’s Ozzy, whose real name is Oussama; Youcef, who became Joe; and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/islam">Islam</a>, who likes his name and is known as such by his family and friends but uses his middle name, which is less identifiably Muslim, in a professional environment.</p>

<p>We are all ambitious young people with diverse backgrounds, personalities and experiences, and being Muslim is part of that. But none of us want to be defined solely by our religion.That’s partly because what it means to be Muslim for us isn’t the same as what it means for a lot of other people. Our generation has grown up in the shadow of 9/11. We have no recollection of the time before, when barely any non-Muslims cared what religion we were.</p>

<p>Every day, as I walk to work past newsstands, it seems there’s another front-page splash demonising some aspect of Islam. Online, the comment threads below any article on Muslims are full of vitriolic messages. Someone once said to me: “If I believed what they said about Muslims, I would have to hate my own mother, my family and everything about myself.” Not surprisingly, there are weekly reports of Islamophobic attacks; and vicious <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/16/black-woman-anti-muslim-rant-british-racism-islamophobia" title="">Islamophobic rants</a> have been filmed on public transport.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">The persistent culture of suspicion means Muslims often find themselves in a defensive position they don’t want to be in</p>

<p>The relentless assaults from popular broadsheets and tabloids are echoed by political leaders too. David Cameron’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/30/david-cameron-migrant-swarm-language-condemned" title="">language around refugees</a> – “swarms”, “bunch of migrants” – contributes to the idea that they are a homogenous, threatening group. In January, he said that the “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/27/david-camerons-bunch-of-migrants-quip-is-latest-of-several-such-comments" title="">traditional submissiveness of Muslim women</a>” was leaving young men vulnerable to radicalisation – reinforcing the stereotypes that Muslim women have to deal with daily. Cameron upset not only the mothers, but also their children – people of my generation, who have come through the British education system, and have navigated the path of being young, British and Muslim.</p>

<p>All of this trickles down into the social interactions Muslims have every day. I have friends who were raised in Muslim households who assume different lifestyles when they leave home, moving away from the faith of their parents. They drink alcohol, live with their partners before marriage, and don’t fast for Ramadan. Even so, they still feel under attack, and find themselves defending a religion they don’t even believe in: it is still a big part of their identity, whether they like it or not.</p>

<p>It’s not about having a victim mentality. But the persistent culture of suspicion and finger-pointing means that Muslims often find themselves in a defensive position they don’t want to be in.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/01/moderate-sadiq-khan-london-mayor-muslim-labour">If a moderate like Sadiq Khan shouldn’t stand for London mayor, which Muslim can? | Mehdi Hasan</a> </p>

<p>In a country where less than 5% of the population identifies as Muslim, most people are unlikely to have close contact with this religion. Instead, their views are shaped by what they read or hear in the media. But this skewed narrative merely creates a growing divide that doesn’t need to exist.</p>

<p>Something has to change, for if we do nothing to improve the worrying way in which Muslims are spoken about, the future is going to be more and more uncomfortable for all of us, with more division, more suspicion, more hate.</p>

<p>Even if we all altered our names to make people feel more comfortable, that wouldn’t change the basic fact that Muslims are part of Britain and part of British history – and we aren’t going anywhere any time soon.</p>

Maybe you are offended by Burqas or Niqabs (I'm no fan by any stretch of the imagination). But don't cry about a "right to offend" when it comes to satirising Muslims.

If there is an economic slump in the coming years combined with more attacks from jihadists in Europe and the UK, then Muslims and others from the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East will find life in the UK and Europe virtually impossible to exist in, human nature being what it is.

I abhor any islamophobia, anti Semitism, racism etc however for some reason parts of the Islamic community in the UK have a very strong grievance narrative and also a deep rooted sense of victimhood. I think people are weary of hearing this constant narrative. I live alongside a large Sikh community and you just don’t get the same endless dialogue about how tough it is to be a Sikh in Britain.

Try walking down the street in any muslim country as a white person (and particularly a woman) and see how often you get a look, comment or action. (Mainly friendly, but not always...) And you can be sure that you will be treated differently even if you speak Arabic.

Not funny in the least. You know very well that quite a bit of the anti-Muslim prejudice is nothing to do with terror. That's the excuse for good old-fashioned racism.

But many people don't realise how very diverse Islamic culture is, and apply negative stereotypes to Muslims based on the very worst that they have read or heard about rather than on the reality of the person they are dealing with.

Sometimes you just happen to be at the wrong place at a wrong time. It helps and makes your life easier if you play along. Yeh it's unfair wrong unacceptable bla bla bla but the reality doesn't chnage. And this self therapy of telling yourself 'proud British Muslim' isn't gonna help, you'd find yourself alone believing that.

Jihad has been almost continuous for the past 14 centuries. The Crusades were a defensive action taken after 400 years of aggression. Within this time scale, the period from about 1750 to 1980 were exceptional.

As an atheist born in a Muslim country, when I described myself as a "culturally-Muslim atheist" to a religious British Muslim colleague, he sneered. Another who practised his faith religiously inquired whether I would go to mosque. When I told him (tongue-in-cheek), "no, but I visited the Blue Mosque in Istanbul as a tourist," he almost turned purple. So, I guess, my point is, even though I didn't write an article about either of those incidents, I learned that different people can be judgemental in different ways.

I think your name is fine and you shouldn't have to and you don't have to change it, but it is really common to adopt a shortened name especially if it is not a name which is familiar to most people.I am sure you are right that there is a large white European descrimination against muslims, whether that discrimination is much larger than against hindhus or sikhs I am not sure.I guess we could make a scale of discrimination say for the UK and muslims would probably be currently near the top with Scots moving up the table and christians steady in the middle.I also guess that a white secular man dating a muslim women would find a lot of discrimination within the muslim community.

But Islam doesn't separate religion from politics. That's the whole problem. Asking them to separate religion and politics is like asking them to accept that Islam is antithetical to life in a liberal democracy.

If you actually read what mohammed did to under girls and women you would be offended by anyone who said they was proud to be muslim. It really is a religion that stands out. Also how can you say you are proud, then where something that suppress women like the hijab, that just reinforces male muslims attitude towards women.

The Scots (originally Irish, but by now Scots) were at this time inhabiting Ireland, having driven the Irish (Picts) out of Scotland; while the Picts (originally Scots) were now Irish (living in brackets) and vice versa. It is essential to keep these distinctions clearly in mind (and verce visa).

When you say you are muslim, what do you actually mean? if you are identifying with a culture and ethnicity which is contrary to, and incompatible with, the Judeo-Christian heritage and values of this country, then you are stating that you are foreign, a potential enemy of this state, and are undermining the social order here.
