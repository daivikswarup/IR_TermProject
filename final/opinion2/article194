Hello Berlin, goodbye optimism: why is Germany’s glass half empty?




DateTime::::2016-02-03T17:00:36+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">G</span></span>erman angst is back, or at the very least consulting its lawyers about a reunion tour. I have just moved back to Berlin, after a total of 18 years away from the country in which I grew up, and can’t help being struck by the relentless reliability of my <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany" title="">birth nation</a>’s appetite for pessimism.</p>

<p>Self-doubt is writ large across the counter at my local newsagent: “Countdown for the chancellor: How long does she have left?”; “Can she still save herself?”; “Have we Germans gone insane?” (Die Zeit).</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/26/germans-reject-joyless-image-europe-optimists">Germans reject their joyless image to become Europe's optimists</a> </p>

<p>Never mind that austerity here is mainly something that happens in other countries. Never mind that beer and bread are cheap, that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp" title="">the cost of living is lower than in most of northern Europe</a>, while <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/PressServices/Press/pr/2015/05/PE15_160_624.html" title="">wages are higher than in southern Europe</a>. Never mind that Germany is the reigning <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/13/germany-argentina-world-cup-final-2014-match-report" title="">football world champion</a>, and that it added a European handball championship title and a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/serena-williams-angelque-kerber-australian-open-final-tennis" title="">Grand Slam tennis title</a> to its trophy cabinet last weekend. Talk to people in the cafes and bars, and they will tell you that the country is going down the drain, or if it isn’t, it is about to.</p>

<p>This is even more surprising, given that what the German novelist Jean Paul christened Weltschmerz has seemingly been in steady decline for the last 10 years. Only a year and a half ago, a survey announced that Germans had remodelled themselves into the world’s optimists, with over half of its citizens saying they were extremely satisfied with their lives. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/26/germans-reject-joyless-image-europe-optimists" title="">Only 2% described their contentment as low</a>.</p>

<p>Weltschmerz looked like a relic of the past, kept alive only out of ironic affection, as the success of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/NeinQuarterly?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" title="">Nein Quarterly</a>, a Twitter account by the US academic Eric Jarosinski that has spawned its own column and books, seemed to prove. (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/NeinQuarterly/status/689182213603225600" title="">Sample tweet</a>: “Go ahead: try defeatism. Won’t work.”)</p>

<p>Even the archetypical painting of German melancholy, Caspar David Friedrich’s moody The Monk by the Sea, has recently been restored to its more uplifting original glory. “The thunder clouds have gone,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/restaurierte-werke-von-caspar-david-friedrich-so-schoen-ist-die-unendlichkeit-1.2828032" title="">remarked one astonished art critic. </a></p>

<p>But ever since Angela Merkel spelled out this newfound optimism, proclaiming “Wir schaffen das” (“We can do it”) in regards to the refugee crisis, the real pessimists have been out in force again. In the current edition of the political monthly Cicero, the philosopher Peter Sloterdijk warns that Germans need to relearn not just to appreciate closed borders, but to reacclimatise to what he calls phobocracy. For too long, he says, Germans have lived sheltered from the terrors of the modern world; now the time has come to “submerge oneself into the subconsciousness of the phobocratic mechanism”. Which sounds fun.</p>

<p>On a more cheerful note, my childhood football club, Hamburger SV, is being ridiculed for failing to tie up a deal for a new player during the transfer window. An email sent from Switzerland was too big for the club’s server, and didn’t arrive until <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dw.com/en/transfer-window-recap-last-minute-bundesliga-loans-and-a-late-email/a-19020773" title="">four minutes after the transfer deadline</a>. Hamburg is a repeat offender: in 2011 another transfer broke down, because the manager <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://bundesligafanatic.com/bundesliga-winter-transfers-a-wrap-up-of-the-madness/" title="">couldn’t work the fax machine</a>.</p>

<p>I sympathise. Moving back to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany">Germany</a> has come with a reminder that even though this country leads the way in so many fields of engineering its attitude to information technology is stuck somewhere in the late 90s. To order up documents from the Stasi archive, you must fax a form. To get accredited to the Bundestag, you have to fax a form that has been rubber-stamped by your office manager. No emails are accepted. Flat-hunting in the old west of Berlin – once the calling card of western hypercapitalism, now a vision of a quaint protectionist past – I spotted a vast shopping emporium selling rubber stamps, and two shops offering photocopying and fax services, all on the same street corner. I now understand why.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>Talking of football, the sports pages of German newspapers are always the best place to pick up new phrases and colloquialisms. Hamburg, who have been in the top tier of German football for longer than any other club, are a bit strapped for cash this season, but their manager confided to one of the papers that he was hoping to soon get “a good gulp of English wine”. Which in modern footballing parlance means selling mediocre German players for big bucks to clubs in the English Premier League. No German angst there.</p>

I await angry replies here, but I agree, the path to hell is paved with good intentions. An example is an episode from television of The Dog Rescuers. The man who took in two unwanted dogs. Gradually more dogs arrived. When there were more than he could cope with he continued to take them in, with the result that various animal rescue agencies eventually spent most of the night removing them, and the condition of some of them was appalling. But the man had meant well.

Funny you say they're BS, because there's nothing controversial about a migrant costing €15k per year if they're not working, and the German government says 80% are unemployable. But you can have all the delusions you want.

The German government themselves say around 80% are unemployable. Most don't speak the language and have few skills. Only a small fraction have high-school lelve of education. No, the vast majority will be on welfare forever, hence the €15k cost.

By the way... did you get the irony? No German has a name like Werner today. Werner's original name was Wijaceslaw and he came from Kazakhstan. The German official renamed him because he couldn't spell his Russian name.

Many people are concerned about the consequences of Germany's ongoing policy to admit millions of unvetted and undocumented people. The demographics of a nation shape a nation.Will all new migrants instantly embrace Western norms, laws, values and beliefs?It seems a bit naive to assume that all new arrivals will abandon long held attitudes/ideologies just because the crossed a border.

That figure is assuming they don't work, which is a nonsense. On establishment in the country with language skills, immigrants work more often than natives and draw less benefits.

The Germans are used to their bureaucracy... but the new coming migrants get insane with it. It's the reason why the first ones are already going back. It seems to work better than the Hungarian fence. - No flat, no job- No job, no flat- please fill out the application form A to obtain the application form B- please be so kind to stand in a queue with 500 others to get your pocket money- Ah, your name is Ali? Okay, Werner will get the job...

Yeah im afraid the simple answer to that is that Germany is being loaded with Muslim economic migrants (the Dutch EU commissioner stated at least 60% were economic migrants, not refugees). At a cost of €15k per migrant, the 10 million that GErmany will take over the next few years will end up costing €150 billion EVERY YEAR. That's greater than the health budget for German citizens. On migrants. And the German media engages in the most outrageous censorship on this topic, not allowing any other viewpoint to be heard. If i was a German, i would be very, very depressed when i think of the future.

The main reason Germany is going downhill fast, is the fact that Merkel has allowed the US to impose their European foreign policy on the EU. There is no doubt that sanctions on Russia has hurt German business, and her recent capitulation by welcoming unlimited migrant numbers, has been an unmitigated disaster. She is also showing signs of mental health problems. This can happen when one is totally conflicted. The sooner Germany, and the rest of the EU, stands up for the people rather than doing the US' bidding, the better for Europe.

More mature about the refugee crisis? absolutely not. They only recently (last weeks) started a somewhat mature discussion. For decades every discussion was ended by accusing someone of being a racist: "if you're not left-wing than you must be a fascist/nazi/racist" . Germany is about 20 years behind in the discussion about immigration (compared to Netherlands or France, where these issues came up long time ago). I also never met a german who knows anything about islam and islamic culture (and I live in germany now). Germany only recently started to come out of the 'denial phase'

You think what Merkel did was "mature" ?The highly irresponsible and dangerous act of flinging open the doors and offering an open invitation to all and sundry (and then slamming it shut five minutes later) is not mature, by any definition.

I don't like Merkel and the way she does things to be honest. She seriously miscalculated the affect of what she did, and did not consult anyone on a local or international level to coordinate this all. The next elections will show what impact this has all had.

As a Catalan IT engineer, who worked for a German owned multi-national company, said to me: 'the Germans impose incredibly high standards on everyone except themselves'. He said that while their work is substandard, they do not tolerate even the slightest lack of standards from anyone else.Before anyone accuses me of racism, my German wife agrees entirely with his appraisal.
