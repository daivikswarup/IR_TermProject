Yes, women should choose their maternity care. Why isn’t it happening now?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">“S</span></span>afe care is personalised care,” says Baroness Julia Cumberlege in a letter to the women of England. Launching the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/national-maternity-review-calls-for-personal-care-budgets">report of her review of maternity services </a>in England, Cumberlege is clear about her vision for the future and catchily suggests £3,000 personal birth budgets. But behind those simple-sounding words lurks an argument that I hope she has the support to win.</p>

<p>Women’s basic humanity – and the autonomy, dignity and respect that this should afford them – is often characterised as the enemy of safety in maternity care. Wherever we place ourselves on the natural to medicalised birth spectrum, the narrative is usually the same. Silly women with their unrealistic and downright irresponsible ideas about birth can’t be the ones who decide what happens to their bodies in pregnancy because it’s just not safe for the baby. This ridiculous argument has left attitudes to women in the maternity system in a state of relentless suspension for years.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/23/national-maternity-review-calls-for-personal-care-budgets">National maternity review calls for £3,000 'birth budgets'</a> </p>

<p>That’s why I fully support the report’s conclusion that for maternity services to be truly safe for women and babies they must be set up to provide individualised care that listens and responds to the women they serve and ultimately supports and trusts them as they make decisions that are right for them. It’s a sentiment that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.birthrights.org.uk/">Birthrights</a> (the human rights in childbirth charity I lead) set out in our <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.birthrights.org.uk/2015/08/letter-to-the-national-maternity-review/">August 2015 letter</a> to the review team, co-signed by the president of the Royal College of Midwives, leading obstetricians and others working in maternity care.</p>

<p>Yet many of the specific changes and innovations that the report advocates are those that women and experts have been requesting for decades. Women being cared for by small teams of midwives they can get to know, increased perinatal mental health provision, improving the way mistakes are investigated and overhauling patchy postnatal services. Some of these ideas featured heavily in Cumberlege’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rcm.org.uk/news-views-and-analysis/news/changing-childbirth-unfinished-business">last review of maternity services</a> more than 20 years ago. I worry about what new power this report will have to stir up the stagnant waters around attitudes towards women’s reproductive health and rights.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/23/maternity-care-issues">What are the biggest maternity care issues where you live? | Sarah Marsh</a> </p>

<p>Nevertheless there are some radical and ambitious proposals that could really shift the power balance for the better if they could be made real, such as giving women their own personal maternity budgets to spend on their care as they see fit. Despite the inevitable barrage of scepticism about whether we can handle the weight of responsibility for our own health, I think this could work.</p>

<p>Proposals to change the way compensation is offered for birth injuries could offer families financial support without having to go through the trauma of litigation that may be unsuccessful. The proposed “rapid resolution and redress scheme” would also liberate the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a> from the devastating consequences of a litigation culture which has spread fear and defensive practice.</p>

<p>But to make these ideas more than tantalising words on paper we need new tools to put pressure on those with the power to enact these recommendations. Otherwise there is a risk that the phrase “personalised care” could replace “woman-centred care” as a distractingly shiny bow on a system that’s actually quite the opposite.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/03/nct-male-ceo-wrong-national-childbirth-trust-appointment">The National Childbirth Trust is now run by a man. Time for deep breaths | Catherine Bennett</a> </p>

<p>A key aspiration of the review team is that all women should have access to a choice of where they give birth by 2020. Yet all women should already reasonably expect this choice today based on <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_074199.pdf">Department of Health policy that came in to effect in 2009</a>. This isn’t something to aspire to but to demand now, and loudly.</p>

<p>Similarly, women already have existing rights to choice, information, consideration of their individual circumstances and a relationship with their caregivers based on different legal sources. Invoking these, and suggesting simply ways to strengthen and clarify these rights could provide a strong platform to begin to turn some of this theory in to reality.</p>

<p>So while my response to more personalised maternity care is to punch the air, I can’t help but wonder, what now? Because what happens tomorrow to stop this just being a slogan and actually make care both safe and personalised is what really matters for every woman, no matter how complex her needs.</p>

There's so much focus on pregnancy and birth, and hardly ever any mention of the extremely poor paediatric care system in the UK. Let's focus more on what happens to these babies after they've been born. As magical and important as pregnancy is, motherhood and parenthood lasts a lot longer than 9 months.

i on our last go we got to know a women who was 47 pregnant with her first and wanted a water birth at home , praise the lord they talked her out of it , it would have been a disaster as the little one was in breach and no one noticed fortunately because she had never had one before the pessary just would not make her dilate so she had a c section so the job was a good one . i have spent enough time sitting round maternity wards to know that in ten years time all that matters is that they came out wealthy and safe and you got to take everyone home

45% of first timers having home births transfer, but the vast majority for epidural pain relief, not due to complications.

Yep. The first thing i thought. And i actually used an independent midwife for two of my three births (all at home but i labour very fast so NHS didn't make sense the second and third times when i was about 35mins from hospital but only 10 from the IM) and think they're a fabulous idea, but that sort of care should be available on the NHS, not instead of it.

We should be very careful about this.The idea of a "£3,000 personal birth budget" sounds alluring, but in fact is simply a step towards further privatisation of the NHS.Mothers will be offered "choice", but as the funding of the NHS is further cut, and services shrunk, do not be surprised to see a list of private providers given to mothers-to-be, which they can pick from, regardless of any potential complexities in their pregnancy. If the services are cut, and prices rise, guess who will pay the excess?

Not ineptitude, just a lack of thought and consideration. It wasn't an emergency situation, all they had to do was tell me - informed consent and all that. Not too much to ask, I think.

I had my first child in mid 70s in a poorer part of London. I had the choice of a hospital birth, a home birth or a birth in a GP unit. I chose the GP unit which meant when I went into labour a midwife came to my home and stayed with me until I was ready to be transferred to the unit. The unit was a small building in the hospital grounds. I was attended there by the same midwife but had I needed hospital care I could have been wheeled into the main hospital. Baby delivered safely. It seems strange the NHS was able to offer that level of choice then but can't do so now without a personal budget. Of course it could be this is part of the sneaky change over to privatising the NHS.

Terrible idea. This proposal will take cash from care and waste it on accounting and administration and probably marketing and fielding queries from mums who can't make up their mind or keep changing it. Just bring midwife numbers up to strength. Opinion of a "midhusband" and now midfather-in-law who has had to listen to wife, daughter-in- law and all their friends/colleagues discussing placentas at breakfast time and the death of services by a thousand cuts for the last 40 years.

And home births are already available on the NHS. This is actually a crackpot, ill thought out scheme that sounds good, like a lot of other things this government comes up with. What most women would choose is a nice easy, safe birth. Most get it, but £3000 isn't going to make a whole lot of difference there. If you ARE lucky, you can spend it on some decent post natal care, it is pretty awful right now. Or maybe they will decide to charge for pain relief, and if you have used up your £3000, too bad.

Can`t you see that this is the next step in the privatisation of the NHS? A spokesperson from the Midwives representatives who was involved in the report, said that doctors are private businesses, so what is wrong with midwives being private businesses? That was this morning on Radio Humberside.

During my pregnancy and birth at UCLH, I never met my assigned midwife and never ever saw the same midwife twice. I didn't get to know anyone who was involved in my care and no one got to know me. I found this bizarre. But this is absolutely the norm now.

Agreed. What's more, not only are we already fleshing out our pockets to provide child benefits and other whatnot, now another three grand on top? As you said, they should save up instead of using public funding. Cruel or not, this is the truth: not every household can afford to part with money they rightly earned and give it away. Your baby, your responsibility.

DateTime::::2016-02-23T20:50:23Z
I am sorry but I disagree with this, if women wish for a home birth or for the help of someone not from the NHS or is not getting paid by the NHS, then they should save up and pay for such care themselves.



Author::::robert davis
DateTime::::2016-02-23T20:47:08Z
Yes they should be every bit responsible for their bodies, and the women too for their babies.

Don't think £3000 will get you very far if you want to "go private" - that kind of care costs a fortune, and isn't all that safe.

'childbirth is not an illness', but mothers can become unwell, not all women can deliver safely unassisted, babies can be unwell, complications can occur. There are 2 lives involved. Of course it should be part of our nhs, the children are our future, we should want to give them the best start in life. There may be other countries that do not pay for maternity costs but that doesn't mean they're right. Just because you are annoyed that women are expressing what they would prefer does not mean that when they progress to labour they will have their choices met. Lots of things can go wrong and the most important thing is to do the best possible to ensure that mother and baby are safe and well at the end of that process. Cancer outcomes and safe delivery of a new born should not be in competition with one another.

Author::::battenberg
DateTime::::2016-02-23T19:26:06Z
Yes! At 38 weeks pregnant, I've been encouraged to make so many choices, when I really don't want to - I want someone to read and synthesize all that evidence and apply it to my situation to tell me what's efficacious and safe. I've been present at exactly two births - my daughter's and my own - so I'm no expert. I value and need the consultant to help me make decisions, not place it all onto me. If I carry the weight of the decision, that makes it all my fault if it goes wrong, which is a terrible burden to carry.

This proposal would only be right if everyone (including men!) were allowed to choose their health care provider, and I dare say this will not happen. Otherwise it's just another grab for more privileges for women. Let's also recall that pregnancy and childbirth is not an illness, so perhaps it should not be funded by taxpayers, particularly in these times of NHS funding crises (some countries' national healthcare systems do not pay for maternity costs). Britain has one of the worst records on cancer outcome of all developed nations and these women demand to choose who will deliver their baby at taxpayer's expense. What arrogant nonsense!

one of my elderly patients relayed this story to me this morning but appears to have got the wrong end of the stick saying, 'women are now going to get £3,000 for having a baby.' We ended up discussing how much it is to buy clothes, and pushchairs, and how it might make women have a baby who might not really want one just to get the money.
