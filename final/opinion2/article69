The Guardian view on David Cameron and the House of Lords: more peers and fewer MPs equals a broken system




DateTime::::2016-02-26T18:53:24+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4699997.ece" title="">Speculation</a> that Downing Street plans to make up to 40 new life peers in July after the EU referendum, most of them Conservatives, should be taken seriously. David Cameron has the means (the prime ministerial patronage system), the motive (stopping the government defeats in the Lords), and the opportunity (he may not be prime minister by summer 2017) to do this. He also has past form on stuffing the Lords. All this makes the stories this week depressingly credible. The move should be stopped in its tracks by the body that has the power and responsibility to do so: the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The case against more peerages could start and end with the argument that it is morally wrong for the head of government to appoint the legislature. But there is more to object to. Mr Cameron has become a serial stuffer. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05867#fullreport" title="">He has sent 244 people to the Lords as prime minister</a> and 56 since May 2015 alone. Another tranche will put him on course to be the most generous dispenser of peerages of our era, well above Tony Blair, who had the real excuse that in 1997 the Lords was heavily stacked against Labour. It is true that Mr Cameron has no majority in the Lords, even though the Tories are the largest single party, but this is partly because of the 178 cross-benchers who make any read-across between the Commons and the Lords tendentious.</p>

<p>There are, though, two more fundamental objections. The first is the disgrace that is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/composition-of-the-lords/" title="">the size of the House of Lords</a>, currently 816 strong. Counting peers and MPs together, this means the UK parliament now contains 1,466 members. Merely to state this figure is to make an irresistible case for change. Yet the only change Mr Cameron’s government is contemplating is a reduction in the number of elected MPs from 650 to 600. This will further reduce representation from Scotland and northern England while the rich and successful (likely to be mainly from London and the south) are ushered into the upper house. It beggars belief that such a shift towards privilege can be taking place in the name of fairness in the 21st century. It is one that only parliament (or, in theory, the Queen, since she has to approve peerages) can do anything to change.</p>

<p>The second overriding objection is to an almost 18th-century prime ministerial patronage system that would not have disgraced Walpole. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/aug/27/party-donors-advisers-former-mps-peers-dissolution-honours" title="">Mr Cameron’s last list of peerages</a> was full of backers, beneficiaries and trusties. It also included a list of more minor honourees, including advisers, that was unprecedented in recent times. The next one is unlikely to be different. The alleged intention to reward financial and political backers of Mr Cameron’s EU campaign, perhaps even as an inducement to change sides, should be fingered, if it is true, for what it would be: political bribery.</p>

<p>Last summer, when Mr Cameron made 45 new peers, there was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/constitution-unit-news/270815" title="">the beginning of a revolt</a> against the patronage system. Then, in the autumn, the government lost a Lords vote on tax credits and the reform focus shifted to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2016/lords-strathclyde-review-debate/" title="">Strathclyde review</a> of the upper house’s powers over delegated legislation. Both houses now need to resume their focus on the bloated size of parliament and on patronage. Other parties and independent-minded Tories should follow the Scottish Nationalists, and condemn a system in which the government is at the same time seeking to reduce the number of elected parliamentarians and to increase the number of those who are appointed. The current system is a disgrace to the way this country does its politics and to the credibility of representative government. It cannot be allowed to continue in this way.</p>

AV would have been a big improvement, because it would have removed the need for voters to vote tactically, and any democratic system should involve people voting for the candidate they want to win.

The problem is, that the majority of Labour's votes came from Scotland and these have now been taken by SNP, this means that unless Labour and/or Liberal Democrats can actually make some movement into Conservative constituencies we are likely to have another Conservative govt or a coalition in 2020.

Your 'personal knowledge' does not regard the facts. No other EU-country has an unelected 'House of Lords". Italy has had Berlusconi,Greece and Spain had right-wing governments; all these lost the latest elections by %. Also in Germany , Belgium and the Netherlands you need 50% of the votes to make a government; and that is the reason coalitions are needed. So you have more inner control inside the government and by Parliament than in a government with just one party which leader might develop rather 'personal' policies like former British P.m's did. It is an offence to tell that Germany and the Netherlands 'are about the same as theUK' as their Parliaments control governments indeed. Questions by MP's must be answered by the Government in a responsible way,related to the content.Members of Government who do not inform the Parliament in the right way are voted out.So your reply is wrong.

The problem is that every-time HoL reform comes up, no-one can decide on its composition, the last time they had this there were 7 options and all of them were rejected and these included various options for it to be partially elected/partially appointed or fully elected.

AV was an abomination, and no improvement at all. The only country that has it (Australia) has had less coalitions than us. The only reason Cameron offered it was because it was totally empty, and with Clegg fronting it failure was inevitable., proving just how useless he really was.

We live in a semi feudal farce. The second largest legislature after the Chinese Peoples Congress could get even bigger so that a minority elected demonstrable liar can be sure to get his own way all in the name of sacred democracy. There goes belief, and it's beggared.

Absolutely insane. The House of Lords is already the second largest legislative body in the world, only next to the Chinese parliament (or whatever they call it). The House of Lords needs to be cut down, not expanded. The main parties should simply stop appointing Peers and let the House of Lords die a natural death via death and retirement.



Author::::kyoto
DateTime::::2016-02-27T16:40:58Z
A bit naive. Most Lords are appointed as a reward or because they have lobbied for it. A lot of rich people/business leaders still rather like the idea of a title in spite of living in the 21st century in all other respects. This is not being done to improve the quality of debate.

Exactly. The individuals are of too low calibre to be worth all this flummery. Cameron is making a speciality of demeaning a public office.

Most of the people who were 'genuinely oppressed by Nazism' are no longer with us, so we can only assume you have the right to take offence on their behalf. Suffice it to say that the modern Tories are seriously trying to engineer a one party state and therefore the idea of a healthy democracy no longer appeals to them (and more significantly, their backers).

The idea that there is legislation that only affects England is a myth. Very little happens that does not affect Scotland in some way. EVEL is a spurious, opportunistic attempt to prevent Scottish MPs opposing the government and defending their constituents' interests.

The Lords should be reduced to 300 at the most. Far too many in there and most do nothing more than turn up, claim their fees and then sod off home for the rest of the day.
