This racist backlash against refugees is the real crisis in Europe

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> coalition of the inhumane is rising in Europe. A group of political leaders have been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-austria-idUSKCN0VX1BZ" title="">meeting this week in Vienna</a> to coordinate how to seal the western Balkan refugee passage. The countries involved, including Macedonia, Croatia and Serbia, don’t want to risk hosting thousands of stranded people in their poor societies. They expect that by intentionally causing a humanitarian disaster in Greece they are going to stop the misery of the world getting in their backyard. Only this week Greece pleaded with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/greece-implores-macedonia-to-reopen-border-to-refugees" title="">Macedonia to reopen its border</a> as 4,000 refugees became stranded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the four Visegrád countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) who have not been not invited to join these discussions, are also at the forefront of this ideological campaign to seal the Balkan route. Their motivation is based on an Islamophobic narrative, as advocated by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, a self-declared <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-28/orban-says-he-seeks-to-end-liberal-democracy-in-hungary" title="">enemy of liberal democracy</a> and consolidator of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/migration-crisis-hungary-pm-victor-orban-europe-response-madness" title="">Christian front against the Islamisation </a>of Europe.</p>

<p>Despite having accepted 90,000 people last year, Austria is the latest country to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/austria-dismisses-criticism-of-its-plan-to-limit-daily-refugee-numbers" title="">impose quotas on asylum seekers</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/20/balkan-states-attempt-to-limit-numbers-of-refugees-claiming-asylum" title="">send refugees towards Germany</a>. Trying to avoid disaster in the forthcoming election against nationalist Heinz-Christian Strache and his Freedom party, its terrified leadership has moved from social-democratic moderation to rightwing extremism within a few months. Chancellor Faymann has been dwarfed by an emerging nationalist star, the 29-year-old minister of foreign affairs, Sebastian Kurz, who lobbied hard for the ringfencing of Greece after f<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-balkans-idUKKCN0QT10Q20150824" title="">ailing to force the Greek government</a> into pushing back boats in the Aegean sea. The declaration produced after the meeting yesterday branded the refugee crisis an illegal migration issue, cynically ignoring the suffering of hundreds of thousand of people escaping war.</p>

<p>Consider for a minute the “invasion” these leaders are moving against. Figures show <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php" title="">34% of refugees are children</a>, thousands of them unaccompanied. Another 20% are women.<strong> </strong>The vast majority of these people are families fleeing conflict. Just under half are Syrians escaping Islamic extremism themselves. The refugee influx amounts to less than 0.5% of the European population. This was never an unmanageable problem for the EU: it is an issue only for nation states. But resorting to nationalist fixes is a cheap solution.</p>

<p>Those finding comfort in virulent leaders are set for a huge surprise. The formal declaration of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> failing to respond collectively to this crisis is about to cause a huge backlash to EU institutions. And the degradation of a system of institutions, no matter how ineffective and despised they may have become, will reverberate into homes. Nationalist hostility between states will mean decades of stable diplomatic relations deteriorate. The slowdown of economic activity throughout the continent will impact on pay packets too. When other problems strike, EU partners won’t be a stabilising factor to resort to. Mistrust and dishonesty are going to spread like a disease.</p>

<p>We have reached the point of no return without a plan. Greece cannot go on like this: mostly due to the fact that a sequence of political developments has brought its ineffective government to the largely unwanted place of defending the 1951 Refugee Convention in its desperation for a European solution for the arriving refugees. The UN <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/un-appoints-filippo-grandi-as-next-high-commissioner-for-refugees" title="">high commissioner for refugees</a>, visiting Athens this week, committed the UNHCR to increasing its involvement in reception operations in cooperation with the Greek government. He has to deliver on this as soon as possible. The European commission should do the only thing it does well: pick up the bill. It has a lot to lose if it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Furthermore, a UN humanitarian evacuation plan (from Turkey and Greece) reaching beyond the EU should be put in place immediately. If EU technocrats and state leaders won’t do it in Brussels there is another way. Last week <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.balkaneu.com/portugal-shows-solidarity-athens-refugee-problem/" title="">Portugal offered to resettle refugees</a> from Greece. Yesterday, Spanish regional officials reached an agreement for the transfer of a thousand migrants – bypassing the European Union’s slow moving relocation system. Smaller scale, decentralised solutions are easier to finance, legally feasible, and they set a precedent.</p>

<p>Democratic communities can do what states have failed to achieve by reacting to the real crisis Europe is facing today: the racist and nationalist backlash throughout the continent. There are a lot of people out there who remember well that the failure of Europe has been blamed on the weak in the past and where this leads. We will fight against it.</p>

If that's the case then why can't they move anywhere in Europe they choose? I'll tell you why: because you think of them as little more than non-Christian, non-white sub-humans. You are totally deluded, I dare say to the point of insanity - a typical example of resurgent central EU racism.

"Just look at the scores on the BTL posts on this, the most liberal of the UK's mainstream media sites."Scores are not what I care about. I speak my opinion, and want to know others minds. That has made me adept at looking through argumentation structure and lines of reasoning. I recognise the memes from the far-right, which have permeated to several people. Who may not think themselves racist, but fell for their promise of a simple solution to a complex situation.

Not particularly true, the journey itself can be extremely dangerous and generally something young men are more likely to be willing to risk than women. Women will always be in more danger of being sex trafficked, for example.

It's a bloody mess however you look at it. The Schengen Agreement has allowed an influx of genuine asylum seekers and opportunist economic migrants to effectively move anywhere in Europe en-mass. If the EU had acted in a coherent and unified manner, migrant refugees could have been checked thoroughly, processed and of course supported in their transition.

I have commented on the necessity of dictators in societies in the middle east quite a few times. But the West does like to get involved usually to overthrow them and bring "democracy" but basically to destroy their model of governance in case the dictator does not serve its interests. Regarding Syria i had mentioned again how competently Assad the father suppressed the uprise of jihadists that had started murdering christian and Alevi ofiicials back in the '80s. Even if we assume that the West wasn't involved in the uprising which i don't believe, his son could have done the same with little help or if left alone against Syrian jihadists.. But Syrian Was is not a civil one...

Once upon a time, racist was the man(or woman) that considered someone less valid or not at all as a human according to colour/race or any other distinction.Modern racism is pretending one is not a racist but having different standards for 'certain' people. 'I don't mind the chinese, so long as they keep to their china town and do what they are good at, launder and run restaurants'. To this modicum of modern racism EU has to add ' Oh we'd love to help but they did not bring any passport from the war, besides I am not certain we can afford to (be human???)

Very much this. The island of Manhattan has 59 square kilometers and there's just over million and half people living there. Meanwhile, the island of Lesbos has 1,632 square kilometres and less than 90,000 people. The entire of Syria could comfortably fit there, and still live more comfortably than Manhattaners do. With all the Syrian neurosurgeons, top-tier managers, cyberscientists and other valued professionals, the Lesbos City could be the paradise on Earth, the high-tech pearl of Mediterranean.

If the problem is that, essentially, Europe has decided implicitly or explicitly that they can't afford to have the odd million or two folk from other cultures unexpectedly trying to move in, why don't the Coalition of the Left (many of whom appear to be millionaire celebrities, politicians and the like) form a self-funded charity to lease land somewhere willing - perhaps North Africa, on the coast - and construct a paradise there for the migrating folk?

True but what is the alternative as in the case of Germany where you do not have enough people to run the factories? This will be true even more for most of European countries in the future when the population is projected to decrease- Even in Turkey , government is giving huge incentives to have 3 kids, plus each kid will get a sizable amount when they reach 18.

"Their atrocities were worse than my atrocities" is a weird angle to take on this, it's not a competition. Even if some particular examples like the British genocides in Australia and North America and the Spanish and Portuguese in South America didn't kill as many people as your examples it doesn't negate the fact that it's hypocritical for Europeans who have migrated to all corners of the globe, both as refugees and 'economic migrants', now complain about others doing the same thing.
