The World Health Organisation’s director of mental health, Dr Shekhar Saxena, has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/number-of-children-prescribed-anti-depressants-increases-by-50-in-seven-years-a6920576.html" title="">expressed concern</a> about the reasons behind this rise.</p>

<p>Antidepressants are not licensed for prescription <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/treatmentswellbeing/antidepressants.aspx" title="">for under-18s</a>, with one exception. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guidelines state that fluoxetine, a type of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, can be used in under-18s, but should not be prescribed without first referring the child for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/28/talking-therapies-better-than-pills-report-depression" title="">talking therapy</a>. The two treatments should coexist and the child should be monitored carefully, particularly in the first few weeks after starting the drug, when the risk of the “major harm” Saxena speaks of is at its highest.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jul/29/chilld-and-adolescent-mental-health-service-failing-children">Children are suffering as mental health services fail to cope, say parents and teachers</a> </p>

<p>When starting an antidepressant, there can be an initial period – usually a couple of weeks, sometimes a bit longer – of side-effects. Some people have none at all. Others find that, along with physical symptoms such as tiredness, their anxiety or depressive rumination increases before things get better. And they do get better for many people.</p>

<p>A rise in prescriptions for antidepressants in under-18s throws up all kinds of fears. The idea that, after a five-minute consultation in a primary care setting (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35756602" title="">as has been reported</a>), a child might be prescribed a psychotropic drug is very troubling. Although the medication may work well, such initial treatment doesn’t just speak of oversubscribed surgeries or poor GP training – it signifies just how weak the bridge between the distressed young person and the specialist care they need and deserve has become. But GPs are often left with no other option. If the wait times for young patients to get psychological therapy referrals are so long, what are they meant to do in the meantime to support a child and their family?</p>

<p>One London-based GP I spoke to, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “Every time I see a teenager whose mental health is suffering and send them – and usually a parent – out the door with nothing but a promise of a referral for therapy that I know is going to take months, I carry the anger home with me. I’m incredibly reluctant to prescribe an antidepressant for someone under the age of 18, as more severe issues should not be managed in primary care, but with the obstacles in place and when presented with extreme distress, it can sometimes feel like the only option to help in the interim. We can’t not do anything.”</p>

<p>Since 2010 the budget for child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) has fallen in England by nearly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-30735370" title="">£50m</a>. A leaked report by a government taskforce <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/feb/13/mental-health-services-crisis-britain-revealed-leaked-report" title="">last month</a> painted a devastating picture of our mental health services, including figures that show the average waiting time for a child to see a specialist was 21 weeks. Twenty-one weeks – that’s nearly half a year.</p>

<p>When researching my <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Anxiety-Beginners-A-Personal-Investigation-y/dp/1509813233" title="">book on anxiety</a>, I spoke to the mother of a teenage boy with obsessive compulsive disorder who had been self-harming. Between the initial GP referral to their local Camhs, which was going to take upwards of eight weeks, her son cut himself so badly she had to take him to A&amp;E. It was only then, with such an acute presentation of distress, that he was scooped up by the system and helped to recalibrate.</p>

<p>I mention this because this boy’s mother talked a lot about the moralising of antidepressants when I met her. The GP had told her they might become an option at some point, but she told me how she’d struggled with the idea of them and how many preconceived notions she had of what taking an antidepressant meant. “Happy pills” was a phrase she used a lot. A mild dose of antidepressant medication did become part of her son’s treatment plan and her perspective has shifted significantly now she sees how much better he’s doing at school and at home, with regular supervision from his care team and GP.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Evidence tells us that the sooner mental health problems are dealt with, the better</p>

<p>We cannot say that antidepressants aren’t a reasonable option for some children who become unwell. Suspending judgment and allowing for nuanced argument is so important. No child should feel like they’re strange or are in sure danger if they are to take this type of medication, if it’s deemed appropriate with thorough conversation and therapeutic support. Their self-stigma is likely to already be high. No parent or caregiver should feel guilty, either, or like they have failed in any way. It cannot be as black and white as that. Sticking to binaries when it comes to mental health isn’t helpful for anyone.</p>

<p>Every brain, and therefore every person, is individual. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/01/stephen-fry-to-feature-in-bbc1-mental-health-season" title="">Stephen Fry</a>, who talks about his mental health in very biomedical terms – as a chemical imbalance in his brain, only treatable with medication – was politely but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://blogs.canterbury.ac.uk/discursive/all-in-the-brain/" title="">rigorously challenged in an open letter</a> by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richard-bentall" title="">Richard Bentall</a>, a professor of clinical psychology, who explained that discussing mental distress solely in terms of chemicals makes it easy to believe that human beings can be divided into two subspecies: mentally well or mentally ill. In fact, the borders are fuzzy and highly subjective. Bentall did not criticise or damn medication, he only asked Fry – and all of us, by extension – to have a more open, nuanced attitude to the hows and whys surrounding mental health.</p>

<p>Mental illness is multicausal. This is true for adults as well as children. Myriad factors are at play, including genetics, but also the infinite variables of life experience. Scientific research can offer no precise reason why one person experiences disordered <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/15/anxiety-epidemic-gripping-britain" title="">anxiety</a> over another, for example. With acute mental distress, particularly with conditions such as anxiety, someone’s symptoms need to be addressed in the first instance – as they are often profoundly physical and uncomfortable – before examining what might be the causal factors and to start addressing thinking patterns. Medication can be part of those first steps.</p>

<p>Evidence tells us that the sooner mental health problems are dealt with, the better. Adolescents are still developing cognitively and early intervention bodes far better for the future. Antidepressants are not a panacea for adults or children, but it’s crucial with studies like this that we try to consider the whole picture, rather than just honing in on the drugs themselves. In the UK, what we’re looking at is the product of our mental healthcare system being suffocated by government-funding cuts. Empty promises of big cash injections have a human reality: distressed children, in need of specialist treatment, having to wait, and needing something.</p>

We've dug ourselves into such a deep and dark hole that no one seems to see any light any more! With every malaise shortsighted politics have brought it's people to face, they conjure up more of the same remedy!Does no one ask any fundamental questions such as what supports health? Certainly not growing up with constant fear of loosing a parent, a home, stressed out not to achieve and if after all that strife, having achieved higher "Education" trained to be one out of thousands competing to fit any notch to just survive to get drunk on a Friday evening, go to bed without any real friendships as every one is competing for the same morsel against every one....and still expect mental health? forget the physical health which is again in the hands of pharma and other industrial capitalistic views of financial growth more vital than health itself!

I disagree; I think the use of antidepressants has more to do with GPs accepting the ethos that they're needed in most cases whereas personally having been through it; I disagree.

A few minutes is never long enough to decide whether anyone, child or adult , is depressed or unhappy.As the government continues to make many people's lives more stressful , unhappiness is bound to increase. Anti-depressants can help with clinical depression, not social conditions.

Fascinating. When kids behave like kids we take them to an 'expert' who, in order to maintain their 'expert' illusion, have to find something 'wrong' with them, and prescribe the appropriate drug to cure the 'problem'. If Philip Larkin were alive he'd change it to ... "They fuck you up, your Mum, Dad and health care experts". The 'experts' aren't wearing any clothes ... wake up Britain.

I'm not sure I agree that manic episodes which develop into psychotic breaks are something that can be overcome with a bit of discipline and an understanding of the condition. The depression experienced by people with Bipolar disorder is also extremely intense and as such dangerous and something sufferers shouldn't be left to deal with thanks to a bit of therapy, yoga and herbal tea. Bipolar is one mental illness that is very well understood to be caused by demonstrably biological triggers and is often responsive to older and less expensive treatments like lithium. A person for whom I care very deeply was diagnosed after her first psychotic episode, which she luckily survived, and successfully treated with that drug. She had only one other episode, within a year or two, while in graduate school. She decided it was worth the risk to stop her medication and ride the wave of the mania she hoped that would trigger in order to get more done in less time. She knew this might happen the last time mania-induced sleeplessness and a hyper mind made her think she had an edge in the earlier stages of the psychosis. Luckily she called me while in the throes of the mania - I called her husband and mum saying she sounded like she was manic again - she went back on her meds, had to push back her school deadlines, but is now a successful professional and mum of 2 and takes her meds faithfully. When I hear or read someone downplaying the role of meds like lithium in changing the lives of those with manic depressive illness I imagine that time I thought that person I cared for so deeply would either die or see all her hopes and dreams, multitudinous due to her extreme intelligence and talent, come to nothing at the tender age of 17. I celebrate that there are treatments available for those with mental illness and that other than a few necessary adjustments they no longer present the probability of ruined relationships, job instability and unstable family lives.

Until this government makes a decision to address child mental health interventions, this situation will continue to escalate. As long as GP's are placed in the position of 'holding' their patients, while waiting access to limited talking therapies, the number of children being prescribed anti depressants, will continue to soar.

Yes, exactly that. Anti-depressants are very often the only way to keep a teenager out of harm's way. As long as they and their families also know that symptoms may get worse for 3 weeks before they get better. My daighter's GP didn't bother telling her that. She ended up in A&E at 1am one Saturday night threatening suicide. The incompetence of the medical profession is matched in many cases only by their ignorance and laziness.

I was very unhappy as a child - to the point where an educational psychologist thought I was severely depressed (although, in later years, it turned out that I was actually on the autistic spectrum, which explained why I was having such difficulty relating to people). I wasn't prescribed anti-depressants until my late teens, but I can't help wondering if my school years might have been a bit less traumatic if I had received some kind of medication. I don't think you can categorically say that children should never be prescribed anti-depressants - it very much depends on their precise circumstances, in my opinion.

On 27 January the BMA published the results of 70 trials of most common anti depressants, which found they doubled risk of suicide and aggressive behaviour in under 18's. This was reported in a Daily Telegraph article by Sarah Knapton on same day. She wrote that comparisons of clinical trials with actual patient reports found that pharmaceutical companies had routinely misclassified deaths and suicides in people taking anti depressants 'to favour products.' NHS guidelines state under 18's should not be given anti depressants. 'I don't remember reading a report of an inquest where a suicide verdict was applied to a child who had never been on psychiatric mediation,' said a father of a son who committed suicide. One thing young people don't need is anti depressants.

Not sure this is for the convenience of doctors - see comment by latenightreader - but they are constrained by what we as a society have come to expect medical professionals to deliver. If depression is looming I know from experience that exercise will help and I had better get on with it quick before the clouds are too low - but I would never expect a doctor to tell me to get out for a run.

I wrote too quickly. I should have said that another drug is prescribed to offset the bad side effects from the antidepressant. I personally think it's quite horrible to have to take a 'drug on top of a drug' to make it right, but that's what society does nowadays.

We can't say increasing prescription of antidepressants is simply down to funding cuts. Maybe more children/teenagers are becoming depressed in the first place. Maybe it's as simple as more are seeking medical help when previously they wouldn't have done. Maybe GPs are more likely to diagnose young people as depressed with the same symptoms.

That's the lazy logic - rightist logic. Only to be expected of a society which has shrugged off responsibility for those in need and handed decision making to the market, of course. With greedy, selfish people happy to be paying so little tax the social infrastructure needed to support the population collapses, and crowing about their success while mocking the fecklessness of those they dismiss as "losers", the result is inevitable. A sick, unequal, unjust society ruled by the worst facets of human nature and proud of it.

Author::::pitselehprintsesin
DateTime::::2016-03-11T19:12:03Z
Have a slow clap for your completely misunderstanding nature of depression. People diagnosed with clinical depression often have the endogenous (rather than reactive) kind; that is to say, they are not depressed 'about' anything in particular. They simply feel low and/or disengaged (among other things) most of the time without direct cause. Of course, as harrowperson mentioned, there are plenty of things a child can be reactively depressed about. But I'm afraid you don't have any idea what you're talking about if you think (as your comment suggests) that depression always follows from an unhappy experience.
