Finally, pornography is doing its bit to save the whales

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">P</span></span>resented with one or more of the innumerable crises currently facing our ailing planet, it’s easy to succumb to frustration; to think, “But what can someone like me do to help?” By this one usually means, “What can I do that doesn’t involve giving any money, or sacrificing anything, or looking up from my computer screen?”</p>

<p>To the two most common courses of action – “nothing” and “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter" title="">retweet</a> the outrage of others” – we may now add a third: “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/pornography" title="">watch porn</a>”. From now until the end of the month, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornhub" title="">Pornhub</a> – a sort of giant online sex video clearing house - is mounting a campaign to save the whales, through its “official philanthropic division”, Pornhub Cares. The oceans, you may have heard, are Not Safe for Whales (or NSFW, as it’s commonly abbreviated), and Pornhub wants to put that right.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/08/death-porn-video-phone-loneliness-sex">Death on the road, porn on the phone: a perfect tableau of modern loneliness | Andrew Brown</a> </p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the mechanics of the pornography-philanthropy nexus, it works like this: for every 2,000 dirty videos viewed, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.geek.com/news/the-more-pornhub-you-watch-in-february-the-more-you-save-the-whales-1646874/" title="">Pornhub Cares will donate one cent</a> to a nonprofit organisation dedicated to the conservation of whales. Pornhub’s Save the Whales webpage (which is totally Safe For Whales, by the way; just don’t click on the “Blow your load” button) has a video view counter at the bottom which, if accurate, tells us that the whales will net $27,000 by 29 February. Traffic varies, though – it goes up during blizzards, and apparently dropped 10% on the day <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.neowin.net/news/neobytes--pornhub-sees-10-traffic-drop-after-gamers-get-fallout-4" title="">Fallout 4</a> was launched. It’s impossible to tell how many of those views were undertaken solely to help whales.</p>

<p>This is not Pornhub’s first philanthropic initiative. In the past the website has launched campaigns to coincide with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/25/boob-bus-porn-hub-bree-olsen-breast-cancer-exam_n_1452715.html" title="">breast cancer</a> and testicular cancer awareness months. Last year someone was awarded the first annual Pornhub Cares scholarship. Most of its campaigns make liberal use of double entendres designed to cement the connection between masturbation and good works - a tree-planting scheme was called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://time.com/79406/now-you-can-help-save-the-environment-by-watching-a-bunch-of-porn/" title="">Pornhub Gives America Wood</a> - and this whale initiative is no exception. “We’re now asking our community to turn its attention to - and help save - a different type of blowhole, said Pornhub VP Corey Price, “one that belongs to a majestic species which once swelled in numbers throughout the oceans.” It doesn’t get more heartfelt than that.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>You may now be thinking, “What sort of whale preservation organisation accepts large donations from a porn site?” The answer is the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thedrum.com/tags/moclips-cetological-society" title="">Moclips Cetological Society </a>of Washington state, the sole beneficiary of Pornhub Cares’ generosity.</p>

<p>The MCS was founded in 1969, according to Pornhub’s press release, although the organisation was only recently reconstituted in 2014, after being dormant for over a decade. I emailed its president, Ken Balcomb, who confirmed the arrangement. “We do agree to receive contributions from Pornhub and its viewers,” he wrote, perhaps forgetting that they’re not just viewers - they’re a community. He said tax-deductible contributions would be redirected to the Center for Whale Research, which is primarily concerned with orcas in the Pacific Northwest, despite Pornhub’s efforts to shoehorn sperm whales into the story. According to Balcomb the MCS intends to investigate the effects of US navy sonar and bombing exercises in critical whale habitats. “That is really the major obscenity in this issue,” he said.</p>

<p>Balcomb is right: the porn industry may have its remarkably unpleasant side, but there’s no reason for the whales to find out about that. Only time and more further research will reveal whether cetaceans are intelligent enough to refuse charity on principle, or because a particular initiative gave rise to one excruciating double entendre too many.</p>

<p>In the meantime we must ask ourselves this: is it possible to do less in the name of philanthropy? You don’t have to run any distance, or collect any sponsors. The porn itself is free, so you don’t even have to stick your hand in your pocket, although I gather most people … no. For the sake of the whales, this time I’m not going to go there.</p>

Can't find figures on traffic. I still think the point is valid. There is so much information and data available the actual amount of porn has diminished.

The porn industry exploits and degrades people, especially women. If you want to help the environment, there are better ways to do it.

Or that the whales are picketing this due to it being a patriarchal sexist construct designed to keep them oppressed.

Sperm whales are lucky they happen to have a suggestive name in this case.

Have you noticed how large numbers of Wales are beaching on the UK coast and North European coasts recently?I'm sure it is purely a coincidence that this is increasingly happening as more and more off shore wind farms are built.Have the greens done it again? Killing wales with their CO2 obsession.Just like the devastation they have caused with their biofuels.

With a headline like that , how could I not read the article? Having said that, I now know something I neither wanted nor needed to know, and which will be extremely difficult to casually drop into flagging conversations.

Traffic is unrelated to the number of websites you know.

The means justifies the end? Depends on what sort of porn. But then again the way industry deceives people is almost universal . The charities now send out products, expecting people to pay without solicitation and don't put identification on the package or envelop so you cannot return to sender. The thing is, some people just do not have money and not everyone is well off. How presumptuous.

The academics behind the research based their results on analysis of the million most frequented sites in the world. Most people now turn to the web to see pornography Their estimate? Just 4% of those websites were porn.
