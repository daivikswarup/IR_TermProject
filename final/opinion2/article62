If a moderate like Sadiq Khan shouldn’t stand for London mayor, which Muslim can?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span> did warn him. Shortly after he became the first Muslim to attend cabinet, I urged <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan">Sadiq Khan</a> to be prepared. The Islamophobes, the new McCarthyites, would at some stage come after him. He laughed it off. Yet it was only a matter of time. In the current climate of anti-Muslim hysteria, it was perhaps naive of Khan and his advisers to believe that he could run for City Hall as a proud and public Muslim without being targeted or smeared.</p>

<p>Consider the recent spate of newspaper headlines: “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/exposed-sadiq-khans-family-links-to-extremist-organisation-a3179066.html">Exposed: Sadiq Khan’s family links to extremist organisation</a>” (Evening Standard); “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article1668187.ece">Khan joined radical imam at rallies</a>” (Sunday Times); “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/12145126/Labours-mayoral-hopeful-linked-to-online-bin-Laden.html">Khan linked to ‘online bin Laden’</a>” (Daily Telegraph); “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6935231/Sadiq-Khan-gave-speech-with-black-flag-of-jihad-flying.html">Sadiq Khan gave speech with ‘black flag of jihad’ flying</a>” (the Sun).</p>

<p>These stories basically boil down to: hard-working constituency MP and former human rights lawyer who campaigned against the extradition of a constituent, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/02/terror-babar-ahmad-extradition">Babar Ahmed</a>, to the US on terrorism charges, and for the release of British resident <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/shaker-aamer">Shaker Aamer</a> from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/guantanamo-bay">Guantánamo Bay</a>, may, in the process, have shared platforms with allegedly unsavoury characters who’ve made unpleasant remarks. <em>Quelle surprise</em>.</p>

<p>What of his “family links” to extremists? Apparently, a man who was once married to Khan’s sister may have spoken at events organised by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/al-muhajiroun">al-Muhajiroun</a> back in the 1990s (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://politicalscrapbook.net/2016/02/how-the-right-wing-media-created-a-story-of-sadiq-khans-terror-links-out-of-thin-air/">though this is disputed)</a>. Seriously? Is that it? Are we all now responsible for the political or theological views of all our relatives? In this case, not even a blood relation, but a former member of Khan’s extended family. Where does it end?</p>

<p>This is not merely guilt by association; this is the rightwing media’s favourite game of “six degrees of Islamist separation”. Khan isn’t the first victim – and won’t be the last. Everyone from former Tory cabinet minister <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2015/02/22/baroness-warsi-placed-islamist-radicals-at-heart-of-whitehall/">Sayeeda Warsi</a> – who warned that Islamophobia had “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jan/20/lady-warsi-islamophobia-muslims-prejudice">passed the dinner table test</a>” back in 2011 – to ex-Respect chair <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/salma-yaqoob">Salma Yaqoob</a>, to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31905704">Muslim schoolteachers in Birmingham</a>, have been subjected to similar smears, suspicion and innuendo. British Muslims aren’t blind; they see the way the likes of Khan or Warsi are treated and draw the only obvious conclusion – Islamophobia has been mainstreamed in modern Britain.</p>

<p>The journalists who penned these recent pieces on Khan may, rightly, protest that they are not Islamophobes and ask, “Should we not report this stuff?” To which the response should be: “Do you seriously believe Khan is a secret extremist? Or that he once held, or sympathised with, extreme views? If not, why suggest that to your readers? How is that not a smear?”</p>

<p>Khan, as they well know, has been outspoken in his denunciations of extremism and terrorism – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6697110/Sadiq-Khan-We-must-stop-our-kids-being-sucked-into-a-world-of-hate.html">including in the pages of the Sun</a> – and even upset many fellow British Muslims last year by accusing them of “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/sadiq-uk-muslims-must-do-more-to-root-out-cancer-of-extremism-a3118801.html">burying their heads in the sand</a>” over the extent of the Islamic State threat to the UK.</p>

<p>And consider too the rhetoric from some of Khan’s political opponents. Last September, during Labour’s mayoral nomination race, a volunteer on rival Tessa Jowell’s campaign told a party member: “Long term you have to consider that Sadiq Khan is a liability because he’s a Muslim” (a comment that Jowell, to her credit, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tessa-jowell-apologises-after-volunteer-claims-sadiq-khan-would-be-liability-as-mayor-because-hes-a2926446.html">immediately disowned and apologised for</a>).</p>

<p>In December, Tory mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith’s campaign had to investigate a canvasser who, while distributing leaflets in south London, allegedly referred to Khan as “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/29/zac-goldsmith-sadiq-khan-london-mayoral-campaign-islamophobic-canvasser">the Muslim</a>”.</p>

<p>Goldsmith, like Jowell, isn’t an Islamophobe. He has been a friend of the Kingston mosque in his west London constituency, and called for a “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://muslimnews.co.uk/newspaper/interview/islamophobia-becomes-issue-in-london-mayor-elections/">zero-tolerance approach toward hate crimes</a>”. Yet he still had no qualms about referring to Khan as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/mayor-battle-heats-up-as-zac-goldsmith-accuses-sadiq-khan-of-divisive-and-radical-politics-a3131501.html">“radical” and “divisive”</a> in a campaign leaflet. Do I have to remind him that, in an era in which radicalisation is associated almost wholly with violent Muslims, this is a deeply irresponsible use of language? Can the normally sensible, Eton-educated Goldsmith be unaware of this? (On a side note, the Tory mayoral candidate’s own former brother-in-law, Pakistani politician Imran Khan, has been accused – unfairly, in my view – of being a “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://qz.com/315636/can-taliban-apologist-imran-khan-reinvent-himself-and-his-politics-once-again/">Taliban apologist</a>”. Should this be “news” too? Of course not, but the media double standard here is pretty brazen.)</p>

<p>At a Tory campaign rally in January, the prime minister said the capital needed a mayor who would be “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/27/david-cameron-facing-dog-_n_9091200.html">tough on Islamist extremists that want to divide our country</a>” – the implication being that Khan wouldn’t be. An aide to the Labour mayoral candidate later described David Cameron’s comments as a “dog whistle” to London’s voters – one in three of whom told YouGov in August that they would be “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lbc.co.uk/only-half-of-londoners-would-be-comfortable-with-muslim-mayor-114523">uncomfortable</a>” having a Muslim mayor.</p>

<p>The irony is that Khan’s election to the mayoralty would be a massive victory in the battle against extremism and terrorism. His arrival in City Hall would be a stark rebuttal of Isis-inspired claims that the west is at war with Islam, that democracy and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/islam">Islam</a> cannot be reconciled, that Muslims have no future in Europe. It is difficult to overstate the huge symbolism and historic significance of a Khan win on 5 May.</p>

<p>To have a Muslim elected mayor of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a>, with a bigger personal democratic mandate than any other politician in Europe bar the presidents of France and Portugal, would strike a significant blow against the simplistic narratives of Islamophobes and Islamists alike. (This isn’t, incidentally, an endorsement of Khan’s candidacy, nor should religious background ever be a reason to vote for, or against, a candidate. It is simply an observation of fact.)</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">To have a Muslim elected mayor of London would strike a significant blow against the Islamophobes and Islamists alike</p>

<p>Remember: here is a Muslim politician who has regretted his party’s “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/145335/interview-sadiq-khan-believe-me-i-wont-be-another-ken-livingstone">unacceptably anti-Jewish</a>” image, received death threats for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2013/02/18/labour-mp-sadiq-khan-receives-death-threats-for-supporting-same-sex-marriage/">voting for same-sex marriage</a> and campaigned to save his local pub in Tooting. I have said it before but I will say it again: if the likes of Khan are “extremists”, then who are the “moderates”? Which British Muslims will be allowed to succeed in public life, without being maligned or defamed?</p>

<p>As Khan himself told me <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/06/09/sadiq-khan-birmingham-extremist-plot-muslim_n_5471818.html">in 2014</a>, he had spent “the past 20 years of my life going to different diverse communities and [saying] get involved in civil society, get involved in mainstream politics”.</p>

<p>“If the impression is left that somehow you becoming involved” in public life results in accusations of extremism, he explained, then “you say, ‘You know what, I can’t be bothered.’”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/27409/muslims-europe-basis-greater-understanding-already-exists.aspx">Surveys show</a> London’s Muslims want to make a difference, to contribute to their communities and stand for office. The shabby and calumnious treatment of Khan’s candidacy by his opponents will only serve to deter those members of a marginalised and demonised community from coming forward. Then the radicals and extremists will really have won – and we will all be the losers.</p>

Yep. For me anyone openly religious, claiming it guides them and other such nonsense, are people of low intelligence and morals; and so should absolutely never be in positions of power and influence. Alas the dimwit Cameron and countless other politicians keep managing to get to powerful positions ... no wonder I have no faith in them.

Not convinced it was his stag night. He was already married before this occurred. And it was apparently Ramadan for crying out loud, where muslims abstain from food water and sex. And I'm sorry, but you cannot claim to be a feminist and fight for women's rights if you're parading in the very place that objectifies women.

Your implicit assumption is that Sadiq Khan would naturally be compelled to side, and see as victims, anyone who is a member of his religious persuasion - therein may lie some of the problem. I'd sort of expect prominent British politicians to assess a situation on the basis of rational analysis, with an inbuilt motivation to further British interests. This may lead them to support or reject military action. The worry is that religious identity trumps everything, with British interests a very long way down the priority list, if present at all, and many people on the left don't seem to see this as a potential problem.

Are you saying that Britain's invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan - without provocation - caused no anger and resentment in the Muslim world? This unprovoked aggression by Britain not only lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians, but also to the displacement of millions more, the loss of livelihood, property and education for an entire generation. We all totally deplore terrorism in any form, but don't expect angry and desperate people to react in a way that you think is fit. Perhaps this is what Mr Khan was trying to say.

There's no absolute problem with a Muslim mayor of London. I'm sure if the Tory MP Nusrat Munir Ul-Ghani stood there would be no problem. But she's a Tory, and the trouble with Labour people is that many have flirted with foreign terrorist causes lie the Corbinites with the IRA and Isis), or with adversarial states like the USSR. Sadiq Khan is no exception.

Great Britain is NOT an Islamic country. Being a British Muslim in public office must mean you putting the needs of the public ahead of your own beliefs. I'm rather betting this will cut down the number of potential candidates considerably and rightly so.
