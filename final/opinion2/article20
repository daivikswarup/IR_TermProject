The EU isn’t just about business. That’s why I think Scotland will vote to stay

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he people of Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, will <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/20/cameron-set-to-name-eu-referendum-date-after-cabinet-meeting" title="">soon decide</a> whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union. The Scottish government believes that continued EU membership is in the best interests of Scotland. We would much prefer Scotland to be one of the independent member states of the EU – and hope that in future we will be. However, whether independent or part of the UK, we believe that we are better off in than out. As such, the Scottish government will make a positive and constructive case for remaining in the EU. I believe that we benefit from being part of the EU, and the EU benefits from having us a part of it.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/eu-inefficient-toasters-ban-delayed-avoid-pro-brexit-press-attack">EU's ban on inefficient toasters delayed to avoid pro-Brexit press attack</a> </p>

<p>For more than 40 years, membership of the EU has been good for the prosperity and wellbeing of individuals, families and communities across the country. Just look at some of the social protections the EU has established: the right not to be discriminated against on the basis of age, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity; maternity and parental leave entitlement; the right to paid holidays; the right to work for no more than 48 hours each week – all of these are enshrined in EU law.</p>

<p>These social benefits need to be articulated just as strongly as the economic benefits of membership. But the economic benefits matter too. As part of the EU, UK firms have the huge advantage of being able to work in the world’s largest trading area of 500 million consumers. For Scotland, this is crucial, as the EU is our top overseas exports destination: 42% of our exports outside the UK in 2014 – worth more than £11bn – were sold into the EU market. Membership of the single market also helps to support more than 300,000 jobs in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a>.</p>

<p>Having access to the European single market has removed barriers to trade and gives freedom to move capital, people, goods and services – but the EU is not simply an economic union, it is so much more than that. Being part of the EU is also about solidarity, social protection and mutual support. This has become even more evident in the recent months, with members of the EU working collectively on pressing global challenges, such as the movement of refugees and migrants, energy security and climate change. By working together within the EU, we can achieve far more and make a real difference to some of the world’s most vulnerable people.</p>

<p>While it’s clear that being a member of the EU has its benefits, within any institution improvements can be made. If we are to influence positive change in Europe, we must remain within it – only that guarantees our role in the EU decision-making processes on issues that affect our everyday lives. Right now, as a member of the EU, the UK sits at the top table in Brussels, with the opportunity to shape EU policy and make a positive contribution to Europe. As Norway’s former foreign minister Espen Barth Eide has said, as a member of the European Economic Area as opposed to the EU, Norway makes a substantial contribution to the EU budget, but has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/27/norway-eu-reality-uk-voters-seduced-by-norwegian-model" title="">no vote and no presence</a> when crucial decisions that affect the daily lives of its citizens are made.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/brexit-effect-everyday-life">What would Brexit mean for everyday life in the UK?</a> </p>

<p>Two weeks ago, as European leaders were forced to break off from discussing the refugee crisis in order to negotiate the taper rate at which the UK can cut benefits for working EU citizens, I can’t have been the only person wondering whether the UK’s standing in the world was really being enhanced by that process. In the weeks ahead, both sides of the debate must aspire to higher ideals.</p>

<p>A concern for Scotland is the prospect of voting to stay in but being taken out of the EU on the strength of a UK-wide vote. I have repeatedly made it clear that such a scenario would, in my view, lead to strong demands for a second independence referendum. Indeed, I have met people who voted no in September 2014 who say they would vote yes in such circumstances. However, I have also been clear that this is not a scenario I want to see unfold. A UK vote to leave the EU is not the circumstance in which I would choose to fight a second independence referendum – but as first minister I would have a duty to listen to the demands for such a vote.</p>

<p>While I take nothing for granted, I believe that in June people in Scotland will demonstrate their support for remaining in the EU. My hope is that the rest of the UK will share that commitment. Because if it does, it will be good for Scotland, good for the UK and good for Europe.</p>

We can cherry pick on details. the poll tax is an old favorite for some !!! (rolled out in Scotland 1989 and England 1990 to replace rates. Now called the Community Charge). the issue is when it comes to the UK Union some Scots and other Brits look at this with more heart than sense. So what I hear many say, if the people want it we live in a democracy don't we.

Lies, damned lies and statistics.The export trade figures are deliberately misleading, 80% of British production stays in the UK only 20% is exported, of which half (that is 10%) goes to the EU and some of that is going to european ports to be forwarded to other countries. So the true figure is less than 10% of our production goes to the EU

Always puzzled by the fact that Nats bang on about being ruled from London but they're perfectly happy to be ruled from Brussels by an organisation over which they have far less influence. Being a minnow in the EU isn't independence.

The SNP is now joining up with the leaders of the Tory, Labour, Green and LibDem parties to embrace the EU.The SNP says it opposes austerity but wants us to stay in the EU which forces austerity on us all. It says it opposes TTIP and TISA but wants us to stay in the EU which wants to force TTIP and TISA on us all. Nicola Sturgeon said that TTIP was ‘a reminder of the massive opportunities that European Union membership brings’. (Like the one million lost jobs TTIP would cost, as the European Commission, very discreetly, admitted?)The SNP opposed having a referendum. It told us we had no right to a vote, now it turns round and tells us how to vote. It had no right to deny us a vote. It has no right to tell us how to vote in the referendum they fought to deny us.The SNP even has the totally undemocratic policy that a minority in Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland should overrule the majority, that a minority could veto the majority.

Exactly. If Nicola Sturgeon does not believe that the UK is big enough to negotiate with the EU what chance does she think she has?

I wouldn't rule out the possibility that she has not thought it through properly and has painted herself into a corner. The inconsistency in her argument is glaring. Judging from her less than firebrand campaigning this might be starting to dawn on her.

Yes. It is entirely inconsistent.

The EU is austerity on steroids. Ask the Greeks. Nicola Sturgeon has also conveniently skipped the fact that Scotland would have to join the euro and accept Schengen.

You are rather sure of yourself. The vote last time was close run. Scotland is anti austerity and the current tories are even more ruthless than the con dems in power when the vote was held. There was widespread expectation of a labour government in 2015, which hasn't materialised, and 2020 is a tough call for labour to say the least. And being out of Europe is hardly a threat to the Scots if the UK votes out. It rather presents their only chance - realistic or not - of getting back in!

Nicola Sturgeon is following in Salmond's footsteps by misleading the Scottish people.Salmond recieved no assurances from EU re automatic membership in the case of declaring independence from rest of UK.It was the case then and still is that Scotland would have to apply for EU membership.This scenario is also highly unlikely since I doubt very much that Scots would vote for independence in case of Brexit.Scotland could not sustain itself as an independent country and most Scots know it.As far as Sturgeon's claims about benefits of EU all of these social contracts can be instituted in UK without EU membership.The EU has failed spectacularly to deal with Eurozone financial crisis,Greece and immigration and it has had years to deal with all of them.It is no nearer to a solution now and seems incapable of coming up with a coherent effective solution.It is also obvious that the EU does need reform but cannot do it as threat of Brexit has shown.

Not at all. One is a democratic, stable prosperous and successful union, and only after Scotland joined did it flourish as a nation. The other has already brought its smallest nations to their knees and a state of servitude.

We all know politicians don't answer questions properly if the truth doesn't suit their cause, and that's why the public simply don't trust them, but can I ask that Ms Sturgeon please answers one question honestly for a change? Looking to the future, why can't I find anywhere in print an SNP politician making any comment about the possibility if we continue membership, that the UK including Scotland could be swamped by EU passport holders 5/20 years from now, coming from any or all of the seven poor countries currently applying for membership (130/230 million people) ? Is it that none think it is possible, or is just better to hide this possibility from the voters, together with the implications involved in jobs, housing, schools, hospitals and crime?

Nationalists who want Scottish independence in europe probably don't know how they feel. It has to be one of the most muddle headed hypocritical positions you could take. How you can Argue for cooperation in Europe at the same time as telling your closest neighbours to sod off is beyond me.

So a question, when precisely did I say delay it until I was sure the independence side would win? When did I say the SNP should have total control?
