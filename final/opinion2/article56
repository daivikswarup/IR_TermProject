The cadet force turned me into a pacifist. So I’m all for the idea




DateTime::::2016-03-12T00:03:01+0000



<p>Peeling spuds in the pouring rain at 4am is hardly anybody’s idea of a good education but to a spotty 15-year-old anything is preferable to double physics.</p>

<p>Last week, Radio 4’s <em>Today</em> programme reported on government plans to encourage more state schools to establish<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schoolreport/35748859" title=""> cadet forces</a>. Apparently, David Cameron is keen to see the number of units expand to 500 by 2020, with chancellor George Osborne committing £50m towards it.</p>

<p>If this is achievable or, indeed, desirable, a whole new generation could soon be escaping the classroom to learn the hard way how to feed themselves, and a whole lot more besides, not least that there is nothing at all glamorous about guns and knives.</p>

<p>I’m no supporter of blimpish ideas to bring back national service or send our young to mindless boot camps. Indeed, I’m not even sure of the wisdom of learning to square-bash in cadet forces, but I do have a theory: if every teenager were responsibly exposed to the true nature of warfare and allowed to fire the weapons that kill and maim it might quickly dispel any jihadi, computer game or gang fantasies that could be lurking in their impressionable minds.</p>

<p>To be handed a .303 rifle and told by a fearsome sergeant that a single shot would, if it didn’t kill you, probably take off a limb was frighteningly real information to teenaged me.</p>

<p>Loading a clip of curiously shiny rounds into the magazine I could vividly imagine what my grandfather faced when he lost his arm in battle. I could see the metal that would have torn through flesh and bone and understand just how terrifying that must have been to a young man not much older than me and far away from home and loved ones.</p>

<p>The dead weight of the rifle and its donkey-kick recoil stay with me to this day, as does the ease with which I sent a spurt of sub-machine gun fire hurtling across a misty firing range. To feed a chattering heavy weapon with a belt of rounds and see the destruction it can wreak in a few seconds is to truly understand just how hideous firearms can be. Close up, clothed in a cruel, dull black, they are brutally ugly; even when silent, their lethal potential is ever-present – something never truly evident in films or in the colourful unreality of some super-violent computer game.</p>

<p>You would think twice about carrying a knife if you knew what hideous damage a bayonet can do and you would certainly never want to go anywhere near explosives once you’ve seen the destructive power of a single stick of gelignite. All this and more convinced me and several of my comrades that there was nothing seductive about the smell of cordite.</p>

<p>My time in the cadets did, however, teach me to sail, to fly a light plane and to hone my very limited culinary skills. My spud peeling was conducted on the deck of a minesweeper as it churned its way through an inky English Channel. The night before, my schoolboy shipmates and I had been sent over the side to learn how to use a paintbrush, covering the little ship from stem to stern, right down to the waterline, following the old forces adage: “If it moves, salute it. If it doesn’t move, pick it up. If you can’t pick it up, paint it.”</p>

<p>It did not, however, teach me to navigate. Out in a small naval vessel in the Solent one day a petty officer asked me to fix our position. I took the compass and did my best to give him the co-ordinates. “Well, you’d better take your hat off,” he said. “According to you we’re in St Paul’s Cathedral.”</p>

<p>And, back on dry land, the final irony: this weapon-phobic pacifist was judged the best shot in his year.</p>

Three of my children have been through CCF and all three share this articles sentiment. I work in a boarding school and this piece is going to be read by fifty boys tonight.

I wish I could have fired the old FN L1 A1 your army used before the SA-80 as I heard they were very accurate and rarely jammed unlike our old 'Nam vintage "Mattel Toys" aka M-16 A1s esp when dirty. I once owned a match grade semi auto AR-15 A-2 and it was a tack driver- wish I never sold it though the 1990 assault weapon ban in CA. would have made that a moot point.

Hi Maj_jak2509. In your replay to ClaudeNAORobot you mentioned the subject of "what the point of marching is". I did plenty of marching in my Army days, from day to day unit stuff to public ceremonial marching, incl funeral firing parties. But if someone were to ask me "what the point of marching is" I wouldn't have a ready answer. What's yours?

- I was viciously bullied in the Marines when I was stationed overseas in Okinawa, Japan where I was the victim of a nightmarish hazing incident in the barracks that got completely out of hand and 35 years on, I'm still too ashamed to tell my own brother. The incident left me with a seething hatred of bullies to last a life time. Yes, the Corps has a very Nietzchean aspect to it and as one can argue it makes one stronger, it also turns out sadists and nut jobs with a sizeable number of victims like from sexual assaults- the ugly secret I'm saddened to say has not gone away one bit. I could tell stories from my era to make a stone weep.

There are other organisations than the military to learn skills with, a plethora of environmental organisations for a start, all willing and able to teach some useful tasks - not peeling spuds at 4am in the channel. The internet is a good place to start if you want to make a change to the way the planet is run.

I was in the cadets. It was good fun, but when someone I knew from school ran his finger along the top of a doorframe and presented the dusty digit to me, I decided it was all very silly and gave it a miss.

Not academic research, but if one hears repeated, over the years, similar comments related to the conduct of matters at cadets,in more than one geographical location, one would be foolish to regard such comments as circumstantial. Your expertise, no doubt, is based upon something much more profound and reliable ?

Two seconds of thought is all that is required to reject your comment, untrue in detail and dangerous in implication. Bullying makes nobody stronger.

If you lead from the front you can be shot from behind as well as from the front. The real top brass were generally well at the rear when things got hot. Blackadder was portrayed as a junior officer who knew all this and it all came true in the series, though some folks swear that it wasn't the case in the actual war.

Those who are against Cadet Forces and able bodied are the damp eyed wet tissue lot with notes from matron. They malinger through life making excuses for their lack of moral spine/courage and pretend they are 'conscientious objectors' and all that waffle. I have come across many of these types, mummies boys, confused about themselves, would rather scratch/shriek than punch, ill all the time, unusual hobbies like stamp collecting/train spotting, generally of the far left politically....bah flimshaw.

Best point made so far. In Tavistock Square in London you'll see the contribution to the Peace Movement made by those who have the clearest view of violence - Hospital Staff. Violence is a last resort in defending yourself against physical aggression - nothing else.

So many wearing rose coloured spectacles commenting today. The darker side of cadet life involves the bullying, sexual harassment and ugly social roles that are unsurprisingly as common in cadet units as in poorly managed army units. Just that there are more poorly managed cadet units. Think Deepcut and you are getting close to the reality. My evidence for this ? An interest in the cadets and talking with students participating over 30 years of school life.

A voluntary Cadet Force is probably not a bad idea per se if gives young people with military inclinations to explore the possibilities of a career. I would strongly advise against a full blown military service though.I did mine at 18 in the European country I was born in. It was the most monumental waste of time and manpower I have ever witnessed in my entire life. It was a year spent with horrid, ignorant people and thuggish, cretinous officers. Some of the conscripts were criminals in civil life. Britain has efficient, determined, committed armed forces (despite the cuts). If you want to completely destroy them, conscription is the way to go, trust me on that.

You'd enjoy shooting much more these days, Stephen - the SA80 is ergonomic, feeds shoulder-friendly 5.56 rounds from a magazine, and is semi-automatic. Best of all it comes in a stylish black/green colour scheme that I understand is all the rage in Islington this year.

Clearly the clay pigeon shooting my son did last weekend with the cadets was an illusion. As was the annual camp. As were the exercises on Salisbury Plain. As will be the mountain biking course he is going on in two weeks. As will be the DofE Gold training he is doing. As are the instructors courses he has done so he can help teach the other cadets. As are the affordable foreign trips. It doesn't always pay to be cynical.

The CCF was mandatory at my school and using the weapons certainly didn't make me into a pacifist. I thoroughly enjoyed using them, in fact. Because - whether we like it or not - guns are tremendous fun.And, since several boys who'd been in the CCF in my year alone went on to careers in the Army and RAF, I'd say the author's theory is pretty much complete hogwash.

On the one hand there are people who seek to throw a blanket over all British military activity and justify all of it. And there are others who are pacifists under all circumstances.The most sensible policies as usual lie between the extremes of the left and right polarisations offered to divide us. Use force to defend yourself against physical aggression but never start a fight.
