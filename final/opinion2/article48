Headline::::
Minority reporting and an age-old question of the right language




DateTime::::2016-03-07T07:00:57+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">S</span></span>omething of a theme has emerged in recent Open Door columns, which have looked at the way in which the Guardian describes minority groups, and furthermore what members of those groups think of that language. Sometimes the complaints are substantial; sometimes a word here, a phrase there, causes a spasm of irritation rather than full-blown rage.</p>

<p>One error that seems ever more important to correct in the light of the debate about the age at which state pensions are to be paid is the misuse of the word “elderly”.</p>

<p>A story published on the Guardian’s website on 17 February (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/17/one-of-three-hillwalkers-found-after-going-missing-has-died" title="">One of three hillwalkers found after going missing has died</a>) began: “One of three elderly hillwalkers who had been missing overnight in Dumfries and Galloway has died...” It went on to say that the three walkers were aged 64, 73 and 74. A second man later died.</p>

<p>A reader wrote: “I’m 64, in my last year at uni, and although I am happy to be considered as older, I am not ‘elderly’.</p>

<p>“I think reporters (which I was for 44 years) should be careful about using the term elderly in the same way they are careful about LGBT or race issues. Elderly is not a good description, especially when readers can make their own judgment because the ages are given.”</p>

<p>The story contravened the Guardian style guide, which rules: “‘elderly people’: do not use to describe anyone under 75”.</p>

<p>As well as exercising caution around language, journalists increasingly have to be sensitive to the needs of readers who are affected by the issues being reported on or discussed.</p>

<p>On 3 February the Guardian published a story on its website with the headline “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/03/man-suspected-killing-estranged-wife-two-children-jailed-assault" title="">Man suspected of killing estranged wife had been jailed for assaulting her</a>”. It gave some background to a tragic story about a man who was found dead after his wife and two children had been murdered.</p>

<p>The story began: “A man suspected of killing his estranged wife and their two children was jailed in 2013 after being convicted of assault against her, it has emerged.</p>

<p>“Geraldine Newman, 51, was found dead with her son and daughter by a concerned friend. Police investigating the murders said on Tuesday that they had discovered the body of the suspect, Paul Newman, 42, on cliffs in South Stack in Anglesey, 180 miles away.”</p>

<p>It is now our standard practice when a story involves suicide to print contact details for the Samaritans in a footnote, as we did on this occasion.</p>

<p>Several readers were puzzled by the decision: “I was surprised to see, at the end of your report on the identification of Geraldine Newman’s estranged husband as the murderer of her and her two children, a link to the Samaritans. I do understand there being an editorial policy in place that requires this to follow any article dealing with a suicide, but when reporting the case of a man previously convicted of assaulting his wife going on to kill her, their children and later himself, it seems misplaced. Perhaps a link to Women’s Aid and similar organisations internationally would have been more appropriate? It strikes me that the Guardian is recognising the wrong victim here.”</p>

<p>Another reader wrote: “The story concerns the horribly frequent tragedy of a woman and her children murdered by her partner/their father. He has committed suicide. While I can see a case for providing a link to sources of support for people affected by the story, surely the top priority should be to help people affected by domestic violence to get to safety? Linking to just the Samaritans seems to make the man’s suicide the main focus of the story.”</p>

<p>I am sure that no judgment was intended, but I understand the points made by these readers. I don’t think one set of contact details should be dropped for another, as there may well be people who would benefit from counselling or help in all of these circumstances. On this occasion two sets of contact details would be the answer – at least on the web where there is the space. But it is an ethical consideration that even five years ago I am sure most journalists would not have expected to encounter.</p>

The Guardian got the headline right on the story about yesterday's terrorist attacks in Israel. Apparently the complaints of bias following the previous article were justified, despite your article of denial.

"So when you talk about "the majority discriminating against minorities" it looks like you think that anyone not in a minority group does so. "

Having worked in several, I can promise you that they don't: they are just more open about it. These conversations happen daily in every news organisation. I personally think the transparency shown here is far better than pretending it doesn't happen.

After ranting about connotations of words, or what is suggested by them, you use ones which have negative connotations themselves. Geriatric may well be a proper medical term - but it's also often used to indicate someone very old and frail. In my experience Americans use senior as we would old. 



Author::::ionetranq
DateTime::::2016-03-08T09:15:48Z
That's because you're not looking. Women of that age and much more describe themselves as girls. As do men who are that age or older describe themselves as girls. Night out with the girls/boys is not an indicator that either group is necessarily young.



Author::::ionetranq

It does have that connotation in certain contexts, but I don't think it does in this case. Having been called a "spastic" and various derivations of it many times as a Disabled child, I detect you aren't being entirely serious.

I agree that comments on the Guardian site are mostly better than ones on other sites, such as the Telegraph or the Mail, both of which seem to be frequented mostly by people who are deranged or illiterate, or both

I have no problem with the use of the word teenager, but I don't see the point in adding the adjective young. You might just as well refer to an elderly centenarian.

If the majorities had spent less time discriminating against the minorities for entirely arbitrary reasons, we wouldn't have minority groups clamouring for equal rights.

Poor Chris. You are on a hiding to nothing whatever phrase you use. There are those who are determined to take offence either for political purposes or because they are emotionally immature. Then there are those who are actually interested in the content of what you say.

And the 'elderly' are pretty coddled in our society compared to other groups. When an oppressed group is belittled, it legitimises and perpetuates the oppression.

I could happily laugh it off when I was in my early 30s and got quietly called an "old codger" by some 12 year olds on a train, but I don't think that I would find it so funny now I'm in my late 60s.

Having now lived in Florida twice, I'm actually opposed to the term "elderly", but not for any of the usual reasons, but because it's root word, "elder", carries connotations of wisdom (or at least knowledge), which simply doesn't hold up to closer scrutiny - they are no wiser nor knowledgeable, and more likely to be prejudiced, than their younger brethren. And the terms more commonly used in the US, "senior citizen", or just "senior" are even worse, suggesting that the rest of us are "junior" citizens, and thus simply less important.

Since the overwhelming majority of stories about Her Majesty are accompanied by a photograph (and that pretty much anyone anywhere on the planet who would be likely to be reading the Guardian has seen a photo of the Sovereign fairly recently) any adjective describing here age would be redundant. 



Author::::Craig DeBlock

As long as we're playing "pick apart the language", I have to ask: why have you capitalized "disabled"? It's an adjective, not a proper noun.

To me any teenager is young but 'young teenager' suggests a person aged 13-15.

Surely a teenager is better defined than many other descriptions of people by age.It is a person aged between 13 & 19 whereas "elderly" or young is a very loose description.

A media organisation that doesn't constantly think about how it describes the world it is reporting on, would be doing a very poor job indeed. This type of conversation happens in every news organisation.

I don't think it adressed his point at all. His point was that he is confused by the ever changing terminology. The response was a total non sequitur, since it didn't address why these terms change, nor which ones are currently correct. It merely described (in an unnnecessarily snarky way) why the terms exist at all.



Author::::suedehead42
DateTime::::2016-03-07T14:21:18Z
At the other end of the age scale, perhaps you could make more effort to avoid the use of the term "young teenager". For most of us a teenager is, by definition, young.

My worry about the series of articles at the time of the 'elderly' hillwalkers was not the use of 'elderly' (although I see the point there) but the putting together of three separate stories concerning missing climbers/walkers and then posting very ambiguously-headlined updates - like 'a second walker found dead' when it was one of the climbers, for instance - which at least twice gave the impression that someone had been found dead from a different group than was the case, and also made it look like as if you were keeping a sortof combined mortality score.
