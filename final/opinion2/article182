Make a honk for rare geese

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>ne of the joys of winter is hearing geese honking conversationally to each other as they descend to their roosting sites at twilight. I used to hear Canada geese sail overhead to a Stoke Newington reservoir behind where I lodged in my London days. In Norfolk, the great <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/06/ruralaffairs">skeins of pink‑footed geese</a> that congregate on the marshes at Holkham are a wonder of the natural world.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/british-national-bird-robin-murderous-bully">Britain has spoken – and chosen a vicious murdering bully as its national bird | Philip Hoare</a> </p>

<p>Our rapidly changing climate is helping many wild geese to thrive – but one subspecies is not. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://monitoring.wwt.org.uk/our-work/goose-swan-monitoring-programme/species-accounts/greenland-white-fronted-goose/">Greenland white-fronted goose</a> is a Celtic specialist which flies from western Greenland to enjoy the mild winters of Scotland, Ireland and Wales. I’m not being ironic: the bogs of western Britain and Ireland don’t freeze as they do in Scandinavia, so the geese can devour the roots of marshy plants on which they depend.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as a world expert in these birds, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/tfo@dmu.dk">professor Tony Fox</a> of Aarhus University, explains, numbers have almost halved since 1999 because warmer Atlantic temperatures have deflected spring weather fronts north to Greenland, causing snowfalls in April and May, just when the geese arrive there to breed. Late snow reduces food and a hungry goose produces fewer viable eggs.</p>

<p>This species is protected everywhere it lives – except England and Wales. They were once widespread in Wales, now there are just 21 birds left, on the Dyfi Estuary. Fox praises wildfowling clubs which have voluntarily agreed not to shoot them but the Welsh government has so far refused to give this rare bird legal protection. There’s a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://gov.wales/consultations/environmentandcountryside/conservation-white-fronted-geese-in-wales/">new public consultation</a> and people should get involved. They should at least raise a honk.</p>

<p>I appreciated a starring role by another endangered species at the weekend: the newspaper. Michael Caine and Jane Fonda are <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/youth">splendid in the film Youth</a>, but my gong for best supporting actor would go to Caine’s unrumpled sidekick, the Guardian.</p>

<p>At first, I was suspicious. Caine plays a curmudgeonly composer who spends much of a holiday in a Swiss spa leafing through the Guardian. Both Caine and the resort have seen better days. What is director Paolo Sorrentino saying about our lovely paper?</p>

<p>Worse was to come, the Guardian looms large in the film’s most tragic scene in what resembles a sinister piece of negative product placement by our rivals. If Caine had been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/13/the-independent-gave-me-some-of-the-most-exciting-times-of-my-career">an Independent reader</a>, Youth would now make a pertinent point about extinction but, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/15/paolo-sorrentino-michael-caine-youth-oscar-great-beauty">according to Sorrentino</a>, it was Caine’s personal choice to peruse the Guardian. This must be the most gratifying actorly embrace of the paper since Paddy Considine <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/06/television">told me he had to “wimp down”</a> to become a Guardian reporter in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/17/actionandadventure.mattdamon">The Bourne Ultimatum</a>.</p>

<p>Brandishing a newspaper will always be a superior cinematic symbol to scrolling through a smartphone. Like onscreen smoking, it is too expressive to lose. Caine’s Guardian reader may be decrepit and disillusioned but still oozes wit and discerning taste. I suspect that newspapers will not die for the same reason as cinema survives: on a good day, both remain a supreme pleasure.</p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">Near Stroud, Cotswolds, today. My earliest ever... OMG! <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://t.co/7JcARlS5GM">pic.twitter.com/7JcARlS5GM</a></p>

<p>Daffodils in south Devon think it’s April: they are over already. A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/NTMatthewOates/status/698891503226195968">flowering bluebell on the Cotswolds</a> believes that Valentine’s Day falls in May. In my part of the world, it is sleeting but a hollyhock is budded, poised to flower, as if it were July. This cold snap will be a relief for everyone hoping for a return to phenological norms. Wild animals and plants are fiendishly adaptable but, as our own disorientation – and the plight of the Greenland white-fronted goose – shows, some species are more adaptable than others.</p>

Also Greylag are likely to be feral birds, descendants of escapees from wildfowl collections, unless you live in the north and west of Scotland. As such, they aren't considered native throughout much of the UK.

I read with interest of the rare geese in Wales and goggled at the bluebell on the Cotswolds. But the praise for The Guardian struck me as a shoe-horning and sycophantic irrelevance. We all know this newspaper is having to cut jobs - and I could name a few well-known hacks who'd be on my list – but is the unctuous Mr Barkham trying to keep his safe?

The point is that if further research is funded and establishes that an increase in Canada geese populations in Greenland is affecting white front populations, then something can be done.

Jane Fonda of the 60s/ 70s would have the support of today's Guardian. Hindsight informs us that the Vietnam war was based on lies, deceit, denial, arrogance and ignorance.  These negative qualities, of a small number of powerful people in politics, military and media sent young men to fight in rice paddies, jungle and mountains, where they risked death by sniper, mine and booby trap on a daily basis. Air crew from navy and air force risked being shot down and incarcerated for many years, as missions over parts of North Vietnam, needed to overcome the most sophisticated air defends systems of that era. Fonda was filmed firing anti aircraft weapons at US warplanes in Hanoi. Bob Hope supported the troops, always, which is not to say he was pro war, but was smart enough to understand that the soldiers were ordered there, and the time in Vietnam for most combat troops was an extremely unpleasant and very disturbing experience. By the end of the 60s, troops returning to America were subjected to abuse, even at the airport, where combat stressed veterans were called murderers and worse. Bob hope stood by the troops, returning to Asia every year for his Christmas specials. He cracked jokes that resonated with the feelings of GIs, who accepted his sarcastic humour with the affection it was given. " This place looks like Malibu Beach for losers" was one joke, and another told on board an aircraft carrier," If you hate being on this ship, imagine being here without the ship" Bob Hope was called a hawk, pro war, extreme right wing, where as he formed a bond with troops in world war 2, understanding that for some his show would be the last some would ever see. He never deserted the troops, even when it seemed the rest of the country had, he knew a majority in uniform were against the war, and made humour from that, but never belittled them. The Christmas bombings in 1972, at the very end of the war were the most destructive, and killed thousands of civilians. Bob Hope gave his last Christmas special from the B52 bases in Thailand and Guam, not because he wanted Hanoi destroyed, but because he understood that supporting those who had no choice in involvement, was the decent thing to do from his perspective. History reveals that the orchestrator of those bombings, Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel peace prize, Jane Fonda became an elder statesperson of Hollywood, and Bob Hope is still considered a pro war hawk by many. Bob hope was a beautiful human being who chose to serve in the way he knew best , comedy. He also toured veteran hospitals, where the limbless, blind and disfigured were confined and explained to the pretty girls on his troupe that tears were not what was required, humour was. Scared kids wanting to appear tough loved him, and he understood this. Every show concluded with the carol silent night, and then the cameras spanned the GIs and marines who were unashamed in wiping tears from their eyes. These concerts are available online for others to form their own opinion, but Bob Hope represents a very rare type of human being, and this individual is very grateful.

Canada geese numbers have increased dramatically since 1988 in Greenland and are probably a more likely cause of the decline of the white front than climate change.

Saw a great light hearted film about a young girl who hatched a load of goose eggs out and when the chicks were born they did this thing which I've heard about before where the first thing they set eyes on becomes their parent figure. The film is a real adventure with a moral thread running through it. A lot of people have probably seen it but I can recommend it for those who haven't. I believe it's called 'All the way home'.

In Norfolk, the great skeins of pink‑footed geese that congregate on the marshes at Holkham are a wonder of the natural world.

I love Geese, so graceful and can fly above Everest apparently, or is that bull?

On my patio here in Spain I have had spring bulbs Daffodil, Jonquil in flower since mid January and there is a nice clutch of Freesias waiting to burst forth. Cyclamen have been in flower, outside, since mid December. Swallows, swifts and martins usually appear on St Patrick's day.
