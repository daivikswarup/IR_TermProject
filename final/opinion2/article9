Disability benefit is broken. Now even Iain Duncan Smith’s advisers say it




DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:36:53+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>fter six years of major reforms, the current disability benefits system is “broken” and must be comprehensively overhauled, according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.smf.co.uk/publications/disability-employment-gap/" title="">a report for the Social Market Foundation thinktank</a> released today.</p>

<p>The proposals are radical. The report recommends scrapping entirely <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/25/disabled-charities-fit-to-work-tests-benefit" title="">the work capability assessment</a> – the now notorious test used by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to determine who is eligible for out-of-work sickness benefits and who should be classed as “fit for work”.</p>

<p>Instead, it states, the government should introduce a properly funded system – making use of trial projects and extensive consultation with benefit claimants – which would identify those disabled people closest to being able to get a job, while those too ill or disabled to work should have a “level of benefit provided … sufficient to allow them to live comfortably and engage fully in society”.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/maximus-miss-fitness-to-work-test-targets-despite-spiralling-costs">Maximus miss fitness-to-work test targets despite spiralling costs</a> </p>

<p>It also says the government should abandon the failing benefit sanction system for people with chronic illness or a disability – instead putting an emphasis on support meetings and financial incentives through a “steps to work wage” on top of their unemployment benefit.</p>

<p>“Many people on disability benefit really do want to work but they feel broken by the system. It is not about providing support; it is about getting them to jump through the same hoops again and again, and they feel defeated,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/11/broken-disability-benefits-need-total-overhaul-says-government-adviser" title="">the report’s author told the Guardian</a>.</p>

<p>But what’s really radical isn’t just what’s being said. It’s who’s saying it. These aren’t the words of a disability campaigner, an anti-cuts activist, or even a Guardian op-ed. The report was written by Matthew Oakley – a former Treasury adviser who until 2013 was head of economics at the right-of-centre <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/" title="">Policy Exchange thinktank</a>. He’s on Iain Duncan Smith’s own social security advisory committee.</p>

<p>The reality is, the Conservatives have overseen what are simply the most disastrous social policy reforms in living memory. What comes out of Duncan Smith’s DWP is not a concrete, evidence-based plan. It is a series of wishes, based on a foundation of ideology-driven myths and childish hysteria.</p>

<p>The government talks – almost laughably – of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/24/iain-duncan-smith-employers-disability-employment-gap" title="">an ambition to get 1 million more disabled and chronically ill people into work by 2020</a> while wasting its time – and taxpayers’ money – on faulty testing regimes that are <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-fitness-for-work-test-is-making-disabled-people-sicker-report-claims-10082452.html" title="">proven to make disabled people sicker</a>, and which as far back as 2010 were <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2010/mar/23/employment-support-allowance-incapacity-benefit" title="">declaring terminally ill people “fit for work”</a>.</p>

<p>The government has brought in “tougher” measures such as increasing the amount of money the DWP can take from disabled and chronically ill people when they have their benefits sanctioned (notably, the DWP <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/24/independent-review-benefit-sanctions-urgently-needed-say-mps" title="">didn’t even bother to test the impact of this</a> before bringing it in).</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Duncan Smith <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.camdennewjournal.com/IDS-sanctions" title="">was filmed</a> declaring that three-quarters of claimants who are sanctioned say it “helps them focus”. I’d tell that to the man with learning difficulties who was sanctioned for being four minutes late at the jobcentre, despite the fact that he couldn’t tell the time. He was found sitting in his flat <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/02/05/tory-mp-mark-spencer-starve-dark_n_6622468.html" title="">in the dark with no electricity, gas or food</a>. Or the 23-year-old pregnant woman who was receiving out-of-work sickness benefits for mental health problems following the stillbirth of her first baby eight months earlier. Her benefit was sanctioned after she missed one “work-focused interview” on a day she found it too difficult to leave her flat – and she ended up having<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/25/benefit-sanctions-regime-should-be-scrapped-independent-review" title=""> to walk two miles to a food bank</a>.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Iain Duncan Smith was filmed declaring that three-quarters of claimants who are sanctioned say it 'helps them focus'</p>

<p>The lie that it’s necessary for disabled people to suffer for their benefits is crumbling. The Oakley report shows that so-called “Conservative values” of personal responsibility and low state spending are not incompatible with a humane and competent disability employment system. What the government has created in its place – rocketing number of disability assessments, outsourced to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/08/maximus-miss-fitness-to-work-test-targets-despite-spiralling-costs" title="">multimillion-pound private contracts</a> mixed with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.scope.org.uk/press-releases/response-work-programme" title="">failing back-to-work programmes</a> – is the definition of economic stupidity.</p>

<p>This week the government forced through <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/tories-force-through-esa-disability-7512289" title="">its plan to cut some sickness benefits by £30 a week</a> – despite evidence this will actually <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/08/cutting-disabled-benefits-wont-work" title="">reduce disabled people’s chance of finding work</a> and that many on the current rate are <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://disabilitybenefitsconsortium.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/almost-70-of-disabled-people-say-cuts-to-esa-will-cause-their-health-to-suffer-and-half-may-return-to-work-later/" title="">already struggling to afford to eat</a> – typifies the current government approach: a disdain for both facts and people’s lives. We have reached the point where even the government’s own advisers can’t pretend this system is anything but rotten. When your own side is turning against you, it might be time to listen.</p>

I take it of course, that this was AFTER her wheelchair assessment to check what she needed and make sure she didn't require extras such as elevating leg rests, pressure relieving cushions, specialised back support, etc?And you did of course consult with her first and ask her what colour she would like?

The truth is too many people are on these benefits for life and many for spurious reasons - it's too easy to beat the system. We need to target the money allocated to this benefit to those who are sick and unable to work and not the sturdy beggars.

There are many decent people in this country that are totally ashamed of the treatment being metered out to our disabLed people and people that are poor and others THAT have MH ISSUES. AS IF COPING WITH DISABILITY IS NOT ENOUGH THIS GOVERNMENT SEEMS CONTENT TO INFLICT EVEN MORE DISTRESS AND ANXIETY ON THESE PEOPLE. It is totally unnaceptable and as a nurse myself I HAVE TO PICK UP THE PIECES OFTEN . WE NEED A CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT.THE PEOPLE THAT INSTALLED THESE ABUSERS SHOULD BE UTTERLY ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES. THIS COUNTRY IS ALL ABOUT greed BEFORE care and compassion.

I agree. This disgusting toad of a man hasn't a clue what life is like for the disabled. I have given up on conventional employment after the discrimination I experienced from my last employer, even before I consider the actual effect of my disability on my ability to work the same as anybody else.

Indeed she does! I had a lot of respect for her work (pre Maximus). And I understand the need to take care of one's family. However, I don't believe for one second (as she claimed) that she would be of more value inside, as opposed to outside of Maximus.

I think that IDS has a problem realising that because of illness some people will never be able to work. He is truly a despicable character.

When will the Tories see that if Britain is broken they are the ones who have broken it with their neo-liberal economics that benefit no-one but the wealthy. In real terms wages have been static or going backwards for decades (yipee say Wonga and their likes). Rather than acknowledge the inhumanity of its policies and the damage they do, the Government has created a new politics of envy where the employed are encouraged to envy the unemployed, the abled to envy the disabled, and those born here to envy immigrants. The narrative then becomes that everybody but the Government and their friends in the City is responsible for broken Britain. I am not ashamed to be British but I am saddened that people like IDS can be allowed any part on the governance of Britain.

You totally miss the point. Of course there are criminals. They need to be caught, policy needs to be a balance of consequence. When the scales on the one side have people not being caught and prosecuted for crimes on the one side and people unable to feed themselves, care for themselves or home themselves dieing on the other side, a just society, a just government must take the side of the weak. The effort needs to go in to catching the criminals. We are not naughty children and the government does not get to say own up or the whole class gets detention.

Beware the IDS of March, or any other day he is around for that matter. The self titled genius has lots of letters after his name spelling lots of nasty words, and doesn't care that things are broken because deprivation makes people desperate enough to fall for the zero hours contract, now outlawed in better educated and more intelligently run countries.

I get that IDS has an agenda towards the disabled and sick, but all these people who go along with it are just as bad. It really, really frustrates me that family members would vote for these b'stards even though they have a learning disabled relative who is unemployable because of his autism and LDs.

No, bollocks to that. The sanctions lottery should be stopped immediately - randomly withdrawing the minimum amount of money which people need to live on is unethical.
