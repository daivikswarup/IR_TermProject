Zoe Saldana in dark-makeup is no way to represent Nina Simone onscreen

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>ast week, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/02/zoe-saldana-nina-simone-black-makeup-film-trailer" title="">the trailer and poster for the forthcoming Nina Simone biopic</a> were released, and we were given our first look at Zoe Saldana playing the legendary musician. Saldana reportedly replaced the singer Mary J Blige after the latter dropped out before shooting began. Indeed, it’s been a controversial decision from the start, with Simone’s daughter describing it as “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/nina-simone-biopic-star-zoe-saldana" title="">not the best choice</a>”.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/02/zoe-saldana-nina-simone-black-makeup-film-trailer">Zoe Saldana faces criticism over dark makeup in Nina Simone film trailer</a> </p>

<p>Debate surrounding the film, Nina – which is based on Simone’s 1992 autobiography – was reignited when the poster was released. It showed the actress with a darker skin tone and a seemingly wider nose than usual. The trailer, in which Saldana again appears in dark makeup, only made for more uncomfortable viewing.</p>

<p>As a lighter-skinned actress of mixed Latino and African heritage, Saldana cannot deny the advantage that her physical appearance gives her over her darker counterparts when going up for parts. India Arie, who played Simone in the TV movie American Dreams, said that Saldana’s appearance in the film made her “sad”. In an open letter, Arie referred to the casting as an example of “black(er) face” – with the actor having to darken up to play Simone.</p>

<p>And why does this matter? Not only is the marginalisation of darker skinned actresses in Hollywood a huge problem, but Simone’s racial identity was a crucial part of her life. She was denied access to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia because of her race, but she was unbowed, using her musical genius to become a prominent voice in the civil rights movement. As Arie says in a recent <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/india-arie-why-zoe-saldana-872960" title="">interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a>: “In the context of the politics of race in America, and the politics of race in the entertainment industry in America, to make a movie about a person like that and cast an actress that has to wear blackface and a prosthetic nose is tone-deaf.” In my opinion, it is an insult to Simone.</p>

<p>Why does Hollywood choose to darken an actor’s skin and create a prosthetic nose rather than casting someone of the desired skin tone and features? The fact that it is even considered as a matter for the costume department is problematic in itself: these are the features and skin tone that some of us are born with.</p>

<p>And no, Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman wearing prosthetics in The Iron Lady or The Hours is not the same thing. They are white women playing white characters. Saldana’s case is different because of what having a wider nose means in a society driven by Eurocentric notions of beauty that consider any deviations as undesirable.</p>

<p>Many have complained that “race shouldn’t be an issue here”, or “all that matters is the acting”. But if race isn’t an issue why not allow Saldana to play Simone exactly as she is? Doesn’t the fact that they have done the opposite suggest otherwise? It suggests they felt the makeup was a requirement to portray her realistically. Saldana’s status as a talented actress cannot mask the fact that in Hollywood darker women remain largely invisible.</p>

<p>We are not living in a time where we are short of black talent. There is an abundance of actors who better resemble Simone – Uzo Aduba, Viola Davis and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://theboombox.com/india-arie-saddened-zoe-saldanas-nina-simone-biopic/" title="">India Arie</a>, for instance. But Hollywood has chosen to overlook them in favour of going to the trouble of painting Saldana’s skin and creating new facial features for her.</p>

<p>Some commentators have even said that those who oppose Saldana’s casting should be satisfied that Simone is being played by a black woman at all. Society is so numb to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hollywoods-race-problem-film-industry-actors-of-colour" title="">the casual whitewashing of the film industry</a> that some believe we should praise them for using a black actor to play a black character.</p>

<p>There is no room for mistakes when it comes to retelling the story of Simone. Her music provided so much of the sound of the civil rights movement. She rose to fame during a time when it was difficult for people who looked like her to be accepted.</p>

<p>Do not be mistaken. This isn’t a matter of light skin v dark skin. Lighter women are often also victims of discrimination. But we cannot pretend that darker women enjoy the same opportunities that lighter-skinned actors do. It is absurd to believe lighter-skinned black women are better at acting. This is colourism at its most obvious.</p>

<p>With the egregiously whitewashed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/13/gods-of-egypt-posters-anger-whitewashed-cast-twitter-exodus" title="">Gods of Egypt</a> having recently been a box-office flop, I can only hope Nina goes the same way. Though its makers may have good intentions, they have continued the Hollywood narrative that darker women of colour just aren’t good enough.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/nina-simone">Nina Simone</a> embodied what it means to be “unapologetically black”. This casting goes against everything she fought for and believed in.</p>

So people have a problem with darker-skinned people, as proven by the funding of a major film about a darker-skinned woman, in which the actress chosen to play her will have her skin darkened deliberately? Okay then.

This is nonsense. The reason she was casted is because of her talents not because of her skin tone. Do your think Salanda would have had it any easier then Simone if she was born in the same era, do you think a mixed cast Latino, African American would have been welcomed into the the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia !? If, what you are proposing, this was a racially motivated casting, do you think the red necks in the southern states are happier that Salanda is 'less' black.. Pure nonsense. What nina fought all her life for wasn't for people to recognise differences in skin tone or the shape of their noses, she fought for exactly the opposite - not to see the difference! Your article is one of the most racist I have read this year !

Race may not be the issue, but a production which can make such a ham-fisted decision is unlikely to get anything else right.

The only fair way to have cast this role was to dig Nina Simone up (I'm sure her cadaver will have been beautifully preserved) and use a combination of animatronics and CGI.

How are they contradictory? The point us that lighter skinned women are given more opportunities in the entertainment industry than darker skinned women, even though both get less compared to white women.

It's called acting because, guess what? It's MAKE BELIEVE! Prosthesis have been a part of an actor's repertoire since the inception of the art-form. Charlize Theron played serial killer Aileen Wurnos. The effectiveness of her portrayal was enhanced by make-up artists. Charles Laughton played Quasimodo, and didn't actually look like this in real life.

Take heart. These people aren't actually going to see the Movie and learn about Ms. Simone. They're just here to push back against any ideas about race sympathetic to the black experience in order to preserve their own personal comfort.

We have been warning of the many hurdles that need to be overcome I this project from the very start. Why would we be doing that? Well we have 1,00's of great untold stories that we would love to see on celluloid, as it were. Nina Simone is just one of them that we have been chomping at the bit to get funding for. so the discussions have been going back and forth for years. It has nothing to do with skin colour, that was just one of a series of mistakes..



Author::::Pat Hard
DateTime::::2016-03-09T11:55:01Z
You prove my point. We love Daniel, and at a certain point in the life of Churchill, sure he could play him. Ms Saldana and Ms Simone were not on par in that respect for sure. The comment about lane is that, Zoe is 'at this moment in her acting career', doing the 'Superhero' thing which suits her 'at present'. Once she has learned the 'craft' to much more 'subtle and sensitive degree', she can take on the character and personas of more complex geniuses, like Nina Simone. It is a growth thing....

She was famous for "being apologetically black" and that damaging her music career commercially. It's kind of how Mohammed Ali is known for being a great boxer who put his principals first. You couldn't create a decent bio of him without acknowledging that.

Why so stupid, it is not a question of enough or not enough 'blackness', it is just how the woman looked....duh!! More to the point, the fact that genius (as she surely was) comes in such a package should be celebrated. Isn't Steven Hawkins celebrated? Well so should a woman who looked likes the typical 'Mamie' archetype, but was a genius and a force-of nature (for the better of man kind) should be also given her due, with The Greats.

Do not act so superior and condescending, this is not a question of 'us or them', as seems to be the common thread in all discussions at present. We all want to see great films and in this case, the 'we' is the negative chatter and sage advice that the 'people in the music business' were giving (or warning) at the very announcement of Ms Saldana as the lead. The hurdles that we knew would need to be overcome, were not. But to the wider point, the Black Community want to get into the Game of Film and believe we have something to bring to the table.....

There are lots of people who are Indian living in the US, and are also into acting. Why not take them in? Ben Kingsley does not look Indian either.

Was Simone famous for "being unapologetically black" or for her musical talent? Somehow standard stagecraft - altering the appearance of actors to fit a character or real person - is somehow verboten? Because Nina Simone? Because skin color charts? Does everyone who plays Nixon not only have to look just like him, but embrace his social and political values as well?
