When I’m 64, I’ll still be singing along

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he Beatles’ When I’m 64 has been pulled up as one of the 72% of pop and rock song lyrics that reportedly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35747166" title="">portray ageing in a negative way</a>. A study by Anglia Ruskin University found that songs about ageing frequently referenced physical frailty, looming death or being unloved, unlovable or an object of pity – all of which, researchers argue, could affect the self-esteem of older people, in turn leading to more serious health problems. Strange: I was under the impression that self-esteem was only invented in around the mid-1980s.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/03/let-everyone-age-as-gracefully-as-downton-lady-crawley">Everyone should be allowed to age as gracefully as Lady Crawley | Sonia Sodha</a> </p>

<p>While I’m aware that music has transformative qualities – it can lift, or indeed lower, your mood in a matter of minutes, I must admit that I thought the war and postwar generations were made of sterner stuff than this. When you’ve stood, aged six, peering down into a smoking crater where your neighbour’s house used to be, or suffered the indignities of a freezing outdoor toilet, are the lyrics to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/leonardcohen/becauseof.html" title="">Because Of by Leonard Cohen</a> really likely to give you a confidence crisis?</p>

<p>When I’m 64 is a lovely song about growing old with another person, and settling into a quieter phase of life involving knitting, gardening and grandchildren. It has its tongue firmly in its cheek, and a rousing chorus that perfectly suits kicking-out time at the local boozer. My grandparents used to sing it together joyously, and they were married for over 50 years.</p>

<p>So often it is said that ageing is a state of mind. I’m not saying growing older is a breeze, but most older people I have met seem to have no trouble keeping a sense of humour. Which is why, when I am old, I hope I’ll be the one leading the Beatles sing-along rather than the one listening to Bob Dylan’s (frankly terrible and utterly humourless) <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bobdylan/foreveryoung.html" title="">Forever Young</a>, which was singled out for praise.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/whenimsixtyfour.html" title="">Yours sincerely, wasting away</a>.</p>

<p>One measure that might make ageing a less painful process is the legalisation of cannabis. The latest recommendations from a panel of experts call for Britain to follow the lead of some US states and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/08/allow-cannabis-over-18s-licensed-shops-lib-dem-panel" title="">allow the sale of cannabis</a> in licensed shops (generating £1bn a year in tax revenue) and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/15/cannabis-marijuana-medicine-law-growing" title="">home cultivation of cannabis</a> for personal use.</p>

<p>My father suffers from multiple sclerosis, the symptoms of which are greatly relieved by cannabis, so this debate is of personal interest to me, as it is to many sufferers of chronic pain. I hope June, an older lady in Cumbria who, being a keen gardener, grows it for three friends (two of whom have arthritis and one of whom has MS) aged 73, 78 and 85, is feeling cheered at the recommendations. A colleague of mine was lucky enough to meet her a couple of years back and declared her an inspiration. I wonder how many other altruistic gardeners there are out there, risking arrest in order to help their friends in need.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>Skiing is a way of spending time that has never appealed to me – which perhaps reveals to you my (lack of) class. I have never been anywhere near a ski slope. I’m reminded of why when looking at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/07/william-and-kate-release-family-skiing-holiday-photos" title="">latest photographs</a> of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding an embarrassing lack of coordination on my part, the wholesomeness of skiing – all rosy cheeks and organised fun led by girls with voluminous, side-parted hair and brisk, posh voices – frightens me a bit. For a life-endangering activity, the upper classes manage to make the whole thing look incredibly twee. But then I would say that, being more of a fag-on-a-sunlounger type than one to engage in a staged snowball fight. They say ignorance is bliss.</p>

On my 64th birthday last year, my husband brought me a cup of tea in bed to the strains of 'When I'm 64' from his iPod, and we sang along in the cheesiest of ways and laughed at ourselves - but at 64 you're no longer worried about embarrassing yourself, especially when you're both still healthy and enjoying life together. Not trying to crow (we've had some dreadful and extremely challenging times) but please realise IT'S JUST A SONG (I believe 'Yesterday' was originally going to be called 'Scrambled Eggs' - that's how serious Lennon and McCartney were). By the way, I also adore Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen for their songs, not necessarily for their great messages.

I'm relistening to 'When I'm Sixty-Four' as I type, and the only negative bit I can think of is when Paul sings 'You'll be older too', implying 'you won't be a looker then either love, but it's OK because we'll have each other'.

No, was not just about how she doesn´t like skiing. It was that she has never tried it but here are some lazy stereotypes about the people who do like it. I was challenging that (the whole point of CIF), not taking offence.

Has Anglia Ruskin University nothing important to research into? Nice article, Rhiannon, but it's only in Britain that skiing is associated with class: in countries with plenty of snow and slopes it's very demotic, but I gave it up after ten minutes. Like you, I prefer the sunlounger, but without the fag: I gave them up after a lot longer than ten minutes.

No problem -- given that sarcasm has everything to do with intent, I stuck with simple irony: the use of words to express something different from and often opposite to their literal meaning.

For the record, although John came up with the basic structure and the lifted Leary lyric, TKN was a group effort and Paul (as well as the just-late George Martin) contributed greatly to putting together the sound that makes it so distinctive and innovative.From the relevant Wikipedia page:The track included the highly compressed drums that the Beatles currently favoured, with reverse cymbals, reverse guitar, processed vocals, looped tape effects, a sitar and a tambura drone. The use of these ¼-inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from McCartney's admiration for Stockhausen's Gesang der Jünglinge. By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concrète. The tape could also be induced to go faster and slower. McCartney encouraged the other Beatles to use the same effects and create their own loops. After experimentation on their own, the various Beatles supplied a total of "30 or so" tape loops to Martin, who selected 16 for use on the song. Each loop was about six seconds long.So even if as egocentric as you allege, he could well listen to it with narcissistic but justified pride.

I've been on a ski slope. In summer.Hiking in the mountains in nice weather is far more to my taste than balancing on a plank (or two) while falling down a precipitous slope. And I've never had to be airlifted to hospital with a life threatening injury (or been bankrupted by foreign medical bills for treatment of an injury that's merely crippling).

Nonsense. No way you can ski for a week "all inclusive", including passes, hiring etc and all your entertainment for 300 quid. Think 700-900 quid.

Of course you should be singing at such a young age, but what will you be singing about? Will it be creeping losses associate with old age, financial and physical impairment? Will it be a song about accommodating offspring into their nth partnership with a variety of estranged grandchildren to match? Will it be the prospect of entering an old folks home and the concomitant loss of independence? There’s a lot to sing about when you think about it, and it might not be all wine and roses, but at least you will be singing and if you win the pools then you can pay someone else to sing it for you. Now, what was that tune … ?

I'm sixty-five and the Beatles became popular when I was about 14 years old, and all these years when I heard this song, I always thought it said "you're sincerely wasting away". Of course I always heard "we are all ducks in the wind" instead of "dust in the wind".

Fifteen years ago I turned 64. To celebrate the occasion I rewrote McCartney's verse. Here's an excerpt :

And that's all you need to know about the entire affair. How stupid this reflexive criticism is. 64 is a charming and wistful song about young men dreaming of being old. Anyone criticised "Things we said today" yet?

McCartney wrote it when he was young before the Beatles. It's a theme that he returned to several times. It isn't difficult to notice that McCartney was one of the foremost composers of our time and that his work always explores the same few themes. In a later song he sings "Here we sit, two lonely old people". The song Your Mother Should Know falls obliquely into this category as does Uncle Albert and even Backseat of My Car. It's explorations of how love grows and changes with age and often they are paeons to old age, McCartney seemed to have great respect for his elders, one of the most interesting driving forces on the Beatles' music. A lesser theme is technology because they lived through the time when telephones and TVs gradually reached the working classes. So you can find several songs based around calling someone on the phone and even Lennon wrote songs about how you would have to go and knock on a girl's door rather than calling. McCartney plays with the idea on the song Give Me a Ring.

Probably because it's not about ageing at all--it's about a very young man contemplating a lifelong and happy relationship (and ending up neither unloved, unlovable nor an object of pity).

The strap line on this article is bizarre - so, this Song portrays aging in a negative way !? How ? The musical Genius that is Paul McCartney wrote this at 14 - looking forward to how he might Look Back at his life in 50 years. Needless to say, for such a terrible song ( as some CIFers claim) nearly 50 years after its release, people are still singing it.
