Is that a troll under the bridge? No, it’s George Galloway




DateTime::::2016-03-09T18:37:45+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>ast weekend I found myself walking along the South Bank near Waterloo when I came across a man pacing up and down in a hat and overcoat, grumbling about the EU. The voice, lightly amplified, was indisputably familiar, but it wasn’t attracting much in the way of attention. I drew closer, not too close – not, you know, eye-contact close – and my suspicions were confirmed: it was <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgegalloway">George Galloway</a>, ranting like a troll under a bridge.</p>

<p>To be fair, the weather had been poor, although it was finally beginning to clear. Had the rain continued, Galloway might have at least expected to attract people interested in sharing the shelter of his bridge. It seemed odd – whatever you think of George Galloway, he’s totally famous – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/14/channel4.broadcasting" title="">he was on Celebrity Big Brother</a>! If <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-only-way-is-essex" title="">Joey Essex</a> was standing under Waterloo Bridge talking rubbish, people would stop.</p>

<p>Perhaps the London mayoral candidate went on to discuss more polarising issues (he’s campaigning to kick Uber drivers out of London) after I left, but his <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/14/left-reject-eu-greece-eurosceptic" title="">Lexit</a> routine wasn’t doing much to pique the interest of passersby. “The 28 countries of the European Union are a fading bloc,” he said. “They are not where it’s at. They are not rising; they are falling. The Euro project, always doomed in my opinion, has turned into a disaster waiting to happen.” If anything, it seemed like a speech aimed at keeping pedestrians moving.</p>

<p>Galloway was strongly in favour of remaining in the EU not all that long ago. It was the Greek financial crisis, he says, that changed his mind. Their democracy, in his eyes, has been subverted by the deal they’ve struck with the EU. Maybe, but that’s an argument for Greece leaving the EU, not Britain. The general drift of Galloway’s speech that day – that the whole European project is on the verge of collapse anyway, so we might as well get out – felt like someone rewarding me for my complacency. In that case, who cares? In, out, whatever.</p>

<p>I stayed until I was handed the same leaflet a second time – the implication being that anyone standing in my spot three minutes after I’d arrived was, by definition, someone else. In a weird way, I felt as if I was being moved on. Nothing to see here, sir. Don’t make us give you a third one.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/mother-told-leave-john-lewis-store-toddler-tantrum">John Lewis apologises to mother told to leave over toddler's tantrum</a> </p>

<p>The news that a mother trying to control a toddler in mid-tantrum <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/mother-told-leave-john-lewis-store-toddler-tantrum" title="">was asked to leave a Manchester branch of John Lewis</a> – allegedly after a complaint – brought back a lot of sweat-inducing memories of my own children in meltdown.</p>

<p>I recall a particular trip to Sainsbury’s with the middle one – he was probably 16 months old – when I rashly took exception to his attempt to shred a full box of cereal. The resulting tantrum lasted for 10 excruciating minutes, and in the middle of it I made the mistake of removing the child from the shopping trolley seat to calm him down. Never do this – once a cross toddler is out of the trolley, he’s not going back in. It’s like trying to push a spider into a test tube. I had to carry him round the whole supermarket while he shouted, “Stupid, stupid breakfast!” in my ear.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the tantrum I found so embarrassing – just the very public display of my own incompetence. If someone had asked me to leave at that point, I probably would have thanked them for their permission. All I’d need was a signed note for my wife, explaining why I’d come home empty-handed.</p>

<p><strong>Noises off </strong>The one positive thing to come out of all those tantrums past is a complete immunity to noisy infants. As long as it’s not my child crying, it sounds like music to me, even on aeroplanes. I don’t care how badly behaved your kid is, or how incompetent you are, or whether this is the quiet coach. Come on in. I’m just so grateful that your problem is not my problem.</p>

Had you carried on walking, you may have met up with a man walking around with his trousers around his ankles, a brown nose, and muttering about how wonderful it is to be PM of the UK and still being ruled from Brussels.

I remember a protest after the gassing of Kurds at Halabdja in 1988 . Went along with some of my friends who were anti Baathist Iraqi exiles . The incident had little coverage in the media , and the protest rally almost none . And the guest speaker leading the condemnation ? One George Galloway .

George Galloway is a traitor to the UK. I won't ever forgive him over his visit to Iraq and cuddling up to Saddam Hussien. In the meantime we should be taking in refugees. How would YOU feel if you were bombed in a war and had to flee? What if you fled to say France, Ireland or USA. And got turned down? It works both ways. We are dealing with fellow human beings. Not cattle. Have we not learnt anything from the Holocaust?

Mr Dowling writes, "the Greek financial crisis, he says, that changed his mind. Their democracy, in his eyes, has been subverted by the deal they’ve struck with the EU. Maybe, but that’s an argument for Greece leaving the EU, not Britain." No, the EU's treatment of Greece reveals the real EU - bullying, anti-democratic, committed to serving the cause of the bankers. Unemployment in Greece is 25 per cent. Among young people it is nearly 50 per cent. 200,000 people have emigrated since 2010. Investment and consumption slumped. GDP per head has fallen from 20,000 euros in 2010 to 16,000 in 2014. It owes more now than before the bail-out. As with the previous two loan agreements, more than 90 per cent of the new loan (€86 billion) benefits the Greek banks and the country’s creditors. If Greek workers ever thought that the EU guaranteed their rights, they don’t now.

Many saw the lie in the Bush-Blair WMD. George Galloway in addition foresaw the misery that will result in waging wars to effect regime changes. . He did not mince words in opposing the war. George might have had short comings but is more honest than most politicians.

There is no such thing as a media article about George Galloway that isn’t packed with sneering hatred, I guess it’s hardly surprising since the man embarrassed and continues to embarrass the media over the Iraq invasion and all the other BS war propaganda they spread, I mean, nobody likes a smart ass.

Plus, modesty aside, mine was the funnier analogy. By far.



Author::::LibbyElk
DateTime::::2016-03-10T07:34:42Z
Interesting to note that calling someone a 'troll' in an article is quite acceptable, but taking the analogy to its logical conclusion in the comments - even while staying completely faithful to Aesop - to imagine how the author managed to escape said 'troll' is not.

He's wears a hat not just because he is bald but because he is a bloated egotist of the highest proportions. He dreams about himself.

Tantrums weren't allowed when I was growing up. Never saw hide nor hair of one. Same in my house when the kids were small, just not allowed.Saw a couple in Tesco a few times. Barmy mother, gormless father . . .Mother (brandishing chocolate bar towards 5 year old): Jason? Jason? Would you like this? We can put it in the trolley and take it home for you.Jason: Yes please.Mother (switching chocolate for biscuits): Or we could buy these instead. Would you like these:Jason: Yes Please.Mother: (switching biscuits for crisps): Or we could buy these instead.This went on for a while until the child was frothing. She was still at it when the poor kid went into complete meltdown and the parents entered into ignore it until it goes away stage. All this time the father stood listening to the tweety birds in his head.Next time I saw them Jason was already incandescent. Gormless dad placed a tin of soup in the trolley. Jason, sitting in said vehicle, screamed, "I don't want that."Dad, his voice like a confessional priest, replied, "But it's not for you, Jason, It's for Daddy.""Get it out of the trolley. Now!""But Jason, it's for Daddy's lunch.""GET IT OUT!""But . . . "Jason picked out offending soup can and brained daddy with it, hopefully knocking some sense into him.
