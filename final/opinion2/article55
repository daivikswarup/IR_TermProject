Why I gave up my job to go travelling after a double mastectomy




DateTime::::2016-03-11T17:23:49+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>s I sat in the bath last summer I decided to inspect my breasts. I lost my mum and sister to breast cancer, and I carry the faulty <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/24/women-angelina-jolie-choice-surgery-ovarian-cancer" title="">BRCA1 gene</a> – which increases your chances of developing the disease (I had an 85% chance) – but despite all this it had never really worried me. On that day, however, everything changed: I felt lumps. I panicked: were they just glands, or was I riddled with cancer? I knew it was possible. I didn’t want to leave anything to chance, so I made the decision there and then to have a preventive <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/12/double-mastectomy-benefit-real-study" title="">double mastectomy</a>. The next day I was at the doctor’s making an appointment. The process went quickly, and before I knew it I had a date for the operation.</p>

<p>Around the same time, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/29/2013-eyewitness-accounts-angelina-jolie-breast-cancer" title="">Angelina Jolie</a> made the news for her own double mastectomy, and while I was glad she’d done that, I wasn’t a successful movie star with a celebrity husband and family to boot. I was single, with no children and at the start of my career. No one in my position had spoken out about going through the operation, so I decided I would. I wanted to help other women discuss their own situations candidly. I felt extremely grateful and positive about the whole thing – my mum and sister couldn’t change their outcomes, but I could.</p>

<p>After my surgery in January 2015, I tried to return to normal life. Prior to the operation I had been obsessed with being a successful entertainment presenter. I lived, ate and breathed my work. I pushed and pushed to break down doors and get myself out there, and it had worked: I had a job presenting for BT Sport and was doing regular slots on BBC Radio 1Xtra. But when I returned to work after my operation I felt different. I stopped pushing – something didn’t feel right. I had to sit and ask myself whether getting to the top of my career would make me truly happy. Would I feel content and at peace if I did? The answer was no.</p>

<p>Travelling had never really appealed to me, but suddenly it was all I could think about. This idea of giving up everything to see the world would not leave me. My friends questioned why I would want to leave everything I had worked so hard for. A couple of times I’d listen and push the desire to the back of my mind, but it always came back. I indulged the idea, and tried to think up TV and online video pitches that would support my new-found need to travel. I came up with several ideas and even spoke to production companies. The one thing I thought had the most chance of getting sponsored was “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q68rqIEEXC0" title="">My life in your hands</a>”, where people could suggest dares for me to attempt. I created a PowerPoint presentation and tried to find backing, and set my date to leave as 31 December 2015. No one was biting and I was giving up hope; which was when my dad and my stepmum offered to help me fund my trip. I sold a lot of my stuff on eBay and at car boot sales, and suddenly my crazy idea seemed just about possible. In November I booked my tickets.</p>

<p>Scary does not fully sum it up. I was questioning my sanity. I wondered what had happened to the career-driven woman I had once been. Why did I want to do something that frightened me so much? Why was this the only thing that made sense? I was confused and worried. Eventually I decided to just embrace my decision – and the moment I did I felt an overwhelming sense of freedom. I was really doing this.</p>

<p>I’ve now been away for two and a half months. Sometimes it’s tough, but these are the times I learn the most about myself. There is nowhere to run or hide from my own thoughts, beliefs and feelings, which means I’m working on myself a bit at a time – and that is exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>I have realised that peace, happiness and contentment aren’t things you attain when you get the right job, meet the right person or live in the dream house. They are internal shifts in what you believe and how you think. They are obtained not by getting or buying lots of things, but by turning your attention inwards and seeing what’s there. Asking yourself what should be there and what shouldn’t. It’s about taking a look at what we believe and how we think about ourselves, our world and other people. From my travels, I’ve realised that ultimately it is this that determines how we see the world we live in.</p>

I'm 59, we are cashing in the bulk of my husbands underperforming super (then we'll be equal!), whacking it on the mortgage, which will save us $12k per year. I'll work in short hard blocks as a casual in between traveling as much as we can for the next 10 years. We will sit on the couch and collect the pension or whatever later. Who cares, it will all work out!

In reality you can travel a long time with very little money picking up casual work if needs be.

Exactly. Really enjoyed reading your comments on the matter! I'm hopefully just at the beginning of my travels - saved enough money that if I went home and began working hard I could get a deposit down in a couple of years on a nice place. But would that make me happy? I'm thinking not.

And you didn't tell her: "This little house, which is more than enough for me to live in, AND a lifetime of experiences and memories that no one can steal. What have YOU got?" ?I don't blame you; such people are not worth wasting one's breath on them.

I spent most of my life travelling, till settling in my late forties to get married, never saved, invested or bought a house, but inherited a modest one, gotin a conversation with the usual social climber, she said ' why did you never buy a house?'Well I spent 30 years travelling the world and partying tbh.'And now all you have is this little house' she replied.Each to their own I guess.

Lovely story. whilst I agree that if you are young, the restrictions to travelling are actually largely imaginary and easily overcome: virtually anyone can do it to some degree. The real tragedy is that most women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are in their 50's and 60's, and have a whole swather of commitments and other health issues that make the whole idea of dropping everything and travelling impossible.

You might if you were stuck in a crap share house with a shitty job for corporate scumbags whose irregular hours just about covered rent and basics. Hard(er) work might be all that gives you the scope to travel.

It is a response to your comment that "having a British passport does not indicate privilege". I have explained to you in detail why it is actually a huge privilege.

A UK citizen can just buy a ticket and go. If I want to travel with my Russian passport, in most cases I need to: a) buy a ticket and book hotels well in advance, risking to lose the money if I do not get the visa, but if I do not book, there is little chance to succeed with the application, b) apply for a visa (it usually takes 1-2 full days just to prepare the paperwork, especially for a country like the UK), c) apply and pay the fee (usually $100-200), wait for indeterminate amount of time to hear from the consulate, d) travel to the capital of the country where I reside to pick up the visa in person (special fun for, say, Russians living in Vladivostok who have to travel to Moscow first to apply and then second time to pick up their visa). Imagine doing this EVERY time you need to go pretty much anywhere in the civilized world.

In the context of this discussion, having a British passport does not indicate privilege or being elevated in a specific society. Also, I don't think that travelling is cheap, nor do I think that it is easy.

If most people had a double mastectomy they'd have to go back to work as soon as they'd recovered, but well done for having the money to do so I guess.

Traveling is cheap and easy only if you have a good passport. If you have a UK citizenship, you ARE born with a silver spoon.

For some reason men tend to over estimate the importance of breasts to women. It is sure a very sad experience to lose a part of your body, but breasts are about the most uninteresting and useless part of a woman't body!

.....after 6 months travelling through South America my thoughts were along the lines - this beats working - but only just! Lots of happy times / insane experiences but challenging ones too and at the end of it looking over my shoulder with astonishment - 'did I really do all that?' Hardest part is coming back and readjusting but I'm sure Claira will not regret a single day of it especially Brazil which is going through hard times at the moment but away from the tourist centres it is still a vast beautiful & wild country.

As a man, and knowing how important breasts are to women especially in this sexually charged world, their desirability, image, the idea of motherhood, their womanliness, let alone their health, I'm absolutely in awe of your decision.

Really depends on what you're doing. Go trekking in Patagonia for 6 months. There really is nothing (at all) to spend your money on.

I don't have the faulty cancer gene and have never faced chopping off essential icons of my very womanhood. But if I did, I think it might have me examining what else was important and what was not worth striving for in extenfing my years. Why did I chop off my breasts? So i could work harder and longer before I die, or really live and experience an exhilarating life instead of dealing with cancer. Good on her.

Some of the comments here are shocking. My experience went the other way round. It's 13yrs since MrsLondon and I chucked our jobs to go travelling - 15 months on the road, on very little money (a lot of trekking and camping). I wouldn't swap it for anything. Did we "find ourselves"? No, but we had a lot of fun and learnt a lot.
