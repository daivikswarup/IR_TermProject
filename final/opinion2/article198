As Dirty Grandpa shows, sex doesn’t stop at 70




DateTime::::2016-01-27T06:00:14+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here is a scene in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1860213/reference">Dirty Grandpa</a> – a road-trip comedy out this week – in which 73-year-old Robert De Niro goes to bed with a student. She doesn’t mind his age. In fact, she finds it a turn-on. “Act like you’ve lost your glasses and you can’t see properly,” she asks. Then she requests he complain about how the buttons on the TV remote are too small. Then: “Tell me how things were better under Eisenhower.” (It’s this last one that really does the erotic business.)</p>

<p>Dirty Grandpa is one of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dirty_grandpa/">most appallingly poorly reviewed movies</a> in recent memory. It is, without question, desperately offensive (sample scene: Zac Efron Skypes a rabbi not realising a swastika of penises is drawn on his forehead). It’s being seen as the nadir of De Niro’s already botched stock, the nail in the coffin of a once shining career.</p>

<p>Yet that’s rather unfair: for once, De Niro really gives it some welly. His usual resignation is gone, replaced by a hot-blooded urge to shock.</p>

<p>Yes, only one joke in 10 works, but there are a lot of them. Plus, Dirty Grandpa tackles a taboo few will go near: sexual desire in pensioners.</p>

<p>De Niro’s character was happily married for many years, but hadn’t had sex for 15, and was a carer for much of that time. Such time has left him itchy for new experience, and – with his late wife’s blessing – he’s keen to share it with young women (he phrases this in a slightly more forthright manner). His former army pal (Danny Glover) might be dying but he too remains lusty, cross-stitching porn from his wheelchair. By the end of the film Efron, initially repulsed by the idea, comes to appreciate the validity of his grandfather’s fancying more than a toffee.</p>

<p>That our younger years, and even our middle age, are so sexualised, yet such feelings are to be dismissed after 70, is a dangerous hypocrisy. Care homes are not equipped to cope. They cater for tea and incontinence. As more and more of us head into them, such thinking will need revising. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/09/fan-2">As Betjeman demonstrated</a>, even on the deathbed thoughts can turn blue.</p>

<p>I live on a big Victorian estate in north London called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/area-guides/greater-london/harringay-ladder-is-urban-diverse-and-still-great-value-31089.html">the Harringay Ladder</a>: 20 terrace streets bookended by two main roads. It’s distinctive enough to be visible if not from space then certainly from a plane circling low.</p>

<p>It’s easy to negotiate. There’s even a long, thin passage that runs all the way through the middle – a masterstroke, you think, until you learn it’s there because they weren’t allowed to build on top of the sewer. But what I really love about London is its curves and dead ends, its abrupt corners and sudden holes. The recently revealed grid-layout <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/25/how-london-might-have-looked-five-masterplans-after-great-fire-1666">designs for the city after the Great Fire</a> are a cautionary look at what might have been: strait-laced, ever so American. Yet not only does non-organic town planning feel soulless, it encourages a denial to a place and its history of previous imprints.</p>

<p>I have a theory that the longer somewhere is seen as having been inhabited, the less importance its current residents attach to their own lives. Thank goodness <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> has remained – mostly – so messy.</p>

<p>Looking smart has always defeated me. Even with effort, I still look like an explosion in a charity shop. Until now, that is. For I have bought a firm-brimmed hat. Berets were a lost cause, requiring dexterity and calm weather; beanies made comparisons to Benny on Crossroads irresistible. Yet a dark-blue, vaguely felt number with a bit of a band has instantly tarted me up. Such hats aren’t handy only for those worried about thinning; they are also a godsend for anyone with too much hair, thick and thatchy, never tamed and best contained. You’re welcome.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> This article was amended on 27 January 2 016. An earlier version referred to a cautionary look at what might have been a straightlaced, rather than strait-laced, grid-layout city. <br/></p>

But these days to see any woman over 70 in a Hollywood movie, let alone in a starring role AND seducing a young male heartthrob, is such a rarity that I doubt any financier would go near it.

Is the lack of recent comments on this thread an indication that the 70-somethings have been inspired by the film to indulge in naughty sexual activities?

My Father has been in hospital recently at the same time as my Mother is recovering from a broken arm (nasty one, right up by the shoulder) so my sister & I have been spending as much time as we are able making life a little easier for her. My sister sent me a text to the effect "Mom has been moaning that she had only just recovered enough to start shagging again & Dad takes himself off to hospital. There are some things you can't un-hear & I am forced to share this with you because I don't believe the joy of this knowledge should be mine & mine alone." I'm all in favour of however old you are you should have as much or as little sex as your mind & body can stand - but when it's your own parents, no ...... just, no. My libido is currently lying bleeding in the gutter.

No professing about it. Most older men prefer much younger women but just can't get them. Many older women too, if honest, would prefer younger men. Older bodies are not at all pretty.

An 87 year old friend of mine was confronted yesterday by a mutual friend who suggested sexual intercourse was over rated. The 87 year old did not agree, saying "It' the best fun you can have without laughing".

Sorry you need to go overseas to find someone willing to have sex with you. I'd say you're the problem, not the women rejecting you.

Those of us who lead active sex lives in SE Asia are despised by women, especially young women. It was fine when people like me supported women in their fight for equality and sexual freedom but now because we are old we are supposed to deny our own sexuality. It's bollocks girls.Now where's that passport...

Recently watched the movie Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict.Not her only 'addiction' if one is going to stick to that pejorative. At one point a taped interview recounts how a renowned artist aged 70 kisses her and she notices he is physically aroused. Some chortling among the young female members of the audience as what is presumably thought of as an absurdity-on his part. Hope they don't work in aged health care. And more generally hope more kids spare their aging parents such incarceration.

So Dirty Grandpa shows an old white man still getting his end away with young ladies. This isn't seen as very shocking in our society. Would this movie have ever been made showing the reverse, say Goldie Hawn enjoying herself with young men? I strongly suspect not. Also from what I understand there is also an old black man featured, but he is safely confined to a wheelchair and is dying, so while he might still feel lustful, he doesn't get to put it into action. Sounds great, what a truly groundbreaking film...
