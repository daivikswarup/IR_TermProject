There’s no such thing as imperialism-lite, Obama. Libya has shown that once again

Britain thinks that a bit rich, given the shambles America left in Iraq. Then both sides say sorry. They did not mean to be rude.</p>

<p>Thus do we wander across the ethical wasteland of the west’s wars of intervention. We blame and we name-call. We turn deaf ears to the cries of those whose lives we have destroyed. Then we kiss and make up – to each other.</p>

<p>Obama was right first time round about Libya’s civil war. He wanted to keep out. As <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/" title="">he recalls to the Atlantic magazine</a>, Libya was “not so at the core of US interests that it makes sense for us to unilaterally strike against the Gaddafi regime”. He cooperated with Britain and France, but on the assumption that David Cameron would clear up the resulting mess. That did not happen because Cameron had won his Falklands war and could go home crowing.</p>

<p>Obama is here describing all the recent “wars of choice”.</p>

<p>America had no “core interest” in Afghanistan or Iraq, any more than Britain had in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/libya">Libya</a>. When a state attacks another state and destroys its law and order, morally it owns the mess. There is no such thing as imperialism-lite. Remove one fount of authority and you must replace and sustain another, as Europe has done at vast expense in Bosnia and Kosovo.</p>

<p>America and Britain both attacked countries in the Middle East largely to satisfy the machismo and domestic standing of two men, George Bush and Tony Blair. The result has been mass killing, destruction and migration on a scale not seen, at least outside Africa, since the second world war. In this despicable saga, Cameron’s Libyan venture was a sideshow, though one that has destabilised north <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a> and may yet turn it into another Islamic State caliphate. It is his Iraq.</p>

<p>As for Obama’s charge that Britain and other countries are not pulling their weight and are “free riders” on American defence spending, that too deserves short shrift. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures" title="">British and French military expenditure is proportionately among the highest</a> in the world, mostly blown on archaic weapons and archaic forms of war. Western warmongering over the past two decades has had nothing to do with the existential defence of territory. “Defence” has become attack, keeping alive the military-industrial lobbies and lumbering military establishments that depend on it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bonds between America and Britain will continue to strengthen. They do so, against all the odds, because they grow from one culture and one outlook on life. That mercifully has nothing to do with politicians.</p>

He may not get everything right, but you have to acknowledge that Obama's basic instinct to keep out of wars, despite being constantly urged to intervene by other political leaders and commentators from the left and the right, is a good one.

Gadaffy had since long planned to free his country and other African states from the yoke of being forced to trade within the American dollar sphere. He was about to lance his thoroughy well prepared alternative welcomed not the least by the Chinese when Libya was attacked. Obama is not truthful when suggesting the attack was not a "core" interest to the US. It was of supreme interest for the US to appear with its allies, Gadaffy´s independence of mind being no small challenge.

Gadafy may have been particularly nasty with dissidents, but the UK has plenty of allies in the Muslim world that are far worse: Saudi Arabia, Bahrain... The Gulf States work their imported slaves to death and the UK kowtows to them. The UK has supplied billions of pounds worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia and sent military advisors to advise them how to use them to bomb Yemeni schools and hospitals.

Did the attack on Afghanistan improve the situation? Perhaps temporarily in the cities, some things got a little better as long as you weren't shot or blown up. Over the country as a whole, it made the situation much worse.

Col Muammar Gaddafi was an anti Imperialist and provided the wherewithal to the oppressed & occupied Irish to force Colonial Britain to reluctantly concede Civil Rights - One Man One Vote in the mid 1970s - 10 or more long years after the blackman in the USA was accorded those same rights.

Well if "balkans" interventions (bosnia and kosovo) are a success, then the bar is pretty damn low. Both of those are non functional states in a limbo kept alive by a combination of foreign stick and carrot. Also both almost ripe for picking by Daesh as the new frontline in Europe.

Wars "to satisfy the machismo and domestic standing of two men, George Bush and Tony Blair," indeed. With the interview in the Atlantic, Obama has now begun to repaint his legacy before he retires from the presidency-- but he bombs and promotes war in more countries than George Bush could find on the map.

Monrover - Benghazi is the problem now too. Qaddafi held the country together. Now there is chaos. Qaddafi wanted to get rid of the petro dollar. That's why he had to go. He wanted to improve Africa's lot. Another reason to get rid of him. There is no excuse. The information is out there.

There's no plain truth in the above. It comes from the school of pre-WWII English history when Winston Churchill warned of catastrophes yet only had four members of Parliament in support (out of more than 600 members); and when Chamberlain was considered the voice of reason.

Bosnia - a slow ticking bomb. Just bubbling under the surface. Kosovo - a mafia state run by drug lord Thaci, supported by the US. It is no secret that the main source of income in Kosovo today is drugs, prostitution, organ trafficking. Tear gas in Parliament for the third time in as many months. While the squares full of unemployed young and old are adorned with statues of those that gave them this opportunity Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were popular but I think their halos are tarnished somewhat. The situation is so serious that the US is beefing up its presence in camp Bondsteel but you won't read about it in the Guardian.
