Justin Welby’s immigration words may gain him unwanted friends

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">J</span></span>ustin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, says it would be “absolutely outrageous” to dismiss everyone who is frightened by the migration crisis as racist. For this the Sun, the Daily Mail <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/651572/Archbishop-of-Canterbury-British-citizens-migrants-refugees" title="">and the Express</a> all put him on the front page.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/11/downing-street-backs-archbishop-over-immigration-comments">Downing Street backs archbishop over immigration comments</a> </p>

<p>These words in themselves should not be shocking: only a minority would claim anyone who questions the immigration numbers is a bigot. But the atmosphere around this issue is so charged that some people will read his words as saying that no one who is opposed to migration is a racist.</p>

<p>That’s not what he said and not even what he meant to say. His view, in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.politicshome.com/home-affairs-foreign-and-defence/articles/house/justin-welby-eu-debate-not-all-about-us-its-about" title="">the House magazine interview that generated the stories</a>, was that the crisis puts real strain on poorer communities, which everyone should recognise, and that the correct response is for central government to offer more support to the affected communities, not to keep all the asylum seekers out.</p>

<p>We could, he says, take many more refugees than we are doing. “Fear is a valid emotion at a time of such colossal crisis,” he stated, but he went on to say that we are seeing “the greatest movement of people, arguably even including the end of the second world war … And to be anxious about that is very reasonable.”</p>

<p>So far so good for the tabloids’ interpretation. But he went on immediately to say “but we’ve demonstrated this enormous capacity to deal with things, and we do it brilliantly at the micro, and with help from the macro the micro can be much more absorbent and much more capable than we sometimes given them credit for.”</p>

<p>This is not well expressed. The macro and the micro are not terms tossed about by Sun readers. But what he meant was absolutely clear: this country should take more refugees, and it could if it tried. This has long been the church’s line. All Welby added to it was a recognition that there were perfectly good reasons to disagree with him, or to be frightened by the problem. In effect, he was giving it the good old JC Flannel shuffle as archbishops are expected to do – on the one hand, on the other hand – but such is his decisive manner and force of character that he appeared to be making a much simpler point.</p>

<p>For readers of the rightwing press, the news that the archbishop of Canterbury thinks they are right to worry about immigration is important. That he thinks their fears should be overcome is quite irrelevant. That opinion would be dismissed as an archbishop “meddling in politics”. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2013/20-september/comment/opinion/a-gap-is-growing-within-th" title="">Research by Linda Woodhead of Lancaster University</a> has shown that the great majority of people who identify as Anglicans in this country very seldom go to church and would never dream of taking moral guidance from an archbishop.</p>

<p>But they are also politically to the right of the mainstream church leaderships and they will be pleased to suppose that he agrees with them, even when he doesn’t. On the other hand, in church political terms, those who are most conservative about sexual morality are also among the keenest supporters of opening the UK’s borders to Christians who have been forced from their homes by <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis">Islamic State</a>. And it is in fact what the archbishop had to say about relationships with Islam that seems to me to contain the real political dynamite.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/25/uk-immigration-data-eu-referendum-ons-britain">Latest UK immigration data set to add fuel to EU referendum debate</a> </p>

<p>Towards the end of the interview Welby demanded that the government put pressure on Saudi Arabia to stop exporting the ideology of violent jihadism: “Mainstream religious leaders – which within many parts of the Islamic world includes governments – must be very, very clear about taking responsibility for the violence within their own traditions. That will mean places like Saudi Arabia tackling extremist thinking within their own tradition. Much support [for Islamists] has come from within those countries, and they need to be challenged on that. They need to stamp out the support for the extremist views from within their own societies. That’s really important.”</p>

<p>While he was very careful not to suggest that this country was involved in a holy war, he was clear that some of our enemies are. “For the first time in centuries in this country … we find ourselves involved in conflict which has very, very significant theological aspects … You’re seeing it in Libya, in Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, right across the Levant and Mesopotamia.” Although he also mentioned <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jan/16/central-african-republic-seeds-genocide-un" title="">Christian violence in the Central African Republic</a>, there’s no doubt who was the main target of his fears. It is extraordinary language, more like John Buchan’s Richard Hannay than anything archiepiscopal.</p>

<p>The archbishop is a clever man, quick-thinking and easily bored, who can be wonderfully indiscreet in conversation. It’s very likely he said these things because they struck him as interesting and important, rather than for the impact he imagined they’d have.</p>

<p>But an archbishop of Canterbury is a public figure. He has put himself at the centre of a great debate. But being there brings perils he may not have foreseen. It creates enemies he may not wish to have and friends whose company he would prefer not to keep.</p>

So basically the ABC should keep his mouth shut as if he is anything but a hearty supporter of unlimited immigration his words will be fastened onto with joy by the sinister dark forces of the right wing?

I am sure that there would have been young lads around in Nazareth in the first decade of the first century AD who knew the young Jesus as a childhood acquaintance and that at least a few of them would have later on found it difficult to take him seriously as an authority on God.

First of all, get some perspective. In 2015 there were about 32,000 applications from refugees to the UK. Applications, not refugees.

Same with the schools. Can't get teachers to stay in harness because of the micromanagement by Social-engineering political dictats from on high. They stress out and leave, and the schools can't pay them enough to take the stress. ( Disclaimer : Retired teacher here. )And housing? Young people living through mid-30's because of affordable housing shortage, and lack of paying jobs to save for down' payment. . Homelessness at an all time high. If we built on all the agricultural land in the UK, we could still not house everyone; but still we endure pressure to invite in still more immigrants who can't speak the language and must compete with natives here for insufficient number of jobs.  Good sense should inform good works or they stupidly backfire.

 the news that the archbishop of Canterbury thinks they are right to worry about immigration is importantYes it is because this newspaper has daily dismissed all of us who think the same. Secondly, I object to the assumption that all who think this way belong to the right. As I have commented many times before on these pages this constant dismissal of readers concerns and fears about border controls are driving many into the more radical camp. This is more so when writers like yourself Mr Brown suggest that the Archbishop was wrong for mentioning this.

Thomas Aquinas, Roman Catholic Doctor of the Church social justice philosopher got the balance between practicing Gospel values (feed and shelter the poor stranger) and admitting him to a nation unless he is sure to obey the laws, embrace the common good of his new country. Using the parable of the Good Samaritan, note how the Samaritan pays to house and give care to the injured man at an inn; he did not bring him to his own house. Prudent. The UK does well to fund refugee camps with humane conditions near the refugee's war-torn homes, so that when the war is over they can return. This is ethical and moral. We should feed, clothe, & shelter the refugee; we are not required to settle him in our country if it would damage our country's common good, as that would be unfair to our citizens.

Of course I'm not - but that's the point I'm making. They're all as bad as each other. It's just then when one is perceived as criticising something left-wing, people jump on you and call you "racist" and "bigoted". It's not true debate.



Author::::sillysam26

He's a brave man. In today's rabidly PC world, even the merest hint of questioning 'immigration' is seized upon. This article -like every other - cannot even conceive that LEFT wingers might not welcome immigration. Perhaps the Guardian columnists should go under cover in Labour / working men's clubs in Wolverhampton, Manchester, Rotherham, Boston, Swansea and see what normal people think of Open Borders. It won't be pretty.
