If David Cameron is so smart, why is he waging war on his referendum allies?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">D</span></span>oes David Cameron sincerely want to win this referendum? He gives every appearance of ignoring what it takes – and time is short. Without Labour votes, Britain will be out of Europe and Cameron out of office as the most disastrous prime minister since <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/frederick-north" title="">Lord North lost America</a>.</p>

<p>Labour canvassers door-knocking for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/11/for-corbyn-may-is-all-that-matters-not-2020-but-2016" title="">May’s elections</a> find their voters to be mainly EU inners, but many see this as Cameron’s campaign – and itch to give him a bloody nose. They only need to sit on their hands on <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/20/eu-referendum-timetable-uk" title="">referendum day</a> to watch his own Tory bastards kicking his head in for them. They’d be cutting off their noses and the nation’s too, but they may be sorely tempted.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/12/david-cameron-bullying-flashman-turn-off-women-voters" title="">Flashman bully at prime minister’s questions</a>, entitled and spoilt, Cameron has never had to fight for anything much, sauntering into the premiership “because I thought I’d be good at it”. But now he faces the fight of his life. For the first time he confronts that wall of sound from his erstwhile myrmidons, the entire Tory press. Day after day they bellow anti-EU, anti-migrant, anti-Cameron stories. “Welcome to our world!” a leading shadow cabinet member says, strongly pro-EU but unable to resist a chortle.</p>

<p>This is what Labour faces at every election, and now Cameron gets a blast of that toxic injustice. For Murdoch, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/feb/22/dailymail.pressandpublishing" title="">Dacre</a> and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/09/staff-fear-barclay-brothers-are-about-to-sell-off-telegraph-newspapers" title="">Barclay brothers</a> this has become a thuggish trial of strength: who rules, the elected government or them?</p>

<p>Surrounded by unaccustomed enemies, Cameron needs new allies. “Friends” is impossible, but he must strike up a temporary truce with <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> voters. Instead, he has embarked on an unprecedented anti-democratic assault on the very idea of opposition, seizing on Labour’s weakness like some power-mad dictator, just because he can.</p>

<p>In the Lords his <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/10/labour-expecting-6m-loss-in-funding-through-trade-union-bill" title="">trade union bill</a>’s key purpose is to neuter unions by preventing them from raising funds effectively through the check-off system in pay slips, stripping away Labour’s prime funding base. At the same time George Osborne is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/spending-review-2015-small-print-tax-credit-cuts-student-loans" title="">cutting the Short money that funds the operation of politics</a>, by 24% for Labour over the parliament, with no equalising reform to the Tories’ funding by plutocrats. Labour in power tried to reform funding but scrupulously insisted on cross-party consent, which the Tories of course refused.</p>

<p>Now add in Cameron’s stuffing of the Lords. No prime minister has added so many so fast – 244, with 56 since the last election. Now he <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-david-cameron-and-the-house-of-lords-more-peers-and-fewer-mps-equals-a-broken-system" title="">plans another 40</a>, angered at the loss of the Lords’ inbuilt Tory majority, though every Labour government has always faced a Tory Lords stoically, without creating hundreds of Labour peers.</p>

<p>What’s more, Cameron is axing 50 MPs to “cut the cost of politics”, while swelling the Lords to a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/composition-of-the-lords/" title="">colossal 816</a>. It’s gerrymandering, since reducing MPs abolishes many more Labour than Tory seats, and representatives from the north, Scotland and Wales are replaced by more from the rich Tory south. The Strathclyde review plans to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-strathclyde-review-of-the-lords-beware-a-government-power-grab" title="">diminish what the Lords can debate</a>.</p>

<p>Add in the shocking destruction of the electoral register, where at least <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/nearly-800000-names-axed-from-voter-register-officials-figures-show" title="">800,000 have been knocked off</a>. The list, already missing many poorer and younger voters, now requires individual registrations, with students no longer block-registered by colleges. Many will dash to register for the June EU referendum – but Cameron forbids use of this new fuller register to re-draw constituency boundaries, ignoring the electoral commission’s protests. The net effect of all this means <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/01/labour-may-need-bigger-swing-than-in-1997-to-win-next-election" title="">Labour will need a far greater swing to win than in 1997</a>.</p>

<p>But it seems neutering opposition in parliament is not enough: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/18/attack-on-unions-gag-democracy" title="">charities and trade unions have been gagged</a> in the year before elections. Now any charity in receipt of a grant is to be silenced permanently, to stop voices trusted by the public revealing the effects of government cuts. Anti-democratic and authoritarian, all this is designed to cripple opposition.</p>

<p>In this climate of hostility, Cameron seeks to woo Labour voters to save his bacon. Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the house, is considering sabotage and revolt. By withdrawing all co-operation with Tory whips, Labour can make the government’s life hell, with ambushes on votes, forced all-night debates, and filibusters on the finance bill after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/01/budget-2016-16-march" title="">this month’s budget</a>.</p>

<p>One example: the Tories have no majority on the members’ estimates committee, which allots parliamentary money. This means all MPs’ committees can be grounded, with no spending on foreign trips. Other committees can be rendered inquorate – stymied – if Labour fails to turn up.</p>

<p>Expect sudden votes when Tory MPs are meeting or at a Downing Street reception. Calling unexpected votes takes only a few Labour MPs, while the government needs all its members at the ready. Spanners can be hurled in the works in myriad ways. Cameron’s hydra-headed assault justifies wrecking tactics; he should ask himself if total war is how to win the referendum.</p>

<p>Britain’s future in Europe is too serious to risk for short-term party advantage. Cameron will be gone anyway – but Britain would be out for ever. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/26/alan-johnson-interview-eu-referendum-labour" title="">Labour’s in campaign is penniless: Alan Johnson</a> needs ringfenced donations, so Cameron and the all-party <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/24/britain-stronger-in-europe-remain-campaign-boris-johnson" title="">Stronger Ins</a> must redirect donors to him.</p>

<p>Humble pie is a dish unknown to this prime minister, but he had better try some. He can draw back from these measures. Remove the check-off clause from the trade union bill. Keep Short money rising with inflation. Let colleges register students to vote. Invest in a major voter-registration campaign – and let the boundary commission use the post-referendum register to redraw constituencies. Abandon the Strathclyde restrictions on Lords’ powers – and stop stacking the red benches with Tories.</p>

<p>It would be wise for Osborne – whose career hangs by the same thread in this referendum – to eschew a deliberately provocative political budget on 16 March. Hostilities will never cease. How could they when you look at the Tory devastation of local government, the NHS and public services? But self-preservation requires Cameron and Osborne to back off.</p>

<p>Ask Downing Street how likely that is, and you begin to hear an inkling of a new tone. Remember, they say, how adept Cameron is at winning elections. He’s a smart man. He’s listening. So let’s see if he can be a one-nation leader, if only for this referendum. And eat up his humble pie.</p>

Forget all this rubbish written by a privileged liberal, the Election of Comrade Corbyn as leader has completely destroyed the Labour Party as an effective opposition. Cameron can do exactly as he wants in most policy areas as the Labour Party looks inward and destroys itself.

Much as I wish Cameron and the Tories ill such an approach can only inflict more harm on those we wish to help. Although I think there would be a small portion of the electorate who'd think that way, the Tories themselves have turned Brexit into a huge anti-Cameron vote by the advent, what a surprise, of Boris.

This article begs the question that Cameron cares about the EU referendum. I don't see any evidence that he does. He cares about the Tories remaining in power, permanently if at all possible. I think any assessment of his motives needs to take into account that one supreme objective.

I think many voters will do exactly the same, they will vote in the same way as they do in local council elections, against an unpopular government rather than whether there local councillors are doing a good job. The Tory machine and the big corporations are for staying in and that may seem to many voters like a very good reason to vote OUT.

Cameron and the Tories are deeply mistrusted and unpopular with the electorate these days so it is entirely possible that, although many may believe in the message, they will still shoot the messenger.

No. Out will mean out, permanently and definitively. There are many in the EU who aren't that desperate to keep us in or have us back. There is far more public "Please don't go" going hand-in-hand with private, off the record "Good riddance" than people realise.

Labour should be sticking up for the low paid and the services they use and go for Brexit. Nothing wrong with a trading union...However the EU as it is and where it is heading is set up for big business. Anything that Godmanchester Sachs is for everyone else should be against.

A war between the biggest frauds in parliament. Cameron is a serial liar. Osborne is a serial liar. Bozo Johnson got the sack for lying. IDS has a fraudulent CV. Gove is a serial liar. Fallon is a serial liar. Grayling is a serial liar. None of them show any competency at all other than the ability for bare faced dishonesty. What fine upstanding citizens?

You see parties that win elections can do stuff and change stuff. Stuff that you might not like. Winning elections is good. The reason Labour has no hope of winning an election right now is down to Labour itself - not constituency boundaries, the electoral register, the voting system, the Lords, the media or the best one....the electorate.

Cameron has acheived more by way of concessions in re-negotiation than all previous Prime Ministers put together.Perhaps the real question is that Europe has shown itself incapable of reform even when Brexit stares it in the face.Ever closer union-their stated intention-has not worked.The response to Eurozone crisis,Greece and immigration have been pitiful and Schengen is a disaster.The EU is not fit for purpose but has shown itself as incapable of reform.This is not the fault of any British politicians let alone Cameron.If we are to stay in perhaps the shambolic Corbyn should stand up and be counted on something that really matters instead of junior student protests and lost causes.With regard to Trade Union legislation perhaps they too should reform and represent their membership the majority of whom do not support Labour nor left wing politics.Would it not be more democratic for members to select the party they wish to support instead of being given no choice but to support far left union leaderships and policies.That way party funding could be based on a far more representaive and democratic basis.

It really is time for this paper, indeed most media, to move away from talk of the EU. The EU is the past & present......the USE is the future. The Referndum is NOT a vote of approval on the EU.....of course, that is the way it is being sold by the boggle-eyed Europhiles. Cameron himself has said that the EZ nations are going to pursue their Ever Closer Union project. For THEM the USE WILL become a reality over the next 20 years. The question is - IF- as Cameron claims - UK is not to be subject to the move towards a US of E, where will that leave us ? Ask yourselves ; If our political masters will only give us ONE Referndum ( thank you UKIP.....Labour and Lib Dems didn't want us to have one) What is to Stop a future PM telling us in 10 years that it is in our national interest to adopt the Euro ? What is to Stop a future PM telling us in 15 years that full Political Union with the USE is the only way forward for UK ? It's ironic that the Cameron-haters are now fully behind him and trust every word he says on UK' s future relationship with mainland Europe. So Guardianistas....do you trust Cameron's word ? BREXIT now please......£2m every hour could SURELY be better spent.

Dave was always the wrong man to negotiate with the EU ( he never had engaged before with the EU, no friends) and he was very lucky to keep Scotland in the Union. He thought the could do the minimum to keep UK in EU and he believed we would never leave. I want out, but even I believe EU needs to reform for its own good and our benefit If power was given back to the 28 governments and UK could just remain on a trading basis not further political integration we could have remained in, that opportunity was wasted.
