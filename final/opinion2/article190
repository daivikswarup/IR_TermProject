Drone-fighting eagles – a reminder of nature’s superpowers




DateTime::::2016-02-08T16:23:58+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>f we ever needed persuading that animals are smarter than technology, we should take heed of the drone-fighting eagles. Scotland Yard is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/08/scotland-yard-interested-in-using-eagles-to-take-down-drones" title="">examining</a> the deployment of bald eagles by Dutch police after a private security firm demonstrated how the mighty birds can deftly pluck a drone out of the sky.</p>

<p>The drone featured in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/dutch-netherlands-police-birds-unauthorized-drones" title="">video</a> I’ve watched is a pretty feeble-looking specimen. The eagle easily avoids the blades and takes its plastic prey away for a mauling. Dutch police say this solution is less hazardous than shooting down drones that deliver drugs to prisons or menace planes (UK authorities recorded <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/29/drones-near-misses-major-uk-airports-heathrow-stansted" title="">30 near misses</a> with aircraft in 2015).</p>

<p>The superpowers of animals have long been used in conflict, from bomb-sniffing dogs to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/03/140328-navy-dolphin-sea-lion-combat-ocean-animal-science/" title="">mine-detecting dolphins</a> unleashed by the US navy. Homing pigeons carried crucial messages during both world wars; one of the only ways the enemy could disable these speedy messengers was to attack them with hawks, as the German army attempted during the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">The superpowers of animals have long been used in conflict, from bomb-sniffing dogs to mine-detecting dolphins</p>

<p>Wild things have an intrinsic right to existence, regardless of the functions they may perform for us, but drone-fighting eagles are a useful reminder that we can’t possibly predict the future utility of wild animals – or plants – and we would be wise to preserve as many of them as possible.</p>

<p>In Britain, this means letting birds of prey back into our landscapes, as James Macdonald Lockhart argues in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/9780007459872/raptors" title="">Raptor</a>, a new book published this week. Hen harriers continue to be <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/13/-sp-mystery-of-the-missing-hen-harriers" title="">illegally killed</a> for eating grouse before we can shoot them ourselves, and many people hate resurgent buzzards and red kites, wrongly blaming them for disappearing songbirds.</p>

<p>Put simply, prey species – food supply – will ultimately determine the number of predators, and so a sparrowhawk in your garden shows small birds are thriving. Here’s hoping that drones make excellent prey for a new band of crime-fighting eagles.</p>

<p>“Chaos as Imogen sweeps in” perfectly describes my niece’s impact on my brother-in-law’s living room. Imogen celebrated her first birthday in style on Sunday, just as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2016/feb/08/storm-imogen-batters-britain-strong-winds-torrential-rain-latest" title="">Storm Imogen</a> gathered a 96mph momentum off western Britain. I like this new naming of things, but if a truly deadly storm strikes I’ll feel sorry for the people whose names will be forever tarnished with carnage. The Met Office is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/uk-storm-centre" title="">publishing</a> this season’s list, so Katies, Lawrences, Marys, Nigels, Orlas and Phils can start getting anxious now. Storm Steve has a particularly nice ring to it but for every Steve’s sake, I hope it will be a harmless blow.</p>

<p>Sheffield’s authorities have chopped down nearly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/trees-council-leader-and-campaigner-go-head-to-head-over-felling-controversy-1-7721152" title="">3,500 street trees</a> in the famously leafy city in recent months as part of a £2.2bn, 25-year contract to “improve” its streets with private contractor Amey. The trees are being cut down because it is cheaper to plant saplings that require no maintenance than prune mature trees, such as the lovely cherries recently hacked down on Spurr Street. After months of the Labour council ignoring petitions, street marches and expert evidence, residents have temporarily halted the chainsaw massacre in the high court. With <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.crowdjustice.co.uk/case/sheffield-trees/" title="">crowd-funding</a>, they are now seeking a judicial review of the council’s flawed consultation and failure to conduct an environmental impact assessment of the whole project. Why is a democratically elected council so deaf to the will of residents (and not an unsubstantial minority, either)? Campaigners believe the reason lies in the small print of its contract with Amey, which has so far been kept secret. It’s not just the treeless streets that look dismal in Sheffield – so does local democracy.</p>

"Machine evolution is a guided process". Indeed! I wonder how many years and how many iterations it would take to evolve a wheelbarrow into a car, by adding random bits to it, and throwing away each version that did not work. My guess is you'd still be at it after 4,000,000,000 years.

Asked about the subject by SputnikNews, Dr David Glynne Fox, of the British Falconers Club Eagle Group said, “[I am] totally amazed that anyone could be so stupid as to even think of the idea.” You can read more on the same lines at DronePunks and SputnikNews.

Well, well PB is on about Sheffield trees again. You are right about the totally undemocratic consequences of outsourcing on long term contracts - whether in local government or in health. I have nothing to do with the Council but have attended several of the meetings about trees. It is reasonable to say that the Council (both Councillors and officers) and the contractor Amey have handled this badly and sometimes incompetently. However quite a few of the tree campaigners allegations and remarks such as yours about treeless streets in Sheffield are woeful exaggerations. It's the butterfly wing flap theory applied with robotic logic - the felling of a single non-diseased tree will damage the whole universe. At a recent meeting one resident was almost in tears because the felling of the overgrown street tree which has been blighting her house and garden has been blocked by campaigners who live nowhere near. The argument about replacement by saplings is also potentially flawed. The saplings planted three years ago in my street already require some attention. The problem is that the desperate cuts which the government's austerity regime have forced on councils have seriously damaged not just services but their ability to plan, respond, consult etc. And of course the outsourced contracts are covered by commercial confidentiality. So, as you hint at the end of your para, people who are rightly concerned about this should be supporting the campaign to persuade the government not to restrict Freedom of Information requests but to extend them to companies contracted through public funds. Perhaps the injunction to stop tree felling will create the space for more rational debate and better consultation. In particular there needs to be much better understanding of what maintenance is most suited, practical and affordable. But, like any sensible gardener, please accept that not all growth is good - after all that is a green principle of economics.

The blades on many drones are sharp and very powerful. I've seen a number of photos and videos of people who have badly cut their fingers on drone blades.

I imagine they would tend to station the eagles in problem areas. A cure rather than a prevention. Better than nothing. Better than shooting them down.

We've got about 150 prisons, so (on a shift system - presumably eagles have to rest and eat) that's around 450 eagles on stand-by. Then we can start on the airports. Possibly there might be some overlap. But that's a lot of eagles, isn't it?

Would be cool if it were possible to genetically engineer eagles that can destroy drones, planes, or tanks in one swoop.

Although it's worth noting that the animals are the result of many millions of years of evolution, largely a process of trial and error where the failures weed themselves out by dying and not reproducing.

I was reading elsewhere that the eagle can actually see the rotors in movement and thus easily avoid them.

Don't forget that dogs were the pinnacle of human technological achievement. All of their functions are still the go-to solutions for humans thousands and thousands of years later. They can even recharge and make fresh copies of themselves, always looking to improve on the design.

Are drones illegal now? Or the jackboots are just going to vandalise them and possibly have them fall on somebody after being taken out midair. Perhaps drone sellers should tell their customers you're not allowed them and the police will destroy them mid flight.

I feel sorry for the fighting cocks that have to play for Tottenham. As the emblem so visually articulates, the owners of Spurs see their players as merely animals to be used, abused and bet on. The ban on Cock fighting should more thoroughly enforced.
