Are they still afraid of the big bad wolf in Finland?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here’s been a massacre in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/finland" title="">Finland</a>. The country, which from afar looks to epitomise sustainable living, has slaughtered a third of its wolves this winter. Seventy-five wolves have been killed since the end of August: 43 in a government-sanctioned cull, and most of the rest under a licence system that allows “problem” wolves – those repeatedly found in villages or menacing farm livestock – to be shot dead.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/finland-approves-wolf-hunt-trial-cull-illegal-poaching">Finland approves wolf hunt in trial cull</a> </p>

<p>Thanks to people finally shrugging off the fairytale baddies that teach us to fear this carnivore, and thanks to protection from an EU directive on habitats, wolf numbers – along with those of lynx and brown bears – have been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/18/brown-bears-wolves-and-lynx-numbers-rising-in-europe" title="">slowly recovering in Europe</a>.</p>

<p>Wolves have proved adept at sharing space with humans, in some cases frequenting densely populated suburbs. Italy and Spain have large wolf populations and even Germany, where wolves are recolonising from Poland, has a similar number of wolves to Finland. Germany also has 233 people for every sq km; <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/finland">Finland</a> averages just 17.</p>

<p>There’s one fact that perhaps explains Finland’s lack of tenderness to wolves: its human population of 5.5 million includes 300,000 hunters. Finland’s government argues its cull will stop frustrated hunters from illegally shooting wolves – so the wolves are being killed for their own protection.</p>

<p>Last year, wolves were blamed for killing about 50 hunting dogs, infuriating hunters who spend years training them. Hunters are handsomely compensated but that’s not enough – the wolf is also a competitor for the elk and deer that hunters want to kill.</p>

<p>But there’s a third reason, according to Riku Lumiaro of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.sll.fi/site-actions/english" title="">Finnish Association for Nature Conservation</a> – and it will be familiar to anyone who brushes against British game shooters: “Hunters have total power over the countryside and they don’t want to lose it.”</p>

<p>In Finland, ​criticism of the wolf cull is portrayed as a clash between urban and “forest” culture. Lumiaro thinks it will simply take time, decades perhaps, for a cultural change.</p>

<p>I’m sure Finns won’t appreciate a lecture from a citizen of a country that wiped out its wolves four centuries ago, and I was reminded of our own attitude towards ​killing ​wild animals outside my local butcher’s the other day.</p>

<p>He was selling some byproducts of Britain’s lucrative shooting industry (byproducts because the main product is “fun”): <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/W/WoodPigeon/index.aspx" title="">woodpigeon</a> and 14 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/w/woodcock/index.aspx" title="">woodcock</a>, their rapier-like beaks tucked inside their carcasses. Eating dead birds is preferable to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3466593/Dead-pheasants-left-rot-field-day-s-shooting-exclusive-country-estate.html" title="">dumping them</a>, as some shoots do, but this beautiful, elusive wader is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bto.org/volunteer-surveys/woodcock-survey" title="">rapidly declining</a>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I bought two pigeons. I struggle to justify eating meat but us carnivores should probably consider replacing other dishes with the ubiquitous woodpigeon. I adore pigeons’ bumbling woo-wooing, but KFP has a nice ring to it. I’m sure Colonel Sanders could liven up its livery flesh.</p>

<p>OK, I’ll admit a grudge too: their fondness for defecating all over my solar panels is wreaking havoc with my electricity generation.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>After the heartbreak of the recent <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/25/uk-whale-strandings-why-did-they-happen" title="">stranded whales</a>, it’s lovely to see such a happy creature on the shores of Loch Nevis. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/847590/ex-sas-man-will-cross-the-atlantic-in-65ft-whale/" title="">Moby</a> is a very strange, smiling 65ft blue whale-cum-houseboat, made of steel by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_McClean" title="">Tom McClean</a>, who hopes to sail her across the Atlantic.</p>

<p>I wish McClean, who is 73, a safe voyage – but this is one whale that looks happiest on the beach.</p>

Not correct. When they attack a flock of sheep and have lots of targets, they become thrill-killers like foxes.

My experience with sport hunters is that they are cowards and would run from a feisty Yorkshire terrier. You are free to disagree. Deer hunters that eat everything they kill and are educated enough to understand the importance of predators, I have on problem with.

They will pick off humans that they identify as vulnerable - young children usually. Our Western lifestyle that doesn't allow children out of our sight is our best protection. Wolf attacks aren't rare in Central Asia, unfortunately. In those parts children will often be guarding flocks of sheep on their own.

From what I have heard farmers are compensated, but it's a bureaucratic system that does not fully compensate for the loss and doesn't cover the costs of protection and watching. In any case no-one wants to raise herds only to see them decimated and then get compensation.

A lonely wolf is far less dangerous to a human than a pack of wolves. Wolves normally attack when they are in a pack.

Hertsman is completely wrong. The population in France is near 300 of wolves. Plus workers get compensation for their losses. There are powerful lobbies in favor of the eradication of the wolf in France. Thank's to our gouvernment they don't let this kind of things happening.

I have seen once a wolf in the forest here in Germany, but as soon as he spotted me he disappeared. I felt no fear just was happy to see such an animal in the wild.By the way I do not know anybody who was ever threatened by a wolf. But I know 2 people who were attacked and seriously injured by boars. They are by far more dangerous then wolves.

There aren't wild wolves in Denmark and in all honesty the Danes dont want them...

Don't they get compensation for wolf losses?

So... just like dogs then, oddly enough.

In fairness, Henforthe, I believe it's the danger to domesticated animals that most complain about whereas from your post, I gather you refer to danger to humans.



Author::::hertsman
DateTime::::2016-03-02T18:15:30Z
 I honestly don't understand why anyone would seek to kill as beautiful and wild a creature as a wolf.



Author::::hertsman
DateTime::::2016-03-02T18:08:26Z
Wolves typically consume between 91% and 95% of the edible portions of a carcass, and hunt for survival



Author::::hertsman
DateTime::::2016-03-02T17:58:47Z
Wolves sometimes go for the occasional sheep, ie. farm animals that don't add much to the economy. In most countries farmers even get royal compensations

Lynx aren't dangerous? What are talking about? A lynx can leap from a tree and snap your neck in a heartbeat. And you won't even see it coming.

Strange that you specifically mention Germany with a couple of hundred wolves, but not France with 650 or so.

Most Russians nowadays live in urban areas but still, there have been attacks on people. They may not be fatal but people did end up in hospital. I did a quick search and found quite a a few such stories, especially from Belarus and Kazakhstan.

I'll back up EpicHawk. I might live a coddled life in a city but I do spend about half the year working in remote parts of Canada, where I hear wolf cries almost daily, get their shit on my boots nearly as often, and see packs or individuals every week or so. They're not dangerous.



Author::::EpicHawk
DateTime::::2016-03-02T10:10:21Z
I know plenty of Canadians who live in areas where there are wolves too. They're pro wolf. You are wrong.



Author::::EpicHawk

So nobody should admit they're against fox hunting either, cause "the nazis were too".

Roads are just not as spectacular to types like Achydenius, just like pedo's, rapists, murderers.

You adapt. There's no need to senselessly slaughter a third of your wolves. If people don't like the wilds than they should migrate to the cities.

Indeed. Fear of wolves is a very irrational fear. It applies to most predators but wolves have a seriously bad image while they're less dangerous than bears or big cats.

Basic research....wolf attacks are very very rare and tend to occur where wolves have lost their fear of humans.

My comment on hares was in response to Jacque_Schitt. I don't know which UK small herbivores are endangered at the moment and which are not, but I gather there are enough to sustain a population of lynx and wolves who are, after all, native to the UK.
