Rupert and Jerry, and the art of the celebrity humblebrag




DateTime::::2016-01-12T18:57:39+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here’s only one engagement notice in the most recent edition of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.facebook.com/MedwayMessenger">Medway Messenger</a> (congrats, Jo and Steve!). That’s one more than in the latest <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thanetgazette.co.uk/">Isle of Thanet Gazette</a>; likewise the other local paper I read, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thetottenhamindependent.co.uk/">Haringey Independent</a>, whose births, deaths and marriages column is full of ads for funeral directors.</p>

<p>But romance is not dead elsewhere. Barely a week goes by without A-listers taking to the Times classifieds to tell us they’re off the market. That’s how <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/05/benedict-cumberbatch-announces-engagement-director-sophie-hunter">Benedict Cumberbatch </a>did it. And <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/27678275/eddie-redmayne-reveals-engagement-to-hannah-bagshawe">Eddie Redmayne</a>. And <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17449465">David Mitchell and Victoria Coren</a>. And <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34411066/tom-daley-announces-engagement-to-partner-dustin-lance-black-in-times-newspaper">Tom Daley</a>. And now <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/12/rupert-murdoch-and-jerry-hall-announce-engagement-in-classifieds">Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall</a>. All are famous. All are highly desirable – to some, at least. And all are familiar with the art of the press release.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/12/rupert-murdoch-and-jerry-hall-announce-engagement-in-classifieds">Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall announce engagement – in classifieds</a> </p>

<p>So why do they choose this route instead? When did it become fashionable for recently engaged celebs to make like they’re in Thames Ditton in 1976? In part, it’s the humblebrag. You thought you were being discreet! But somehow somebody saw it and other outlets ran with it – and what can you do? The Times’s Register section is the classy Twitter: a mode of self-publishing that doesn’t invite comparisons to the Kardashians – or people to weigh in below the notice about your choice.</p>

<p>It is intentionally elitist. But the wider effect is more insidious. Sixty years ago, classifieds were the cheap way of letting people know Gran was dead or the twins had been born, or to save the date for the wedding. Now we do this for free, constantly. We inform people of even the smallest change in our family circumstance – in grisly detail, with pics.</p>

<p>Hence the need to distinguish yourself from the pack, to announce your intentions in a forum not just anyone can access. The noticeboard has been ringfenced; a rarified space apart from the global village.Plus, of course, if you have the cash, even a Times classified is thriftier than a press conference. A few lines of text costs less than £100; add a black border and you’re only looking at £300. Still, every penny counts if you have an impending wedding – and Murdoch did not splash out on an upgrade, despite his position as proprietor of the paper presumably meaning he’s entitled to mates’ rates.</p>

<p>Murdoch and Hall have been courting for just four months. But on the evidence of that decision, he has not lost his head. Putting a ring on it is one thing, a box round it quite another.</p>

<p><strong> <br/></strong></p>

<p>An official sticker on the new <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesbond">James Bond</a> DVD collection flags three key selling points. “All 23 Bond films” are included, plus “two all-new featurettes”, not to mention “space reserved for Spectre”. “Space” means an empty sleeve you can one day fill, if you shell out another tenner. That DVD sales have held up so much better than CDs is perhaps attributable to this sort of ingenuity. I recently bought an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/alan-partridge">Alan Partridge</a> boxset for someone unfamiliar with the show, forgetting that to access the actual sitcom you need to know that you have to say <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://vimeo.com/13547030">“yes” to watching Bangkok Chick Boys</a>, lest you get lost in a maze of Linton Travel Tavern in-jokes. Once you’re a fan, of course, all this is much appreciated – and the sort of peripheral creativity that’ll be missed when the format finally dies.</p>

<p>Now is the season of the underwhelming David Bowie anecdote. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Old-Coulsdon-man-delivered-David-Bowie-s-milk/story-28505240-detail/story.html">Croydon Advertiser prints the memories of a Coulsdon milkman who met Bowie in 1969 (he was “a nice man”)</a>. Here’s mine: I saw him buy some soya sauce in a convenience store in Earls Court in 2002. It felt apt: for all Bowie’s otherworldly genius, he was still strangely suburban, even approachable (I didn’t, though).</p>

<p>That disparity was brilliantly mined in the BBC comedy <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY4isQVSgDg">Stella Street</a>, in which Phil Cornwell and John Sessions played various megastars who had moved to Surbiton. In one episode, Bowie takes over the corner shop run by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. True to form, he wants to innovate. “There’s gonna be some ch-ch-ch-ch-changes,” he says, as he dances down the aisle, past the beans and the scourers and the soya sauce.</p>

What does she need? Common sense, an introduction to good taste, a course in self esteem? Just a thought.

Having noted that Ms JH is rather tall, one looks forward to Rupe tweeting a line from Dudley Moore's wit. The wee funster, drink having been taken, was once asked, because he was consorting with one of the long-legged American lasses to whom he was partial, whether he went down on her.

As my Mum almost said, 'Better to be an old man's darling than Mick Jagger's fool.' Less chance of Murdoch shagging everything that moves as infidelity is usually only fun for the perpetrator. Also Jagger has a reputation for looking after the pennies, the measly few million or so he has. So Jerry has discovered revenge is best eaten ice cold.

Of course Wendi was also under deep cover for Chinese secret service. Did you see her ninja kick that geezer at the hacking tribunal, pure trained instinct. Her and Jerry in a fight to death over the wrinkled old swagman would be great to watch though. Is Tarantino reading this?

Don't think he needs to marry to access sexual services.He's probably worked out that it's an easier, less expensive arrangement than having to arrange escorts for every function he wants to attend.For all we know it might be that he just couldn't get on with a motorised wheelchair and needed a pusher. And those collar studs and cufflinks can be right so and sos.And bear in mind, a first aid course, some CPR knowledge and a handy pack of aspirins in her handbag could pay dividends.With or without sex.Leaving aside everything else why shouldn't an 80 something and a (nearly) 60 something do what they want? Kids do all the time.As they might say down under, good luck to the old bastard(s).

Let's hope she keeps her side of the bargain better than Jackie apparently did. The deal was that Onassis would get the ultimate trophy wife, plus sex, while she would get to spend his money. I saw a programme where friends of Onassis, speaking after his death, said he'd complained bitterly about not getting any.
