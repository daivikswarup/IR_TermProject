It’s not so grim up north. George Osborne should try it some time

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he government has admitted that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/07/97-of-top-officials-at-northern-powerhouse-department-work-in-london" title="">97% of the staff driving George Osborne’s “northern powerhouse” work in London</a>, which for anyone unfamiliar with British geography is in the south-east of the country. This is probably why the northern powerhouse has failed to materialise, despite the chancellor’s promise several years ago.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/07/97-of-top-officials-at-northern-powerhouse-department-work-in-london">97% of top officials at 'northern powerhouse' department work in London</a> </p>

<p>The north of England isn’t getting any more powerful. In fact, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/uneven-growth-tackling-city-decline" title="">according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</a>, 10 of the 12 poorest towns in the country are in the north. The first southern location to make the list is in 24th place.</p>

<p>The problem of the north/south divide is self-evident – especially to northerners. The north feels about as far away from Westminster as you could possibly imagine. For young voters especially, it’s hard to think that Cameron et al would ever face the problems they do, or know how to tackle them. No issues that my generation in the north care about seem to permeate to Westminster; no solutions go back up the M1. And having major governmental offices for devolution in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a>, rather than the place where the issue is most prominent, only emphasises the point.</p>

<p>It is the same with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/29/government-accused-of-contempt-for-north-over-sheffield-office-closure" title="">shutting the largest office</a> for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills outside London. It doesn’t exactly inspire faith in Osborne reinventing the north, does it? People in the north, especially Generation Y, are more alienated by the current situation than ever before.</p>

<p>The job market is terrible. Town centres are dominated by boarded-up shops. There’s a distinct lack of both emotional and financial investment in anywhere further up than Leicester. Industrial towns died when the coal mines shut and never got the shock of life they needed to come back. People still live there, they still exist. Just forgotten about.</p>

<p>It is all quite demoralising for any young person trying to start a life, get a job, think about a future. A message rings out loud and clear that Westminster doesn’t care about the north, or the people in it.</p>

<p>Let’s make no bones about it, the north is treated as a bit of a joke. All on benefits with lots of kids, eating chips and gravy and training up kestrels to pass the time. Northern accents are also an indicator of lesser intelligence, obviously. These stereotypes are pervasive and mean that northern youth are always going to be at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Class is obviously a factor, as are government cuts, but it isn’t all to do with money. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/youngpeople">Young people</a> in the north are always going to face a tougher battle when everything is so London-centric and there aren’t many comparable opportunities in Newcastle, Leeds, Liverpool or Manchester.</p>

<p>Work experience for jobs in the media, politics, finance ... none of these can be snapped up by those needing opportunities in the north because it takes time to get to London and it costs a fortune to stay down south for a week or two. A teen living in Essex, or greater London, or the home counties doesn’t face quite the same hurdles.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">People still live in northern industrial towns – they still exist. Just forgotten about</p>

<p>It isn’t just the geographical difference either. It wasn’t that long ago that news came out of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/15/poshness-tests-block-working-class-applicants-at-top-companies" title="">“poshness test”</a> blocking working-class applicants from top jobs. So those of you with a strong Barnsley accent had better get elocution lessons.</p>

<p>Just last month, statistics from the Sutton Trust confirmed that the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/24/privately-educated-elite-continues-to-take-top-jobs-finds-survey" title="">privately educated elite were still taking the top jobs</a>. Not to say that there isn’t a privately educated elite in the north – it’s just not on the same scale as in the south. Until someone, somewhere, starts realising that anything north of the Watford Gap isn’t barren wasteland, nothing will change because this government isn’t really trying to change anything.</p>

<p>The north of England is a brilliant place and each of the cities has something different to offer from London. But if the government keeps pulling resources from the north, relocating offices and paying it no attention, the problems are bound to continue. Osborne is kicking the very generation of people who could do his job for him and create the northern powerhouse.</p>

You'll have noticed that all the Guardian opinion pieces were by so-called Millennials on Wednesday. The young writer, Helen Whitehouse, was careless with her citations; it's ungenerous to assert "wilful misreporting". The piece is a flurry of grievances. I blame the editors — Millennials in focus is a flaky gimmick.

Prescott sold it wrong, and was very bullish in his approach. It all sounded very "seperatist" and put people off. We may be northerners up here, but we're very much English as well. What we'd rather prefer is stronger representaion, and a stronger voice, at Westminster rather than having more politicians knocking about doing very little, except claim expenses.

It used to be mostly confined to the underground, which wasn't surprising when you think about it. But it's happening more at street level these days, what with greater polution levels. Cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds sometimes get it too, but not half as bad as London.

And yet when John Prescott offered up democratically elected regional assemblies with (most importantly) devolved regional budgets for transport, economic development, education, health etc., the regional populaces were less than interested.

That may be his thought, but the truth is that a combination of the IRA (unintentional) and Manchester's own local politicians have done more to regenerate the city than an absentee landlord from footballersville.

Absolutely. In fact the effects of the divide are perhaps most stratified in the South West, as the popularity of the area among upper-middle-class holidaymakers has left property prices completely unaffordable to the native population on account of the value of houses that aren't even lived in for most of the year.

88% of people in Manchester's Crumpsall ward and 88% of people questioned in Oldham's Fallsworth East ward had no idea about devolution plans being imposed by their Council. If such a poll were taken in my area of Devon, the Heart of the South West LEP Ltd CIC, I dare say the result would be the same. And yet these deals have been pushed through across the country in the breathtakingly fast period of 3 months since the Chancellor's Autumn Statement. The deals may be quite good for businesses that are 'in the loop', but they will be of little benefit and less accountability to the local people and communities amongst whom they are placed. It's an audacious power grab by Government and furthermore perversely resulting in greater centralised control. (Who signs the cheques?) Devolution without proper democratisation will be nothing less than privatisation of local government.

I was directly taking issue with the mischaracterisation wilfully employed by the journalist in insinuating that because 'the first southern location to make this list is in 24th place'; precisely because Greater London is taken a monolithic whole, there is a good deal less deprivation in the South. There is not. The very poorest parts of the country are actually in London; it is a city of breathtaking asymmetry despite the city's much fabled status as the prime driver of growth.

I don't think that it's that simple. There would have to be another referendum and IF Scotland did break away there would be no guarantee that it would be automatically enrolled in the EU. Spain would very likely veto such an application.However, I accept your point about England getting a raw deal.

You are correct, THE NORTH has been used for centuries to denote the north of England by the English. In Scotland THE NORTH has been used by the Scots to describe places like Aberdeen or Caithness.In the context of Great Britain, of which I sincerely hope Scotland remains a part, I was merely congratulating an English commentator on recognising the fact that THE NORTH has different meanings within the context of a union of two nations.

The north south divide has a silver lining. The diversity you find in the UK is enormous and much of it was invisible to me, despite my business travels, until my children went to university. That took me to diverse places like London, Nottingham, Loughborough, Newcastle, Durham and Manchester. All are different and all have much to offer and Newcastle for me in particular, because Geordies are just Jocks with funny accents they are warm and straight talking. Manchester's vibrancy is distinctly different from London's, it's edgy and much less pretentious, more honest. The Midlands surprised me because in among all the industry there are fabulous beautiful villages, canals and rivers so different to Scotland. I even got to like London. Once you see past the City and the west end and head out you find a multicultural experience that is second to non. A diversity that's very engaging. It's not England, not even close, but it's good. And so is the rest of the UK and that's what makes me angry. Westminster's myopia and greed. The visible waste of resource and opportunity everywhere you go outside the M25. It's time it was all broken up for the benefit of our children and their children. Britain does not work. The northern power house will not happen because it's only a Westminster sound bite.

All the time. But as with 99% of the UK population I don't count.The North for me starts at the Scottish border, politically it means outside the M25. The result is a vast no-man's land Called England. Ignored, starved of resources, powerless and invisible to Westminster. It's sort of Scotland with no voice, no tartan, no heather, no Sturgeon to bang the drum, no hope.

I am a southerner whose daughter lives in Manchester. I love visiting there, good shops, restaurants that Cover every part of the world and do not charge the earth, art galleries and museums and cinemas.There is a lovely community feel about the place as well. The parks are well maintained, some have enterprising cafes.In the Northern quarter there is a mix of some lovely old buildings that have been converted to individual shops, bars and restaurants . Some have been converted to apartments with the original steel beams and brickwork. There are some bad parts the same as anywhere , leafy streets do exist.

Disagree southerners get a bad rep because there is more pressure to succeed and therefore more individual ignorance and tolerance ( for example on tube). However the majority of London dewellers do not judge on appearance if a conversation is started and actually are much more likely to be accepting of change and personal choice than potentially some other areas of country. a

Is it a fault of the south that favourable geography, and therefore historical social and economic development have started there? Of course it is favoured it always has been in the development of our population. The north needs dynamic local decision makers to spend funds on improving accessibility of infrastructure and facilities to drive demand. The money could be spent differently if it was thought about better. And no I don't have 1 solution but am suggesting a change of mindset would aid advancement.

Well I live in Leeds and the sense of optimism and progress is tangible. Nothing to do with central government of course although infrastructure investments can only accelerate progress. A mix of 'push' factors out of the South East and 'pull' factors of the northern cities. Yes there are lots of post industrial dumps in the north but nothing - neither market nor government - can save them. Any ideas for saving Bradford? No. Let it de- populate and find some sort of post textile destiny. Leeds Manchester and Liverpool will thrive because they have appeal and belief.

The Northern Powerhouse, as so many have observed BTL is bullshit, as far as most of the Tories are concerned. The author of this article paints with too broad a brush however. Osborne's constituency may not be quite in Manchester, but it does depend heavily on the conurbation for its living. I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but even if he is genuine, the rest of his party will undermine his little project.
