<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">S</span></span>ome may call it the law of unintended consequences, some <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">the Streisand effect</a>, but when a council tries to ban swearing on its streets and most people react by saying, “Wankers!”, the ban should be regarded as ineffective at best.</p>

<p>The thing about swearing is that the more you chastise the profane, the greater their urge to utter profanity. So trying to get someone to pay £100 for swearing in a public space can only result in a tsunami of filth that would cause Viz readers to cack their keks and quiver with wonder.</p>

<p>Salford – the place of the ban – has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.apho.org.uk/resource/view.aspx?RID=171633">over a quarter of its children living in poverty</a> and the already depleted child services are <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://salfordonline.com/16283-salford-council-cuts-6m-from-childrens-services.html">set to be cut again</a> by £6m this year. Its murder rate is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/murder-capitals-salford-manchester-rochdale-10777067">one of the highest in the UK</a>. Impotent to act against the cuts in government funding, the council last year opted to make the world a neater and nicer place by wishing away the nastiness and introducing a swear box.</p>

<p>Using a public space protection order (PSPO) that enables councils to ban “antisocial behaviour” (which is already banned under other legislation that requires police and messy stuff, like evidence), Salford has outlawed the utterance of “foul and abusive” language within the confines of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/salford">Salford</a> Quays, the home of BBC Media City and quayside residences. Which is to say, the nice bit where the visitors go, the regenerated showcase, the bit on the postcards; not the bit outside the Quays, where life expectancy is on average 10 years lower.</p>

<p>Cross that regenerated line of the swearing ban and watch the mortality rates change – a fact that should elicit at least a “Bloody hell!”</p>

<p>So how will the ban work? Shall we be denied the pleasure of entering the mall, cast out of Gap and the other assorted pap peddlers? Shall we be denied the right to wait behind barriers at the Beeb to glimpse the stars of screen and radio?</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/04/sacha-baron-cohen-donald-trump-demagogue-aids-hiv-daniel-radcliffe-grimbsy">Sacha Baron Cohen attacks Trump amid Aids joke controversy</a> </p>

<p>No, my friends – a fine is the punishment of choice.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is a sliding scale, starting with 30p per “piss” or “bum” and working its way up to a fiver per “fuck”? What is the rate for the C word? And if you are found guilty of using that, can you plead for a series of “tosses” and “turds” to be taken into consideration? Alas, no: the fate of gutter-gobbed miscreants will be in the hands of a council official, who will decide to issue an on-the-spot £100 fine or send them straight to court.</p>

<p>There is a defence – that it was reasonable to swear: for example, “I was stabbed and shouted, ‘Fuck! I’ve been stabbed.’ ” Or, “We were discussing Boris Johnson.” But other than that – and the Boris defence might not actually stand up in court – it’s £100 for an audible “arsehole”.</p>

<p>There are questions of fairness too. How does the council envisage enforcing the ban? The area is a cut-through for Manchester United fans attending Old Trafford; will council wardens in hi-vis jackets be told to fine singing fans? Or will they target teenagers from next door Ordsall loitering by the Quays? They see the Quays as their swimming pool, and once summer arrives anyone who so much as swears about how cold the water is could be slapped with a fine.</p>

<p>This may have already happened; we’re waiting for a freedom of information request to reveal how often the PSPO has been enforced. Even if it’s still only a threat, it has a chilling effect on everyday freedoms.</p>

<p>As fate would have it, I am about to perform at the Lowry theatre within the boundaries of the PSPO, and I have been known to drag audiences through the streets after gigs for nocturnal demonstrations, so how would the ban affect that? Will I and the audience be fined for our utterances?</p>

<p>In the interests of remaining within the law, I sent Salford City Council a list of words I’m considering using, and asking which are permissible and which are not. The list runs to 425 words, in alphabetical order, starting with “arse”, ending with “winnit” and including the term “cat twinky”. I have no idea what that last one means but thought we should check nonetheless.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/08/pspos-new-control-orders-public-spaces-asbos-freedoms">PSPOs: the new control orders threatening our public spaces</a> </p>

<p>The council’s reply refuses to assess my list, so I will probably never know if “fingering the towel holder” could be regarded as foul and abusive language. However, its lawyers did say: “Salford City Council would wholly support your ability to express yourself as a performer and would not seek to take steps to prevent such a performance from taking place.”</p>

<p>I appear to have been given some kind of a pass. And once again we are left with the impression that all of this is targeting working-class kids from the other side of the ban’s tracks. So I have decided to make an offer to anyone who is fined for straight-up swearing at Salford Quays. After the show I am setting up a swear box, and aim to cover the first couple of fines. So if you are fined for just swearing contact me via <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.markthomasinfo.co.uk">my website</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps more importantly, Liberty wants to hear from anyone who is issued with a fine for swearing. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/get-advice">Get in touch</a> and it may be able to help. Let’s see if this ban stands the scrutiny of a full legal challenge.</p>

Having recently moved back from Glasgow (Southside) to Ipswich, Suffolk I have retained the Glaswegian way of readily saying ffs and quietly did this at Ipswich Library after having to wait too long. It was overheard by the staff who attempted to reprimand me for my spoken contribution. I suggested the accusing staff-member needs a broader education. I explained my Glasgow experience but this cut no ice - the question in response to this was, "this was done in public?"; yes I replied and regularly - she added "well not here". I miss the bare-bones reality of Glasgow. Get real Ipswich (not even a pseudo `posh` town).

I was having trouble getting a refund for an over charge at tesco's last Tuesday. The manager was in a bad mood and I said "This is so bloody frustrating". She tried to throw me out of the store for 'swearing at her'. When I refused to go she tried to get security to throw me out. He didn't...I left of my own accord and got my refund and compensation through a complaint to customer services. Donna don't take your bad moods out on customers........

But we're not talking about kids spending hours and hours around these people. We're talking about them passing them in the street. How much is that going to affect them really?And the six year old who said fuck... Am I supposed to be shocked? Kids do/say things that aren't right or appropriate sometimes, you tick them off and hopefully they don't do it again. That's how it goes and there are much worse things a child could do than say a swear word without really understanding what it means. I'd rather my son said fucking pencil case than whacked another child, or all sorts of things he might see other people do while out and about but which we can't legislate against

I'm pretty sure if someone issue me with a fine for swearing in public I'd simply tell them to fuck off. I'd then tell them that my name was 'go fuck yourself', I live at 69 Go Fuck Yourself Avenue' and my phone number was '0161 Fuckity Bye'.

But there's a massive difference between seeing a group of people ebulently swearing after a few hours afternoon on the drink in a town or city centre while families are still walking about, and the accidental expletive that inadvertently pops out at moments of stress or pain. This article which you were so dismissive of is very much about the former. Its something that is getting worse, and isn't OK. Swearing might be part of language but I'd be very wary of rearing children to believe it is a normal part of life as that will only disadvantage them when they invariably encounter people who aren't quite so ambivalent about it, or go to work in a tabloid newsroom. We know one family to whom swearing is a normal part of life. They got called in to school when their six year old son turned round to his teacher to tell her he couldn't find his fucking pencil case.

Is it okay for children to see people smoking in public places? They do, all time. Is it okay for them to see their parents have a glass of wine, or see other people doing so in restaurants? I have a three year old son and look after a three and a five year old. I occasionally swear in front of them (stubbed my toe, heard a piece of shocking news, became extremely angry about something) (not them and never swear at them) and they don't bat an eyelid. If you don't make a big deal out of swearing, nor do they, and it's not appealing or funny to them. Never heard them repeat a swear word but if they did I would ignore it and inwardly chuckle. Swearing is not harmful, it's a normal part of language.

Swearing has its place. In public it's an invasion of public space, like graffiti. Just makes the world slightly less pleasant, possibly more menacing, to people who aren't part of your group.

I don't really see any correlation between class and swearing. I think there are as many posh middle class "bankers" who think its clever to litter every word with "fack". I told off a group of students in our local department store's toy dept a couple of weeks backs (toilets on the same floor). If people are swearing loudly, and there are young kids around, they deserve more than a fine. Once upon a time they'd have got a clip round the ear.

Not really, I am quite tolerant and come from a sweary family.But we all know how to not swear infront of children and old ladies and not to do it in a quiet train and so on.However, I now have a son who is unable to understand social ways easily, through no fault of his own, and it is a lot of work getting him to not say any rude things he hears in assembly, to the teacher and so on, to parents at the park etc and is having a big impact on his life e.g. he has been excluded from school and no longer invited to parties and so on.It would make my and his life easier if adults did not use swear words in family places and on public transport.

Most people have more pressing concerns in life than whether someone has said a naughty word or not. It's a form of expression and can be a healthy way of releasing negative emotions. Anyone who's mortally offended by swearing should get out into the real world more often and away from their cosy, sheltered middle- class existence. Imposing restrictions on speech is puritanical.

You could be onto something.I think most section 5 offences are dealt with by a fixed penalty, but (I am guessing here) it could be that FPNs go to HM treasury but locala authority fines go to the local authority...... might just be a way of clawing back funding cut by central government?

So you are thoughtful about when to regulate your speech. Well done. You're probably thoughtful about when to assault someone too. So we don't need the state to regulate that either.

I take it you were not brought up in this country? If you were, you would know that people can see through Cameron. Reading body language and what clothes people wear is essential to living in any society. The trouble is that we generally find it more difficult to read such signs in a different society to our own. The further away one gets culturally and geographically the more difficult it is.
