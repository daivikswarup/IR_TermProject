I own four boilersuits. I don’t even know where my boiler is




DateTime::::2016-03-10T15:10:00+0000



<p>Like the very essence of every hateful hipster, millennial cliche, I dress like a callus-handed daughter of industry yet haven’t done a hard day’s work since about 2014.</p>

<p>In my favour, I’m hardly the first. Winston Churchill, the inventor of the sirensuit, often wore his khaki onesie for nothing more rugged than the occasional political confab and photoshoot with some notable, like Montgomery or Roosevelt.</p>

<p>I am also, I’d like to add, hardly alone. The pop-up cafes of Britain’s post-industrial cities are now clattering, clanking, ringing and thrumming with people dressed like they make an honest living. Stiff aprons, leather belts, linen overalls and large pockets are, ironically, twinned with soft hands, iPhone chargers, designer glasses and perfect diction. Grimy neckerchiefs, heavy boots, paint-splattered jeans and Thinsulate hats are all too often the accompaniment to hotdesking, Skype meetings, MA tutorials and artisanal coffees.</p>

<p>But where has this hunger for hard-work outfitting come from? Why is an entire generation of white-collar, narrow-shouldered urbanites dressing in overalls, dungarees, smocks and work coats? As the last twitches of British industry fade to dust, why are we all suddenly dressing like a gaggle of extras from Boys from the Black Stuff?</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/17/students-are-so-in-this-season-the-young-people-behind-london-fashion-week">Students are so in this season: the young people behind London Fashion Week</a> </p>

<p>The first answer, as so often this millennium, is because of nostalgia. At a time when British manufacturing is a whisper away from being just a memory, when job security is nonexistent and most graduates face panic, unemployment or underemployment, it’s little wonder many of us are getting nostalgic for an era when people actually had jobs. You know, proper jobs that involved uniforms, hard boots, a community, tools, protective clothing and unions.</p>

<p>When your “portfolio career” is sliding into inability to find work, pay rent, live in the city where you grew up, have a child, plan a future or ever hope for a pension, it’s hard not to get a rosy glow about climbing ladders, clocking in and a subsidised canteen.</p>

<p>And if, through a combination of mechanisation, international outsourcing and the destruction of trade unions, those jobs are not so readily available, then … well, at least we can wear the clothes that used to characterise them.</p>

<p>Which brings us on to the fact that fashion is and will always be a beacon, a signal, a siren – something that blares our sense of identity out across the shopfloor. Clothes are used to communicate, without words, how we want to be seen.</p>

<p>So many of my generation are using the shirt on their back to look busy: to seem productive, strong, down-to-earth, serious, tough, traditional and useful. By wearing a smock, a pair of dungarees, some lace-up boots or a mackintosh, we’re hoping to give off the air (if not whiff) of all the hearty, salt-of-the-earth associations that come with farmers, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jan/26/fisherman-fashion-menswear-workwear-trend">fishermen</a>, builders, butchers, bakers, painters and mechanics.</p>

<p>We know the rest of the world considers us lazy, feckless, self-indulgent and smug. How could we not? And we know how actual bricklayers, carpenters, bakers and farmers talk about us. My friend Matt, a builder, tells me: “Most of what they do has no real worth or value outside some shallow specification of entertainment, so they try to masquerade as workers to borrow some sort of ‘dignity of labour’. ”. It’s hard to argue with that.</p>

<p>So, like the self-loathing hipsters you consider us to be, we reach for a disguise. We’re dressing up like people who have learned a trade, partly out of the shame that we haven’t.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s social conformity. Perhaps the current trend for workwear is just the logical conclusion of fashion as uniform: that we use what we wear to feel a sense of belonging within our particular subculture, class and demographic. It used to be tonic suits, ripped tights, drainpipe jeans or cowboy boots; now it’s overalls and aprons. If you like wearing this, and I like wearing this, then maybe you’ll like me too – it’s that simple.</p>

<p>I would love to tell you that I wear my boilersuits to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/06/lay-off-builders-wolf-whistlers-sexism">help my dad out on the building site</a>. But I don’t (and, to be fair, he does most of his work barefoot and in jeans). I would love to tell you that I wear my boilersuits when I’m fixing my car. But I don’t. I don’t even drive. I would love to say that I wear my boilersuit to do essential home maintenance and manual labour. But I don’t. The last time I came home from the pub and regrouted my bathroom, wearing a baby-blue VW boilersuit, I was only just the right side of shitfaced, and had to do it all over again a week after.</p>

<p>Of course the fetishisation of the working class is awkward and at times offensive. Of course wearing a set of dungarees doesn’t actually make you any more capable of work. Of course the nostalgic view of postwar industry is the silliest sort of rose-washing. But if you think the worst aspect of industrial decline is a few people in coffee shops wearing secondhand workwear, then, well, that’s your business.</p>

The George which makes me cringe is the Galloway variety - owning a clothes shop does not give a public man of advanced years the license to ponce about in a granddad shirt and wide brimmed hat looking like a tw@t. Although he talks like one so fait a complet...

You're paying £150 an hour for the knowledge, skill, years of training and the overheads of running a business. Plus, the fact that so few people in this country actually want to do the job means that there are enough people in your area willing to pay £150 an hour to keep those who do, fully employed.

the truth is that ''doing something useful with your hands'', in the given labour conditions, actually means back ache, arthritis, not enough money or not enough time, listening to absolute fm full blast because nobody changed the dial in 20 years, eating bad and having to deal with the jobcenter advertising jobs for agencies

that depends very much of the size of the site for a start, and trademen not only work onsite, they also work in worshops, like a joinery shop, and not all sites or workshops have labourers, i don't know how was for you anyway, but before i could called myself a carpenter i had to be a labourer and an apprentice and then i had to unload many more trucks and clean many more sites than i do now, and because i did it at the time, i am not some lazy arrogant who wouldn't help a labourer or undermine them because they have to hump stuff around, a trademan should know everything that involves his trade, like where the materials come from and what is the way to handle them, i actually would never trust a trade who says is never unload a truck and would prefer to be signing on

DateTime::::2016-03-11T19:48:25Z
no, there is not 2 trades, what are you talking about? what are you implying with your comment, those 2 trades never unload a truck because the materials they use don't require big trucks coming with them like bricks, timber, cement, plaster, steel, etc, you sound you dont have any trade really

Demarcation on a building site ? Was this in Chicago during the 1970's because there has not been no unions on building sites for decades and no one unloads anything much by Hand as it tends to be really heavy or would take forever like bricks that's why it all comes on pallets on a waggon

But that is the same. The proportion of manufacturing to GDP may decline but is the total amount of manufactured goods greater?



Author::::Acamar

As a proportion of our GDP manufacturing has been declining for 50 years, and this perhaps justifies the lighthearted article. I really lack the knowledge to take it any futher.

It is a peculiar grammar that uses 'that' for people instead of 'who' or 'whom'. Nor would citing Dickens' or Austen's use of same make it correct.

Similar background here. I think some of it is about confidence in your own abilities in the time of constant reports about being ripped off whenever you need to get something fixed or replaced. If you know that you can sort out pretty much anything that might might break or go wrong, or at least know enough to figure out who might try to rip you off it is a great boost to your self esteem

Just because a person is overweight, doesn't mean they don't exercise. I go to the gym regularly and swim and cycle as well. I'm stronger than some of the thinnies I see in the weight room, but I'm still chubby.

There may be an actual physical reason for that. Quite some time ago I read an article in either Discover or Scientific American in which a researcher noticed that depression rates have climbed since fewer and fewer jobs are done by hand, even though the people doing the non-manual jobs have more money and presumably better quality of life.Her theory was that the part of the brain that controls use of the hands is connected to the part that creates a feeling of satisfaction. Can't remember the details, but I've been trying to find that article again ever since.

I looked out my window today and thought isn't it strange that people think it is cold and winter and that they are hungry and can hear bullets. When it is actually summer and 32C and every single house as far as the eye can see costs over $3m and I can see the river and doesn't my PhD look spectacular hanging on the wall and how shiny my daughter's piano looks after the cleaners polished it yesterday. And, then looked back out the window at my spectacular view and thought how stupid people are to think it is winter and there is poverty.

I think it was an H G Wells book I read years ago, but whoever it was by, there was a section where he discusses a university professor who takes his class outside to dig a ditch. He does this to show them the joy of good honest work. The author then proceeds to rip this to shreds. Yes it is fun to dig a ditch when you can go back to your nice comfy surroundings the next day. But it is bark breaking, hard labour, when it needs to be done every day.

perhaps, but you also have to look at actual output. As other countries increase their industrial place we will surely fall down even further. But you would have to look at what was produced before that slide and now to determine if actual production is falling.
