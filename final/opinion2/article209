What did the US learn from Downton? Obsolescence catches up with us all

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he final season of Downton Abbey <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/downtonabbey/" title="">just got going on PBS in the US</a> and, as those who saw it in Britain last year already know, it has a sufficiently sad, end of an era air about it to make one practically mourn the passing of formalised inequality. The Dowager Countess is laying off staff, Lord Grantham is wondering if he still needs an under butler, and the neighbouring estates are being sold off to new money. The country, in other words, is going to the dogs.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/22/downton-abbey-truth-about-britain">What if Downton Abbey told the truth about Britain? | Polly Toynbee</a> </p>

<p>The cleverest thing about this series has been just how skilfully it has provoked its audience to mirror the responses and expectations of its characters, so that when, in this season’s first episode, a blackmailer barges her way into Lady Mary’s bedroom, one is not affronted because she’s a criminal, but because she’s a chambermaid without permission to be there.</p>

<p>This is not, as has been suggested by some of the show’s critics, because <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/julian-fellowes" title="">Julian Fellowes</a> identifies too flagrantly with the upper classes, or rather the question of whether he does or not is irrelevant. The horror one feels when a servant is rude in Downton is just a function of how thoroughly the world of the show has been created – so thoroughly that one buys into it to the extent of sympathising against one’s own interests. The vast majority of us busily empathising with Lady Mary would have been shovelling coal in her fireplace, or helping her put on a dress that cost more than a year’s wages.</p>

<p>In the US, there have been a lot of Downton spin-offs that might have been funded by the English tourist board, focusing on the history of various palaces and stately homes, and a documentary fronted by the expert who advised the Downton cast on period etiquette.</p>

<p>None of them captures the charm of the show. In the final season, as political consciousness finally seeps through the servants’ quarters – Daisy the maid referred caustically to the unfairness of “the system” this week, imagine! – the nostalgia is working against itself. When a servant expresses the view that working in a shop is better than being in service, we sigh with Carson not out of sympathy for the aristos, but at the passing of time. Obsolescence comes to us all in the end.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35309034" title="">The record-breaking Powerball lottery draw has been made</a>, rendering a lucky trio from California, Tennessee and Florida up to $1.5bn richer (minus the 30% tax deduction if they happen not to be a US citizen). Everyone else has gone back to work. One of the most enjoyable spectacles of the whole Powerball episode has not been the fantasy of winning the biggest jackpot in history, but the scene in every drugstore in my New York neighbourhood, some of which had lines out the door this afternoon, full of people squinting at lottery cards they were clearly filling in for the first time in their lives. Multidraw, Powerplay, Quick Pick or Personal Selection – who knew it was this hard? Worth it though. Choose the right numbers and life in a modern day Downton could be yours, servants – sorry, personal assistants – and all.</p>

Thanks to Twitter, the cycle of celebrities falling in and out of favour is as short as a single bad tweet and some of Gervais’s targets have been considered too soft recently. But on Sunday night, he <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3397952/Everything-fantastic-Mel-Gibson-insists-no-hard-feelings-roasted-Golden-Globes-host-Ricky-Gervais.html" title="">found a deserving victim</a>. Whatever a man’s faults, it’s hard for him to look bad when he’s standing next to Mel Gibson.</p>

The guardian and its Corbinista Cultural marxist followers like to portray the times of downton as all bad ''it wasn't '' for a start many of the gentry who owned these homes felt an obligation to the staff who had served them for many years, it wasn't all pack your bags and get out for over sleeping, often generations of families had worked for the same family .

Most of the US learned nothing from Downton Abbey with its laughable dialogue and amateur acting.

Marx got it wrong but then back then TV wasn't around otherwise surely it would take precedence over religion as the peoples opiate.Quite frankly I find it hard to respect people so willingly and easily affected by such blatant fictional manipulation at work in TV shows. No wonder there is no peace and progress is so painfully slow, until some TV show is concocted to educate the masses. No wonder the same loons keep getting elected by these great democracies... ha ha. Violence doesn't work lets prove it by bombing and killing, keep taking your opium.
