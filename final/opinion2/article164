The new battle of Hastings? Watch out for the flat white brigade

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he five stages of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/gentrification" title="">gentrification</a> are, as everyone knows: denial, anger, artisan coffee shops, acceptance and bankers.</p>

<p>There’s been much talk in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/feb/10/hastings-east-sussex-weekend-break" title="">Hastings</a>, where I live, about the effect of the DFLs – the Down from Londoners – and how they are transforming, potentially for the worse, one area of the town centre in particular.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/10/gentrification-not-urban-renaissance">Gentrification doesn't trickle down to help everyone | David Madden</a> </p>

<p>As a DFL, I’ve been thinking about how to be a good one. But I’m still not entirely sure. I’ve stopped obnoxiously referring to houses around the £400,000 mark as “cheap” to my new local friends, but I admit to being delighted about the chichi pizzeria, trendy wine shop and dapper barbers that opened last year. You will often find me at the derelict-building-turned-hipster-arts-space around the corner.</p>

<p>But I’ve been wondering how I’ll feel about the area in a few years’ time, when it’s all chalkboard signs with nice fonts, and the character and eccentricity – the diversity that comes from affordability – that I love about Hastings have been priced out.</p>

<p>Friday sees the launch of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rockhouse.org.uk/" title="">Rock House</a>, a 1960s office block in the same pocket of town that has been turned into nine floors of live-work space for local creative people and businesses, and which has – crucially – capped rents. “People think gentrification means the place gets nicer,” says Jess Steele, director of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.jerichoroad.co.uk/2015/09/whats-happening-to-hastings/" title="">Jericho Road</a>, one of three community development organisations that bought and renovated the building. “But gentrification is simply the replacement of low-income people with higher-income people.” They’ve already turned down requests for office space from lawyers and accountants, and relatively wealthy Hackney artists.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/12/gentrification-tottenham-property-horror-soto-noto">Gentrification in Tottenham? It’s a real property horror story | Emma Brockes</a> </p>

<p>Instead of accepting the inevitability of gentrification, or at least the downsides, Steele says, local people should be clubbing together and becoming developers themselves. Jericho Road launched a “crowdlending” scheme last year, whereby residents put in cash to buy buildings and land and keep it community-owned and permanently affordable. It may be too late for London, but it’s not for other areas of the country.</p>

<p>I ask Steele’s advice on how to be a good DFL, and she says the one good thing about us is – if we were lucky enough to sell a property in London – we often come with some capital and should think about investing in one of these community land trusts. I’m planning to chip in – but I need to hang on to some cash for the overpriced flat whites that are coming.</p>

What a snobby comment, Kent & Sussex are very nice parts of the U.K. That's why these Londoners are moving there, rather than moving to SNP/Labour areas.

UKIP were the 3rd largest party in the country in 2015 by votes cast in the GE & that was the case in Hastings were they came 3rd. Labour threw the kitchen sink at Hastings with Ed Miliband unveiling his Edstone there, yet they lost, the truth is UKIP/Tory votes outnumber Labour/Libdem votes in Hastings.

Still, in a stroke of chance it appears that the word gentrification was coined with reference to Islington, in 1964.

But Hasting should welcome the much needed vibrancy, diversity & cultural enrichment of Londoners emigrating there no? How is a rich Londoner (who can fund themselves) relocating to Hastings worse than a poor refugee (who can't fund themselves) doing the same?

When something becomes a THING, as you aptly call it,it can now be priced at up to £3 for something whose cost is less than 50p.This blight of "Marketing" is all pervading and for those who don't recognise it,probably costs them a quarter of their income.

Can I just calm everything down by saying don't lets get all our Nespresso's in a twist: a FLAT WHITE is just a coffee with milk (totally, like wot you'd make at home, without all that fancy Cafe Society frothing milk muck) only now it's become a THING and our Baristas feel too embarrassed to call it just a CUP OF COFFEE.(Sits back,laughs at the pointlessness of the whole article and wipes her frothy milk moustache onto her sleeve.) Come to enjoy the seaside and the DIFFERENCES it has from London and Brighton -but leave your 24hr caffeine demands behind! winks.

I applaud your brevity and eloquence ManAlianza.. However I rather feel the epithet "shithole" is a little too harsh on Hastings. If you've ever had the misfortune to spend a day in Newhaven you'll know what I mean. Hastings has the wonderful Jerwood, the funicular and those caves -in which I once had the myriad pleasures of what could best be described as a sapphic orgy!! -Have a lovely day.

It was used as a dumping ground for people that the social services did not have the resources to support, and their poverty is a symptom of the malaise.

The people moving from London to Hastings are economic migrants, they just happen to have more money than the natives in this case, which is perhaps the crux of this matter.In a poor Town with high unemployment and acute levels of social deprivation this is surely an opportunity? No, it's now a problem called gentrification. No wonder this Town has struggled over the years with this mindset!Commercial property values are super low in Hastings, and there's plenty of space available. DFL's welcome here.

It always amazes me these social artists and artisans who want to come alongside, befriend and help build the communities they have all been reading about in college, like some curious indigenous remote tribe in some backward country. These people are not part of community or the class they want to befriend and adore. And these romantics do quite the opposite.

Go for it. The Old Town needs an independent grocer, butchers, ironmongers, haberdashers.. What was I thinking. It had these, now they're just shops selling over priced junk as "antiques" and poxy coffee shops.

Said independent opticians has only moved up the road to Silbverhill and considering the two other independent optitions within five minutes walk are a Opticians/Persian Coffee bar and and opticians which describes itself as a seller of "luxuary handmade eyewhere" the status of opticians in St Leonards would not exactly contradict the gentrification picture being presented. Though dodgy eyesite of the poster above may explain why the poster above failed to notice the folllowing in their list of businesses in St Leonards:Pier 9, St Clements, Kino Teatr, Half Man Half Burger, Wine Shed, Graze on the Grand, Shop, Truffels, the St Leonard, Mama Putts, Whos Wearing What, Nuna Velenki, Bramwell Coal, Smiths Wholefood, Relax, Pheonix and Plum, Baker Mmanova, Wayward, Love Cafe, Lucy Bell, Mchelas cute cakes, Omega Studios, Halcyon, Project 78, Refine, Sideshow, The Kitchen Craftbox, Fleet Gallery, Burton Gallery, Tilt, Xanadu, Little Larder, The oak and its sourdough, Bobo, Craftiviss, Grays Emporium, Pearl and Queenie, Seaside Charlie, Objekt, Arts Forum, Admiral Benbow, Pomflys, St Leonards Central, Pizzerelli, Lakshi, Rusannas specialty store, boutique hotels and B+Bs like Zanibar, Cloudlsey, Hastings House and St Benedicts

Don't be an idiot. People leave London because housing is so expensive and if you want a family home to accommodate a family then moving out is about the only option. Once people begin having kids and are unable to go out quite as much then the benefits of living in London suddenly decrease a bit and the attraction of moving further out to have a bigger living space increase. It's not rocket science.

Oh God...another journo who has relocated to Hastings and is now having an existential crisis over how to be a "good" incomer/"DFL" and a belated bout of guilt about how she might be adding to the "gentrification" of the town.
