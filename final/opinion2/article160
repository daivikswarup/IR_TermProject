<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he main character in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/anomalisa">Anomalisa</a>, a brilliant new movie out this week, is a heavily depressed customer service guru spending the night in Cincinnati. He rings down for room service at his hotel, requests a salad starter and salmon main course, and then listens as the person on the line reads the order back to him in excruciating detail (“Good, sir. So that’s a bibb lettuce, gorgonzola, prosciutto and walnut salad with honey raspberry vinaigrette dressing and a wild-caught Copper river Alaska salmon with the baby asparagus and black truffle broth”).</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/26/cold-call-nuisance-phone-calls">Behind every cold call is a person hating their life | Kate Solomon</a> </p>

<p>Our sympathies are with the hero, as he endures. Those of the writer, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/charlie-kaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a>, are more complicated. In the 1980s, he was employed fielding calls about missing newspapers in Minneapolis. This meant he was on the receiving end of our widespread assumption that when it comes to service industry employees – especially those we can’t see – normal rules of engagement do not apply. These people are not human, but messengers dispatched for our shooting pleasure. Sponges, hungry for all the anger we can spit at them. Of course they can take it! After all, who wouldn’t want to work in a call centre, with that huge salary and secure contract and all those amazing perks?</p>

<p>Kaufman’s plan, after Anomalisa, had been to make a movie from the point of view of the guy reciting the order down the phone, or similar. Yet he can’t, because although Anomalisa is one of the best reviewed movies of last year, almost no one in America went to see it. Nearly 6,000 ponied up to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anomalisa/charlie-kaufmans-anomalisa">fund the film on Kickstarter</a>, but that package included a DVD. So even those most heavily invested may have failed to visit the cinema. Some things really are worth your cash – and I say this as a former telesales agent. So when Anomalisa is out in the UK this week, let’s be better customers. And the next time some poor sod cold calls you, just try to be better.</p>

<p><strong> <br/></strong></p>

<p>It’s hard to find out anything about Ray Tomlinson’s miniature sheep – the sweetest detail in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/07/ray-tomlinson-email-inventor-and-selector-of-symbol-dies-aged-74">the obituaries</a> of the man who created email. Having made quite a mark in the world of computer science, Tomlinson retired to Massachusetts where he bred dinky breeds using the frozen sperm of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouessant_sheep">Ouessant rams</a> . This is an outfit you’d expect to have one snazzy website. But no: turns out Tomlinson pretty much quit the internet.</p>

<p>His legacy for the rest of us is rather different, for we live now in an epistolary universe; our working lives largely conducted through correspondence. And though you don’t see people chugging down copies of Clarissa when they can’t get wifi, awareness of the form has been heightened. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/">Letters of Note</a>, the blog that republishes snippy missives, is now both a stage show <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Letters-Note-Correspondence-Deserving-Audience/dp/1782112235">and a paperback</a> translated into 16 languages.</p>

<p><strong> <br/></strong></p>

<p>Cycling alongside a river on Sunday, I heard Elvis and saw a big quiff emerge from the earth. Not a second coming, but a man digging a well while listening to the greatest hits. He’d got about nine feet deep, hadn’t hit water yet, still looked ecstatic. In the new film <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/17/couple-in-a-hole-review-scots-go-feral-in-france-in-poignant-wilderness-drama">Couple in a Hole</a>, a grieving couple seek sanctuary by burrowing below ground in France; in Geoffrey Household’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/15/robert-macfarlane-household-rogue-male">Rogue Male</a>, a spy on the run does the same. It’s the primal nature of such hunkering that makes super-basements seem so upsetting. They involve JCBs and cranes, not hands and spades, hollowing out the ground for luxuries, not basics. In <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/23/worm-fell-into-mouth-my-life-as-a-badger">Being a Beast</a>, Charles Foster’s account of living like a badger, he comes to love his sett. “It was OK to lie in the dark,” he writes, “surrounded by the scratching and humming and thrashing of animals that would one day eat me”. We will all return to the earth. We might as well get accustomed.</p>

There is something called TPS (Telephone Preference Service) in this country: if you register with them, no cold-callers can ring you - & companies can actually be fined for breaching this. (There are a few exceptions though, such as research surveys - which are excluded from TPS blocking on the grounds that it would 'skew the results' of their demographic sample...). But definitely worth doing though.

Fair enough. I suppose it didn't help that my time working in a call centre was for an absolutely useless mobile phone company that would regularly fuck up and leave its customers in the lurch. As the first port of call, we were often the cannon fodder for angry customers.

A few years ago I used to wind up cold callers as a revenge for them bothering me, but now I don't do it as it's not the fault of the actual person on the other end of the line.

I've done cold calling, which is a vile job. I've worked with incoming calls, which was a bit better. I don't randomly abuse people down the phone, and I'm all too aware of the constraints they're working with. However:



Author::::chalkandcheese

I didn't know cold callers sent texts! No way in the world 99.9% of people are going to call back those fuckers. Fair enough, I forgot the others from the phone companies and the bank. Yeah, I've worked nights before so understand the annoyance of getting to sleep when the rest of the world is going about its daily business.

Well, I can't tell you what to think, I can tell you that, firstly I said nothing about shouting and secondly, that person who pulls the trigger is not blameless. They made what was probably a difficult choice. I can understand that, but it doesn't make them blameless, anymore that someone who knifes me while drunk is blamess. That isn't how the world works.

Sometimes if it's a cold miserable day and I'm bored (I'm 74, so not often bored!) I have fun with cold callers. I'v got a selection of answers I use. The one about "our records show that you worked in a noisy environment" elicits the reply-"Yes, I ws an undertaker". Sometimes they ask to speak to me by name, but obviously haven't got a clue how to pronounce it, so I tell them "this is her secretry, can I take a message?". I got one poor little subcontinent guy going for ages--especially when he queried there being a secretary at a private address, to which I asked "doesn't your mothee have a secratary?" My best one is the dodgy computer fixer, I let him get as far as asking for my password, then tell him it's "B****r off!" Childish I now, but passes the time!

I did inbound in my youth and I must say I found it to be the most relaxing job I ever had.I had 44 different programs on the computer and, in the course of answering calls and capturing information, we had to stuff countless fulfillment envelopes for one of the investment firm clients.It was like solving a complex puzzle and I managed to be completely zen about it. Time just flew.

the alternative is to politely decline and wish them good day. If they persist after a firm but polite refusal, then you're at liberty to hang up or be mildly annoyed, whilst at the same time respecting that all labour is honourable.

I once did cold calling for The Daily Express (or a subcontractor). We were trying to sell Express subscriptions to OAPs in Yorkshire (from a London office). One time I got a lady who had recently lost most of her sight, so informed me she was not really interested in a newspaper subscription. She was however hoping to catch a glimpse of a few blooms in her garden, as she was pretty sure that was going to be her last winter/spring. So I listened and cooed as she chatted about her garden for about 10 minutes. Catherine Shoard is right. Cold callers do have feelings! They let me go at the end of the week. As everyone who does the job is aware, your calls are monitored.

Cold callers most certainly do send texts relating to my "recent accident" or insurance mis-selling and I quite often get sent routine texts showing things like my recent bank transactions or sales promotions from companies that I deal with regularly along with reminders about forthcoming dental appointments etc. When the phone is switched off, such texts are never annoying.

Just how many people bother answering the phone, I use mine to make calls and tell people that I never answer the phone so if its urgent send an SMS. The landline phone is just there for LadyM to use chatting to her coterie of chums.
