So Tina Fey’s playing Afghanistan for laughs. Good luck with that

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">J</span></span>ournalists loved the movie <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/spotlight" title="">Spotlight</a> because, rarely for Hollywood, it cast them as heroes rather than shady, two-timing, craven alcoholics or, in the case of female reporters, scheming narcissists – Rita Skeeter from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter" title="">Harry Potter</a> or Kate Mara’s character from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards" title="">House of Cards</a>, sleeping with her source – without compromising their essential shabbiness.</p>

<p>On the heels of Rachel McAdams winning an Oscar nomination for her role in Spotlight comes another film featuring the female journalist as hero, this one based on Kim Barker’s memoir of being a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. (It’s a sign of the times that the Tribune no longer has any foreign staff - not a single correspondent - and Barker has long since moved on, first to ProPublica, then to the New York Times).</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/books/the-taliban-shuffle-by-kim-barker-review.html?_r=0" title="">The Taliban Shuffle</a> was first published in 2011, and is terrific, funny, insightful and races along. It eschews the reportorial tone for something more informal and hilarious without sacrificing any of its authority. Barker, who was south-east Asia bureau chief for the paper for five years, describes Afghanistan as “a fragile and corrupt country stuck somewhere between the seventh century and Vegas”; Hamid Karzai as “whiny and conflicted, a combination of Woody Allen, Chicken Little and Jimmy Carter”; and foreign visitors to the country as squandering local goodwill by, for instance, throwing fancy dress parties themed around “tarts and talibs”. She also shrewdly documents what happened in Afghanistan when the US shifted focus to Iraq, and offers a corrective to the earnestness and propaganda of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/homeland" title="">Homeland</a>.</p>

<p>How much of this will make it through to the movie, in which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tina-fey" title="">Tina Fey</a> plays Barker, remains to be seen. Fey is brilliant, but she has a dicey track record with movies, and on the evidence of the trailer she is playing it mainly for laughs – Liz Lemon in a war zone. The film, titled Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, has a romance written into it. It co-stars Billy Bob Thornton as a US army officer and, in what looks like a disastrous piece of casting, Alfred Molina as an Afghan official.</p>

<p>Barker has said she is OK with the changes and likes the film, although before seeing it was silently pleading, as many more of us will: “Please don’t let this be <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101940/anchorman" title="">Anchorman</a> set in Afghanistan.”</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>I thought Spotlight was overrated. It’s a good movie, but it’s not <em>that</em> good a movie. It goes on too long and occasionally feels a little made-for-TV. I preferred another of this year’s big Oscar films, Spielberg’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/bridge-of-spies" title="">Bridge of Spies</a>, in spite of the small but loud contingent of people on the internet who think Tom Hanks can’t act. I’m not one of them, but even if I were, he has that combination of extreme fame and buffed affability that makes one simply grateful he isn’t a Scientologist.</p>

<p>The best thing about Bridge of Spies was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-rylance" title="">Mark Rylance</a> as the Russian spy. You don’t see him on the big screen very often, and he is almost embarrassingly good, espousing a form of ultra-realism that requires an extraordinary level of artfulness to carry off. Any more realistic and he would appear, in a bad way, not to be acting at all. During the course of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://observer.com/2016/02/mark-rylance-actors-actor-comes-to-brooklyn-for-nice-fish/" title="">an interview with the New York Observer</a>, Rylance talked about the Bridge of Spies’ script – and specifically, how the Coen brothers edited it.</p>

<p>“It was,” he said, “like going to a great masseur or a chiropractor and they just kind of aligned a few things. Did a few clicks, and then just massaged the blood into all the parts of it and then kind of exfoliated a few bits that you realised weren’t actually necessary.” It’s the kind of nerdy talk that, to a writer, makes an actor as heroic as it gets.</p>

You are seriously citing a character from a chidrens film as an example of the portrayal of journalists?

You're right Eustacius, it's shame we're "attacking" the beautiful Pashtun culture. The same one that sexually glorifies and exploits little boys and women are ostensibly brood mares from their teen years until menopause. I'm not nearly ethnocentric enough or "America World Police" enough to give these as valid reasons for an occupation, but let's not cloud the issue of Pashtun culture with your ignorance. In my first hand experience, we are actually too accommodating of their molestation of young boys. Secondly, the mineral deposits are mostly being exploited by the Chinese as we speak, so well done on that one. I believe we should stay out of the ME, but the invasion has led to young girls attending schools, and that above all, has the ability to initiate cultural change in a despotic land.

The Taliban has always said that growing opium is anti-Islam, and the first thing they do when they move into a region is destroy the opium crops. Remember, the Taliban are religious zealots, and that takes priority over any mundane mercenary concerns. And Afghanistan has had its share of problems with the opiates.

As a survivor of child sexual abuse, i still find that figure to be excessive.I do not, however, have access to reliable numbers, but do find the 4-5% number very high, especially since it is not separated by the sex of the abuser.

I think the idea is that he's not Middle Eastern. I'm thinking it's a valid point. There's got to be some guys who have some Middle Eastern descent in them that could have done that role. Assiv Mandvi comes to mind. I think his family is from India, but that's closer than Molina. Ahmed Ahmed is from Egypt. There's that other guy from Egypt that they called the Jon Stewart of Egypt. He hasn't done movies, but he's got the right mix of comedy in the face of tragedy. Can't think of anyone else. Who else is there?

I think the point is that she doesn't like Tina Fey. Or maybe that you can do a movie review just from watching the trailer. Or don't laugh about Afghanistan. Something.

In a world where Trump will likely be a presidential candidate if not actually president, nothing is really all that surprising (i.e., horrifying) anymore. Humor, if done well (and, that is key because it seems pretty rare) can be quite effective in what is serious storyline. IF done well....
