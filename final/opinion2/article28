Detaining women refugees is imprisonment, plain and simple




DateTime::::2016-03-09T16:30:00+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">F</span></span>reedom should be enjoyed by all. This is a comforting and simple enough idea that we like to take as a given. We sometimes qualify it by adding “except of course those who break the law”, but those are the usual parameters.</p>

<p>Assuming the judicial process is fair, most of us vaguely understand that when a crime is committed, the (potential) criminal may be charged, judged as deserving of punishment and, finally, punished. This is what we call due process. Countries that lack due process are viewed as functioning outside the “civilised” world – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/david-cameron-brilliant-uk-arms-exports-saudi-arabia-bae" title="">unless we’re desperate to sell them arms</a>. They are, we like to think, invariably led by corrupt, totalitarian dictators. It’s not, crucially, how we like to see ourselves.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the United Kingdom in 2016, this does happen. People seeking asylum are regularly detained indefinitely, without a charge or trial. Their crime, presumably, is daring to seek asylum in the first place. Doesn’t this have a whiff of the feudal about it? Distinguishing one particular group – one of the most vulnerable – as criminal for simply being in the UK is, yes, draconian. It gets worse when we remember that these are people fleeing conflict and persecution.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">It’s chilling to think that as a nation we are comfortable with dehumanising treatment like this</p>

<p>Yesterday the campaign charity <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.refugeewomen.co.uk" title="">Women for Refugee Women </a>launched an action outside the Home Office to mark International Women’s Day. As part of the #SetHerFree campaign, the charity delivered 99 signed postcards from women – I was one of them – with messages in support of refugee women. The number 99 represents the number of pregnant women held in detention centres in 2014. A woman flees persecution, manages to survive the dangers inherent in crossing borders, reaches the UK and is summarily locked up. It’s chilling to think that as a nation we are comfortable with dehumanising treatment like this.</p>

<p>This coming Saturday, another campaign group, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://m.facebook.com/movementforjustice" title="">Movement for Justice</a>, led by women who have themselves been detained, will hold <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://m.facebook.com/events/1084119398266917?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A98%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D&amp;aref=98" title="">an action outside Yarl’s Wood detention centre</a>. They will be standing in solidarity with women on the other side of the perimeter fence, who are behind windows that open just enough to allow small arms to wave makeshift flags fashioned out of scraps of material. All that matters is that the woman locked within will be able to communicate to people who agree with her that her detention is really imprisonment by any other name and is wrong.</p>

<p>They will be protesting the fact that a third of women seeking asylum will be detained as a matter of course. 43% of those will be held for more than a month and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.refugeewomen.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WRW_IamHuman_report-for-web.pdf" title="">some for as long as a year</a>. Keeping a woman in a detention centre for a year costs more than £37,000. Given that less than a third of the women who are detained are then deported, the process seems indifferent to efficiency. There are cheaper, community-based alternatives to detention that do not criminalise the individual and rob them of their dignity.</p>

<p>Last September I wrote about <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/07/dehumanising-refugees-migrants-aylan-kurdi" title="">the national outpouring of sympathy triggered by the death of Alan Kurdi</a>, the three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea. It seemed then that the image of his little body on that beach would shift public opinion, making it more sympathetic to what we had been reluctant to call a “refugee crisis” (the word “migrant” doesn’t have quite the same emotional tug).</p>

<p>After a summer of witnessing the perilous journey refugees were forced to make in order to seek asylum, the hope had been that, collectively, we would push our government to rethink its policies. This shift was also to be reflected in transforming our treatment of the asylum seekers who are currently within UK borders.</p>

<p>Six months on, and with the EU referendum looming, the public debate has reverted back to discussing asylum seekers within the framework of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/09/is-britain-full-home-truths-about-population-panic" title="">the country being “full”</a>. Last month David Cameron warned that Brexit could result in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12145781/David-Cameron-warns-of-migrant-camps-in-southern-England-if-Brexit-vote.html" title="">Britain facing an “influx of 50,000 asylum seekers”</a>. This is a low blow from a desperate campaign willing to invoke the language of swarms and imminent danger in order to bolster its arguments. It is, too, recognition that the ratcheting up of anti-immigration sentiment by Ukip, our popular press and the Tories themselves over the last decade has left many seeing Brexit as the best possible chance of securing our borders. The dominant discussion is that we are already too full and, once again, EU migrants, refugees and asylum seekers have become indistinguishable.</p>

<p>My message to the Home Office yesterday was, “seeking asylum isn’t an offence”. Yet the fact that yesterday’s action was centred around pregnant refugee women shows that the act of seeking asylum is generally viewed as being criminal. It is inhumane to lock up any asylum seeker, but the pragmatic approach has been to focus on the most disadvantaged, to shame our government into recognising the plight of women who are victims of torture, sexual violence and those that are pregnant. These groups tug at our heart strings and are more likely to move us to outrage. But why should we need such stark examples to recognise the injustice?</p>

<p>Rather than continue to mete out brutalising policies, policymakers should be looking at how we can help refugee women gain a foothold in our society. The default position needs to change from seeing these women as liars and frauds before all else. Despite the fear and violence that has forced them here, their sense of hope has carried them across borders in the most dangerous of conditions. We should be celebrating their bravery and tenacity.</p>

An inner city Educational psychologist liaising with Soc Serv, which included fortnightly meetings to discuss the boroughs children likely to be accommodated. Many of these children were unaccompanied 'minors' who had arrived without passports, or pitched up in the town in lorries and 'happened' to bump into an 'uncle' and get taken to a local mosque. Obviously if they could convince the Borough they were under 16 they were entitled to accommodation until they were 21. The Borough developed dentistry and bone marrow testing after many phone calls from childrens' homes saying 'He can't stay here he's at least 25'. There were also 'abandoned minors' usually when the parents 'right to remain' was finally refused. the staff would report the children were in daily mobile phone contact with the parents (who had apparently abandoned them) on their mobile phones. One lad of 13 yrs had been told his parents had been killed on their way to the airport when they left their country. He had received victim trauma support counselling for a couple of years since his arrival in the country by himself, he later found out they weren't dead at all but were waiting until he got established before hoping to join him. Another was told at the airport by his Mother 'Go get on the plane and get yourself an education'. He had thought they were going on holiday and had no idea she wasn't coming with him. he was 11 yrs old.

I would also like you to explain why again a reporter brings up Alan kurdi and fails to add that poor innocent child's body was moved so reporters could get a better story and photos I find that inexcusable as a parent that that could happen just to gain sympathy that didn't tug at my heart strings I found it disgusting to move a body and treat it so disgracefully you should be ashamed .

I'm sure they love putting their lives at risk every day and getting CS gassed. France won't give them asylum, so they're very desparate. No, not all of them are 100% asylum seekers, but to have walked hundreds of miles and sailed on dangerous boats from war zones suggests the majority are genuine.

Legitimate asylum claims can be made in the first safe country anyone fearing persecution goes to. It doesn't have to be the UK? You cannot pick and choose which country you would like to claim asylum in?

I'm certainly not being dishonest but reacting honestly to what anyone should surely admit is an appalling situation. These people are being detained, they have, in general, neither been convicted of criminal offences nor are they awaiting trial for any and, therefore, they are being held in detention without trial. You can argue that this is justified under the circumstances - many people do - but it doesn't change the nature of their incarceration. They are being held indefinitely in that, general targets notwithstanding, the have no way to know how long their case will take to process. If they have entered the country illegally it is often simply due to the case that, having fled from a war zone, they have been unable to retain the kind of paperwork which would make processing simpler. The same was true of many Jewish people fleeing the Nazis.

I would suspect that those detained are suspected of forgery or deception, burning their passports so they cannot be deported etc. in other words, the kind of criminals we do not want in our country. (there are enough criminals here already) .

Only those suspected of intentionally deceiving the authorities are locked away, those who have tried using forged documents etc. Women have wanted equal rights. that means being treated the same as men, being a woman surely, in this manner, should not mean they are treated preferably but equally?

The number of asylum seekers who are detained is a small percentage of those applying for asylum. They are detained because their claim has failed, or because they are awaiting deportation, or because their claim is unlikely to succeed. If you know your claim is hopeless you would be likely to abscond as you have nothing to lose.



Author::::VerneWells
DateTime::::2016-03-10T11:49:12Z
An asylum seeker is someone who applies for asylum - anyone from outside the UK can do this. When their claim fails they are a failed asylum seeker and subject to detention and deportation. An economic migrant can be an asylum seeker, as can anyone.

They are mostly failed asylum seekers awaiting deportation or those at risk of absconding. They are here illegally. What do you think happens when they are allowed to live in the community? They often abscond because they have nothing to lose. They are detained not imprisoned. Have you ever been to a prison? It's nothing like Yarl's Wood.



Author::::VerneWells
DateTime::::2016-03-10T11:42:49Z
The number of asylum seekers who are detained are often failed asylum seekers awaiting deportation or those at high risk of absconding. Those detained represent a small minority of the number who have applied for asylum. Average detention time in Yarl's Wood in 2014 was 50 days. I honesty don't see a lot to outraged about.

Do you believe there are any circumstances in which any asylum seeker, illegal immigrant, or visa overstayer should be detained? Do you believe there should be border and visa control for entry to the UK or that anyone should have the freedom to travel anywhere? I would be grateful if you could state your position on open borders, as I get the impression that many articles about asylum or Calais are actually written by those who believe in open borders under the guise of concern about a specific issue. It would helpful if you could clarify your position.

How about not lock em up? But then you end up with people starving on vouchers cos they have no recourse to public funds while the Kafkaesque world of the Border Agency wends its slow way. I once asked an immigration lawyer if the Border Agency were really evil or just unbelievably incompetent. "A bit of both" was her reply.
