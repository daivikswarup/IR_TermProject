The awards show masterclass – how to keep A-listers in their place




DateTime::::2016-02-09T19:56:43+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">H</span></span>ow are you spending Valentine’s night? Up the Shard? Down the pub? On a mini-break? This year, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/baftas" title="">the Baftas</a> happening, I shall be spending it in the office with four frayed colleagues and a magnum of coffee. I will also, of course, if you squint optimistically and think four-dimensionally, be in the company of many of Hollywood’s most desirable stars. Hanks! Blanchett! DiCaprio! Winslet!</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/09/oscars-swagbag-celebrity-products-nominees">How to crash the Oscars’ swag bag and get your goodies into celebs’ hands | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p>

<p>But of course there is really only one person I will be spending Sunday night with: Stephen Fry. For it is absolutely, categorically the host of an award show who is the key figure, the defining presence, the real star. Forget the winner. Forget the person who trips or weeps or dedicates it to diversity. It’s all about the frontman.</p>

<p>Remember the Oscars a couple of years ago? Surprisingly tough, isn’t it. OK: remember how Ellen Degeneres <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/mar/03/oscars-2014-ellen-degeneres-best-selfies" title="">ordered pizza and took a selfie</a>? There you go! Now: remember any moment from the Golden Globes over the past decade <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2013/jan/14/jodie-foster-golden-globes-video" title="">that wasn’t Jodie Foster coming out</a>? No? What about <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jan/13/golden-globes-tina-fey-amy-poehler-opening-speech-video" title="">Tina Fey and Amy Poehler calling Gravity</a> “the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age”? Bingo! Now you have it.</p>

<p>Parties are about invisible hosting; schmoozing around the room with an open bottle; awards are about publicly cackling at your guests, then pushing them out of the door with a slap: off-message is the new obsequious, something Fry doesn’t seem to have appreciated. How far you can push the envelope is the new competition.</p>

<p>Both are most easily realised when the ceremony isn’t televised. The host can cock more of a snook; the organisers aren’t so concerned about walkouts or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Check-Out-Tommy-Lee-Jones-Angry-Face-Golden-Globes-51377.html" title="">Tommy Lee Jones-style hatchet-face</a>. Such liberty was demonstrated last Sunday night when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/oscars-race-evening-standard-film-awards" title="">Simon Amstell triumphed at the Evening Standard Film Awards</a> by being – if not rude, exactly – then brilliantly withering. “Remember,” he advised his guests at the start, “if you do win tonight, it will feel great, but it will never heal your childhood wound. There will be a short-term high followed a few years later by panic that you will never win anything again. Because you’re a fake. And if you don’t win tonight, don’t be too upset. Win or lose, in the end, we all die. You win an award; you die. You buy a boat; you die. You’re having a baby; you’re both dying. So let’s get on with the show.”</p>

<p>Monday sickies are traditional when Valentine’s falls on a Sunday. People need to sleep in, to recover from the romance and the happiness, the screaming rows and crushed dreams. They require time to sleep off the exhaustion, to pack their bags and consult the divorce lawyers. Employers will therefore be blanching at the news that this year <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3438119/For-Valentine-25p-oysters-Morrisons-starts-offering-luxury-seafood-discount-rate-tempt-shoppers-buy-romantic-dinners.html" title="">Morrisons has a special Valentine’s offer on oysters</a> – 25p a pop. Their rationale is that price is the reason most frequently cited for never having tried them. But everyone knows this is a lie. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.tesco.com/groceries/product/details/?id=258079160" title="">Tesco has long sold them for 50p</a>, less than a Twix. The real reason, of course, is the mortal fear of food poisoning. Are people truly too frightened to just fess up? Are we happier to blame thriftiness over the desire not to be sick? If so, come Sunday, all round the country oyster virgins will be merrily necking a dozen on the in-for-a-penny principle. Monday 15 February just got a whole heap messier.</p>

<p>I am saving up seeing the BBC’s must-see War and Peace serial for 2050, as a retirement treat. In the meantime, I’ve gone back 34 years and caught up on <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086667/reference" title="">The Barchester Chronicles</a>, their must-see series from 1982. Hot off the presses: it’s terrific. Nigel Hawthorne <em>and</em> Donald Pleasance <em>and</em> Alan Rickman <em>and</em> Geraldine McEwan, none of them dialling it down. Long scenes about liturgy. Abrupt time leaps between episodes so shocking you think you’ve missed a disk. Who needs nudity when you have Hawthorne hissing in a cassock?</p>

Above all else, from any decade, Patrick McGouhans "The Prisoner". In second place comes Bilko.

I missed the other article, just looked it up. What this girl knows about horses could hardly cover a postage stamp, yet, I assume, someone paid her to write about them!Funny old world.

The food poisoning is an afterthought, the bigger hurdle is knocking back something resembling another persons salty bleb of hockle...in the name of what? romance?Lately much anything literary the TV proudly trumpets these days is better replaced by the 70s/80s version of the same im saying.Cinema too, the tiresomely pretty and witlessly bowdlerised 2 hour cinema release Testament of Youth was happily ignored in favour of the 275 minute BBC version starring Cheryl Campbell for example, altogether chewier. So im off to gawp at the Hopkins 72 War 'n' Peace, im sure its fine and good.

Couldn't we have had Frankie Dettori or Clare Balding write on this subject?

Hmmm. This would be the 'film critic' who suggested that Dirty Grandpa was anything other than appalling, yes?

No one above a certain age wants to spend too much time with people their own age. They look across the table and see nothing but death. Or how much the world they grew up in and finally got to understand has just been sucked down the plug hole. Old people are desperate to stay in the now, which they may do, in the clueless, optimistic, naive presence of those whothink that their own demise has been posted on a train that will never arrive.

I'm looking at Catherine's face and seeing shame, contrition, confusion, fear and a desperate hope that no-one's going to mention the 'Carnage Horse Incident'. Anyone else?

That was the selling plate at Haydock and we were hoping for the full Champion Hurdle. No horses were exploited in the writing of this column.

Bah. That was boringly competent, I enjoyed it. I can only assume the hallucinogenics have worn off. Neck a load of acid please, Catherine, then write more delightfully mad things about horses. PS Simon Amstell is great, isn't he.

omgggg, new Catherine Shoard article. I have high hopes for this, knowing it can't possibly match up to the towering majesty of the last one, but nevertheless, breath quickening, expectant.
