'I cried at night when I realised I had an older dad': readers on pensioner parents




DateTime::::2016-03-01T14:13:31+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>nce upon a time, getting married and starting a family in your 20s was the norm, but these days people are choosing to have children much later in life – especially men. (The number of men having children over 50 has risen <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article4699751.ece">by almost two-thirds</a> in the past 16 years, according to the Office for National Statistics.)</p>

<p>This means the number of teenagers with fathers collecting their pensions will shoot up. But what’s it like to be a pensioner with young children? Or indeed to grow up as the child of a much older parent? We asked our readers to share their experiences.</p>

<p><em>Kate is 28 now and her dad was 58 when she was born</em></p>

<p> I was the youngest child of his second marriage with my mum, who was much younger. Despite his age and being from a totally different generation, he was very contemporary in his views and very worldly wise. I miss my consultations with him dearly.</p>

<p>My dad never had great health and for as long as I can remember I have always expected him to die. He had breathing problems from working in smoky clubs and developed cancer in later life. I never remember getting annoyed that he was unable to go on rollercoasters or go swimming with me when I was younger but I do remember getting frustrated as he got older (I was in my early 20s) and became forgetful and repeated himself – all of which I now feel immense guilt for.</p>

<p>I called ambulances and attended him in hospital countless times and he fought a tough battle. It was hard to lose a parent when I was young, although I think it’s difficult whatever age you are. He went three years ago next month. I say “went” because I think he’d had enough. He signed his “do not resuscitate” order, I have a lot of respect for that. Because I’d spent my entire life anticipating his death I coped well. I remember getting the call to go to the hospital and seemingly taking it all in my stride. But that isn’t to say I didn’t hurt. I still do.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/09/me-and-my-old-man-growing-up-with-an-elderly-parent">Me and my old man: growing up with an elderly parent</a> </p>

<p><em>Vicky is 17 and her father was 49 when she was born. Her mother was 28</em></p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">I felt shocked when I realised my dad wasn’t as young as other people's ... I would cry at night.</p>

<p>Growing up I thought my dad was pretty young, he has aged really well and until I was about 12 I believed he was in his early 30s. I felt really shocked when I realised he wasn’t as young as the other dads. For a few months directly after I would cry at night because I thought he was going to die soon.</p>

<p>But, despite the fact he’s older, he still acts like a child sometimes, and I don’t think age has made much difference. I suppose the generation gap means our values and beliefs can differ (it took a while explaining the LGBTQ+ acronym) which can cause tension and confusion, but a happy medium can always be reached. It’s pretty fascinating hearing him talk about the first vinyls he bought and the deceased celebrities he saw play live too.</p>

<p>Growing up I’d say we did more things together than the average family. With age comes financial security which is a huge benefit. He retired a year after I was born, and my mum works part-time so I was lucky enough to go skiing several times and to visit places like Egypt and China. How many teenagers can say they’ve done that with both their parents? </p>

<p><em>Silvette is now 49 and she had her son when she was 44</em></p>

<p>I don’t think my age does, or will affect my relationship with my child. Being an older mother does have its disadvantages: for example, sometimes I get tired more quickly and I worry about how many years there are ahead. Sometimes I even worry whether I as an elderly person, and he as a teenager, will be able to understand and live well with each other. Nevertheless, I don’t allow such disadvantages to overcome the desire to provide as much love and attention as possible to John. </p>

<p>I am more attached to the positives, which include that it keeps me young. Also, maturity has given me the understanding that my child’s needs must always come first. I no longer think as I did when I was younger and still travelling or exploring the world. I am finding motherhood a lovely and unique experience. It’s not only because I am a mature mother, or that it has happened only in my 40s, but also because I have never had to experience such an amount of love for someone at same time as the fear of losing him. <br/></p>

<p><em>Aged 30, with a father who had them at 56 (their mother was 32)</em></p>

<p>Having an older parent does give you a unique perspective on history, and an early lesson in mortality and compassion as you see your aunts and uncles, your dad’s cousins and friends at the end of their lives (I’ve attended far, far more funerals than weddings in my lifetime, and medical frailty doesn’t freak me out at all). I feel horrible about even thinking that. </p>

<p>But now having one elderly parent, and loving them and supporting them, is coming awfully close to costing me my own family and career. I tell myself, you are the “sandwich” generation with your career, spouse, school-aged kids and elderly parents, and you should quit your idiotic complaining: you have it all. That is my perspective. I love my mum and dad, but I do not think that becoming a parent in your 40s or 50s should be undertaken lightly or without significant planning and realistic forethought.</p>

<p><em>Phil is now 62 years old and had his son at 51</em></p>

<p>My first wife had died after some years and that’s when I met Daniel’s mother, and we got married. We also decided that we would like to have a child, only the one. My wife was 41 when Daniel was born and I was 51.</p>

<p>My son is now 11 and he is my best mate. He was born in Spain but he is very proud that his dad is English and he always describes himself as Spanglish. He speaks English with a Scouse accent, like me, and when we visit England he mixes seamlessly with other English kids. </p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">I can’t really remember now a time when my son was not in my life and he never ceases to amaze me</p>

<p>I was already retired when Daniel was born and as I am an “amo de casa” (house husband) I have lots of time to spend with him and we do lots of things together. I don’t think I would have had the patience when I was younger, although he was my first and only child. The downside, of course, is that he will not have me as long as I have had my parents who are both still alive. So we try to do as much as we can now while I still can. Last summer, for example, I accompanied him on all the water slides at Siam Park in Tenerife and, believe me, I’m still suffering.</p>

<p>I can’t really remember now a time when my son was not in my life and he never ceases to amaze me. He is the love of my life. I never worried about having a child later in life, since now I have more patience and more time to spend with him.</p>

<p><em>Aged 63 and had their first child at 52</em></p>

<p>My daughter, now 10, is very aware that I am as old or older than her friends’ grandparents. She also occasionally gets upset at the thought of my dying before she reaches adulthood. On the other hand, there’s a connection between us that I don’t think would have been possible if I were 20 or 30 years younger. It’s hard to define but it’s an easy, joking friendship that I don’t think I would have been able to nurture had I not had the perspective of my years. The disadvantage is mainly that I probably won’t know my daughter in her middle age. I’d love to see how she turns out but that probably won’t be the case.</p>

It's too complicated and expensive to get detailed planning permission for a single plot. What we need is to designate a couple of million plots of sizes between 1/10th of an acre and 5 acres within which no reasonable application for planning permission for a residential dwelling can be refused.

You probably wouldn't have any choice. It's insidious. If your children are still living with you it starts with just a helping hand (popping to the shops, hanging out the washing), then the tasks get more personal and onerous. If they are still there when you need more intensive help, their presence will obviate, or at best minimise, what you are offered. If there's a choice between staying in bed and wetting it, and being assisted up and going to the lavatory, you will, I assure you, choose the latter.

I agree with what you say and the wiki page too. I exaggerate to make a point, that the lawful father and the biological father are quite likely not to be one and the same person, in 'fathers' over the age of about 45-50, any more than women over the age of 45-50.

Over the last century, technology has extended expected lifespan a great deal for westerners. That will continue. Technology has also extended the fertility window of women. That will continue too. So having children at an older age will become more common, not less. I think the more thorny problem for us to get our heads around will be the inevitable increase in intergenerational relationships - even though they won't be as salient as they are now.

Selfish parents with selfish children.The best you can do is enjoy each other while you still can. Occasionally think of people with no parents, and cease criticising teenage mothers.

1) Ask anyone who has dealt with a parent with dementia of any age: spouses are usually deeply in denial about the situation (at times, and depending on the type of dementia, the spouse seems less aware of the situation than the dementia-affected person). So, it usually falls to a child, sibling, friend, or co-worker to broach the subject and negotiate the early stages at the very least. The second part: it *is* related to her age, and that of any couple with a significant age difference--they've already demonstrated unusual social judgement in selecting their spouse. Both of my parents (and many unusual couples) are romantics, and idealists. Not helpful when dealing with the bald practicalities and frailties of ageing.

I do have a lot of sympathy for the plight of younger adults in the current uncaring climate, but I have read this thread with some amazement. Sure, it isn’t fun to be in your twenties and thirties and having to concern yourself with aging parents. But it isn’t exactly new, or a major trauma. It was fairly unusual, in the past, to have your first baby in your late thirties or forties, as is now more common. But it wasn’t that unusual to have your last baby at that age. Another big difference between the pre-70s world and now is that parents aged quicker, and children grew up quicker. As most left school at 15 or 16, adult responsibilities came along a lot sooner than they do now – and that included caring for aging parents. I can see that caring simultaneously for young children is a problem – but doesn’t that happen because they themselves are having children late? Sure, parents can stick around longer – but most are not really relying on their children in quite the same way if their health holds out. More like the other way round. Not every member of the older generation had it THAT easy, you know. (And we don’t all vote Tory either) and our expectations from our children are not quite as automatic as they once were when extended families lived in close proximity. Someone in these pages said that whinging is “more fun”. It is certainly more common. Life is never simple and problem free – where do people get the idea it should be?

I'm not sure what you're gonna get from this article. Seeing as children have no alternative reality to work off, those that had a great time and see the benefits, will the support aged parent concept and those that found it a burden, won't. These are same spurious responses one get when one talks of experiences of one child families vs. having siblings.

My dad was 41 when they had me. Doesn't sound so bad nowadays but in the 80's he didn't want me or my sister to feel we had an old dad so he spent the next twenty years shaving 5 years off his age. My mum knew of course, she even threw him a big 50th birthday party, all the while knowing that he was 55 haha!

Whilst young people get ill and die (I've known several) it is more likely that a child of older parents will have to contend with the declining health and death of their parents whilst they are still children or young adults. Whilst adopting a healthy lifestyle can increase the chances of you living healthily until an advanced age it will not stave off everything. In general, the likelihood of developing heart disease or cancer or suffering a stroke increases with age. Whilst these diseases can be successfully treated dementia - an increasing problem - cannot and even 'ordinary' (by that I mean *not* early onset) dementia often starts to affect the person in their late sixties - which most people think of as late middle age. There are some medications to slow the progress of dementia but they can't be taken by everyone, don't always work and, at best, are only effective for a few years. Nothing can repair the damaged brain and if a person develops vascular dementia in his/her late sixties s/he will almost certainly require constant supervision and a lot of help with day to day tasks or, if s/he lives alone, residential care by his/her mid-seventies. People who are otherwise fit and healthy develop dementia. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with lifestyle or how mentally active or socially connected you are. At a time when many people live into well into their eighties with or without physical ailments a disease which starts to ravage the brains of people in their sixties and early seventies is a terrible thing.

Kate says it's hard to lose a parent when you are young, but she was 25 when her dad died. I was born shortly before my mother's 30th birthday, but she was ill throughout my childhood and died when I was eight. Being an older parent doesn't necessarily mean spending less time with your child.That said, I'm glad I had my daughter in my 20s. Friends who are only a couple of years younger than me have young teenagers, and they've been exhausted since their children were born.

I appreciate your sharing about having a much older father. I'd just note a couple things: 1) Your mother's age at your birth was entirely common, perhaps even the what is considered the ideal age these days. It seems a lot of responsibility for your father that would have expected to fall on her went by her to you. This seems to be an unfortunate development unrelated to her age.2) Your father presumably would have struggled with dementia anyway even if he were 15 years younger when you were born. The question then becomes, how much easier would his situation have been to deal with were you 10 years older at each milestone along his decline, and how much easier would it have been were you 20 years older. You seem to be of the view that if he became your father at 46 instead of 56 he still would have been problematically old, what was really needed was for him to become a father by 36. Or you have another father completely. I think there's a big difference between 46 and 56, and if adding 10 years to your age wouldn't have helped much, I understand that, but would adding 20 years help much more than 10? My point being that perhaps the tragedy here is a father with dementia period as opposed to when your father's dementia appeared in your life.

Not quite in the league of my friend' s mother. She had 18 children, including three sets of twins. They all lived in a standard size three bed house and bought a 1 cwt flour sack each week to bake all their bread. They slept head to tail in their beds. My friend often tells the story of how his father was caught naked by police in the centre of town, was taken to court but was let off by the judge who deemed that he had been in his working clothes at the time of the offence.

Yes, the neat nuclear families envisaged in the intro to this story were a historical anomaly. Twenty-plus years of childbearing, or frequent deaths and remarriages as single parents sought new providers for their children, were much more common and led to very complex family structures.

My father was 65 when I was born and my mother 32. Unfortunately my father passed away when I was 14 but I would not have had it any other way. Now almost fourty my wife's (same age as me) had two grandparents pass just this last year and I never even knew any of mine. Her parents are still younger than my father was when I was born which I have kind of just realised.

I was born in 1951, my dad was 65 and my mum 35, in those less enlightened days caused a stir in a small market town, especially as dad,s previous marriage had been dissolved through non-consummation. Childhood, despite gossip, family difficulties etc. was wonderful. Late parenting seems to run in the family e.g. my great great grandfather was born in 1813! As for myself I am now the same age as my father when I was born and the proud kinship carer of one of my granddaughters, having had with my wife parental responsibility since she was 9 days old. My main regret being that due to work I was not able to spend as much time with my own children.
