EU referendum: female voters will decide Britain’s future – so don’t marginalise us

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>ne of the silliest mistakes of the Better Together campaign in the Scottish referendum was an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/27/scottish-independence-better-together-campaign-new-advert" title="">advert featuring a worried-looking mother</a> trying to make up her mind about whether her country should leave the union. “There’s only so many hours in the day!” she wailed as she sat in her kitchen musing about her husband and children’s future. “Patronising BT lady” became such a figure of ridicule – with hundreds of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/Cuphook108/status/504348163374063616/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc^tfw" title="">parodies</a> about women just having too many household chores to even be able to vote, that the actor in the advert dropped any mention of it from her CV.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/08/pankhurst-relative-priti-patel-eu-suffragette-comparison">Pankhurst relative condemns Priti Patel's Brexit-suffragette comparison</a> </p>

<p>The reason Better Together had bothered to put together the ad, which was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://theconversation.com/patronising-bt-lady-ad-may-not-quite-be-the-disaster-it-seems-31061" title="">based on comments real women had made in focus groups</a>, was that undecided women remained a large and important group in the final weeks of the Scottish campaign in 2014. Now, with three and a half months until the referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union, the two campaigns are trying to recruit the same group for their cause.</p>

<p>According to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.britishfuture.org/articles/women-will-decide-eu-referendum/" title="">research by the thinktank British Future</a>, women are twice as likely to say that they are unsure how they’ll vote in the referendum (20-25%) as men (10-15%). Given that they are also less likely to say they are certain to vote (29% compared with 43% of men), this means that both the Leave and Remain camps need to target them, both to persuade them to vote for their side, but also to turn out at all – though it may be that men are just more likely than female voters to make confident claims that they know what they’re doing.</p>

<p>When British Future released its research, it expressed surprise that neither side in the EU debate seemed that interested in women. The campaigns largely felt like men talking to one another, and a cursory glance at a debate on the matter in the House of Commons might still back that up: Europe seems to turn men on in a way it doesn’t for women.</p>

<p>The campaigns feel rather blokey too: most of the attention and setpiece interviews involve chaps, whether they be the prime minister and chancellor, or the men who surprised everyone by joining the out camp, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/24/boris-johnson-dinner-party-not-eu-referendum-coup" title="">Michael Gove and Boris Johnson</a>.</p>

<p>This is partly because politics still has too few women at senior levels, but also because at least one of those senior women has decided to go rather quiet. Theresa May has said little since she <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/02/theresa-may-announces-intention-to-back-eu-membership" title="">backed the Remain side</a>, though I understand she has decided to sit out the current blue-on-blue scrapping in her party before making her considered case in a few weeks. And Labour campaigners for Britain staying in are worried their female voters will just see a wall of Tory men on both sides of the argument and feel that no one is speaking to them.</p>

<p>Even at a grassroots level the debate is rather heavy on the boys. I recently attended a packed public meeting in the Meon Valley constituency in Hampshire organised by the local MP, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/24936/george_hollingbery/meon_valley" title="">George Hollingbery</a>. You couldn’t have hoped for a better panel of experts on Europe, but one thing jarred. I was the only woman on the panel: and I am a journalist, the antonym of expert. This isn’t the fault of those organising the event: there are just more men prepared to talk at length on the subject, and other similar public meetings have been entirely masculine affairs – and yet there are more women who haven’t made up their minds.</p>

<p>With this contradiction in mind, both sides have now set up targeted campaigns, with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35752605" title="">Women for Britain</a> campaign – which wants to leave the EU – launching yesterday. Both are trying to claim they are the modern suffragettes: the Tory minister <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/08/boris-johnson-abandons-city-hall-eu-referendum-gag-after-hypocrisy-claim-politics-live" title="">Priti Patel claimed</a> that “Women for Britain are fighting for the same cause” as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/great-speeches-emmeline-pankhu" title="">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>. This <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/08/pankhurst-relative-priti-patel-eu-suffragette-comparison" title="">didn’t go down all that well with Helen Pankhurst, Emmeline’s great-granddaughter</a>. She claimed the suffragette leader would have “been the first to champion what the EU has meant for women – including equal pay and anti-discrimination laws”.</p>

<p>So both campaigns have answered the call to actively court women voters and, like the wider movements in the referendum campaign, are also fighting with one another about their campaign tactics. Indeed, there has been so much fighting between the campaigns about the tactics of the other side that you might be forgiven for thinking they are tiring of talking about Europe already.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Out campaigners will talk about the tampon tax – as if women vote on the basis of visits to the chemist</p>

<p>But is setting up specific women’s campaigns really the right way to appeal to such a big, disparate group of voters? After all, women bring one million more votes to the referendum than men, and they hardly have a clear set of interests that can be addressed by one special campaign. Why should they be squirrelled away as a niche issue, rather than driving the messages and personalities of the main campaigns? The out campaigners will be talking about the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34645179" title="">tampon tax</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/05/car-insurance-women-rise-premiums-eu-ruling" title="">sexist EU insurance regulations</a>, which makes it sound as though women vote on the basis of their visits to the chemist, rather than the big national issues that the boys bother their big heads with.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the in campaigners warn that “those of us who are mums have taken for granted the maternity leave set out in EU employment law”, which is a curiously self-loathing message from a campaign backed by the British government. It suggests ministers cannot trust themselves with women’s rights, and need the EU to restrain them. And once again it suggests women look more to their self-interest than men, who worry about national security.</p>

<p>Then again, even though focusing on domestic issues may sound as patronising as the Better Together woman fretting over a cup of tea about Scottish independence, it might still be the right way to approach those voters, if they are more interested in those issues, as some polls suggest. But that still doesn’t explain why women need a niche campaign group in the way that farmers and lawyers do.</p>

<p>A bigger question is why, if so many of them claim to have made up their minds, the campaigns think they even need to worry about the men.</p>

While I don't exactly support the simplicity of blingmuns argument and fail to see any evidence either to support or refute his theory I do need oppose your contention that man and women have offspring in roughly equal proportions. We know for example that 1 in 200 men on this planet are descendants of Genghis Khan and 1 in 25 kids are not related to their unsuspecting dad. There are some men out there that sow their oats quite widely and this has been going on for thousands of years. Blingmuns idea is thus interesting but unproven.

Actually, with proper diplomatic input - which Britain tends not to do - the UK could influence EU policy as much as the French and Germans do - so say about a 1/4 of EU policy (the other quarter being split among the other 25) But that policy will apply across all 28 EU members

So you accept then that you share roots with modern day Swedes and Danes, as well as with modern Irish? You have just implied so. So why do you want to cut yourself off from them? And what of your neighbours? No Anglo-Saxon - i.e. Dutch/German - roots among them? Not the odd Norman-French by-blow?

As a wild stab in the dark though I'd suggest that women are less likely to be moved by empty calls to patriotism - or any other -ism - and are less fearful of loss of national identity. For millennia women were expected to lose their own identity on marriage and that must still linger to some degree.

Well, as a wild stab in the dark, women do not vote as a gender, but, like men, vote on class grounds, economic grounds, or don’t vote at all, because politicians aren’t reaching out to them at all?

The EU does not have the UK's interests at heart; it has the EUs interests at heart. They want the UK to remain their cash cow, and to keep exploiting our fisheries, and to absorb all the EU citizens (in 7 years that will include Turkey) who wish to come to the UK. The argument is made that the UK can influence EU policy better from within than without. Wrong: IN, the UK can influence 1/27th of the EU policy. OUT, the UK can influence 100% of UK policy. So: Which gives the UK voters the most influence over the lives of UK citizens & their children's future ?

Why does everything have to be genderised by the Guardian, are you unable to see the human animal simply in it's common humanity - always things are presented as women as opposed to men. Nowadays it seems news events are only describable in these sexually antipathetic terms - let's have done with it and just talk about the issues on their own merits in a gender-neutral way.

I'm very confused by the headline. How will womens votes decide the referendum? Womens votes will be about as decisive as mens. won't they? As for this peculiar request for more "information" what is it people want informing about? The whole debate seems to have come down to one side claiming we'll be better off in/out, and the other side claiming no we won't. I still reckon how you vote will just depend on your gut feeling about the EU.

I believe we should stay in the EU and she has done a very good job at articulating the reasons why, and does so in a positive way. All I am saying is that people may respond better to her approach to giving support for staying than the likes of Dave and Gideon.

However men and women both have offspring in the same proportion (e.g. roughly 50:50 male:female), so even if your hypothesis is true, than a woman who is the daughter of a high achieving man should be equal (on average) in leadership abilities as a son.

Very impressive list. But the EU (not Europe, that's a place) didn't give us these things - we bought them. Has anyone calculated how many billions or trillions we've paid for these benefits? Or what they would have cost to have them anyway, individually?

It's interesting that there are a whole lot of double standards here. Although many people don't like it, lobbying is a fact of life in modern government. Some estimates put the number of full time lobbyists in Westminster at around 15000 as well, so actually the EU is no worse, and some would say a whole lot better, given the much wider remit of the EU parliament.Of course the main difference is that in the EU there is an official register of lobbyists, and all meetings with lobbyists have to be recorded, as opposed to the UK government where no one really knows because there is no register and no requirement for recording of meetings.

There may well be some differences in the way men and women think both generally and about this issue, both sexes are quite able to think rationally and emotionally. However, initially your post stated "women in general do not like Farage so therefore will not vote UKIP. It follows therefore that they will not vote leave EU as it is perceived as his policy" your second post then says you have based your views on the women you know and that they might vote leave. Which negates the view that they won't if they don't like Farage.As for being sexist your first post states you are concerned that there are people who will make the decision based on emotion rather than rationalisation and then goes on to talk about women. Given that this is an article about women voting on the EU it is not too big a leap to assume that you meant that women would not be voting rationally. (And you had already indicated you would be worried about people making a voting deceison based on emotion ergo you are worried about women voting) Perhaps this was not your intent but that is the way it can be read and is thus sexist. If it wasn't meant that way, my apologies.

I take your point about using hormones to describe behaviour and in your example I would agree with you. However, there are occasions when I might ascribe actions to female hormones if I felt that the hormones played an important part, and if my behaviour had been affected by my hormones (which I am positive it has been on many occasions) I would be happy for you to say so. On this occasion I did consider the use of the word testosterone as I understand that it is this hormone that can make some men more adversarial and more likely to engage in fights (part of its evolutionary purpose?) and it does seem to me that this is the manner in which the "discussion" is being held, as in its not just about winning the debate but about winning as a whole.As for men hating the bullshit sniping too, that why I said "others" rather than "other women", I think there are alot of us from both sexes who do and I do wonder if it was this that made JC seem so refreshing in his campaign.

All I can base it on ,are the women in my life. Most will not vote UKIP under any circumstances but might vote Leave EU . We also have a situation that a lot of women will say " I am still making my mind up" but most men have already decided. It is not sexist, its just that men and women think differently.
