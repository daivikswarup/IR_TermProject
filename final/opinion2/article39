The Labour rebels plan a long game but time is running out

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he long game is what politicians claim to be playing whenever they are losing. When things are going swimmingly there is no need to pretend that what looks like drowning is actually part of a strategic plan.</p>

<p>The predicament of Labour MPs illustrates the point. A majority of them wish Jeremy Corbyn had not won last summer’s leadership contest, yet all accept that he would win again, perhaps by a greater margin, if the race were rerun tomorrow. Most of the dissidents also accept that a significant factor in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/sep/12/labour-announces-leadership-election-result-with-corbyn-tipped-to-win-politics-live" title="">Corbyn’s victory</a> was that the other candidates deserved to lose. They failed at organisation and inspiration. “They lost because they were shit,” as one former minister puts it. That leads many potential plotters to conclude that there is no sense in trying to unseat the leader any time soon. There is neither a candidate nor a programme around which non-Corbyn Labour might coalesce.</p>

<p>A speech on Thursday by Dan Jarvis, MP for Barnsley, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/10/dan-jarvis-distances-himself-from-new-labour-as-leadership-talk-grows" title="">on the challenges of globalisation and inequality</a> was inevitably received in Westminster as a proto-manifesto for the top job. Potential supporters willed themselves to be impressed – as did much of the audience for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/rachel-reeves" title="">Rachel Reeves</a>, who earlier in the week presented a shadow chancellor-in-exile’s view of Labour’s economic challenge. But whatever ambition lurks in those interventions should wisely be tempered with patience and discretion.</p>

<p>Even MPs with the itchiest trigger fingers have stopped talking about local election results in May as a potential moment to strike. The need to focus immediately on the EU referendum in June is one reason to hold fire. The bigger one is that the members expect Corbyn to be given a chance. And by that they mean more than a few months of pretend probation, against a background hum of defiance and derision.</p>

<p>In vain do <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> MPs observe that every needle on the dashboard of political recovery is pointing the wrong way and every warning light is flashing. Poor polling can be explained by disunity and media savagery, with the naysayers blamed for causing one and feeding the other.</p>

<p>This is where the long game comes in. The theory is that Labour members will become amenable to different leadership once they have observed the Corbyn experiment failing on its own terms. The ardour of conviction is expected to cool given sufficient contact with public opinion outside tribal left circles. “Before people lecture me about loyalty to Jeremy, they should try selling Jeremy on the doorstep,” says one MP in a marginal seat. The long-game plan holds that sniping and sabotage are counterproductive because they generate excuses for underperformance.</p>

<p>More impatient assassins respond that the well of Corbynite excuses is bottomless: an unfriendly media will always be there to blame. MPs will be held to impossible standards of loyalty. They cannot defend positions they hate and know to be electorally ruinous. It is the Macbeth dilemma: if it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well it were done quickly.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">The determination of the few who want regime change is neutralised by the many who like the leader they chose</p>

<p>One spur to prick the sides of intent is the battle already under way over party structures, rules, committee seats and balloting procedures. Corbyn’s supporters want more control over the policy-making process and to make sure dissenting MPs cannot block the left’s candidate – Corbyn himself or an anointed successor – in the event of a challenge. This is perfectly rational. The democratically elected leader wants his agenda reflected as party policy and his position fortified against threats of insurrection. If the loyalists get organised enough in advance of this autumn’s party conference, they can rewire the party so it is lit up with Corbynism, even if Corbyn himself falls. So the parliamentary resistance is in a bind. It is hard to play a long game with so little time on the clock.</p>

<p>One point on which Corbyn’s parliamentary allies and critics agree is that the default setting for many of their colleagues is loyalty to whomever the leader happens to be at any moment. A chunk of MPs will always choose stability over conflict. Some are unhappy but staying discreetly neutral for fear of getting on the wrong side of ideological militias in their constituencies and online. Some are enjoying a first taste of shadow ministerial office. A few see the “modernisers” and Corbynist ultras as two cliques of equal and opposite fanaticism. As one front-bencher puts it: “What they have in common is their sense of entitlement.”</p>

<p>A lesson from Gordon Brown’s brisk stumble into defeat and from Ed Miliband’s steady glide to the same place is that Labour has an institutional culture of deferring pain and honouring failure with the benefit of the doubt. For all of the drama of last summer’s leadership race, it is remarkable how little has changed.</p>

<p>Under Miliband, the left demanded a break from the discredited New Labour era and blamed reactionary Blairites for obstructing progress. The right grumbled and plotted ineffectually, succeeding only in advertising its obsolescence with a dearth of big ideas. Every MP with a network of friends outside the leader’s office was “on manoeuvres”. Their speeches were reported as “veiled leadership bids”.</p>

<p>Supporters of the embattled incumbent said he had reached out to internal enemies and been rebuffed. They said it would take time for his message of hope to cut through the fog of press lies. Aides recounted how warmly Ed was received outside the Westminster bubble; how he connected with ordinary voters; how they responded to his sincerity and decency when they experienced it live.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the nation was crying out for alternatives to Tory rule. The Conservatives were divided. Their supporters would soon recoil from the iniquitous impact of austerity. “Neoliberalism” had run its course.</p>

<p>Everything that is said now to explain why five months is too soon to pass judgment on Corbyn was said throughout five years of Miliband. There are big differences, of course. The current leader has a much stronger mandate. His critics are also more desperate. But those features cancel each other out. The determination of the few who want regime change is neutralised by the many who like the leader they chose. The situation is unstable but not unbalanced. Labour can spend years in a state of dysfunctional equilibrium, sliding towards defeat. Or to use the technical term: playing the long game.</p>

When this country NEEDS someone to have a good go at the Tories we have a Labour leader who thinks it is still the mid 1980s with his backwards policys. This country has suffered as a result.

Not so sure about that; in 1983, following the death of the immensely popular Bob Mellish, Peter Thatchell fought Bermondsey/Southwark on behalf of Labour. An unknown Simon Hughes fought for the then Liberal Party.Thachtell was rejected and Hughes won a previously safe Labour seat and held it until last year (he was a bloody good local MP).I lived in the constituency from '87 to '95 - locals told me they resented Labour's presumption they'd vote for a man they disliked because he wore a red rosette.(In fairness, it was a very dirty campaign and the Liberals fought it using somewhat illiberal values).

Right yeah, you lose me at 'aggregate'. You can't assign opinions to people based on what different people in that same group say. If half believe in red and half believe in yellow, you can't say they all believe in orange.

They were saying, in aggregate, that Corbyn would enthuse people who don't vote or vote for other progressive parties and in this way recapture Westminster and Holyrood. It was also a riposte to those that think Labour should aim to capture the central ground or anyone - whisper it - who might otherwise vote Tory or UKIP. Their point was that Miliband had tried to do this and failed. There was more mileage in non-voters. Since then, the centre ground has got bigger with ex-Labour voters while non-voters are, as far as we can tell, resolutely intending not to vote Labour.

It was a choice between four people who couldn't win a general election, so people picked the the clown car that was at least their favourite colour. The 'moderates'(read: batshit war-mad Blairite right) seem to think getting rid of Corbyn is more important than first finding someone who can be prime minister. Not being in a reflective or listening mode(much the case when they were in Downing Street), they're opting for not just suicide but murder-suicide by killing off any Labour project they're not in complete charge of.

Not understanding here, before or after his election? Because people saying he would win before he was elected leader were right- he was elected leader. If they were saying it after, talking about the next general election or any kind of election for office, then we need to consider what they were actually saying. Were they saying he WOULD win because X reasons or were they saying IF he won it would be because X reasons? Because if he does win a parliamentary majority, however unlikely, there would be a good case for saying it was because he got the voters who rise rather than the voters that swing which are the ones always emphasised by the Labour right as being crucial.

Yep... that period sort of exposed the middle way/triangulation thing that Blair et al built their reputation on. Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime etc etc. At the time (following 13 years of one way Tory rule) it seemed like such a clever idea. Park your tanks on the Tory lawn... talk right to act left yadda yadda.

This article and the Guardian Picks below it only serve to show how out of touch the journos, politicians and some readers are with what the public feels and wants and needs from our politicians - a new deal not a Bliarite deal. We need a vibrant left that doesn't hide behind failed neo-liberal policies.

I'm neither. My instincts are pretty left-Labour but I admired Healey and I disliked Benn. I never liked New Labour. I've spent more time as a trade union affiliate than a member because from the Kinnock years until the last election I felt Union work was more useful than party membership. I'm an elected councillor in Tory heartlands having been elected three times because my focus is upon issues and campaigning to help more people live better lives, so what does that make me?

Everyone is very civil. There are clear undertones of disagreement but they are exprebressed politely. If by "moderates" you mean people who think that Labour under Blair/Brown was on the right course then the answer is that they do speak up and no one tries to stop that by heckling or hectoring them.

Oh I don't doubt that the Churchill-led Tories were unpopular to many in 1945 but to suggest that they 'lost' rather than were beaten fair and square by the idealism of the Labour campaign is just plain ignorant.

Absolutely right. There is no way people in key marginals will vote for Corbyn and his little gang of hard left misfits if Red Ed and Ballsup were too left wing for them. Although there will still be areas where they would vote for a stray mongrel if it wore a red rosette and barked loudly at the Tories.

And the musical chairs experiment led by neocons liberals continue in search for a COUP LEADER to replace JC. From chuka Umunna to Hilary Benn to Tristan Hunt to Dan jarvis, none will have the guts to stand against him in a democratically elected mandate. They all know, it will be suicidal. These are bad pupils who never learn from their past mistakes from Iraq to Scotland, failure is their trademark :) I wonder which next candidate, the so called Moderate MPs (i.e. neocons Liberals Warmongers supporters) will drag screaming to face JC :)

I think you are saying the same thing as me for the current situation, but the other way round. The last time I ventured into Guardian comments on the Corbyn topic around the time of his election there were plenty of his supporters who said he would win by enthusing non-voters and would switch voters from the Greens and Lib Dems. I don't see that any more.
