Headline::::
Naff wordplay about Terry Wogan? I’m going in all puns blazing




DateTime::::2016-02-02T17:35:24+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">P</span></span>eople have been objecting to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/feb/01/terry-wogan-gets-a-fine-farewell-from-national-newspapers" title="">Daily Star’s headline Top o’ the Mourning </a>to report the death of Terry Wogan, and rightly so. It is crass because it forces the reader’s attention on the trick being performed instead of on the subject, which – when that is loss and bereavement – is inappropriate.</p>

<p>But this is the besetting sin of puns and punsters generally, and why there should be heavy fines and prison sentences for anyone who uses them in conversation. I once had to punch a friend to the ground when he replied to the opening question “How are you?” with “Pretty well. Or at least one of those.” He can’t help himself.</p>

<p>A close family member, who shall remain nameless in case it encourages him to get in touch, also does it: forces every conversation to a grinding halt as he puns for Britain. Every 18 seconds or so, you have to stop, perform a fast, detached scan on whatever wordplay he’s just essayed, nod, (approval or understanding – which is it they prefer? What drives these people?) and then try to recover the momentum of your conversation after an interruption so inimical to mood and normal human interaction.</p>

<p>There are only two contexts in which puns are acceptable (three, if you count conversations with me to which you bring a doctor’s note confirming that you have a medical condition that makes it impossible to communicate in any other way). The first is hairdresser’s salon names: Curl up and Dye is not, of course, a fully functioning pun (unless the stylist and colourist are actually going to kill you), but British suburbia needs all the monotony-breaking it can get. The second occurs only when your <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/21/conservative-sources-deny-david-cameron-pigs-head-allegations" title="">prime minister has recently been rumoured to have put “a private part of his anatomy” in a pig</a>. I wouldn’t have been without any of the porcine wordplay that ensued from that glorious revelation for anything.</p>

<p>But that’s all. Kathy Lette’s have no more of it.</p>

<p><strong>A wafer-thin case </strong></p>

<p>About <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.itv.com/news/2016-02-01/woman-threatens-legal-action-over-waferless-kitkat-demands-lifetime-supply/" title="">the law student and the KitKat</a>: for most of us, biting into a KitKat to find it not wafer filled but made of solid chocolate makes us feel like Galahad stumbling across the Holy Grail – it is an occasion for reverence quickly succeeded by rejoicing, for the gathering of friends and the tweeting of celebratory pictures.</p>

<p>Not so for law student Saima Ahmad, who instead took the opportunity to confirm every theory the world has ever held about lawyers by firing off a letter to Nestlé claiming for the “monetary and emotional loss” incurred by the experience.</p>

<p>“Clearly, if I wanted to buy a confectionery item that is purely chocolate, I would have purchased a bar of Galaxy,” she wrote. It’s all there: The strangulated English. The joyless pursuit of the letter of the law rather than its or life’s spirit. The narrowly correct point embedded in a world of wrong. The dedication to quantifying the unquantifiable intellectual firepower and energy brought to bear on something most humans would have contemplated, discounted and moved on from.</p>

<p>She is a lawyer to her bones. All that’s missing is a bill to herself for the hours worked. She will go far.</p>

<p><strong>In your face</strong></p>

<p>I was travelling back on the train from a family do and a young drunk couple across the aisle were getting amorous. And loud. Eventually an incredulous cry went up: “You want me to sit on your face?” asked the young woman. “But then everyone will see my vagina!” The whole carriage fell completely silent.</p>

<p>The only way we could have been more British would have been if a tweed-jacketed don had emerged from behind his newspaper to say: “Actually, it would be your vulva.” When I next tell this story, however, he will. I don’t see why the truth always has to ruin everything.</p>

Re the Kit-Kat story.. once as a child I bought a bar of Fry's Peppermint Cream. On taking a bite, I discovered that there was no cream- it was solid chocolate. I showed my dad who suggested that we send it to Fry's with a letter and see what happened. About two weeks later a box arrived for me full of assorted Fry's chocky and a nice letter apologising for the "faulty" bar. What treasures! The puzzling thing was how fast the level in the box went down and it wasn't me scoffing it all. Still, as it had been dad's idea, I didn't mind him helping himself!

You know reading an article doesn't have to be enjoyable, you may do it to become informed or to challenge the way you think about things. In such a situation it is wise to read until the end before making your mind up about the quality of what you have read. An article that doesn't use all the words within it to make it's case is after all a very bad article. It is very reasonable assume that an article in a national news paper does indeed use all it's words to effect and so make it necessary to read to the end to fully understand it. Having done that it is quite possible to conclude that the whole thing was a waste of time.

Terry Wogan was the vegemite of the entertainment world, spread very thinly it was just about bearable, slap it on thick and it it engendered a violent gag reaction. He lived, then he died and life carries on pretty much as before, no need for mass hysteria faux mourning or an abundance of valedictory puff pieces.

Interesting point for a comment. How dare these "media companies" discriminate in his favour solely on the basis of intelligence, wit, charm, professionalism, humility and decency ( and of course the voice). Far better to promote talent lacking in these areas - not too late, perhaps you can apply.

Surely Guardian Reporters know enough to NOT MAKE YOUR READERS stop reading after 6 lines.Where sex and Terry Wogan come in I have not idea, but the next time this person tells this story, I hope no one punches her to the ground - even if deserved.

Sometimes you read a response to yet another tiresomely predictable comment* and think, Yes, this should be on a very select list of public responses to this kind of nonsense.To have an excellent rote response to this type of comment would be quite satisfying. It would be a perfect reposte, not merely because of its contents but because it would cost the rest of us exactly the kind of time and effort these commentators deserve.
