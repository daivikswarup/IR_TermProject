I’m like, wow, calm it, you are going red, he’s like, he says I am a modern snob who would rather be cool than compassionate &amp; he puts it all in PLAYS literally at OUR SUBSIDISED NATIONAL THEATRE - I’m like, did I not tell you to stop Googling your name? He’s like, it was on the cabinet table with the insults highlighted in yellow, wait – my PMQs notes – God you don’t think … ? I’m like, no shit Sherlock, so Govey hates you but is too mean to buy a new highlighter, what is new, look, get Vaizey to sack the Hare person, job done.

Why do you think that saying 'Nah', 'gig' and 'geddit' makes you look super cool? In fact, it's rather sad to witness your desperate attempt to relive your teenage years so long afterwards.You also don't seem to understand the meaning of the word 'troll'. Someone who trolls is a troll, not a troller, and there is no such thing as a 'witty troller', or even a 'witty troll'. A troll does not even try to amuse: his/her only mission is to annoy. Making catty remarks about other people's relationships, on the other hand, is at best a bit sad and at worst plain unpleasant.

If you don't like it, stop showing off about it and don't read it. I do get sick of people BTL using anything and everything to pat themselves on the back.

Great stuff as ever, though I think Sam would remember David Gandy's name. He's front row at London Fashion Week, after all.

Oops! Too much merlot. Last para should read; "The boredom factor is so powerful . . . " This is the problem that work has always been the curse of the drinking classes.

Nah. She sleeps with some grey-haired fogey from Radio 4, who's about forty years older than her. I reckon she's looking to jump (geddit?) to the Beeb. This gig has the death rattle about it.

Sam and Dave...... there used to be a record label that was in competition with my favourite label(which was Tamla Motown), Stax was the rival company. They had a singing duo called Sam and Dave. They were crap as well.

Wow, this journalism game is an easy way to get laughs and make a living, babes! (Trouble is David Hare's so poker-arsed 'left' he's a joke who can't be made funny!)

I missed the David Hare piece first time round. I've just read it, and it really is an excellent piece of work.

This series has the fascination of a car crash and the entertainment value of a truly bad film, I will so miss it when it's gone - so few left to enjoy it's delicious awfulness
