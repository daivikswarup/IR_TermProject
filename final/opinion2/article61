Labour still has to work out how it can speak for England




DateTime::::2016-02-04T20:11:18+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">S</span></span>o who will speak for the England that thinks asking, “Who will speak for England?” is somewhere between hideous and mildly hilarious? That’s the first question posed by the excitable front page of Thursday’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3430870/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-speak-England.html" title="">Daily Mail</a>, which was instantly spoofed all over social media.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/08/labour-englishness-falkirk">As a political force Englishness is on the rise – and Labour mustn't forget it | Vernon Bogdanor</a> </p>

<p>What politician will speak for the poor flustered millions, those for whom the very definition of Englishness is feeling mortified when asked to define Englishness; who if pressed might cite queuing, apologising even when the other person is actually at fault, and always carrying an umbrella, but worry afterwards that maybe even that was a bit strident?</p>

<p>It feels a bit lame, in what we’re always being told is an age of identity politics, to admit that you haven’t really got one; worse than not being able to summon up a vision of how David Bowie changed your life. But what if you just … haven’t? What if you try and try and try to squeeze out a properly fierce, heart-swelling vision of something you would die for and it just won’t come?</p>

<p>One answer is to watch an old video that recently went viral of the US presidential hopeful <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaZGaJrd3x8" title="">Ted Cruz making bacon with a gun</a>. (Should you want to try this at home, then the safety advice is not to, but it involves wrapping raw bacon around the barrel and loosing off a few shots at the rifle range. The heat of the gun apparently singes the bacon to a crisp.) If Englishness means anything, it surely means preferring your country not to be led by someone who cooks with a semi-automatic rifle.</p>

<p>And that’s the thing about national identity – it’s most easily defined and keenly felt as opposition to somebody or something else. The quickest route to a strong national identity is a common enemy.</p>

<p>English nationalism has been rising steadily since the early 1990s, according to a little-noticed piece of research discussed on the fringes of the Labour party conference last autumn by the ex-minister <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/johndenham" title="">John Denham</a>. (Now an academic based at the University of Winchester, his work focuses on what he calls the search for “progressive patriotism”, or a vision of Englishness with which the left is comfortable.)</p>

<p>But what’s interesting is that this identity has often peaked in tandem with key moments for Scottish nationalism. It’s as if Scotland’s vigorous assertion of its own identity has shattered the lazy assumption that “British” was basically synonymous with “English”, forcing the rest of us to ask rather defensively what being English actually means. And this new strain of Englishness is, according to the Future of England survey, closely associated with attitudes to “otherness”.</p>

<p>People who self-identify as English are significantly more likely than those who live in England but self-identify as British to regard the EU as a bad thing, and to favour restricting immigration. Feeling English is clearly associated with an aversion to perceived meddling from Brussels or to newcomers potentially changing what it means to be English.</p>

<p>And if you’re wondering why Labour would ever want to speak for that kind of England, one beloved of Sun and Mail readers, the answer is that it already does. Over a third of Labour voters in England self-identified as English. One in four Sun readers voted for Ed Miliband in 2015. Short of telling them they’re all not allowed in the party any more, the Englishness debate is not one <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> can easily sidestep.</p>

<p>Drawing on George Orwell’s famous clarion call to the left not to ignore working-class patriotism, MP Tristram Hunt this week became the latest senior Labour figure to demand a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/14251502.Tristram_Hunt_urges_Labour_to_reconnect_with_English_supporters/" title="">new approach to Englishness</a> – including the inevitable call to be more “honest” about immigration. Next week the up-and-coming leftwinger Lisa Nandy will open a series of seminars on Englishness organised by Denham, which will also include the ex-soldier-turned-leadership-hopeful Dan Jarvis. The search is on for a way of speaking for England, without resorting to the usual reactionary script.</p>

<p>Labour’s past is littered with awkward attempts to “do” patriotism, from Peter <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-labour-party-campaign-manager-peter-mandelson-with-fitz-the-bulldog-32500907.html" title="">Mandelson posing with a bulldog</a> during the 1997 election campaign to Gordon Brown’s clunky promise of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/feb/04/gordon-brown-david-cameron-pmqs" title="">“British jobs for British workers”</a>. Who can forget Ed Miliband, meanwhile, sacking Emily Thornberry<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-30139832" title=""> for tweeting a photograph</a> of a white van covered in St George flags before declaring that his own emotional response to seeing a white van was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ed-miliband/11245673/Ed-Miliband-I-feel-respect-whenever-I-see-a-white-van.html" title="">“respect”</a>, as if it were some sort of ancient monument?</p>

<p>And now it’s Jeremy Corbyn’s turn. There is actually something quintessentially English about the Labour leader. It’s there in his love of his allotment, his terrible dress sense, his gentle understatement and the way he waits sternly during prime minister’s questions for MPs to stop mucking about at the back of the class.</p>

<p>He speaks naturally for an England that recoils instinctively from flag-waving jingoism; that cheerfully couldn’t give a toss whether you <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/15/jeremy-corbyn-silent-during-national-anthem-battle-of-britain-service" title="">sing the national anthem</a> or revere the Queen; that sees the value in Englishness being a deliberately vague concept, elastic enough to incorporate all without rancour. (Good luck finding any definition of Englishness that’s sharp enough to mean something, yet not instantly divisive; that can’t be aggressively turned into the age-old game of ‘if you’re not with us, you’re against us’.)</p>

<p>It’s a lovely kind of Englishness, but the only problem is that most Labour voters who embrace it are probably in the bag already. The ones who aren’t are those Orwell might have recognised, those who – as the sacked shadow cabinet minister Michael Dugher <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/too-many-pointy-heads-and-too-few-street-fighters-labours-michael-dugher-what-went" title="">said recently of his Barnsley constituents</a> – fly the flag out of pride but also as a cry for help, to show “we haven’t gone away and we deserve a voice too”.</p>

<p>Yet under Corbyn, Labour members are significantly more middle class, Londoncentric and affluent than in decades, more Stoke Newington than Stoke-on-Trent. The party’s electoral base too has never been more middle class. The traditional party of the working classes is having something of a quiet identity crisis itself, increasingly confronted with Labour voters whose views on national identity or immigration Labour politicians don’t share – views they may find divisive, disconcerting, even offensive.</p>

<p>The optimistic answer is that somehow the socially conservative and liberal wings of Labour will eventually argue and reason their way to a more enlightened understanding of each other’s differences.</p>

<p>But the pessimistic answer is that a schism looms; that the crack between Labour’s old industrial heartlands and its liberal urban playgrounds is getting too wide to paper over. Who speaks for England, when England speaks with so many different voices?</p>

You certainly seem to have overlooked the numerous times that Labour has stood up for the NHS, striking workers, the disabled, working tax credit families, the police, local government and the low paid. Just because you only choose to notice foreign policy and nuclear disarmament doesn't mean Labour isn't talking about local issues most of the time.

Never mind that, where do they get the idea that everyone in Islington is wealthy? Most people are in council flats or extortionate private rented places. Hence the solid Labour vote.

If you include Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Vikings and Normans, most definitely. The actual Britons were mostly dispersed to Wales and Cornwall. Maybe the 'English' should give them their country back?

The message was a load of photos, including one of a house with flags flying from it, and the caption "Image from Rochester". I think you are reading too much into it, and Miliband over-reacted.



Author::::supermac1432

Because that is not the style of the message.

Look, if you are going to continue to contend that her tweet was completely non-judgemental and that there was no snobbery intended, I simply do not wish to use my free time to argue with you. If the tweet itself won't convince you, I certainly cannot.



Author::::cherryredguitar
DateTime::::2016-02-06T21:19:40Z
The context was that it was one of a fairly large series of photos and this was the only one which attracted any controversy. The caption was boring and informative. The most ridiculous part of the whole sorry saga was Ed Miliband saying that seeing a white van made him feel respect, as if they had helped to abolish slavery or something.



Author::::supermac1432
DateTime::::2016-02-06T21:12:59Z
Please don't be obtuse. Taken in context - with the photograph, the message was clearly intended to sneer at the perceived little-England-ness of the working class. Do you honestly think that, simply to document her being in Rochester, she would take a picture of someone's house with their white van? What do you think she was trying to say with that picture?

Oh, stop being ridiculous. The image and caption were clearly part of a sneering message about Rochester. I really don't see how - or, indeed, why - you are trying to pass this off as just a banal photographic description of Rochester. She has every right to be a snob about people who live on estates, drive white vans, and hang England flags from their houses; you don't need to be so ridiculous in trying to defend her.

Roy Hattersley entered Parliament in 1964 and had been active in the Labour Party before that. By the time he retired in 1997, his constituency had been transformed by decades of mass immigration.

Hey, Turpin (are you related to the great Dick?) - keep fighting for our Country. I do not agree with Corbyn on some things: for instance immigration - The EU. We do; however, need to look after our own. All good people of these Islands. So far, Corbyn appears to be the best way forward,The Politicians are self -serving b........s

No, but it doesn't look good to sneer at people who do. Thornberry's tweet was from someone in a cosseted position of power bullying someone much further down the pecking order. It was bullying, basically, and came across very very badly, not least because it clearly fitted a narrative.

If you go to Norway France or the states you find huge numbers of houses have a flag and pole in the front garden which is interpreted simply as a patriotic not a political statement. It is only in England where the left view our national flag as a statement of racism and bigotry. It says far more about the mentality of the left than it does about those flying the flag.

Labour suffers from what Roger Scruton calls "oikophobia", I.e. a fear of the familiar. This probably stems from the folk-Marxism that leftists cannot escape, so that every human relationship is one of oppressor and oppressed.
