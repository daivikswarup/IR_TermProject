A moment that changed me: becoming homeless

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t’s 8pm, and I have been standing outside a church building for hours, too afraid to go in. I am giving God another chance. Having grown up in a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/christianity" title="">Christian</a> family, I rediscovered my own faith recently, after being fairly indifferent to it all as a child, but standing there – feeling a mix of shame and sadness – something is stopping me going inside. If there really is a supreme being, where is he now?</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/25/shelter-fifty-years-charity-homelessness-government">Happy birthday, Shelter – sadly you are needed more than ever | Polly Toynbee</a> </p>

<p>People file out of the evening service, laughing with friends and discussing dinner plans. They walk past me as if I am invisible. Then a woman stops and asks if I am all right. “I have nowhere to live.” The words tumble out and are almost inaudible as I try to hold back tears. “Why don’t you come inside? We have a notice board where people offer spare rooms,” she replies. “No, you don’t understand,” I say. “I have nothing. I’ve fallen out with my family, I’ve run out of friends, I’m failing in school and I have no money. I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>She saw the fear in my eyes, and her countenance filled with compassion, as she offered me a bed for the night. She was convinced that a few phone calls would help sort everything out. She didn’t ask much about my life up to this point, but simply showed unquestioning kindness instead.</p>

<p>At 18, from a “good” middle-class family, and well-educated, I might not have looked like an “obvious” person to be sleeping rough, but my life had turned down a dark path. I had run away from home and was making some poor life choices – blaming all my mistakes on my mum and dad. I left in search of independence and had fallen into self-destruct mode, suffering from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/depression" title="">depression</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/obsessive-compulsive-disorder" title="">obsessive compulsive disorder</a> and self-harming.</p>

<p>At first I stayed with a close friend, but then her family moved away. Another family from church took me in but they couldn’t care for me along with their own children. I was less focused on my <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels" title="">A-levels</a> than their own daughter, despite the fact my exams were looming. Maybe they thought I was a bad influence and that their best intentions were failing. They kept suggesting that I should return home, when neither I nor my parents felt ready for this.</p>

<p>So I sofa-surfed until my friends ran out of patience. I was street homeless for a week. I went up and down a London underground line, slept on night buses or in train stations, and survived on reduced foods from the 24-hour supermarket. This was an exhausting and embarrassing experience.</p>

<p>This woman outside the church came into my life when I was on the brink of collapse, panicking about what to do from one day to the next. I was in survival mode, and all I could think about was myself. I was taking advantage of people’s generosity without showing much gratitude or consideration. This woman not only gave me a bed for the night, but she also talked some sense into me. “What’s your long-term plan? You can’t go on like this for ever,” she said. “No wonder you’ve run out of friends if you treat them this way. You’re taking advantage of their kindness… or are you just expecting people to continue to pay your way for you?” Her words and tough love broke a cycle of negative thinking.</p>

<p>After hearing this analysis of my situation I realised that I needed to sort my life out. This advice was nothing new; friends and family had already tried to get through to me, but hearing it from someone who didn’t know me hit harder. I spent the next night at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.churcharmy.org.uk/Groups/245011/Church_Army/ms/Marylebone_Project/About_Us/About_Us.aspx" title="">Marylebone Project</a>, run by the Church Army. I had a hot shower, a hot meal and a room to myself. The staff made enquiries and found me a bed in a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2013/dec/27/centrepoint-young-hidden-homeless-london-video" title="">Centrepoint</a> hostel for 16- to 25-year-olds. I shared a dormitory and bathroom with three other girls. From there, I was given a room in a flat with another girl, sharing the kitchen and bathroom. After four months there, I entered a six-month Christian residential programme for vulnerable women. Everywhere I went, I was treated exceptionally well – I didn’t feel like a burden, but a valuable human being. The staff helped me to get my life back on track. I got my first job working in a department store. I was becoming a responsible adult, paying bills and learning to deal with the consequences of my actions.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/15/secret-life-homeless-outreach-worker-abuse">The secret life of a homeless outreach worker: we put up with abuse that no other profession would | Anonymous</a> </p>

<p>The biggest challenge was not being taken seriously. I was British, well-educated, and middle-class – I didn’t fit the typical image of a homeless person. I felt like being homeless was my fault, because I didn’t have “real problems”, such as addiction. When people think of a homeless person they probably imagine a bearded older man, but I know now that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/homelessness" title="">homelessness</a> can happen to anyone.</p>

<p>Looking back, it sometimes feels as though this is not my own story, because it seems too far removed from my life now. Family relationships and friendships have been restored. Being open, honest and vulnerable, we have spent lot of time talking and learning to trust each other again. I love the work that I do now, both paid and voluntary. I’ve just moved into a new apartment, which is a stone’s throw away from where I used to sleep rough. I walk past the same places every day, which can be quite surreal.</p>

<p>I’m part of another church now, which is very involved in the local community and I’ve recently become part of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.citizensuk.org/" title="">Citizens UK</a>, a non-partisan organisation campaigning for things such as the living wage. The government needs to step up its game, to ensure that more affordable housing becomes a reality and that people are paid enough to actually live. More volunteers are needed for street teams who help the homeless sleeping rough.</p>

<p>If there were more people out there like the woman who helped me, then perhaps we might see a reduction in rough sleeping. True success stories can only be achieved and sustained when people can access the services they need for long enough to rebuild their lives. Whenever I buy <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/the-big-issue" title="">the Big Issue</a>, or serve on a team for Crisis at Christmas, it keeps me connected to something that I could easily try to distance myself from. Homelessness could happen to any of us, so do remember that a single act of kindness could change someone’s life.</p>

Why did you run away from home, Emma? And why, considering how young and vulnerable you were, did your parents apparently not make any serious attempts to find or help you? That wasn't very Christian of them. Living with parents like that who profess to be quite holy and righteous and yet act in a way towards their own children that is anything but can be very injurious to ones mental health. Perhaps that was the true source of your depression?

No because I don't allow other people to talk down to me like I am a piece of dirt and neither should you. When people attempt to emotionally/verbally brutalize and demean you its not because they think it is going to help you. Its simply because they are cowardly abusive arrogant assholes who enjoy it and think they can get away with it. Don't let them. The only thing lower than kicking a person when they are down is doing it under the guise of "helping" them.

Well it's a "chicken-egg" argument, isn't it? Which came first? I wasn't there, so I can't say. Neither can you, presumably. But it seems perfectly logical to me that as a young adult she may well have been beginning to experience the onset of these conditions that would contribute greatly to poor decision making. That she one day apropos of nothing in charge of all her faculties just started making a bunch of poor choices strikes me as off.

You're telling me that in no way in life nobody has ever told it to you how it is, no matter how brutal it'll be to your pride or emotions, and you've come off better for it?

Aye, she had a home to go to, she just "wasn't ready" for it. A big difference to someone who loses their home through unemployment, disability etc.

"Homelessness could happen to any of us, so do remember that a single act of kindness could change someone’s life." Dear Cameron, and friends. What will it take for you to accept what you are doing - is it necessary for this to happen to you before you wake up?

I think the UK and the USA need a better welfare system. Just look at Denmark or Scandinavia in general. Very good economy, high education and high luck in society.

Yes, I wasn't impressed by that part. She has taken responsibility for everything, and has got back on her feet, but I wonder if it was so one sided as it all being her fault - not enough information to tell.

When people talk about God in this way, I find it helpful to see it as a figure of speech pointing to emotions we can all relate to.

If I ever became homeless and some supposedly kind soul offered me a bed for the night only to start lecturing me and talking down to me once we got back to their place I would tell them in no uncertain terms to take their precious bed and shove it up their ass.

One of the great myths of the offspring of middle class homes is entitlement. 'We' could never become homeless - it is our right to be comfortable.However here the world has taught that its a very short step for all of us from comfortable success to destitution.A fall that you could not have imagined being able to happen - but one that happens so fast.Getting out of it can be very difficult and I am glad to read about someone who managed it.But once experienced - never forgotten.An experience that makes a kinder, more tolerant, more understanding person.Perhaps the most valuable experience of your life.
