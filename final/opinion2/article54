‘Project Fear’ started as a silly private joke during another referendum, but now it won’t go away

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>n conflicts of all kinds, the enemy will sometimes do or say something that a clever opponent can seize and magnify from a small and apparently trivial matter into a damaging generalisation of the enemy’s character and campaign. Irony, which rarely travels well between sides, is in these warlike situations almost always best avoided.</p>

<p>A famous example is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lusitaniamedal.com">the Goetz medal</a>, which appeared in Germany after a U-boat torpedoed and sank the British liner Lusitania off the coast of Ireland in May 1915 with the loss of 1,198 lives, including 128 Americans. In the international outrage that followed, Germany alleged that the ship had been carrying arms and was therefore a legitimate target, and also that the British government and Cunard Line had ignored warnings from the German embassy. Later that same summer, the medal-maker Karl Xaver Goetz commemorated the event in one of a series of “satirical” medals that he was then producing in his Munich studio. One side showed the sinking liner’s deck filled with armaments below the legend “Keine Bannware!” (“No contraband, eh?”), while the reverse had a skeleton in a Cunard office selling tickets to a queue of innocents under the German for “Business above all”. Thanks to an inaccurate newspaper report, Goetz recorded the date of the disaster as 5 May, two days before it actually happened.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/26/eu-referendum-scottish-playbook-project-fear-europe">The EU referendum is already following the Scottish playbook, Project Fear 2.0 | Ruth Wishart</a> </p>

<p>Goetz made fewer than 500 of these medals, but one of them found its way into the hands of the British Foreign Office, which sent photographs of it to the US, which were published in the New York Times. Reports suggested, falsely, that the medal had been awarded to the U-boat crew. The wrong date inspired the theory that the attack had been premeditated. The skeleton suggested an inhuman (perhaps “typically German”) delight in death. Anxious to exploit the anti-German feeling that the medal aroused, the Foreign Office’s propaganda department commissioned the department store magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge to mass-produce exact copies, of which 250,000 were sold at a shilling each, with the revenue donated to charity. Opprobrium grew internationally – not least in neutral America – and in 1917 the government of Bavaria suppressed Goetz’s original. But by then America had entered the war; by playing a small part in creating the atmosphere that made that decision possible, the medal had done its work.</p>

<p>And so we come to “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/29/cameron-dismisses-claims-project-fear-eu-remain-negative">Project Fear</a>” and the Karl X Goetz of our times, Rob Shorthouse, who in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum was the communications director of the unionist Better Together (aka No) campaign. “Why does the No campaign call itself Project Fear?” a taunting Alex Salmond asked Alistair Darling, Better Together’s leader, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/05/alex-salmond-alistair-darling-scotland-debate-independence">in the first televised debate</a> between the two in August 2014. To which Darling replied: “It doesn’t.” The denial was true, and yet not quite wholly and completely true, because in some private and possibly self-ironising or satirical way, it did once.</p>

<p>As a phrase relating to the Better Together campaign, “Project Fear” first appeared in Glasgow’s Herald newspaper in 2013. According to a report in the same newspaper last year, a volunteer at the campaign’s Glasgow headquarters had coined it “as an ironic suggestion for Yes Scotland – a handy name it could use in its constant complaints about Better Together’s alleged Unionist scaremongering”. In others words (if I understand this right), it was a way of referring to its own campaign as characterised by its opponents – “a joke phrase”, as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13194407.I_admit_it__the_man_who_coined_Project_Fear_label">Shorthouse told the Herald</a>, “that was all about poking fun at the Nats and their constant dismissal of every legitimate point raised by anyone and everyone as scaremongering”.</p>

<p>Joke names for serious things are a fact of office life; many years ago the Sunday Times ran a series of interviews with powerful husband-and-wife duos that the staff, though not the interviewees, knew under the working title of “Nightmare Couples”. The mistake Shorthouse made was to mention “Project Fear” to a group of journalists at the Scottish Tory conference in June 2013, who quickly got it into print. A few days later, on 1 July, the Daily Telegraph’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a> editor, Alan Cochrane, recorded in his referendum diary, published last year, that Shorthouse was “in deepest doo-doo for coming up with the ridiculous Project Fear name … He really is a stupid boy. I’ve never rated him and always thought he was massively over-promoted.”</p>

<p>It was a godsend for the SNP, which could now rebrand every unionist objection to independence as nothing more than scary propaganda. Like the Foreign Office with the Goetz medal in 1916, the party amplified something small and half-cocked and made sure everyone knew about it. The effects of the electorate are still unclear. The unionist side, after all, went on to win the referendum by 55% to 45% and “fear”, it should be said, had also been part of its opponents’ arsenal: though health is a devolved power, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/independence-no-vote-would-hurt-scots-nhs-1-3475186">Nicola Sturgeon had warned voters</a> that only a Yes vote would save the NHS. But an unshakeable idea took root that the No side, by stressing the negatives of independence rather than the positives of the union, had come close to losing. Sturgeon, especially, seems to believe that the No/Yes proportion of the Scottish electorate declined from roughly 65/35 to 55/45 over a long campaign, mainly because of the No side’s negativity, which, when you think about it, suggests she has uncharacteristic doubts about the strength of her political cause.</p>

<p>With this history behind her, Sturgeon has more than once warned David Cameron against fighting a “miserable, negative, fear-based” campaign on Europe. But what if those words were replaced by “sensible, sober and cautious”? Remove the prism of Project Fear, and the same kind of practical questions come with a far less pejorative set of adjectives. The fight to maintain the status quo – as member of the UK and/or the EU – is bound to stress the dangers of the unfamiliar.</p>

<p>There is something else. To be fearful is sometimes to be wise. Before the referendum, to question the Scottish government’s estimates of oil revenues or worry about Scotland’s over-reliance on them was seen as evidence of unionist miserabilism. “The No campaign, the Tory party [and] the Labour party are the only people in the world who argue that the possession of substantial amounts of oil and gas are somehow a curse,” Salmond said in 2014, when oil was forecast to stay above $100 a barrel and an independent Scotland’s share of oil taxation reckoned at between £6.8bn and £7.9bn for the year 2016-17. Today, with oil priced around $40 a barrel, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/north-sea-tax-revenues-plummet-negative-first-time-history">that annual tax take</a> is expected to hit £100m – a seventieth of the pre-referendum estimate. For the first time in 35 years, since before the oil boom got going, Scotland is generating less tax per head than the rest of the UK.</p>

<p>Things move on. After the referendum, the “massively over-promoted” Shorthouse became the client and communications director of Scotrail, the franchise owned by the Dutch transport company Abello that runs Scotland’s trains. Last year he said it was “pretty pathetic” that the SNP had tried to describe Project Fear as “anything more than a joke in our office”. And yet it did become more than a joke. It became a piece of conventional wisdom about referendum campaigns – “negativity doesn’t work” – that has still to be properly tested.</p>

"Project Fear" may or may not have started as a silly in-joke. But it would not have caught on in the manner in which it did had it not been absolutely apposite.

Boris Johnson is the Pied Piper, tootling reassuringly on his flute, pretending to drive an HGV, cajoling an ill-informed population, decrying the scandal of people banned from speaking their minds while hypocritically banning his own staff from speaking their minds, as he attempts to lead us into the wilderness of his Canadian fantasy.

Except it wasn't a joke. It was the modus operandi. Senior MPs phoning pensioners to tell them would not get next Thursdays pension wax unfortunately just one example of the scare tactics used to frighten vulnerable people . Unionists seem desperate to airbrush their behaviour from history but it won't be forgotten or forgiven for that matter.

Cameron and Johnson, along the rest of the cream at the top of the tree, are at their happiest when talking down to people...its very English and is as a result of high levels of extreme inequality, the likes of Eton and our class ridden society. Top-down economics, top-down politics, top-down business culture etc. Preaching and talking with a stern voice whilst simultaneously pointing fingers, hand waving and frowning whilst doling out their "message" is the norm.

It's an interesting point, but I don't think ultimately valid. You are right to say that many did recommend joining the Euro, although to be fair it was far from overwhelming. Nonetheless the Great Recession was not predicted and neither was the Euro crisis.However:1) People learn from new information. For example economists are now factoring in banking data and considering irrational behaviour, which they had previously thought unimportant.2) staying in the EU is not the same as joining the Euro3) The people who want to stay put forward the economic argument for doing so. It is better to engage with the arguments than to just believe the opposite.

Project Fear is now a permanent feature of life in Scotland as 90% of the papers are Unionist and are determined to use their power to retain and strengthen the Union, (this paper included). There are genuine issues brought up by Project Fearists but to such a degree and amount that it becomes ludicrous and therefore counter productive because youend up just switching off.

Because the far right wing of the Tories needs to be defeated - always and at regular intervals, even if only by slightly less right wing Tories. Though I disagree that is what this is - it's about our place in Europe (ie political, geographical and economic reality) vs a fantasy world of obligation-free trading in a bubble of selfish isolationism.

Since it's clear that many nationalists now have an obsessive hatred for the BBC in all its forms, could it be that few actually applied to join the audience? Or that word went out to suggest that might be a good opportunity to produce a 'biased' audience and thus a further stick to beat the Beeb with? Conspiracy theories shouldn't be restricted to the unionists side, after all, as that would suggest that Nats are less capable of organising themselves, which couldn't possibly be true.

Not just an absence of risk. Outies can't point to a single benefit that exit would bring. Immigration will continue as most is from non EU states, UK would be excluded from the top table of international politics. Perhaps they think the loss of Northern Ireland would be the positive?

If you read the word project as an verb's imperative, instead of a noun, it does alter the meaning quite a bit.  The OUTs wish to overturn a settled political status quo which already has the validation of one referendum behind it. Along the way to their destination, they will project any amount of fear. Of the EU. Of foreigners. Of TTIP. Of those of us who merely wish to stay as we are, in the EU. The British public, I think, knows a fool for a fool, and will simply keep calm and carry on.

Look Out! There's an Iceberg ahead!  In real life, icebergs do exist. One may or may not be steering towards one. In order for any complaint of scaremongering to be well- founded, it is first necessary to demonstrate conclusively there is no iceberg in one's path. Like all political buzzwords, project fear conceals a great deal more than it illuminates. In the current referendum, it's an attempt by OUTs to evade their duty, as proposers of a radical political change for the UK, to demonstrate an absence of risk implicit within their suggestion.

"fear-inspiring propaganda and lies". Yes, all those concerns about the oil price dropping were totally inaccurate. We'd be rolling in money up here if we'd voted for independence, right? Just like if we'd been independent before RBS punched a hole in the bottom of the Scottish economny, right?

Maybe I am missing something, but there is little evidence that the intent behind either of the cases mentioned was satirical. Project Fear was a genuine strategy however you choose to call it, and for a good reason. Humans are notoriously resistant to change, and maintaining the status quo is pretty easy unless things get really bad.
