New York apartments were an exotic world to me – until I moved into one

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>ike a lot of people raised in the 80s I read a lot of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/judy-blume" title="">Judy Blume</a> growing up, and before graduating from the junior titles – Superfudge, Sheila the Great – to the thrills of Deenie, Tiger Eyes, Are You There God? and beyond, the most exciting thing about them was their outlandish location.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/04/parenting-americans-cotton-wool-new-york-mothers-french-safety-guy">When it comes to parenting, Americans reach for the cotton wool | Emma Brockes</a> </p>

<p>There were the weird American names to grapple with – Farley Drexel Hatcher; Merle “Mouse” Ellis; cousin Eudora. There were the baffling snacks – “Jell-O”; “grape juice”; “Fruit Loops” – but above all, in those early books, there was a style of living that, to a suburban English person who had never been in a house more than two storeys high, seemed as improbable as science fiction. The Manhattan apartment block where Peter Hatcher and his family lived in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_a_Fourth_Grade_Nothing" title="">Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</a> featured a man in a uniform who operated the elevator and another who stood in the lobby and said hello as they passed. Both knew the names of every resident in the building. It seemed like a freakishly modern way to live.</p>

<p>I’ve had cause to think about this since moving into a similar kind of building (minus the elevator operator, which even when the book came out in 1972 was a fanciful detail given the Hatchers weren’t rich), and I find the assessment still holds. There are lots of practical advantages to living in a traditional <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> apartment building: no utility bills, a package room so you never miss the mail; maintenance staff on hand for emergencies and the sense of security that comes from knowing that if something happens, 300 people will hear you scream.</p>

<p>But it is also peculiar to live in such close proximity to others. The life of such a building is a strange thing, like a never-ending cruise in which you’re always trying to avoid the same people at the buffet.</p>

<p>My particular building is in transition from something called a Norc – a Naturally Occurring Retirement Community – to one predominantly inhabited by young families, which means that every time I step out my door, I run into someone 30 years my senior with pronounced views on whether or not my children are out too late or wearing enough layers. There is also the occasional game of chicken – pushchair v Zimmer frame – in the corridor.</p>

<p>In the 18 months I have lived here, however, something surprising has occurred to me. There are bake sales in the recreation room. At Halloween, kids go trick-or-treating up and down the building’s 20 floors. Every time I go out, I talk to the doorman about the weather. It still strikes me as a weird way to live, but not for the reasons I once thought: in a city as divided and alien as any, it is a strangely old-fashioned idea of community.</p>

<p>The recent trend in publishing for learning a new thing and then writing about it – travelling to a place, doing a sport or finding an esoteric skill to pursue for a year - has a new iteration: lessons learned while the author studies a new language.</p>

<p>After the success of Deborah Fallows’ Dreaming in Chinese comes <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/jhumpa-lahiri-in-other-words-italian-language" title="">Jhumpa Lahiri</a>’s new memoir, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/30/in-other-words-jhumpa-lahiri-review-learning-italian" title="">In Other Words</a>, about her love of Italian, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/379544/the-joy-of-learning-french-part-deux/" title="">Ta-Nehisi Coates learning French</a>, and there are more books in this vein in the pipeline. Meanwhile, on rages the disagreement over whether bilingualism has any real benefits to the brain. In a recent paper, Kenneth Paap, a psychologist at San Francisco State University, concluded that such benefits “either do not exist or are restricted to very specific and undetermined circumstances”. The advantages of simply being a fish out of water are perhaps harder to quantify.</p>

<p>New York survived a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/freezing-temperatures-trigger-cold-blue-warning-nyc-article-1.2495867" title="">Code Blue</a> at the weekend, the emergency protocol for when temperatures hit as low as minus 22, which results in homeless people being brought in off the streets. In my building, the heating was cranked up from retirement-home warm to palm-house tropical, the kind of indoor weather Americans expect and non-Americans guiltily enjoy while recalling, all over again, how strange this place is.</p>

Hi. You're right on the insulation. In contrast large parts of the UK housing stock and old hotels are poorly insulated and leak heat. It's an area where we could benefit from significant government investment/subsidy. The price of petrol should, by government intervention, reflect its long term scarcity and environmental damage not its short term oversupply. We could be compensated in other ways. N. America is like China in respect of centrally heated overheated buildings.

I worked in New york for quite a while,I really like small town Americans. New Yorkers? from another planet, interesting but very strange. All the apartments I went into had at least three industrial strength locks on steel doors, and that is with a doorman to keep out the riff raff. These were not in crummy parts of town.

Unfortunately this moving to the country seems to be what it takes to have a quiet life in the UK. It is not an option for every peaceable soul. Many have to work in the big cities and cannot afford to move out. Others belong to racial minorities and are made to seem foreigners outside the big cities. In the country where In am fortunately you can live a quiet life even in the biggest cities. There are plenty of immigrants here but the pubic culture does not valorise sheer thuggery as in the UK.

An interesting point. Energy is a lot cheaper in NA than in anywhere in Europe that I know about. Even petrol is about half the price. It's not good (for the environment, ffs) but it is good for individuals.

You would clearly know better than I. However I find it extremely hard to believe that rents are not significantly higher today than they were in 1992, even when adjusting for inflation. Don't forget there has been virtually zero wage growth for the middle and lower-classes in the US since then. Perhaps the difference is that 25 years ago it was actually possible for a new graduate such as yourself to live in Manhattan albeit with several roommates and not the nicest of accommodations (I'm assuming your debt burden wasn't high, as it wouldn't typically have been in that era, prior to tuition skyrocketing to the stratosphere). Today, even that would be next to impossible unless partially supported by parents or otherwise parachuted into a cushy bankster job through familial connections, or loaded up on debt.

There are, at any given moment, about 700,000 British subjects living in the US, not including those who have taken citizenship. While here, they all seem to love the place, or at least say they do. That's been my experience, anyway. Then I read the posts on the Guardian site, and it appears that, well they were lying-or "being polite," which in the final analysis seems quite similar.

'AFFORDABLE HOUSING for the middle-class, was trashed by Bloomberg's cronies, the Speyers, and turned into into an "oasis" where rents for 2 BR apartments went from $1500 a month to $5000 a month, or more? But that would entail actual journalism!

I lived in NYC then. Graduated university in 1989 and got my first job and moved into NYC in 1992, having grown up on Long Island. NYC was the same bloody fortune then that it is now. The only difference for me all these years later, is that I finally made a salary jump where I do not have to live at absolute desperation level. But believe me. rents in 1992 when you were making somewhere between $18-21k a year as a typical new grad, were murder and that was for a dumpy apartment shared w lots of roommates. Unless you somehow illegally accessed a rent controlled or rent stabilized place.

As a Jewish person, I have absolutely no idea why you think this a predominantly Jewish co-op. Short of some of the Hasidic neighborhoods in Bklyn, I think the idea of "predominantly Jewish" in NYC is a form of bigotry in and of itself because even here, we still amount to a small percentage of the population so we cannot really be predominant.

No aggro where i live, quite quiet here tbh, friendly neighbours all around, never heard anyone exploding over a trifle here.Two primaries and a secondary on the doorstep, plenty greenery for organised sports, no real crime to speak of either.And no, it's not a rich part of town, it's an area filled with every age group, from young singles starting out to retired couples downsizing.Not everywhere is London, you know.

I have found that Londoners have the same attitude towards the rest of the UK. The only difference is that about 20% of the UK lives around London, while about 5% of the US lives around New York City.

High rise = a community. I think that was the main thrust of the story. But it has to be properly designed high rise, that's the key. It's silly to simply equate high rise with a community without examining the other factors that help make it a success. The Brutalist estates that were built in London and in some of the northern cities in Britain were largely failures that turned into drug estates.

I agree. Post-World War 2 architecture and urban planning in the UK has had disgracefully low ambitions, resulting, as you say, in the endless sprawl of mediocre 'toy town' housing estates on the outskirts of old towns and cities. The result? An epidemic of suburban depression, social alienation and other ills. Yet we still cling rather pathetically to that old adage "An Englishman's home is his castle..." Blah!

I've driven through practically every single suburb in Sydney. With a few exceptions, the vast majority (99%) of the Sydney metropolitan area is comprised of one and two storey McMansions, old 1970s red brick bungalows and fibros from the 1950s.
