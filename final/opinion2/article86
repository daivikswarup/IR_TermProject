If Britain Stronger in Europe sticks to these five lessons, it will win

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/what-does-boris-johnson-really-think-of-european-integration" title="">Boris Johnson backing Brexit</a> might make a good headline but his intervention is unlikely to mean Britain votes in his favour. Just look to the French rejection of the European constitution in 2005, the Irish voters vetoing the Lisbon treaty in 2008 and, way back in 1992, the Danes saying “nej” to the Maastricht treaty. Individuals were not responsible for these results, but rather the communication of better arguments and credible fears to the electorate.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Scaremongering rarely works and often backfires</p>

<p>Should Britain Stronger in Europe be worried by those referendum results? Not really. They were exceptions. In fact, the vast majority of all referendums on the EU have resulted in victory for those wanting more integration – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-923X.12224/abstract" title="">74% of the 58 cases, in fact</a>. On average the percentage supporting the European Union has been over 60%.</p>

<p>Having researched and having advised governments and opposition parties on referendums for the past 20 years, I have narrowed down the art of winning to five lessons:</p>

<p>Britain Stronger in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> must highlight concrete and credible pitfalls of Brexit like the Danish government did in 1972. The Danes ran a campaign called “the price of a no”, in which they compared the prices of selected groceries in the event of a vote to join the EEC (the name of the EU before 1994) with the prices of the same items in the event of a rejection. One poster showed bag of ground coffee and the simple caption: “If you vote yes this will cost 12 kroner, if you vote no it will cost 15 kroner”. The prospect of price increases outside the EEC gave the pro-European government a boost of 10% in the final days of the referendum.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/iain-duncan-smith-uk-risks-paris-style-attacks-by-staying-in-the-eu" title="">Outlandish claims</a> rarely work and often backfire. The Dutch government made the fanciful suggestion in 2005 that a “no” to the European constitution would result in the return of the Third Reich. Without a European constitution to tie the Germans in – so ran the implausible argument – they would once again turn to the National Socialism. This rather fanciful argument saw a clear majority melt away. Voters are not fools and when politicians treat them as such they will punish them by voting no.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/22/cameron-deal-eu-europe-peter-mandelson">Cameron’s deal is a chance to make the EU work. Seize it | Peter Mandelson</a> </p>

<p>In 2003, the Swedish elite – such as Volvo’s chairman Per Gyllenhammar and the prominent entrepreneur Birgitta Ed – endorsed the euro. Eurosceptics responded by asking simple questions about their personal finances. This resonated with voters and Swedes voted against joining the euro.</p>

<p>A referendum is about issues, not individuals. Politicians are used to dealing in personal attacks and character assassinations. This might work in elections but it tends not to in referendums.</p>

<p>In 2015, in the referendum on whether to join Europol, the Danish government highlighted the questionable ethics of the far-right Eurosceptic MEP <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/25/danish-peoples-party-triumphant-in-european-elections" title="">Morten Messerschmidt</a>, feeding the media salacious details about the rightwing politician’s abuse of public money. Danish voters did not approve of his antics, but it didn’t affect how they voted. The personal campaign against him backfired and the voters said no.</p>

<p>Winning a referendum is about setting the agenda as much as convincing voters. Britain Stronger in Europe cannot tell people what to think, but it can tell people what to think about. So it should be specific: talk about the economy, jobs, and so-called “bread-and-butter issues”. Appeals to lofty principles such as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.facebook.com/borisjohnson/posts/10153023611636317" title="">sovereignty</a> might exercise law professors and anoraks, but ordinary voters have little time for political philosophy when they enter the ballot box.</p>

<p>Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://" title="">once said</a> that you “campaign in poetry but govern with prose”. Referendums are different. They are won by prose, not poetic musing. If the campaign to remain highlights the concrete and credible fears, by appealing to ordinary voters’ concerns and by making this a clear and simple message, it will win.</p>

<p>David Cameron’s negotiating tactics may not have been impressive last week and his decision to hold a referendum in the first place was perhaps unwise. But if the remain campaign can learn the lessons of previous referendums, the United Kingdom will still be a member of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> after 23 June.</p>

I shall be. I don’t regard it as politically different from living in Britain. The English Channel shouldn’t make any difference. You can have cultural variation, certainly, but I don’t like the idea of people being defined in a politically national way. The possible similarities or differences between someone who lives in Canterbury and someone who lives in Chester should be assumed to have the same possible range as between either of them and someone who lives in Nantes. I like the idea of being European.

You do realizes your comments are typically xenophobic towards Britains, right? What's the EU brought to France, exactly? A limping economy? Failed socialism? Maybe you ought to worry more about the National Front or the terrorists that are bound to rise again and again across mainland Europe because we don't control our borders or even check the identities of those who do pass through.

Not sure the EU like democracy, you've even got Hollande suggesting that any right-wing governments that get elected should be suspended or elected from having any sort of say in the union. This is a pet project of using the left to overwhelm any sort of common sense and steal away personal freedoms.

Good advice, but some comments on the lessons:Lesson one – highlight the dangers is close to scaremongering but the example form Denmark on the price of offd will not work as food will be cheaper out of the EU as we will not have to subsidise inefficient French markets and can buy on the cheaper world marketsLesson two – avoid scaremongering, which is difficult to follow now as the Remain side have said that, in no particular order, the UK would be alone.. holidays would be more expensive…no one would like us.. phone calls would be more expensive Lesson three – don’t cosy up to big business and the wealthy which is where the Remain campaign, funded by the big banks and specifically Goldman Sachs, has meant that they appear to be representing big business but not the general publics.Lesson four – avoid personal attacks which I wish someone would mention to Anna Soubry and David Cameron Lesson five – set the agenda which is where Cameron has tried to do by saying “trust me” which is a risky request for any politician and particularly for him bearing in mind his “cast-iron guarantee” of a referendum on the Lisbon Treat not fulfilled and the fact that even this thin his deal does not deliver what he promised in his manifesto and can be changed after the vote by MEP and struck down by the European court

The pound will plummet with Brexit. I reckon that about half the UK citizens living in the EU whose revenue originates in pounds sterling won't be able afford continuing to live there. So UK immigration figures will suddenly rise by about half a million.

I think the principle of "no man is an island" comes into play here. The UK may be an island (or an island, less than half of another island and various little islands) geographically speaking, but it’ s not a good idea for it to act as an island politically. A country can’t just "run its own affairs" without that having an effect on other countries’ affairs and, as we sadly know, those effects have sometimes been disastrous. I would rather have the security of everyone under the same rules. It doesn’t seem plausible that what is socially desirable is relative among societies – freedom and justice are freedom and justice: the idea that there is a French justice and freedom and Italian ones and British ones and that they can all be different doesn’t seem plausible to me. Better to work together to find a common agreement on what is just and fair and sign up to it. I’m sure the future lies in togetherness, eventually a togetherness of the whole planet. That need not mean cultural sameness.

This is true if they are filling genuine gaps in local provision. But when a business recruits entire workforces directly from the eastern nations without even looking at what is on their doorstep its not a great idea at all. And when they tell them that in addition to their wages they can get help with housing costs and generous tax credits to boost take home pay they are really not helping local people at all.
