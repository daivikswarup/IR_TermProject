My nerdy hero is the star of Making a Murderer

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>ike many people who have just binge-watched all 10 episodes of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/30/making-a-murderer-netflix-show-another-blow-to-our-confidence-in-americas-police" title="">Making a Murderer</a>, the extraordinary Netflix documentary about a man accused of a killing in small-town Wisconsin, I have become mildly obsessed with attorney <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/04/dean-strang-making-a-murderer-netflix-sex-symbol" title="">Dean Strang</a>. He acted as defence counsel for Steven Avery, the man who many believe was falsely convicted of murdering Teresa Halbach in 2005 and is serving a life sentence without parole.</p>

<p>In the 10-year-old trial footage Strang appears, floppy-haired and nerdy, as the voice of reason in a landscape peopled almost entirely by characters who seem to have stepped out of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/coenbrothers" title="">Coen brothers</a> movie. Strang’s incredulity at the flaws in the US justice system, his flights of eloquence and shocked reaction to Manitowoc county law enforcement’s more questionable tactics make him the hero of the piece and a rare corrective to the image of the slimy trial lawyer. At the end of the documentary he says of his client, “I just hope he is guilty.” Because if he isn’t, the implications are too awful.</p>

<p>Strang still works as a defence lawyer in Madison, Wisconsin, and is an adjunct law professor at the university there. He has been in the media a lot in the US this week and it has been striking how unsuited he is to daytime TV – he is altogether too sober and mumbly. Neither does he fit the mould of rock-star lawyer, the byproduct of permitting TV cameras into the US court system that has thrown up, over the years, the likes of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gloria-allred" title="">Gloria Allred</a> and OJ’s representative <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/31/guardianobituaries.usa" title="">Johnnie Cochran</a>.</p>

<p>In the Avery case, it wasn’t hard for Strang to look good when the opposing counsel, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/05/arts/television/ken-kratz-making-a-murderer.html?_r=0" title="">Ken Kratz</a>, came across as less of a lawyer than a circus ringmaster, staging absurdly theatrical press conferences and later <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/09/27/wisconsin.da.scandal/index.html" title="">resigning as district attorney after a sexting scandal</a>. Nonetheless, Strang is so articulate, with such quiet, understated integrity that, by the end of the series, he too seems like a character from fiction.</p>

<p>“It’s been a lot,” he said mildly, of the huge response to the series. Here’s hoping no one gives him a makeover.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>I streamed a lot of music over Christmas, in the course of which I happened across an album called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No%C3%ABl_Coward_at_Las_Vegas" title="">Noël Coward at Las Vegas</a>. (The “at” in this sentence is such a perfect assertion of English over American idiom that one imagines it came from Coward himself.) It was recorded in 1955 at the Desert Inn and features his most famous hits, including a rendition of Cole Porter’s Let’s Do It. At the end of the song, Coward changed the lyrics to appeal to the local audience, so he sang, “teenagers squeezed into jeans do it” and “even Liberace we assume does it” – a dangerous reference given that, a few years later, Liberace would successfully sue the Daily Mirror for implying he was homosexual. More often forgotten is the fact that Porter’s original lyrics were far more offensive. “Chinks do it, Japs do it,” sang Porter in the original, lines that were swiftly excised. The familiar “birds/bees” configuration sits more easily.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/24/irobot-roomba-880-review-robotic-vacuum-cleaner-thats-almost-a-pet" title=""><strong>My male cleaner</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>

<p>Is your vacuum cleaner male or female? I ask because I realise I have been referring to my <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/24/irobot-roomba-880-review-robotic-vacuum-cleaner-thats-almost-a-pet" title="">Roomba</a> as male. (He managed to shut himself in the bathroom last week and battered hysterically against the door until I let him out.) The car is a she, so is the GPS, although that is by design. Most computer voices are female, except in Germany, where BMW, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://cuindependent.com/2010/09/23/german-drivers-refuse-directions-for-female-voice-gps/18290/" title="">reportedly</a> recalled the voice system on the 5 Series after hundreds of German men complained they wouldn’t take directions from a woman. The male vacuum cleaner feels like a rebuke to all this, particularly when a friend says hers is definitely female because, after all, “who else is going to do the cleaning?”</p>

The most villainous of many villains in Making a Murderer are the attorney who first represented Brendan Dassey and his investigator, Len Kachinsky and Michael O'Kelly. Their attitudes and behavior could not have been more wrong. They played the bad cop to the prosecution's good cop and both should have lost their licenses.

Dont know if you are American , so we have over here had many historical high profile , media event cases where only the flimsiest circumstantial evidence was bolstered by hard scientific evidence of chemicals the jury was told could only come from explosives , this evidence supplied by the very best forensic scientists was seen by both sides as being rock solid science was not challenged for years and then when it was it was by a tv documentary who exposed the test used would show many everyday products would give positive results , test of dna etc that are destructive of the evidence used as a sample should be avoided the thing about science is to be of any use it must be repeatable . Evidence of just one piece of fabricated , planted evidence should be enough to make you at least question the rest .An example would be O.J.Simpson i believe evidence was manipulated and also maybe planted "If it doesn't fit " enough to give the jury doubts that this went the other way perhaps has had an effect on juries in making them question the motives of "city slicker" liberal lawyers . I am in no way a forensic expert ( my niece is a police officer who works high profile crime scenes and she has loaned me some of her text books , she at times supervises doctors doing rape kits to make sure the doctor does not miss anything vital )but in a case where the prosecution and ( this does not happen here ) even the police are elected in a small community not blessed with the best system get real career boosting benefits from a conviction in a high profile case , this also happens here though at a higher level so maybe more dangerous , and where we have been pre programmed to the idea of a "good " rogue cop , up against a corrupt system who gets a free pass and can even be admired .There were several occasions where officers of the law both prosecution and defence raised their eyebrows at any talk about Avery,s first conviction being unjust , despite the as i have mentioned been proven by repeatable scientific evidence .The thing would have been to have a re trial and a judge with more experience in more complex cases ( this happens here ) up to date on best scientific practice , the first court appointed lawyer and his legal assistant should be barred from practising law at all ,America like in so many things claims to have the best system in the world USA ! USA ! when it comes to the legal system that is not even close to the one we are so lucky to have , however as i pointed out even ours are not perfect perhaps no system is but around the world the system based on the British , works better , is better by far than the cut and pasted system they have in the states .Your FBI is excellent though , the reason ? they are professionals , not citizens with little training and being professional at the end of the day like our barristers they loose little sleep over a lost case , they don't take it personally they don't bear grudges that in the Avery case lasted 20 years .

The investigators interviewing Brendan alone on multiple occasions are by far the most disgusting moments in the series. Even if it's somehow legal to question a minor by himself when minors are more easily influenced than adults, how can you say it's ethical to do so especially when Brendan clearly has some kind of mental disability? And then on one occasion Brendan's own attorney allowed him to be questioned without a guardian or attorney present. Why is this allowed?

Aside from the Netflix series, other documentaries have been done on Avery, and it was widely reported on at the time. I do believe some evidence was planted, but as I already stated, a lot of evidence was left out of this series.

The series pointed out the flaws in our justice system, and I admire his lawyers for fighting that. I first read about Avery when the murder of Halbach occurred, and the series does leave out crucial evidence pointing to Avery's guilt. Personally, I think Avery is guilty.

Consider also the case of Timothy Masters. Convicted of murdering a woman, he was nine years in jail before being exonerated. He was convicted because the lieutenant investigating the murder decided it was him and manufactured a case against him based solely on supposition and innuendo. Guy-Paul Morin was convicted of murdering Christine Jessup because he lived next door to her, repaired old cars and kept bees--clearly a weirdo, in the opinion of the investigators!

"Birds do it bees do it" is one of the original lyrics as well, "bees" rhymes with "over-educated fleas". If you want to replace the offensive lyric, you need something that doesn't disrupt the rhyme, such as "Girls do it, chaps do it", "chaps" to rhyme with "laps."

The way the detectives fed Brendan his lines and coerced confessions out of him, considering his obviously poor mental health, looked completely like child abuse.

I drove a 5 series hire car over Christmas, and Frauline Auto was wonderful. Her instructions saved hours in traffic snag-ups and her patience when dealing with her stupid Herr Britisher driver was infinite. Her voice was reassuring and her instructions a godsend. Those daft German men don't know a good thing when they hear it...

I have to admit, I was not familiar with this case or the original. As I watched I started Googling to see if this was for real... only to find that this was not a mockumentary at all! The feelings you get watching this of horror, hope and then immediately afterwards hopelessness. We like to think 'only in America' - then we remember cases like that of Damilola Taylor...

Watch The Memphis 3 - the DA on that case still maintains the innocent men found guilty will be found guilty again if a new trial were held. Truly mind boggling how these people even get to these lofty positions.

It is not Star Wars but a real life case that has been a feature of more than one article in the press over the years and of many on web sites , the fascination is watching how the system works .We have not got a system where elected officials are involved , our system has its faults but at least we don't have lawyers using a difficult case with real victims on both sides and used as campaign material to get up the ladder it invites corruption it invites bad practice , shame on you America .

With lawyers like Len Kachinksy being appointed as your defence lawyer ? well you need all the help you can get . This doofus was for me the star of a show that goes some way to explain how the US is Number (Yay !) one beating China and Russia in the number of its citizens locked up . It looked to me as though the power of prayer and good old evangelical bigotry held more sway in those courts than solid scientific evidence . Who killed that girl ? I honestly don't know , but we do know that the man jailed definitely did not do the rape that he served 18 years for , yet the prosecution lawyers and police did not believe the science of DNA in that instance , and other facts did not add up like why was the only blood evidence from the victim in a vehicle that if used to move the body a few yards ? why .

I do like Strang and I also like the other defence lawyer, he reminds me more of someone acting in a drama than an actual lawyer. He has a look of Alan Alda about him......I think I'm developing a man crush!!

It was a very enjoyable insight watching Strang and the other defence lawyer talking through elements of the case with each other. Struck me as two intelligent and competent professionals, both with a level of integrity not necessarily associated with the profession.
