Donald Trump's campaign violence is condoned all the way to the top

<p>When will the first pro-Donald Trump murder happen?<br/></p>

<p>The incidents are piling up. A Black Lives Matters protester was<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/mar/10/donald-trump-rally-black-man-sucker-punch-north-carolina-video"> sucker-punched</a> by a white bystander at a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina. A young black woman<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theroot.com/articles/news/2016/03/trump_watch_young_black_woman_assaulted_at_kentucky_rally.html"> was surrounded and shoved aggressively</a> by a number of individuals at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky. A black protester was<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/11/22/3724879/donald-trump-black-lives-matter-protester-beating/"> tackled, then punched and kicked</a> by a group of men as he curled up on the ground in Birmingham, Alabama. Immigration activists were<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.yahoo.com/trump-rally-gives-way-shoving-yelling-amid-latino-024244055.html"> shoved and stripped of their signs</a> by a crowd in Richmond, Virginia. A Latino protester was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://time.com/4090437/donald-trump-violence-protests-republican-debate/">knocked down and kicked</a> by a Trump supporter in Miami.</p>

<p>At a press conference on Friday morning Trump even seemed to encourage violence at his rallies. “We’ve had some violent people as protesters,” he said. “These are people that punch. These are violent people.” (No such videos have been found.) This adds to evidence piling up that the Trump campaign’s culture of violence extends all the way to the top.</p>

<p>Another incident happened Thursday, when Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbed the arm of Breitbart news reporter Michelle Fields at an event in Jupiter, Florida, jerking her so hard he bruised her body and made her cry, according to a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/inside-trumps-inner-circle-his-staffers-are-willing-to-fight-for-him-literally/2016/03/10/4b2b18e8-e660-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html">first-person account</a> by the Washington Post’s Ben Terris. That Breitbart is a Trump-friendly publication was likely lost on Lewandowski in his fervor to stave off questions from the scrum. That Terris in his story vividly describes the finger-shaped bruises he saw forming on Fields’ forearm, and that she <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/MichelleFields/status/708005032839548929/photo/1">tweeted out a photo</a> of her injury, hasn’t stopped the Trump campaign from denying the incident ever occurred. The story is the most important one yet, because it distills Trump’s culture of violence and subsequent denial. </p>

<p>I should know, because it’s exactly what I felt at the rally I attended in Radford, Virginia, earlier this month. It was the now infamous event where a secret service agent grabbed a Time photographer by the neck and threw him viciously to the ground simply because he dared to step over the confines of a press pen to photograph a Black Lives Matters protester. These press pens (or as one reporter at the event referred to it, “the cage”) are familiar to anyone who has covered candidate Trump; tightly restricting the press and barring the media from events is a central feature of the campaign.</p>

<p>In Radford, I was one such reporter denied access to the event, not because I wasn’t on the list, but because I was afraid for my body. Despite arriving with plenty of time, I was unable to make my way to the door where members of the media were allowed to enter since it involved bypassing Trump supporters who asked me who I was and why I thought I could cut in front of them. “Sure you’re media,” a guy almost twice my size said as I tried to slide past him. “I’m media too,” he added, before moving to physically block my access. When I finally got close enough to talk to security – complete with guns and dogs – I was told I had to go a different way, an impossibility given the masses. A similarly banished AP reporter who regularly covers Trump events told me this was par for the course with his campaign.</p>

<p>Later that day, after I’d <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/29/trump-rally-photographer-secret-service-protests">written up</a> the incident of Time photographer Christopher Morris being thrown to the ground by a secret service agent inside the gymnasium where the event was taking place, Trump defenders tweeted that I couldn’t possibly link the actions of a single security guy to the Trump campaign. The argument seemed unlikely – an organizer from Radford University had told me the school had had very little involvement in putting together the event, that the Trump campaign handled almost everything – but hard to definitely refute.</p>

<p>Now it’s possible to call bullshit. Now we know the culture of violence is set at the top, at least as high as the actions of Trump’s right-hand man.</p>

<p>The Lewandowski incident and the one at Radford feature the assault of the press, not the assault of protesters, but both types of violence are of a piece: they are about silencing voices of dissent, silencing critics, silencing truth in a campaign built around racist fear-mongering and bombast.</p>

<p>And that – it shouldn’t need to be said, but it does – is undemocratic. Activism and the media play a vital role in any healthy democracy, and to allow this kind of brutality and silencing of free speech to go unaddressed is worse than undemocratic: it’s fascist.</p>

<p>The Trump campaign knows as much, and so it has repeatedly distanced itself from the most overt incidents of violence, even as it dog whistles its approval. The latest incident implicating Trump’s campaign manager is no different.</p>

<p>“The accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false,” campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a Thursday statement. “As one of the dozens of individuals present as Mr Trump exited the press conference I did not witness any encounter. In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.”</p>

<p>This jaw-dropping statement came in response to the story published by Terris, who was, it should go without saying, in attendance and saw (and reported!) the assault. That makes him by definition a witness, of the most useful sort, and it makes Hicks’s statement patently absurd – or, to put it bluntly, a lie. And Thursday night, the campaign went even further, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/CLewandowski_/status/708162663579144192">Lewandowski calling Fields “delusional”</a> and Trump himself suggesting “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/politics/donald-trump-breitbart-reporter-michelle-fields-corey-lewandowski/">she made it up</a>”. This despite a credible eyewitness confirming the victim’s account, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/03/transcript-corey-lewandowski-breitbart-reporter-attack-220589">as well as publicly available audio</a> corroborating it. </p>

<p>Trump purports to be the great defender of free speech. He rages against what he deems to be “politically correct” culture because it silences the things (usually bigoted) that he and his supporters really feel and think, things he believes must be said – but now he’s the one doing the silencing. Never mind that politically correct culture never killed anyone. And never mind that at this rate, Trumpism surely will.</p>

I think we're heading for a 'They came, they heckled, they died' moment at a Trump rally too.

Stand-up comics get heckled, and how they handle it is with intelligence and wit. It seems Trump has neither.

The rabble manipulators are quick to spin this thuggery into some kind of noble protest. Blame is perfectly placed at the feet of carpet bagger Democrats. The "protestors" are being used by reptiles that lust for power.

Trump supporters are NOT "all racist bigots." Many if not most are fear-based and ignorant (thanks to decades of Republican Party attacks on U.S. public schools), also somehow sense they have NO WAY the kind of skills required to survive in the 21st century. So, rather than look in the mirror, face their fears and DO SOMETHING to improve their skills and their attitudes, they are gleefully supporting Trump as their Evangelical Savor -- who joins them in their "hate" (terror, actually) of anyone different from Teensy Tiny Them.

So is your point that media reporters must remain out of public? The correspondence dinner is an event honoring/roasting people in the news industry. Why wouldn't they be there? Are reporters not people and citizens too? Should it be illegal for them to file charges when assaulted?

I watched the video of the young man getting punch, I then looked up,what transpired in the US media. It appears that a group of people went on purpose to cause eruptions at a trump rally. The man who was attacked was winding up the crowd, yes he was punched by an angry bigot, but really. Would we say the same if a kKK bigot was allowed to strut his stuff at a black rally . Maybe there lies the reason he was arrested, Finally the very people who are so quick to castigate all trump supporters as racist bigots are the same ones who quite correctly say that not all Muslims should be seen as terrorists based on the actions of a few idiots.

Uh no. You don't seem to know Trump. He is not image conscious, if he was he wouldn't walk around with that awful comb over. He is monumentally narcissistic. There is a difference. While he is a savvy media manipulator he is incredibly thoughtless. He seems to lack emotional maturity and says destructive things off the top of his head without any thought to the consequences. Then later lies and denies oblivious to things like video recording and records.

Nah he isn't worth the effort. Trump is this elections Sarah Palin. He is a giant polarizing exciting turd running against other lackluster turds in the GOP. He will not be President. Then you will see a monumental temper tantrum. Then he will fuck off into sad obscurity when the media tires of him just like Sarah.

You might get roughed up and that wouldn't be right. It's not right when it happens here either. Trump supporters are the first to whine about how being politically correct curbs THEIR free speech but they seem to have little tolerance for allowing others to exercise their right to free speech. Intelligent decent people don't fight words with fists.

I'm watching the brouhaha going on in Chicago at the cancelled Trump Rally. I noticed some Bernie signs and how can I say this tactfully. The folks holding the signs were not going to take anybody's shit, have their signs removed or express an ounce of fear. The bigots and the racists, aka, Drumpf Supporters, were not going to get their jolly's off this night in this racially complex and much more integrated city.

Yeah sparky those announcements at the beginning of his rallies are a recent addition IN RESPONSE TO THE VIOLENT INCIDENTS PERPETRATED BY HIS FOLLOWERS AT HIS RALLIES, and you can bet the only reason his campaign is trying to appear like they are trying to keep down the violence is because it's gotten media attention.

So would you describe the out-of-control protests in Ferguson and elsewhere during which random whites (who showed up in support of black victims of police) were beaten to a pulp... as "fascist"? Or does this definition only apply to rich white people who are non-PC and and "suspect" on the pseudo-left alarmist curve?

Well, fascist rallies tend to become characterised by violence insofar as this is how violent feelings can most fully express themselves i.e. aggressively. trump anyway is not so much a crowd pleaser as a mob agitator. Trump has clearly garnered much of the notable crowd working skills of the European fascists with imperial ambitions who slouched their way into 20th century history. They also looked ridiculous & appealed to irrational raw emotion. What they orchestrated, encouraged & then developed was socially devestating, culturally destructive & downright dangerous. America, for one, has clearly yet to properly learn the lessons of recent European history & thus runs riskily close to replicating its many fatal errors - imperialistic, self centered excess very much amongst.

I go to Trump's rally to hear Trump. I do not go to hear some loud mouth loser screaming and shouting abuse next to me and interrupting Trump telling me what I come to hear. If that idiot and moron won't shut up after several cautions and warnings, I conclude that he is itching for a fight. And if that's what he wants, that's what he will get. I am not going to just sit there and be robbed of my freedom and civil rights in Free America by a total bozo who is out of control. Either he shuts up or I will shut him up. And that has nothing to do with the color of his skin. Whether he is black, white, yellow or green, I will shut him up if he won't shut down. End of story.

Trump is no defender of free speech but, out of all candidates, one of it's greatest threats. He wants to expand libel laws to not just include provable slander an injury but to also mere criticism. He is a disgraceful excuse of a human being and it's no surprise he attracts the most shameful losers as followers.

Interesting aspect of the Trump phenom are the number of idiot comparisons and "damning" caricatures i.e small hands, Hitler, racist etc that ironically only succeed in driving his numbers upwards. Guess these detractors must just love the rotten, institutional shitfest that is the current state-of-affairs in Washington. At least Camille Paglia gets it, notwithstanding her support for Sanders. The tired demonizing of Trump by the pseudo-left is so predictable but when you really think about it - severely myopic. The energy and change Trump represents is badly needed in order to break the stranglehold of a corrupt kleptocracy, unless of course you are wed to neocon logic. That retrograde thinking on foreign policy crosses party lines and infects Clinton as much as Rubio. Trump despite his many deficits, doesn't buy into that defunct narrative.

The people who go along to a Trump rally just to disrupt it are themselves using violence. Knowing that they might get evicted - or even a punch in the mouth - might deter them. That's how it used to be. Kinda makes more sense.
