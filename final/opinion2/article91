You can’t build a northern powerhouse if you undermine the local schools

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>oday, two directions of travel for education policy have been set out. One comes from Ofsted, whose chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, this morning called for a programme of collaboration and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/23/underperforming-schools-in-liverpool-and-manchester-putting-northern-powerhouse-plans-at-risk" title="">partnership between local councils, communities and school leaders</a> to turn around failing schools in the parts of the country where stubborn underperformance prevails. This includes the area where my own children go to school – Manchester.</p>

<p>Wilshaw says that the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/northern-powerhouse-cities-devolution-england-manchester-george-osborne" title="">“northern powerhouse”</a> will “splutter and die” if youngsters in the north are not given the excellent education and skills they need to succeed later on in life, not only holding back the prospects of young people in these areas, but also risking the economic and stability of this region as a whole.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/feb/23/underperforming-schools-in-liverpool-and-manchester-putting-northern-powerhouse-plans-at-risk">Underperforming schools 'putting northern powerhouse plans at risk'</a> </p>

<p>The other proposal comes from the government, whose first education bill of the parliament returns to the House of Commons today. This bill is the ideological outlet for the Tories’ obsession with school structures: a part of their plan to convert every school to an academy in a further centralisation of powers in Whitehall. Rather than play a key role in the so-called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/06/osborne-devolution-tories" title="">“devolution revolution”</a>, this bill actually cuts parents and local communities further out of the schools landscape, removing the requirement for local consultation over what should happen to failing schools.</p>

<p>The difference between these two directions of travel could not be starker. As the government is taking another step towards deeper fragmentation within the schools landscape and more isolated schools, Ofsted joins the voices calling for more intensive, localised action and collaboration to turn around systemic failure.</p>

<p>It is Wilshaw who is right. For years, it has been evident that strong local partnerships and collaboration, alongside effective high-quality teaching and leadership in schools, are essential to raise standards and turn around persistent underperformance once and for all. There was nothing inevitable about the improvements that London schools made under the last Labour government. It was the concerted effort by local headteachers, politicians, councils, businesses and communities to work together and take collective, robust action that was at the heart of the transformation in schools at that time. Today, schools in the city far outperform the majority elsewhere. There is no reason why other pupils in the country cannot have, or do not deserve, the same dynamic success that London has seen.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">It has been evident that strong local partnerships and collaboration are key to raising standards</p>

<p>Yet the Tories’ only strategy for standards is to continue to splinter the schools system and centralise control in Whitehall. This could not be further from what we know works in school improvement. And it will hinder the success of the regions that are so key to the government’s own agenda. The realisation of the northern powerhouse fundamentally depends on ensuring that all young people in the area get the excellent education they deserve, in order to fulfil their potential. Any action the government takes on securing the powerhouse will ultimately be for nothing if standards for pupils in the north fail to improve.</p>

<p>The examples the Wilshaw draws on today, such as Greater Manchester and Liverpool, are not unique. Overall, almost <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/483347/Ofsted_annual_report_education_and_skills.pdf" title="">a third of secondary schools in the north-east are less than good</a>. There are 16 local authorities around the country where less than 60% of children attend good or outstanding secondary schools, achieve lower than national results at GCSE and are also behind in terms of expected progress. While the government’s sole tool for school improvement is “academisation”, in some of these areas every single one of these schools is already an academy. The key question this government has failed to answer for these areas is, “what now?” It simply has no plan or understanding of how to drive up standards here. All the while, far too many children are being left to fall behind.</p>

<p>These areas are crying out for local leadership. Despite this, the government continues down the road that removes communities from the picture and leaves local leaders feeling powerless to intervene when they finally hear of problems in schools.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/northern-powerhouse-cities-devolution-england-manchester-george-osborne">George Osborne’s ‘northern powerhouse’ project will devastate whole cities | Leo Hollis</a> </p>

<p>So while Wilshaw is right, it is also vital that we recognise that we must enable local communities to play their part in supporting their schools. In order to have the dramatic impact that is required to improve the life chances of young people in these parts of the country, there must be a better joined-up and strategic approach to school improvement and local oversight, which encourages collaboration and fosters innovation and partnership between all stakeholders – school leaders, councillors, multi-academy trusts, businesses and parents. In <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/greater-manchester">Greater Manchester</a> and Liverpool, for example, mayors should be given powers and a key role in turning these cities into centres of educational excellence, helping to deliver the change in standards that local pupils deserve.</p>

<p>It no longer makes any sense to leave schools outside the localism agenda. If the government means what it says about a northern powerhouse, it must rethink its approach to oversight and accountability in schools. Every day children fall further behind in these parts of the country is a day too long. Rather than continuing to waste time obsessing over whether a school is an academy or free school or whatever, the government should now focus on delivering a robust system of local oversight that supports collaboration between families of schools everywhere. By now it should have realised that it doesn’t have that time to waste.</p>

O level was designed for 25% rather than 15%. The GCSE was Joseph rather than Baker, and the process you describe was not what he had in mind, though it is pretty much what happened. I want academic rigour in the exams, but it is also possible to give a gentle slope in the entry grades - I prefer entry grades to lower grades, as everyone can achieve something. Results will not necessarily go down in real terms, but I agree with you wholeheartedly on the issue of literacy and numeracy. The latest pupils I've taught the 2x table are 13 and 16.

No John.You know very well what I am talking about.When O level was in existence it was clear that it was only appropriate for maybe 15%of kids. CSE was a kind of pitiful pseudoacademic consolation prize. Baker tried to disguise and merge the academic with the non academic via GCSE which has been generally accepted to be an utter utter "one size fits all disaster "Trouble is basic but very necessary learning skills for all pupils whether they are academic or not has been neglected over the years. Very badly neglected too,I refer to the three R's of course. Now ,the standards of literacy and numeracy are poor across the board even amongst the academic minority. 24%of UK adults functionally illiterate. That is fact and not a good one is it for a so called developed nation. The new style GCSEs of course are an utter farcical mish mash of smokescreenesque grading systems which nobody understands. Results will go down down in real terms because the examination is much more academically rigorous. The big hit will come next year when the A level results will catastrophically plummet. So keep it real Q.Kick on

You are accepting the "academic" and "non-academic" divide of the 1944 Act. For some reason, I never have, and feel it is too simple. Sir Michael showed as a headteacher that it is inadequate.

The simple facts are these. In the so called under performing schools of Manchester and Liverpool the majority of the kids are not academic. The notion of using academic attainment as guide to whether a school in an inner city is "underachieving ,under performing or has the appropriate distributing of grades at GCSE " is just not relevant and never will be either. So basic literacy,numeracy, communication skills, PSHE, etc etc should be the broad aims shouldn't they?It is the that need a team effort and some.The fact is that the majority in our schools ie the non academic are not being catered for,yet are being judged against the kids who are academic but in the minority. Utter utter lunacy An indictment of our education system which is now very definitely in terminal and irretrievable meltdown. In any case very few teachers want to work in inner city schools . Increasingly few want to teach in any school Keep it real Y'all

Ms Powell must have been pleased when Wales, governed by Labour, decided to go against the government's programme for expanding the academies. The results, however, show that Wales has been consistently close to bottom of the class in Europe in PISA results in reading and maths - and far below England. In fact it's worse than many third-world nations in this. It's become a basket case.Similarly, most of the northern authorities which are failing according to the Wilshaw report, are in councils run by Labour and deeply resistant to government policy.Look at facts, not ideology, Ms P. (And when the facts are clear, try changing your mind. You'll be amazed at the difference it makes in your world!)

I'm not paying him less than the minimum wage. he does the job in 10m minutes. Potentially earning £15 an hour. Your point that people don't work in the North because of the benefits they're receiving is nonsense. That's the point I'm making. People work up here and they work competitively. I'd argue there's far less fat on our systems than London.

Yes, this is an issue of education but it is even more an issue of environment. Look, I'm from the bottom end of society and lived in one of those anonymous industrial cities. It was my great good fortune that once, aged about thirteen, our class went to the Birmingham Art Gallery where I set my eyes on their collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. It was like the turning on of the sun, that miraculous enabling that turns gasses to a great purpose.

the "Northern powerhouse" is a tory sop to pretend they care about the north. Manchester gets the tory love because Bodgit George's constituency is nearby. But Manchester is not the north and unlike the mas urban sprawl of London the North is a series of separate cities and towns with their own identity and needs. To congeal the north into one homogeneous mass tells you what the tories know.

"he's actually asking local politicians to put pressure on schools when they receive poor Ofsted ratings." - this is just bluster because they need power to have any meaning to this - and taking the schools out of local control takes away the power - which is the point of the article.

It's the same theme in these responses again, though. In the good old days, things were "taught", children had to "know". My daughter "knew" how to count to 20 before she was two. It took a lot more engagement and application of number before she started to grasp what "20" meant - or indeed any other number. I've yet to meet an employer who could (or wanted to) give me a reason why anyone might want to employ someone based on how early they memorised their times tables. Usually they want the numeracy that comes with long hours of engagement with numbers and numerical relationships - the deep and far-reaching understanding that allows one to spot mistakes, and rapidly evaluate solutions. Pushing kids to memorise fact upon fact does nothing to attain that understanding and takes up valuable learning time, and our curriculum is currently more heavily factual-content-driven than I can remember ever setting it before.
