How do you radicalise a calm, dedicated doctor? Ask Jeremy Hunt




DateTime::::2016-03-10T15:07:41+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">O</span></span>n the second day of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/10/junior-doctors-begin-second-day-of-48-hour-strike" title="">third strike</a>, the junior doctors are standing as solid as ever, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35766166" title="">just over half are on strike</a>, with most of those not striking staying in to cover emergency work. Thousands more non-urgent operations are cancelled, adding to the backlog already growing due to the extreme pressure the NHS was under long before this.</p>

<p>It’s an impasse. The new contract has been imposed and the government has withdrawn from all further talks while these young-ish doctors have been radicalised by the way they have been treated: they look unlikely to buckle any time soon – on the picket lines, they are garnering waves of public support in beeps, claps and whistles.</p>

<p>“Our door is always open for talks”, says the BMA, but Jeremy Hunt’s door is slammed shut. Crucial to all this is public opinion: if Hunt thinks it will swing his way he may be making yet another of his serial miscalculations. So far, YouGov finds only 17% on his side, with a minority even of Tory voters thinking he’s “doing a good job”. The public backs the doctors, with 62% of the population believing they are overworked and giving that as the biggest cause of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.claims.co.uk/press/overworked-doctors" title="">medical compensation cases</a>.</p>

<p>Today’s latest figures on the state of the NHS show how badly it’s coping with its tightest ever financial squeeze. More than one in 10 patients are waiting longer than four hours in A&amp;E, the worst performance for more than a decade. The number of patients waiting in emergency departments to be admitted to hospital has spiked to almost 52,000, the worst since “trolley waits” started being recorded, and delays in discharging patients are also rising. The King’s Fund, sober health analysts, say: “These are symptomatic of the perfect storm through which NHS trusts are trying to steer – with pressures on services across the board. Most trusts are operating with very high bed occupancy which makes it difficult to respond to unexpected fluctuations in admissions.” Winter, say many health economists, is the new <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a> normal.</p>

<p>Hunt, brought in to pour oil on the boiling waters of the NHS after the wreckage of Andrew Lansley’s regime, has poured on petrol. And he keeps doing it. Cameron’s manifesto pledge of a “truly seven-day NHS” had no money attached. Why did Hunt start with the juniors, who already do more seven-day working than the rest? How did he think it could be done without adding any money to their pay? What’s needed for seven-day working is more diagnostics and other services, some outsourced, all of which cost a lot more. The seven-day trope has come under the microscope, with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h5624" title="">editor of the British Medical Journal indignant</a> at Cameron and Hunt’s abuse of weekend death rate figures, misused from research the BMJ published. Some 11,000 more people do not die at weekends. The fact that more of those admitted over those days die within 30 days has multiple causes, including the case mix of patients going into hospital Monday to Friday.</p>

<p>But all that makes it harder for the government to back down now. The consultants are next in line: will they be handled any better? Far from calming strife, Hunt is threatening to sack entire trust boards if they fail to both fix their debts and improve their quality – impossible under current pressure. This week he produced a new league table of shame listing the best and worst trusts at “learning from their mistakes”, which stirred even the supinely obedient NHS Confederation of employers to indignation at “crude use of data”. How many more parts of the NHS can he alienate and outrage?</p>

<p>This strike would have been centre-stage, with No 10 anxious about the deadlock, but political attention has been diverted to the pointless and destructive EU referendum, which has immersed Cameron in war with his own party. Two more two-day strikes are scheduled, and the question is who blinks first. Hunt is described inside NHS England as a dead man walking, expected to be removed in a post-referendum reshuffle – assuming remain wins, so Cameron remains. But three and a half months is too long to wait for a new minister to resolve this, as NHS waiting times lengthen. Making peace now would be the wise strategy, if No 10 were focusing.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, the NHS bill gets its second reading; put forward by Caroline Lucas, it is supported by Labour and a roll-call of the great and good and distinguished campaigning medics. It seeks to restore the NHS to a single unified service, ending the expensive and disruptive fragmentation caused by clinical commissioning groups purchasers tendering out services for providers to bid for. That is what Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, is trying to effect quietly, but he may not succeed without a change in the law, as private companies are already protesting if they are denied their legal right to bid.</p>

<p>Most strikes end badly and sadly, in my experience, with a compromise and a bit of a climb down on both sides, a deflating anticlimax for staff who have stirred up great collective endeavour. But this one will leave deep scars on the NHS that will last for years. These junior doctors, who work harder than almost anyone in Britain, will not forgive. They will become the consultants and NHS leaders of the future, and will be unlikely to acquiesce so easily to myriad abominations imposed by politicians for the sheer fun of re-disorganising the service from the top. The government should beware radicalising the cleverest, most dedicated, most popularly admired people in the public sector. Hunt will be long gone, but they will be there for decades. No 10 should remember that 98% of them voted for this strike, so it’s time to recognise Hunt’s monumental error and back down fast.</p>

Well does that also includes the local council bin collectors, gardeners, builders, miners.. versus say the members of parliaments, judges, pilots, company CEOs, accountants, lawyers. Thus without trying to twist the fact, you really mean those 2 typically groups of workers one who does more dirty and physically hard jobs should be paid more than those who don't. Or have I read you wrong? Right.....

I think doctors should actually start asking for a payrise (after 5 years of payfreeze) and not just strike to prevent the 30% paycut imposed by this new contract! It s only fair considering the workload has increased exponentially for junior doctors!

You re right ...doctors are not gods but slaves! How come you re saying that junior doctors are highly paid when, if you consider total hours worked their salary is £9.50 per hour!

Just waited for two hours in A&E with my little daughter nursing a broken arm, just to see the triage nurse; another two hours to get a cast on it. Home at 1am. Anyone who voted Tory needs to be a fair way out of arm's reach just now.

How is it radical to protest about negative changes to your contract? Doctors aren't asking for pay rises or even improved working conditions, they're asking for an unfair and unsafe contract not to be imposed upon them.

To be honest until everyone is well paid, you're still at risk. The nurse or HCA that missed your symptoms or was too busy to care? The fact of the matter is unless the government wants to raise taxation there is a finite pie to be sliced up and paying the best paid even more: consultants are massively overpaid, is a waste of resources as they then just get a lifestyle to match, work locum or private having part or fully retired.

Consultants earn good money, junior doctors don't. Aside from that, you're missing the point. If the doctors accept this deal, the nurses are next. Then the other allied health services and the care workers and the receptionists and ward clerks. The junior doctors are only the beginning and this contract will set the precedent for all of the other contract negotiations.

Junior doctors are doing their best to keep it that way. Hence why the sensible solution of cutting consultant pay and benefits and recruiting more juniors to help with the workload never entered the debate.

Let's think of another 20 years of tory governments. Consequences? These: Hardly any doctors, or hospitals; hardly any schools or teachers in the state sector but a few schools in the private sector, well staffed, but too expensive for ordinary people. The laws on having to send children to school relaxed, so that children don't have to attend school after the age of 12. An England - Scotland and Wales will be independent - back to Victorian times, with a few extremely rich people in government - the electorate has been organised so that only house owners and people earning above a government set salary will be able to vote. No need for Big Brother, we will be so demoralised, apathetic and compliant that elections will only be needed every 10 years. The tories will have a large number of Lynton Crosby's dripping poison.Job done, really and Cameron and his pals will all be elevated to Dukedoms or Earldoms.

I don't think anyone would deny the need for meaningful reform of the NHS, not least in terms of its integration with welfare and social care, effective management and administration and removal from political interference.I would be interested to know something about your experiences with/of the NHS that have led you to hold opinions on its current state that appear to me to be somewhat disingenuous and unsubstantiated.

How is it a pay dispute? Doctors agreed to a pay-neutral deal in principle, and put forward a pay neutral deal in January, and have been given a pay neutral deal in February. Nobody is asking for a payrise. It is not about pay. It is entirely about hours.



Author::::martford
DateTime::::2016-03-11T19:53:56Z
the threat of leaving to work in a richer country for more pay and less hours is getting pretty dull. Why do medics get paid more in Oz - because the GDP per capita is 50% higher and the health service is based on insurance - so far more privatised than the UK.Fine we cannot compete with that - so if the grass is greener I am happy for them to go. This threat needs to be removed from the discussion it does not look good on people who are meant to be motivated by more than cash...

the real takeaway here is that consultants can afford to retire in their 50s. that's the sort of financial package junior doctors can look forward to.

The centralisation of hospitals is about bringing specilist skills into a centre, clustering specialist consultants as an example. The provision of services does not have to be managed and run by govt to support this model. The nhs cannot do everything itself we know that. Take a look at German of French healthcare, they centralise but the state does not operate every aspect of provision. Innovation is key to continual improvement - large monolithic state run industries are poor at that. Hence why the right mix of private and state service makes most sense
