The Mosul dam is crumbling. If it bursts, it would be a disaster on a biblical scale

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosul_Dam">Mosul dam</a>, in northern Iraq, holds back more than 11bn cubic metres of water from the river Tigris. Completed by Saddam Hussein in 1986, and having been built on soluble gypsum, it was never the most stable of structures, requiring continuous grouting to maintain its integrity. But when Islamic State captured the dam in 2014, they ran off with all the grouting equipment. And even though the Kurdish peshmerga retook the dam some six weeks later, it is still close to the Isis front line, and the Kurds have been busy fighting, not grouting.</p>

<p>Last week the US embassy in Baghdad issued a warning that the risk of the dam failing is now “serious and unprecedented”. And if the dam was to burst, a 14 metre-high wall of water would be unleashed downstream that could drown over a million people and displace several million more. “The dam is in a very dangerous situation now,” said Dr Nasrat Adamo, the dam’s former chief engineer. “The coming floods in March and April will definitely raise the water to alarming levels. My feeling is the dam will fail sometime in the future.”</p>

<p>As I read about this story, thousands of tiny connections started pinging off in my head. For it was on the outskirts of the city of Mosul, just a few miles from where the dam now creaks under the pressure of water, that in 1844 the young English explorer <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austen_Henry_Layard">Austen Henry Layard</a> first discovered the ruins of the lost city of Nineveh and its magnificent library of clay tablets. Back then, no one could read their curious markings and they were shipped back to the British Museum for scholars to study.</p>

<p>Decades later, in 1872, working on a mid-7th-century-BC tablet in the museum’s storerooms, the amateur enthusiast <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Smith_%28Assyriologist%29">George Smith</a> made an astonishing discovery. He began to read a story that sounded remarkably like another story many knew from Sunday school. The god <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gilgamesh/section9.rhtml">Ea warned Utnapishtim about a coming flood</a>. He was to build a large boat, to specific instructions. He was to fill the boat with “all the beasts and animals of the field”. The flood lasted six days and nights, after which the boat came to rest on the top of a mountain. Utnapishtim then sent out a dove, a swallow and a raven to seek out dry land. In the bowels of the museum, Smith suddenly realised he had before him an earlier version of the Noah’s ark story from the book of Genesis.</p>

<p>Human civilisation first flourished between the fertile banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This is where the first cities were founded. This is where writing itself began. And this is where, over a thousand years before the Hebrew Bible was put together, the first great story known to humankind – the Epic of Gilgamesh – was being scratched into clay. And it’s unsurprising that the flood story began here, between two great flooding rivers.</p>

<p>These days, the scholarly consensus is that, as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://biologos.org/uploads/resources/enns_scholarly_essay3.pdf">Professor Walter Brueggemann has put it,</a> “the Old Testament in its final form is a product of and a response to the Babylonian exile” – that is, to the period following 597BC when many Jews were carted off to captivity in Babylon, then the largest city in the world (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/apr/16/thebattleforbabylon">and now squashed by a US military base, Camp Alpha</a>). “By the rivers of Babylon, we sat down and wept,” wrote the psalmist.</p>

<p>In Babylon, Jewish exiles asked themselves how this catastrophe could have happened. There they whispered nostalgically of home and drew upon a great many Mesopotamian legends in the process. In the land of enormous ziggurats, they told about the Tower of Babel. In the land of cities, they imagined Abraham as coming from Ur, another of Iraq’s once great urban centres then located on the river Euphrates. It was in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</a> that much of the biblical imagination began to take shape.</p>

<p>Within four hours of the dam bursting, the people of Mosul would be underwater. Within 77 hours, Baghdad would be swamped. You don’t have to be interested in the Bible to recognise this as a potential disaster of biblical proportions.</p>

Could it be that God has sent another swallow and a raven to seek out a safe place to live and told Him to send those in danger to Europe?

I read somewhere that one gate was broken and the other, if opened on its own would cause further erosion to the bedrock due to the channeling of the water, probably speeding up the collapse of the dam.Grim situation.

I'm sure there are valves and sluice gates. Release as quickly as possible to reduce the pressure and the available flood water.

I guess you or anybody else can write Voltaire off as one can equally write off any exceptional philosopher and writer.However as I said in my post he was using the Vetus Synodicon Statea as his reference and as you appear to be a follower of meaningless old documents I would have thought that would have given it some value.

And do you look to a preacher to explain to you the origins of the universe and the origin and evolution of our particular species.From our present knowledge we can say with absolute certainty that we are in no way divine, special, or created in the image of any mythological god.If any adult needs some mythological belief as a crutch to get them through life then that is their right.My problem is in the indoctrination of children into one of the many (well over 2000) mythologies available.Brainwashing is psychological abuse and should be penalised in the same way as physical abuse.If during adulthood a person decides that one of the religions is of value to them then that is fine. I think if religious businesses depended for their propagation on adults to discover them the businesses would die in a couple of generations.

Civilizations built up along the banks of major rivers. Major rivers flood. Hence the flood stories around the world. The Book of Genesis is an anti-Babylonian polemic using Babylonian myths, in much the same way as the New Testement uses Jewish myths in its anti-Jewish polemic. The Flood story is not the only Genesis story copied and rehashed from older myths.

How about this as an explanation of the 2x2 animal motif: When disaster struck, all matter of species were on the move. They were all taking the same migration path away from the disaster zone. Humans arent that far removed from other mammals,,, we essentially behave the same given the same set of life altering circumstances. Imagine, a never before seen or contemplated spectacle defying the usual relationships we have with animals, and all following the same path to a new beginning. Future generations would find it very hard to believe, unless the society swore by it, and it was religiously and thus unquestionably told as Absolute truth. That isnt to say it is all the truth, or that we can discern and separate what was the truth from what was tagged on later as fantasy. But to discard a primary source?, even a flawed or incomplete one, wrapped in incomprehensible metaphor? Not a good idea. Scholars delight in such mysteries, by assiduously and scientifically examining new evidence that may corroborate bits and pieces of these ancient stories. Let them continue. Let's not have book burning rituals, that shut us off from the past for eternity, please...

The flood stories of the Bible pre-date Mesopotamia civiliasation, by many thousands of years. We arent talking annual river floods, or even disasterous 100 or 500 year floods. But epic stuff. Like the melting of the glaciers, ice dams bursting, tsunamis, sea levels suddenly rising, etc. Impacting almost everywhere, and thus told "religiously" by many disconnected peoples throughout the world. I'm not sure why people are confounded by these simple facts...

Oral history refines to an efficient coherent story. After the event, in this case a flood, a thousand eye witness stories are told. After a couple of generations it includes the consequences, the struggles, reflections and the wisdom learned --and is constantly amended and crafted. As far as the animals being "saved", well, when you are telling your story around the fire, and a child asks "but what happened to the animals?" Is it not appropriate for their curious mind, to give a logical answer but to retain the essence of the main story? This is how oral history develops over time...

I'm assuming English is not your first language and you don't live in the UK. Many of our cities are hundreds or even a couple of thousand, years old. They were built where they were built for reasons that were good at the time. In Somerset, for example, which means "Sommer setr", Viking for summer pasture, the land was only dry in the Summer. People lived on higher ground, or put up with a certain amount of flooding and waited for the houses to dry out. Nowadays, living in a damp house with mud floors is not desirable, so we can't do that any more. Plus, we have built on the areas that have always flooded, because it was dry for a while. Now the waters are coming back. York floods in part because places upstream have been protected, so the water ends up in York instead of on a flood plain, which would be big enough to take it all. The River Severn is a famous case. If you try to protect Shrewsbury, which is up stream, Gloucester, near the mouth, gets it.

It is a bit like that, unfortunately. But then, if you don't try to use your brains, it's a bit of a poor do. We start from a belief that God exists, which is a priori reasoning. But that is our experience. And the experience of millions of others for nearly two thousand years. But there's no need to stop using your critical faculties altogether.
