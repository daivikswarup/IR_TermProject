Do women really feel they can only propose in a leap year?




DateTime::::2016-02-29T04:43:51+0000



<p>Simon and I met after being set up by friends, though it was another 18 months before we finally got together. In hindsight, neither of us would have been ready for this relationship when we first met. We needed time to deal with family problems and past relationship issues.</p>

<p>I started thinking about proposing to Simon after a friend reminded me of the tradition of women popping the question in a leap year. I decided that not only was it the most romantic thing I could ever do, but it was the most romantic thing that could ever happen to him. I’d known for a long time that I wanted to marry him, and I thought, “Why should I wait for him? It’s what I want, so why not do the asking?”</p>

<p>I didn’t tell anyone what I was planning – not even my mum: the first person to know that I wanted to marry him should be Simon himself. My friends were a bit annoyed about that, but they eventually understood.</p>

<p>The 29th fell on a Friday, and when I got home from work I headed straight to our bedroom, making the excuse I needed to change and chill out for a while. I set the bedroom up with candles, rose petals and champagne, put on our favourite song (Brown Eyed Girl by Van Morrison) and called him upstairs. He was a little overwhelmed, and started telling me how much he loved me. I had his hands in mine, and I told him I loved him too – so much – and asked, “Will you marry me?” He hugged me and said, “You stupid girl,” at which I laughed and said, “That’s not an answer.”</p>

<p>Then he said yes and told me he had been planning to propose later in the year while on holiday; hence the “stupid girl” comment.</p>

<p>We told our families that evening, then celebrated with dinner at our favourite restaurant. There we made some quick decisions about the wedding we would have – none of which came to pass. The only thing I regret is not getting down on one knee.</p>

<p>People say it’s lovely that I was the one who proposed, although some women have told me they would always hope their boyfriends would do the asking. My mum wasn’t at all surprised though. She says I have always been in charge of my own destiny.</p>

<p>Simon feels good about it too: it made him feel special that I was the one to make the effort. We’re not really the type to boast, so he doesn’t share the story unless anyone asks. But when they do, he’s proud to tell them what happened.</p>

<p>We ended up marrying exactly four years after I proposed, on 29 February 2012. Although we’ve now been married for four years, we joke that this is our first anniversary as it’s the first time we’ve been able to celebrate on the actual date of our wedding.</p>

<p>The notion of the marriage proposal as an overwhelmingly male responsibility is so culturally pervasive that even to look at an image of a woman down on one knee holding a ring box seems incongruous.</p>

<p>This is not helped by the fact that most media representations of women proposing – both current and historical – show the man leaning away in trepidation, if not horror, as the predatory female tries to trap the unwilling male into lifelong commitment. Once you reach the big day, you can even graduate on to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=reluctant+groom+cake+topper&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRmvPosZXLAhWBQhQKHZ6LDxIQsAQIIw&amp;biw=1965&amp;bih=1124&amp;dpr=1.1">“hilarious” wedding cake figures</a> that show the bride dragging the groom across the icing by the scruff of his neck, or clutching at his ankles as he tries to make a break for it.</p>

<p>The “game over” narrative that men are resistant to marriage and must be pinned down at all costs might, on the surface, seem out of step with the widespread assumption that it’s the man who does the proposing, but this is perhaps why the male proposal has so much currency. We assume that men are almost always resistant to commitment – so in order to get married, they must make a (sometimes public) declaration that this is what they really want. If a “pushy” woman does it, how are we to know the groom’s heart is really in it?</p>

<p>No matter how enlightened and feminist you may be, these cultural narratives are hard to escape. I consider myself fairly laid back when it comes to gender roles, yet I was still brought up with this Disneyfied notion that marriage is the endgame. My boyfriend, in contrast, had simply never really thought about it. I was not averse to the thought of proposing, but because marriage was less of an important tradition for him, it meant a lot when he did.</p>

<p>One of the things I dislike about the myths surrounding engagements is this idea that a male proposal comes from nowhere (“It was such a surprise!”) Because who springs big, life-changing decisions on their partner like that? Not most couples I know. Many of them spend a large chunk of time discussing how they envisage their future. Such talks may not have the “romantic spontaneity” of a surprise proposal in front of a crowd (a strategy slightly passive-aggressive and narcissistic in motive, I feel) but they can make for a solid foundation based on openness and communication.</p>

<p>When my boyfriend proposed to me two weeks ago – quietly, and sweetly, with little razzmatazz but a lot of heart – I already knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. Did it mean more because he did it and not me? It probably did, but only because he started out as the one less afflicted by the stereotypes surrounding marriage, not because he was a man. Regardless of gender, having someone you love say to you that they are into you enough to be around you for ever feels like a huge honour. As for who does the proposing, it’s whatever feels right for the two of you.</p>

<p>Female empowerment! <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women">Women</a> of the world! Feminism! I believe in all these things, but I’m not gutsy enough to ask a guy out for coffee, let alone propose marriage. It’s less a question of equality and more my inner ego-crusher assuring me: “He’s just not that into you.”</p>

<p>My problems with proposing are manifold. I suffer from what many men have been accused of, namely: a) fear of rejection, b) fear of commitment, and c) fear of putting myself out there (which I’ve acronymised as Fopmo – almost as acute as my <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/17/hephzibah-anderson-fomo-new-acronym">Fomo syndrome</a>).</p>

<p>A male friend recently said to me (in jest, I’m sure) that he expects a proposal on leap year. In the wise words of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/rizzle-kicks">Rizzle Kicks</a>, na na na na never gonna happen.</p>

<p>I would be terrible at proposing. But I know from experience that guys aren’t always great at it either. One Muslim suitor was magnanimous, saying marriage is the cradle of civilisation and a moral duty upon me. He quoted a prophetic saying that goes: “Marriage completes half of your faith.” I told him another saying, which states patience is also half of faith, so I’ll hold out for now.</p>

<p>And there was a random I met for two whole minutes at a work event felt I was instant marriage material and emailed me the next day to say: “I’m interested. I want to protect my chastity too. Can I discuss with your parents?” I did not reply, As my tea mug says: “I’m single, not desperate.” But I have to give it to him: he did not have Fopmo.</p>

<p>If I were to ask a guy to marry me, it might be behind the e-safety net of something like <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>, where an emoji can easily transform an awkward moment into a “just messin’” situation.</p>

<p>I admire any woman who has and will propose this leap year – or any other day, for that matter. You are a better and braver woman than I.</p>

<p>Women proposing? Of course I’m all for it, but this leap year my feminism has a day off.</p>

<p>Vanessa and I met at university in Manchester in 1992. It was the height of rave culture, and we partied together as part of a wider circle of friends. I was single but Vanessa wasn’t, so although we had chemistry we didn’t get it together.</p>

<p>A few years later I moved to London to work as a designer and moved in with my best mate from university, Piers. He landed a job at Loaded right in its prime, and in the next office was Dance Muzik magazine, where Vanessa was working as a journalist. Piers reunited us and we’ve been together ever since. It’ll be 20 years this April.</p>

<p>I asked Vanessa to marry me a couple of times – first at the Notting Hill carnival and once in St Ives, on Love Lane – but both times she turned me down. With hindsight, I realise my timing was lousy: in the ups and downs of a relationship, we weren’t ready.</p>

<p>Vanessa is notoriously indecisive, but she eventually asked me after changing careers and becoming a teacher. By then we had been together for nine years. The day she qualified, she sat on my lap in tears in our little front room and asked me to marry her. I can’t remember exactly the words she used: she was just being spontaneous and instinctive. What I remember is her relief and vulnerability, and thinking: “Finally!” I never felt closer to her than then.</p>

<p>We agreed to marry or have children – whichever came first. Isobel was born nine months later; then along came Bo after another three years. We then decided to wait until the children were old enough to remember and enjoy our wedding day. Last summer we finally did it, after 19 years together.</p>

<p>When marriage between same-sex couples became legal in 2013, I remember thinking that generations of lesbians might never be aware of the proud feminist tradition of laughing at the ludicrousness associated with getting hitched.</p>

<p>Take the belief that on leap years a woman is “allowed” to propose marriage to a man. Does this not show just how patriarchal the origins of marriage are? Since civil partnerships were introduced for same-sex couples in 2006, however, many lesbians have excelled in aping everything their heterosexual counterparts do when they tie the knot.</p>

<p>I have seen a number of butch and femme replicas of straight weddings, right down to the meringue dress and the morning suit; the first dance to some schmaltzy tune; ring bearers, maids of honour and page boys; and fathers-of-the-bride speeches. I have even heard of lesbian hen parties that are attended by the couple together. So with a lesbian couple, who would propose to whom? The more “butch” of the two, of course!</p>

<p>Because marriage has been framed as a human right, many lesbians appear to have forgotten that we were once critical of the institution itself, an institution that has been built on the oppression of women. One of the first badges I wore as a young feminist bore the slogan, “Y B A Wife?” As 29 February approaches, I am wondering how many lezzers have arranged trips to Paris planning on taking their girls to the top of the Eiffel Tower to ask for their hand in marriage. While feminists have succeeded in deriding such ridiculous traditions, some lesbians will no doubt be reviving them.</p>

By that point we had been together 12 years, bought a house and had 2 children. In my head we were already married. It wasn't going to change anything but I have a slightly insecure streak and so it felt great that she wanted to spend her life with me.

It's sometimes for their wellbeing and future security that some lesbians and gay men marry. If they have difficult family circumstances, it will give them safety to ensure their relationship can thrive.

It is important to be able to discuss your wishes and desires. Whether you are a man or a woman ( or something else?) To me the proposal should really be a cementing of ideas that have already been thought about.I had absolutely no hesitation in proposing marriage but if my wife had proposed the same it would have been no less important.

The Leap year thing does not matter & it really does not matter whether the man or woman proposes -it is down to the couple and very personal.Many are not marrying and my youngest daugther ,a Doctor in London ,has moved in with her boyfriend of 2 years like many nower days and bought a property together in Stockwell.They are sensible but as she is 28 I hope they do not leave it till she is 35 to have kids ( her Mum was 45 when she had her after 6 misscarriages!).

Never heard of any such nonsense. Anyone that felt constrained by such a societal "norm" is far too easily influenced by others' expectations. Who gives a damn what society wants from you - I can't see why you'd give it a second thought! Propose whenever the hell you like, why make an issue out of absolutely nothing? If someone complains or criticizes you for acting on your own will, screw 'em, they're clearly an imbecile. If you want to be with someone it's up to you to do something about it!

The opposite logic to this is that a mature guy will marry a young girl, so that when he becomes too old (or too dead) to care about females, he will not care much that his partner has become fat and grumpy.But in the end it looks like it will meet the interests of both parties!

This suggests that the female logic behind marriage is money and security only. This implies that men are fools to believe a woman loves them when in fact it is their ability to provide that a woman wants.

If marriage is truly about two people living together as equals then it should not matter who suggests it first. If one person feels that they can not ask the question then marriage is not about two equals living together. QED

Well, sometimes one partner is dominant over the other and the vulnerable one wants the state to step in and help - for example in divorce or child custody proceedings. Fair enough if you would never want the state involved, but for some it's a sensible pragmatic step to participate in the legal framework.
