My mother gets drunk pretty much every night and I don't know what to do




DateTime::::2016-03-11T11:43:10+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t has become clear that my mother drinks far too much and does not have it under control. She seems to get drunk pretty much every night (drinking 15 units-plus) and I regularly see her start earlier, drink faster and finish later than anybody else, as well as “needing” a drink by mid-to-late afternoon most days. There are times when I won’t call past 9pm because I know she will be slurring, and maintaining a conversation is hard. The idea that if I had kids, I might not want to leave them with her, is particularly hard.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure she recognises this as a problem. We were always a family where drinking was just something we did. I feel I can see the impact of it on her physical health, mental sharpness and mood, and can’t sit by and condone it any longer. She doesn’t have any other close family left in the country, so it falls to me to talk to her, but I think she might react badly to being told what to do, or just deny things. What can I do? Should I be so frustrated that this has been left to me to deal with?<br/></p>

If I lived alone and didn't have much of a social life I'd probably drink all the wine I could lay my hands on to. Maybe try and change her routine, get her out and involved in things that don't revolve around booze. If that doesn't work then a full blown intervention and councilling is the hard but sensible choice.

The point is that OP feels it's destructive behaviour, rather than a choice made freely. It's probably making her unhappy and having a knock on effect on those that care about her.

I don't think OP was suggesting this as an argument to present to his mother, more as description of his feelings. I don't think he's necessarily begrudging lack of free babysitting either but is disappointed that his/her mother wouldn't be able to be an active part of her grandchildren's lives.

I suppose that the OP doesn't have to tell her mother what to do or deny things, the OP just has to start talking to her about what she's noticed, very gently and non-judgmentally, and see how her mother responds. if she's instantly defensive or angry then call a halt to that area of chat and then seek outside help?

Thanks - any bravery came from the support and encouragement of others. It was double-edged sword in the end - relief that she died while happy and looking forward rather than due to an inevitable descent, but frustration that she didn't quite get to do all she wanted. But then, who does?

It's a choice she has made and she can stop if she really wants too. Tell her it's me or the drink. Mollycoddling doesn't help alcoholics.

You have to decide whether having a row with her is worse than knowing you didn't do anything when you could've.

My mom is a high functioning alcoholic. I remember many times during my childhood/adolescence coming home from school in the afternoon to mom still in her nightgown "lying down" on the sofa watching soaps. When I was older, she would once in a while come and get me to drive her to the liquor store, or to get soda. One Christmas she was furious with me and quite drunk and stood in the doorway of the bathroom as i was taking a bath and told me that because i was a bad daughter she didn't get me anything for Christmas. She has called me late at night and threatened to disown me for "making bad decisions". She has said some nasty things to me for sure. I too don't answer the phone late at night unless it's the emergency signal. She doesn't EVER drink and drive or hell even go for a walk in the park with a drink.

Would an intervention be possible? Gather friends and family and confront your mother by having each member speak about how much they care for her and the effect her drinking is having on them. Be supportive throughout.

Hello there. As others here have advised, please seek support from your mother's GP or from Alcohol Advice Services in your area. Most Alcohol support services will be able to advise you on various ways of bringing the topic up in a gentle and supportive manner with her. Many services also provide support for family members of people struggling with drink issues. On another important note, if your mum is consuming 15 units per evening, there is a very strong likelihood that she is physically dependent on alcohol - in fact, if this is the case, she does "need" the alcohol to ward off withdrawals. Tell-tale signs of alcohol withdrawal include things such as tremors, sweats, increased anxiety, and nausea/sickness.Alcohol withdrawal can be very distressing and potentially dangerous - in some cases it can result in withdrawal-induced seizures and possibly death. Please, for your mum's safety and well-being, do not ask her to stop "cold turkey" or even reduce significantly without the proper support! Good luck!

Your mother has an alcohol addiction, whatever else is going on in her life. Unless she attends to this, she will find it almost impossible to sort any other problems out. Please explain this to her and tell her that there is a lot that can be offered in support but that she is the one who will have to take ownership of this problem. Suggest that she sees her GP, as she may already have physical damage as a result of her drinking. She must not suddenly drinking, but come off it in a controlled manner, and will need the help of a health professional for this.

I have such sympathy with you and know how hard it can be to see someone you love destroying themselves in this way. Unfortunately in every one of my experiences with similar situations, it has taken a very serious life-threatening event to make that person come to terms with the fact that what they are doing is killing them. It's such a cliche but an addict cannot begin to get help until they realise they have a problem, and denial can run so deep.

I strongly suggest you find Al Alon and attend their meetings, and read and learn everything you can from them. This is not something you can just walk into and handle on your own. YOU have to deal and prepare yourself first before you are prepared to deal with your mother. Good luck and hugs.

My auntie used to drink 2/3 bottles of wine a night when she lived with her ex husband, it was just something they did together and became a habit. When they split and she moved in with me for a bit, she stopped almost straight away because I don't drink in the house. Would your mother still want a drink if you took her away from her normal routine? If not, then she could do with something to replace the drink; an activity, non-alcoholic drinks, going out. Meet Up is a really good site to find groups to meet with similar interests.

That's such a great story. Apart from anything else, you have the personal satisfaction of knowing that you did your utmost; you didn't wash your hands of her or look the other way. As you say, it's not a prescription, everyone has to do what's right for them. But it's such a good illustration of the possible excellent outcomes of being brave enough.I'm sorry she died so soon after. Best wishes to you.

For someone with an addiction, there are support groups like AABut there are also support groups for those who are close to someone with an addiction - eg Al-Anonhttp://www.al-anon.org/http://www.al-anonuk.org.uk/The support groups do the 12 steps programme too. Even if you don't attend, they can usually direct you to other groups, organisations, or resources.

I can't agree enough with what you have said here, speaking as someone who has watched a loved one balance precariously on the edge of destroying themselves with alcoholism for many years. Tough love and making it clear that their behaviour is not acceptable may be the only way to make them look at their own behaviour. Also acknowledging that alcoholism is a disease, that the person is drinking to drown some internal pain that is so bad that only obliterating themselves with drink will help. It's also becoming more clear that the difference between someone who drinks a lot and a true alcoholic is genetic, so even once the person decides to stop, it might be very difficult to do so and a great deal of patience is needed.

A close friend of mine was drinking every night. I lived with him in his apt, just friends.He was in a play every night- always did plays, so he was needed at the show and would start to drink soon as he arrived there.Coming back at 11pm, he was already loose with six cans of beer. It escalated. Throughout his life, he's drunk on and off, now this period of time, very heavily. We, his friends and I all on different occasions had talked, soothed, comforted him and tried to get to the root, or supply some sense of bridge to sobriety in him.It did no good.

I feel your pain here. May I ask - did your method above work? I have often thought of trying it, but am afraid my dad would kill himself rather than face such a drastic life change later in life, and my mum would be caught in the middle.

My experience is that alcoholics do not respond to intervention. I know someone with a problem for 30 years and homeless for the last 20 and while they know they *drink*, they *still* don't accept it as a *problem*. In their mind they are still functional. Until they face that, they have no motivation to change.

Her mother is still an adult not a child despite the way most responses here seem to see it and while the OP can support and encourage her, she can't change her.



Author::::HTaylor121

I'd love to see the suggestions for this. I know a relative of similar closeness who has the same problem. We've tried talking calmly, we've tried getting annoyed, tipping it down the sink, we've tried pleading emotionally and rationally. Nothing's worked and it's heartbreaking because it will end up doing serious damage.



Author::::gherkingirl
DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:44:28Z
I suggest the OP seeks some therapy and support systems for herself before she starts, because without that she's is likely to get sucked into the vortex of someone else's behaviour and pulled under.

The problem with allowing destructive behaviour to be labelled as a lifestyle choice is that there is always someone that has to pick up the pieces. Poor health or a slow slide into alcoholism is going to affect the child that loves and cares for her.

She will almost certainly react badly, as you say. You have to decide whether having a row with her is worse than knowing you didn't do anything when you could've.

But that's part of the OP's pain most likely that they are being cast into the role of parent to their parent rather than remaining as their child.

Apart from your first sentence pavanne (which is not what the OP actually said), I completely agree with you.

Your last paragraph captures perfectly one of the chief causes in my opinion. Not only the physical isolation but the physical 'imprisonment'. My mum always feared the winter months for precisely this reason. When the buds started to show her mood visibly improved.

If she can afford to do this, and she is not injuring herself, to some extent, it is her lifestyle choice.It sounds like she is lonely and you are worried about herMaybe just try talking to her about getting more active and socialising more. If this does not help you are going to have to accept she has made her own decisions and you are not responsible for themAlso, I would never phone anybody after 9 pm, that's really inconsiderate.

It sounds very much like your mum is lonely and drinking may help her deal with that. A previous poster mentioned 'breaking the routine' and that's a good place to start. Trips out in the evening, a meal, it doesn't have to be the 'evening class' route, but something she would enjoy, preferably where alcohol isn't the main event. It sounds like she finds solace in drinking and that may numb whatever else she's feeling. It also sounds as though there isn't much in the way of a social life for her so group activities suited to her abilities might be helpful: a walking group, perhaps. Or, if she is not very mobile, is ther something else she might enjoy? Somewhere she can meet other people, maybe make new friends, or at the very least, interact.

I feel for you. My ex partner (who was still my best friend) was an alcoholic. When I could see it was controlling him and he had no control I tried to help. Looked up loads of information about how to broach the subject and did many years of "your memory was better before you started drinking" and "you didn't catch so many colds before you started drinking" and "<insert concern element> before you started drinking". I did all the things that they suggested to no avail. He always had a reasonable excuse for the drinking which I knew was to validate his actions not to relieve my concerns. At one point I even lost patience after he had been very nasty and told him point blank he was an alcoholic. By the time this happened he was in full paranoid mode and thought everyone was out to get him. I got no where and he died because he was an alcoholic.

If you have said nothing up till now then do , don't go over the top and if you have siblings see if they will support you , perhaps she knows that there is a problem already , see if you can find any literature , leaflets perhaps , be humble and tell her you love her and it is hurting you .See her more often , talk to her every day , and get her to come to see you , she may be lonely and alcohol is her crutch .

I had exactly the same problem with my mother a few years ago. She always enjoyed a drink but it got to the point where she 'bookended' her days with alcohol. Her health had deteriorated; she was dangerously underweight and was easily agitated and confused. There were a number of incidents which made her private issue a very public one. Her friends felt they couldn't intervene because they shared her lifestyle, and I was the only family member who could confront her; I reasoned that if I left her, she wouldn't have survived another 6 months.

While you need to address the drinking, you also need to look at the reasons she is drinking, beyond addiction, if she has no family around it might be loneliness, or some other issues which you should talk to her about, maybe before you bring up the drinking.



Author::::bcarey
DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:07:51Z
I can see the impact of it on her physical health, mental sharpness and mood, and can’t sit by and condone it any longer.

DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:04:15Z
If it was you that was doing the drinking wouldn't you hope that someone who cared about you would say something to help you stop? Could you maybe try and get her to do something else to break her routine? Good luck.
