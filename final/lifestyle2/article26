How was your weekend running?




DateTime::::2016-03-07T07:39:06+0000



<p>Well my weekend did at least involve some running, which is more than last week did. I do not, however, recommend absent mindedly making your not-very-long run route cross the finish line of the race you were supposed to be doing. Does not improve the mood. Then again I almost certainly looked worse after a couple of miles than the 20 mile race finishers did. </p>

<p>Missing a week is fairly meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but not ideal in the run up to the London marathon - particularly when you weren’t feeling particularly great before then anyway. I suspect I may well - possibly for the first time ever - do the sensible thing and defer my London place. Could I get to the starting line, could I finish 26.2 miles? Probably, yes. But then again I might break down properly in the attempt - or on the course. It increasingly doesn’t seem worth the risk. So, autumn marathon it (probably) is then. </p>

<p>For now, I’m taking it easy - I am off on Thursday to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.209events.com/running-training-camps/algrave-spring-training-week-1-portugal">209 training camp in Portugal </a>so I just want to make sure I can actually train while I’m there. Oh, and I did do one race this weekend - pacing my seven year old around junior parkrun. Unlike me, she was on good form, clocking her best time this year. </p>

<p>So, tell me all about your weekend running. London marathoners are probably clocking up the miles - I saw quite a few 20-plus on Strava yesterday. Please report your woes, your PBs, your niggles - and share tips on your fast, flat autumn marathons, thanks ... </p>

Noooo, I thought I'd replied to you on the other article I was reading on heart rate monitors! Sorry!!

Wot, under 2hrs and you just started running, that is epic! If you had fun and managed that time, then it seems definitely worth going further. Look forward to hearing about your exploits on the 'How was your weekend running' blog on Monday morning!

A complete newbie runner here, having 'laced up' properly at Christmas. I ran my first race this weekend - the Cambridge Boundary Run half marathon. I had a great time in the muddy fields (although felt a bit out of place - thank you to whoever told me where to put my race number and timing chip!), and scraped in just under the 2 hour mark. Hopefully the first of many races to come :-)

Having failed to complete the Transgrancanaria 125k course last year, it made my finish this year all the more special. My finishing time was 29 hours and 10 minutes.

Love your "Fit after 40" article Kate - thanks for that. As someone who only started to get seriously fit after 40 I could relate well to it. Thanks again!

Think it definitely counts as a long run, and you probably went a bit faster over two runs. It must have been awful to see your friend hurting, but you can run for both of you, I'm sure she'll come along in support.

long time reader, first time commenter here.... inspired to join in having spent the weekend in the Lake District and having pulled on my new shoes at 08:00 on a glorious sunny morning to do a quick pre-brekkie 15km as a warm-up for the Liverpool 1/2 marathon this coming weekend. it's runs like that which keep you motivated whilst running round the park for the 577th time this year in the pouring rain and the dark!

Thanks for the publicity for Wimbledon Park junior parkrun. It's only fair to point out to prospective runners and parents that the picture was taken in the summer, when flowers bloomed, the ground was hard and all was set fair with the world. Currently it's a bit of a mudbath, thanks to a high water table, so bring appropriate shoes! But all welcome between 4 and 14 years of age...

Indeed, would be interested to know what she does for this sort of session, something like 10k pace for the afternoon reps. You can probably see why very few coaches would suggest this sort of load to to a runner as the balance between performance and errm fun and enjoyment is so heavily tilted towards performance. That , in part, is Olympic marathoning. Is she allowed to bite people's heads off in the hour or two before she does the p/m reps?

The resident Aussie Olympian whom I occassionally train with told me about a similar session that a friend of hers is doing in the lead-up to VLM. A/M: 25km steady pace runNo carbs whatsoever as part of the recovery, but unlimited proteinP/M: 4 x 1 mile reps as hard as possibleApparently it teaches the body to burn fat, which is what happens at the back end of a marathon when glycogen stores run out.

Excellent pacing for your 10km race mate, well done. Especially given you are not exactly tapered, even though it was a "recovery week". I miss Battersea Park, I used to run there plenty of times back in the day. Continue your great training in the lead up to VLM.

Hi MRM - sorry for delayed response. The answer to your question is it will depend if I do a marathon later in the year. If so, then I will slowly work up to around 110km per week. Experience (read trial and error!) has taught me that my current mileage is sufficient for up to HMs, provided I get the mix and quality of my sessions right.

Or if you are really keen and like Renato Canova more than having a nice sunday lunch, you can do this sort of thing whereby you run both the a/m and p/m legs at strong pace (details vary but not far short of MP, and at MP in parts) and - the grim marathon specific bit - going rather light on the carbs in between. Total volume on the day would be something like the longest of the long runs that you do. Mentally it's obvs a tough gig and physically it needs some planning to make it tough but not destructive.

I think its because I was always an unfit kid at school - and right through to my late twenties - I guess I can't help seeing the running period as an anomaly! But I take your point :)

Its my local one! Anyways.. I don't think I'll do any running at all this week... and I'm going to walk most of those hills on the day... and try and run fast on the downhill flat bits.That's the plan.And after that... I'll have to take things very easy for a while and see if I can fix my poor tendons.Flipping old age! The rest of me feels great. Just the tendons have wimped out.

Terrific photos again! I got myself a facebook page some time ago, which I've never used for anything (and can't even remember my password for!) but I did start to put some of my mountain pics onto it. I don't know if you have an account, or how to view them, but you're more than welcome to try if you like?

that sounds gorgeous. and blimey, what a time. well done. I love that in fell or trail races, people will encourage you when you overtake. actually, it's usually me doing the encouraging because it's me getting overtaken. but still, it's a lovely tradition.

It's a fascinating combination of disciplines isn't it. Really diverse. I'd love to ask a lot more questions, but there isn't really room here! Thanks for the photo - really nice looking group.

it's often not just that you have weak glutes but that you're not activating them. we sit so much, the glutes stop working and you use hamstrings instead. google some exercises to activate them before the race. it will pay off.

Thanks for the encouragement! I like the look of the Salomons, though I'm really happiest in zero, or close to zero, drop. I don't know if Salomon offer anything like that? (I'll take a look!) Weirdly, I wear their running clothes quite a bit, but have never tried their shoes!

Yes, much better idea, I remember doing my first practice 27m around Dulwich Park in light snow, but I was that pumped to be doing a marathon at all that I didn't care. Wouldn't get me doing it now three years later!

I've been plagued with injury the last few weeks. I was hoping for a big run two weeks ago but foot pain stopped me at 13.5 miles. Yesterday I took some ibuprofen and ran 20.7 miles in 3:44. This is a third further than I've ever run before and psychologically getting into double figures before my first ever marathon (Blackpool) is a big big deal.Foot hurts like hell today but I don't care. I am an athlete.

Anything sub-30 for a 5k is wholly respectable, especially for a lady.

Hello The Spare and Arkoia. It's nice to see other cyclists here on the running blog. I couldn't just do one thing as I'd get bored, so like Arkoia, I really enjoy triathlons. In fact I did a steady 31 miles on my bike today after a 16 mile run yesterday. My legs didn't like the hills though! I'm off to Majorca at the beginning of April with 7 mates for a weeks cycling and I can't wait!

There must be a more direct route, the climb to the monument just seems unnecessary torture inflicted on the runners by the organisers. Still, medal was much improved on last year's effort so that made it all worthwhile.

Thanks! I'd never even heard of modern pentathlon until about five years ago when I signed up for a beginner's fencing class -- I'd never actually seen fencing before, so had no idea what it was -- and met some pentathletes who said 'You're a horse person? Come along, then.' No one cared that I was older and utterly inexperienced in all the disciplines aside from horses and running.

I'm a bit of a wasted grump after a long run too, and I'm trying cut down on sweet stuff as I am a bit of an addict. I am trying to use protein shakes post-run - they seem to work to combat the fatigue, but I don't really like them.

I too am now planning the autumn marathon. After two trips to the physio an April marathon is not going to happen. I did manage a walk run of two miles on Saturday which was great, just need to take it slowly when building up the miles again. Nice to Cannes marathon looks good. Any one have any experience of it??
