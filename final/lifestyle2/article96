Is it #eatclean or just green sludge? How to sort the good from the fad




DateTime::::2016-03-09T19:06:59+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>’m standing in the kitchen, staring at a blender full of brown sludge with my name on it. Expensive brown sludge at that: the worktop is scattered with about £20 worth of ingredients, all impeccably sourced and beautifully packaged, yet somehow they have combined to create something that looks like baby poo. Towering nearby, a pile of bright books mock my efforts: Clean Cakes, by Henrietta Inman; <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/new-wellness-bloggers-food-drink-hadley-freeman">The Naked Diet by Tess Ward</a>; Coconut Oil (Nature’s Perfect Ingredient) from Lucy Bee; Sarah Wilson’s Simplicious; and, at the top, new books from the goddesses of the clean-eating movement – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/359186/">Deliciously Ella Everyday</a> by publishing phenomenon Ella Woodward, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/373188/">Good + Simple from sisters Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley</a>.</p>

<p>It strikes me, as I grimly scrape the sludge into a glass, that if you wanted a metaphor for the clean-eating craze that has swept the western world in recent years, you could do a lot worse than the kale and cacao smoothie in Woodward’s new book. On the page, a tempting vibrant green; in reality, a dull beige disappointment. Should you have been lucky enough to have dodged the torrent of green juice and nut milk that has flooded the media since the turn of the decade, here is the skinny on clean eating: it’s not a diet, it’s a way of life – a line you may remember from the Atkins, the 5:2 and just about every other fad diet that has been and gone. Unlike its predecessors, however, it doesn’t come with a strict set of rules. Its adherents might advocate largely plant-based, minimally processed foods, but, as associate editor of Slate magazine LV Anderson <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/05/08/clean_eating_is_a_bad_label_with_no_real_meaning_for_your_diet_plan.html">perspicaciously observed</a>, in practice clean eating “can mean pretty much anything you want it to mean”.</p>

<p>What all the various clean regimes have in common, however, is a hefty helping of self-denial: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/30/sorry-gwyneth-paltrow-but-steaming-your-vagina-is-a-bad-idea">Gwyneth Paltrow’s Clean programme</a>, which, the actor-turned-lifestyle-coach reports, makes her feel “pure and happy and much lighter”, requires its victims to cut out dairy, gluten, meat, shellfish, soy, “fatty nuts”, nightshades such as potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and aubergines, condiments, sugar, processed foods, and, just to really twist the knife, alcohol and caffeine too. Though such details generally make me want to mainline a sackful of pork scratchings, the incredible popularity of the kale smoothie has convinced me to look more closely at this newest crop of clean-eating bibles – and even brave the odd brown breakfast myself.</p>

<p>Paltrow’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://goop.com/clean/">“amazing” cleanse lasts three weeks</a> (21 days that, I suspect, feel like a lifetime), so I’m pleased to discover that these advocates tend to be a little less extreme. Though some, such as Woodward, follow a plant-based diet, others, including the Hemsley sisters and Ward, positively relish a bit of meat, as long as it comes from “pasture-raised, hormone- and antibiotic-free animals that have been raised on a diet that is natural to them”. Indeed, the Hemsleys attribute near magical powers to what they call bone broth, more commonly known as stock, which they dub “an elixir to cure ailments and nurture the sick”.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/new-wellness-bloggers-food-drink-hadley-freeman">Green is the new black: the unstoppable rise of the healthy-eating guru</a> </p>

<p>They are, to a woman (paleo aside, men are thin on the ground in the clean-eating world), big fans of what Ward calls “naked” foods – “stripped back, unprocessed and bare-faced”. Happily for those of us who have taken it upon ourselves to cook clean, processing seems a pretty elastic concept for all concerned. Miso paste, tofu and coconut sugar, rice noodles and spirulina powder all pass the clean test, and while Paltrow has a horror of fatty nuts, Woodward can’t get enough of her homemade nut butters, admitting: “I can, and often do, sit with a teaspoon and eat a whole jar at once!”</p>

<p>As someone known to come home a bit drunk and demolish half a loaf of bread and a jar of Skippy, to say I’m unconvinced by the clean-eating argument is an understatement. I have only to hear the words “clean”, “detox” or, God forbid, “spiraliser” at a party to march over, glass charged with filthy booze, and begin demolishing the dearly held beliefs of people I barely know. The only thing I’ve got in common with Woodward is a dog, and mine is nowhere near as glossy and gorgeous as hers, though he does prove surprisingly keen on her blueberry chia seed pudding when I lose my own appetite for it.</p>

<p>I’m far from alone in my reaction – there has been something of a backlash against the detox divas. The Observer’s restaurant critic Jay Rayner has dismissed clean eating as a pseudonym for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/11/clean-eating-diet-food-gwyneth-paltrow-jay-rayner">“joylessness, piety, self-regard, self-delusion and staggering pomposity</a>”. Meanwhile, Nigella Lawson, a woman who has always celebrated the pleasures of food of all types, gently suggests that “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nigella-lawson-brands-clean-eating-craze-way-hide-eating-disorder-1532765">people are using certain diets as a way to hide an eating disorder or a great sense of unhappiness and unease with their own body</a>”. My favourite takedown, however, is by American comedian <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp18AwsEnSo">Jarrett Sleeper, whose YouTube performance of the actual daily food diary of LA Moon juice bar magnate Amanda Chantal Bacon</a> has been viewed more than 39,000 times in the past month. To whet your appetite, after “Kundalini meditation and a 23-minute breath set”, the poorly named Bacon starts the day with “a warm, morning chi drink … it contains more than 25 grams of plant protein, thanks to vanilla mushroom protein and stoneground almond butter, and also has the super endocrine, brain, immunity, and libido-boosting powers of Brain Dust, cordyceps, reishi, maca, and Shilajit resin. I throw ho shou wu and pearl in as part of my beauty regime.”</p>

<p>In comparison, Woodward’s list of essentials, which include chia seeds and Japanese tamari sauce, seems fairly modest – though it hasn’t stopped her getting her own personal parodist in the form of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/deliciouslystella/">Deliciously Stella</a>, the alter-ego of comedian Bella Younger, whose idea of a nourishing green juice is sticking a mint Viennetta in a blender. Younger says she was inspired to create Stella because she was “tired of being made to feel guilty and inferior by everyone’s perfect lives on Instagram”. My own objections to clean eating run somewhat deeper. I love the carefully staged social media shots of Gwyneth relaxing with a matcha latte, but some of the myths she and her fellow clean-eaters are peddling are less amusing.</p>

<p>Woodward’s wide-eyed claim that microwaves are “very damaging to the nutrient levels of food” may be laughable, but she is on to something when she says that “eating healthily can become obsessive and compulsive in the way that lots of diets can”. As Heston Blumenthal observed when asked for his views on clean eating recently: “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/heston-blumenthal-interview-clean-eating-trends-major-tim-peake-a6889166.html">Isolating and excluding certain food groups … often does more harm than good</a>.” Gluten, for example: though none of the big names mentioned are, as far as I’m aware, coeliac, all of them avoid it, and the Hemsleys prefer to eschew grains altogether on the basis that modern commercial varieties are “not what our ancestors would have consumed”.</p>

<p>Many of these books also propagate the myth that a diet of alkaline food is necessary to maintain a healthy pH level – in fact, the body is perfectly capable of regulating it on its own, and nothing you eat will change this. Legumes get the heave-ho because they cause bloating, while quite a few of the authors seem to believe that eating peanuts in particular will give you cancer, though, they helpfully point out, other nut butters make an excellent substitute, for three times the price.</p>

<p>Such claims, as well as outrageously expensive ingredients, made the early clean movement an easy target, and with their second books, the Hemsleys and Woodward seem to have taken some of the criticism on board. Woodward has been keen to point out that “the point of this new book is to show that healthy eating doesn’t have to be expensive or time-consuming or feature obscure ingredients” (though her store-cupboard essentials still include raw cacao powder, buckwheat groats, coconut oil and raw honey), and the Hemsleys’ Good + Simple promises to make “eating well even simpler”.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/08/suzanne-moore-sugar-free-diet">‘My life is basically over’ – 14 days on a sugar-free diet</a> </p>

<p>Have they succeeded? Well, to an extent. Having cooked (and ground, and blended) from all of them in the past few days, I think there is some good stuff – we should all be eating more vegetables and wholegrains, less heavily processed foods, and less, but better-quality, meat and fat. Crucially, though, one thing that’s missing from a lot of the clean-eating books is the message that we need to reduce our sugar intake. As the Australian journalist Sarah Wilson, founder of the hugely successful I Quit Sugar campaign, says in her latest book, Simplicious, she has no time for the “natural sugars” used in abundance in many “clean” recipes. Honey, maple syrup, agave – all contain high levels of fructose, the sugar increasingly linked to the current epidemic of diabetes, obesity and fatty liver disease. (Oh, Deliciously Ella, why did you introduce me to the caramelised delights of the evil Medjool date?) Though I can see many ideas from these books sneaking into my life, it’s Wilson who might just stop me reaching for that second slice of cake. So here’s what you need to know: no food is clean. No food is dirty. Eat more whole fruit, and especially vegetables, more wholegrains and less sugar, whether it comes in crumbly white cubes or from a beehive. Make sure you enjoy your food, whatever you’re eating. It may be unfashionable to say it, but the occasional doughnut really isn’t going to kill you.</p>

<p>For those tempted to dip their toe into clean water, the following recipes are great examples of the best of clean cooking – a vibrant, vegetable-packed noodle salad from the Hemsleys, and Wilson’s bitter chocolate tart that tastes sophisticated, rather than virtually sugar-free (NB use a small, shallow tin with a removable base – I found it advisable to grease it generously, despite her instructions). And Woodward’s mango and berry smoothie is as gorgeous as the ingredients suggest (though I would make it with live yoghurt and water, rather than nut milk). Her other smoothie? Well, in the sunny, positive spirit of the clean movement, I’ll say it tasted as it looked, and leave it at that.</p>

<p><strong>270ml can coconut cream<br/></strong><strong>2tbsp cardamom pods, lightly crushed with a flat blade until the outer husks crack<br/></strong><strong>½tsp pure vanilla powder or 1tsp pure vanilla extract<br/></strong><strong>100g dark (85–90% cocoa) chocolate, chopped<br/></strong><strong>Pinch of sea salt, plus coarse sea salt, to garnish<br/></strong><strong>Berries, edible petals to garnish (optional) <br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>For the crust<br/></strong><strong>75g coconut oil<br/></strong><strong>4 tbsp rice malt syrup<br/></strong><strong>150g unsweetened desiccated coconut<br/></strong><strong>1 tbsp raw cacao powder</strong></p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 180ºC (gas mark 4). To make the crust, melt the coconut oil and rice malt syrup in a saucepan. Remove from the heat, add the shredded coconut and cacao powder and mix well. Press the mixture into the base and up the side of a quiche or tart tin – no need to grease it – so that the mixture is approximately 5mm thick all over. Bake the crust for around 15–20 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool and firm up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, heat the coconut cream, cardamom pods and vanilla in a saucepan to a simmer, then turn off the heat and cover with a lid. Allow to steep for 10 minutes. Strain the coconut cream mixture into a bowl, reserving 4 tablespoons in the pan for emergency use later, if needed. Discard the cardamom pods (or save to spice up chai tea). Add the chocolate and salt to the bowl, whisking it through until silky and melted. If the fats separate and your ganache develops a chocolatey cottage-cheese appearance, just add the reserved coconut cream, whisking swiftly to bring it all back together.</p>

<p>Once silky, pour into the tart shell and refrigerate until the ganache sets (at least 2 hours). Garnish with a pinch of coarse sea salt, berries and petals.</p>

I have never followed food fads, diets or any other so called healthy eating regime. I eat only vegetables, fruits and nuts and homemade bread. I make all my own dressings and sauces, I also make all my own soups. I will not eat any food that has been processed in a factory simply because we do not know what's in it, manufacturers lie about this, as we have all found out. Plus there is a well known scientific fact that eating processed foods fools the stomach into believing its half empty instead of overfull. This in turn leads to snacking on really terrible junk food like crisps, sweets, burgers...etc.I do not eat this way for aesthetic reasons but only through choice, plus the fact that I never have indigestion, heartburn, or stomach problems and never get tired or sleepy after eating a big meal. Many people suffer from the above ailments on a daily basis, in fact its so common that no one really sees them as a problem but just put up with them. Eating a vegetable only diet will lead to feeling well and better health Vegetable meals are not boring.......well mine are not, and I always have a homemade juiced drink made up of such things like Kale, Spinach, pineapple, banana, oranges, peaches, and mixed omega seeds, but always make sure to add in extra flax and sunflower seeds.I am never likely to go around preaching about what you or should not eat, but anyone who say's to me that eating any type of animal flesh is good for you is talking absolute bollocks.Eating animal flesh is good for only the people who raise the animals for sale and for processing plants who decimate the original products by adding spurious ingredients....just too make it go further, to increase their profits.

The Hemsleys and Ella are only successful because they are young and beautiful. Their food comes a distinct second. There's no way either their success or their food philosophies will last as long as Delia's, Nigella's or Mary's. How many dinner parties have you been to where thin attractive women pick on bits of green and avoid all sugars and carbohydrates, while gulping down wine and popping out regularly for a fag or a line of coke in the loo? It's got very little to do with healthy and a lot to do with staying thin.

I get so irritated by these predictably cynical approaches. Generally speaking, the truth of the matter is that we don't eat enough veg - hence the 5 a day campaign - and even then it's not much good if you're going to struggle to keep to it. Blending, therefore, is a simple way to ensure you get a good dose of raw veg and fruit. WTF is wrong with that? I do it all week and then the weekend treats are even more pleasant (not that a blend of kale, watercress, strawberries, kiwi, blueberries and grapes is much of a hardship!) Also, there's less chance of that 'I can't believe I'm here again' feeling at the gym if your diet consists of the very things that aid recovery.

The phrase "edible food-like substances" always makes me laugh. As did the recipe for the mango and honey smoothie. Why not just eat half a mango, a handful of berries, a banana, forego the honey (the fruit has plenty of sugar), and drink 150ml of plant-based milk (be careful there; those milks often have added sugars and flavours). Why do you have to put it in a blender, then drink it? Your stomach acid etc is your own, on-board, natural "blender", and you have a digestive tract and waste elimination system that's evolved to extract nutrition and get rid of toxins.

Food fads and clean eating are a neuroses and won't save anyone's life.
