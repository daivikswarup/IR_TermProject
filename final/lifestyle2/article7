Keep your ticker up – the truth about heart-rate monitors




DateTime::::2016-03-09T12:37:33+0000



<p>As an old-school runner, I’ve always had a rather scathing attitude towards heart-rate monitors, fitness trackers and associated technology. But as an older runner – I’m 53 – I find I am increasingly susceptible to health scares. I was scared indeed when I witnessed a far younger fellow parkrunner being brought back from the brink by paramedics after he collapsed on the finish line. He went on to make a full recovery, but his near-death experience had a positive legacy: the London Ambulance Service provided our park cafe with a defibrillator, and gave our parkrun team CPR training. </p>

<p>We found out later that the casualty had had a narrowed aorta since birth, and that his collapse could have come at any time, but the episode made a big impression on everyone, especially us more mature runners. Mental notes were made to check in at our local GP surgery for an MOT.</p>

<p>A few weeks after – all thoughts of an MOT forgotten as I launched into marathon training – I pulled up during mile repeats on the track because my heart hurt. I jogged awhile, upped my pace a bit, but finished the session tentatively. I put it down to eating too many biscuits before training.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/mar/07/fit-after-40-improve-lifestyles-middle-age-government-campaign">Getting fit in middle age: a marathon addict, a couch potato and others share their pain</a> </p>

<p>A month or so after that incident, I felt faint and sick during a long, slow marathon-training run, and my heart seemed to be racing even though I was running at an easy pace. I cut the run short and headed home to rest. Turns out I was sickening that time; I was laid low with a fairly typical winter virus for a few days.</p>

<p>The culmination of all this ticker-related anxiety was a sudden fascination with heart-rate monitors. The traditional ones, with their cumbersome chest bands, seemed a bit of a faff, but when I was presented with a Mio Fuse heart-rate activity tracker, which is only a tiny bit more complicated than a Fitbit, I liked the cut of its jib.</p>

<p>Using it, however, caused another alarm. I had calculated my maximum heart rate (MHR) using the easy formula 220 minus my age, 53, which meant my MHR should be 167. The trouble was, my new toy told me that it was galloping way above this limit every time I did an 800m repeat. </p>

<p>I wondered if pushing myself into what I feared was some sort of danger zone was wise in a woman on the uphill side of 50. Was I straining my heart? Could it explode at any point?</p>

<p>Who better than Professor John Brewer, head of the school of sport, health and applied science at St Mary’s University, Twickenham, to put my mind at rest?</p>

<p>“What you discovered is a fundamental flaw in the 220-minus-age theory,” he told me, soothingly, having explained, with admirable patience, that hearts rarely explode. “It’s a rather inaccurate measure of fitness, an approximate calculation. It tends to result in a rather too cautious measure of maximum heart rate for older, fit people.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/07/how-to-get-fit-after-40-healthy-retirement-guide">How to get fit after 40</a> </p>

<p>“If you’re fit, you know you have to work at a level of tolerable discomfort to get the most from your training, and that might mean pushing above the ‘acceptable’ maximum heart rate for your age. So, if you find that your MHR pushes up to nearer 182 beats a minute, instead of the more modest 167 decreed for your age, you may find that the heart-rate monitor tells you you’re pushing too hard.”</p>

<p>Brewer continues: “During steady runs, heart rate tends to creep up even if running speed stays the same. This is primarily due to the thermoregulatory [heat loss] challenge faced by the body during exercise. As you run, so core temperature increases – the main way of losing heat to control this is through sweating, but the second mechanism is diverting blood to the skin so that heat can be dissipated. These means that the heart has to work harder as it is being challenged to supply blood to the muscles to deliver oxygen, and blood to the skin to lose heat.</p>

<p> “All this is why good coaches are more likely to say, ‘Listen to your body’ than keep your eyes glued to a heart-rate monitor all the time … becoming a slave to it may stop you exerting yourself, which is not beneficial in training.”</p>

<p>Brewer concedes that heart-rate monitors can be very useful as another way of checking levels of exertion and, for less fit runners starting out, they can be a boon for lowering the risks involved in doing too much fast running too soon. </p>

<p>However, the heart needs its workouts like any other muscle, and if you stay too much in the comfort zone, it won’t be working hard enough.</p>

<p>“We’re designed to exercise, and our hearts are the No 1 muscle involved when we do. If you’re fit and healthy, you owe it to your heart to make it work hard during tough interval sessions. With such hard work, your heart will help you to improve,” says Brewer.</p>

<p>”I’d suggest you leave your heart-rate monitor at home sometimes and learn to know what tolerable discomfort feels like. Use it as a guide to check your resting heart rate and recovery times during occasional sessions, know that your maximum heart rate is going to be slightly higher the fitter you are, and your recovery towards resting heart between efforts all the quicker. Learn to work around 70% of your personal MHR figure for the most beneficial effects.”</p>

<p>Of course, if you feel chest pain, dizziness and nausea that you can’t attribute to raiding the biscuit tin too enthusiastically 10 minutes before your track session, back off and go for a walk instead. </p>

I also think people like HR monitors because of the calorie counter. We know it's a very broad ball park figure, but you only have to look at Endomondo's monthly calorie challenge to see how popular it is.

That's really interesting. My resting HR is 50, but will go to 170+ when running for a 1hr+. I am definitely guilty of running at the same speed & have become a bit obsessed with target times. Consequently this year I'm not racing at all, but trying to recapture the joy of running.

My friend claims the Mio Fuse thing wrist mounted strap works. Basically it is large enough and can be worn tight enough to block out ambient light which optical sensors need to be able to do. The Fitbit, Garmin Vivosmart HR etc... ones need to be at least vaguely fashionable to be worn all day and night so are too small.

Great comment although I also recommend someone's comment above pointing out that working out your zones using LTHR is better than MHR



Author::::whatwasigoingtosay

Fashionable wrist based optical HR sensors are indeed (currently) rubbish but don't taint ECG basrd chest strap ones or even the Mio thing the writer mentions (which is also wrist based optical but large and tight enough to be effective) with the same brush

Just to provide some balance I use a HR monitor from Garmin, the values it reports are always believable, and I use it to train at the intensity I want to during that session.

A few years back I had chest pains, Doctor had the nurses put me on a ECG machine, computer said it was a Heart Attack. Very interesting ambulance journey to ER, followed by hours of tests etc. I found it quite fascinating: but that`s just me. As long as my carers/parents were healthy & well whatever happened to me was pretty much fine. My attitude of detached stoicism had to be explained quite often to Doctors, it`s just normal for me. I am a genetic disaster area, you get used to medical crises. Mostly directly genetic, or indirectly: bad eczema = long term high dose BETNOVATE Steroid cream = skin thins + immune system badly damaged, endless infections (no Steroids now, so far fewer/lesser infection), but my cancer tends to occur 20+ years after immune system damage, came exactly on time. All `linked` to my childhood eczema. Turned out I did just `grow out of it`with eczema, kept using Steroids for no reason for decades: skin now perfect 6 years after I stopped & immune system mostly fine now: ho hum. The immune system damage, 20 years of infections & my cancer were, very probably, avoidable. Not NHS`s fault, stopped going to regular clinics (Eye, Chest, Skin, Psychiatric, `Weight/diet` ) after my breakdown in 1981. I just kept on my medicines for decades, on repeat prescriptions: not a good idea.

Nice to see some background in this area. Took a long time to find out the 'science' behind the 'max heart rate' equations that are floating around out there, so a little explanation of why my HR is always creeping 'high' after a good 15 - 20 mile bike ride is informative. The 'follow your pain' injunction is a good guideline, now with some context.

To check if the reading is somewhere near, stop running and place a couple of fingers on your neck to feel your pulse. Count the pulses for 6 seconds then muliply by 10. If this looks different to what your hr watch says then it is faulty.

Yes, I can agree with that. Its the low-end where it comes in handy. I am 55 so my long slow runs are 'stop when you hit 135 bpm, start running again at 115'. So, I can run for hours like that and it has really helped my endurance.

I've been using a HR monitor (garmin 220) to run for the past couple of years and it has change the way I run and improved my 10k race times significantly. How you may ask? Before I was guilty of running all of my runs at the same pace, hard.Now my training is polarised between hard (intervals, hills, tempo run etc) and easy long runs at a low HR rate.I received "heart monitor training for the compleat idiot" as a gift which shows you how to identify your max and resting HR rate accurately both of which are needed for the to calculate "recovery ceiling" (HR not to exceed when doing slow runs) and "threshold floor" (HR rate not to drop below for hard runs).It's the recovery ceiling which has really help me to slow down and improve my aerobic capacity. I can't recommend this enough but be warned you will be running very very slowly and that takes some getting use to...

As someone who is STILL trying to learn how to run 5k despite being fit, this is the best piece of advice I've read. "Just slow down" when I'm already doing a lumpy walk rather than a slow run just wasn't cutting it.Thank you.

I've used a Tom Tom cardio for two years - since it first came out. It has a wrist based sensor and is generally pretty accurate, having compared it to a strap based Garmin one. Agree about the max heart rate calculations - I'm 62 and can push my heart rate to 165 or more. Find the monitor is good for intervals - run at 125 to 130 then sprint to 155 to 160, then back to 125. Repeat over a 10k. Agree with comment about illness or over training. Had a chest infection that cleared up, but resting heart rate was elevated from normal 50 to 80 or more. Did not run until heart rate was back to normal - took another three weeks!

I could never make the chest strap thing fit right, bra's and all that seemed to get in the way. But was quite excited to see if the Apple Watch wrist HR thingy worked, but everyone seemed to think it was wildly inaccurate, so didn't bother, but might try again inspired by this, at least to compare different runs at the same place.

This is reassuring: I had the same experience of exceeding the calculated MHR (for which there are at least two formulas). The key lesson I took from reading about HRM training is the use of resting heart rate: if elevated you are at risk of overtraining and need to exercise at low intensity until it falls. With practice I found out what a recovery run feels like so I don't need the HRM for that any more. It will come back into play once I am ready to add high-intensity sessions.

fifties l had a heart scare and bought a heart rate monitor.On a fifteen mile run with my friend(same age) I noticed that at eight miles my pulse was 180. The hardest seven miles were still to come.I eased up.Discretion being the better part of valour.I used my monitor as a check on my crackpot runner's brain.At seventy I still joglimp(a non running injury).I use 100 and above as fat burning and 120 plus as aerobic.I am still here.Is it because of my monitor or Falstaff.

The point of a hr rate monitor for running is not too avoid too high a rate, but to train in a specific zone. Calculating maximum hr is useful for figuring out where your zones are. The idea is to spend lots of time in an aerobic state and a little in an anaerobic state. The article is misleading.

I use one of the Polar chest trap things, but it has quite often reported my heart rate as being nearly or just above 200 when simply jogging a few miles, which at 38 years old and reasonably fit is slightly disturbing. I'd be inclined to believe it if I was pushing it a bit far and could feel myself wheezing or getting that slowly increasing sense of the walls closing in that eventually would lead to a blackout, but in a lot of cases I figure either the device is wrong or that actually I can handle it.

My most entertaining use of a heart-rate monitor was when I wore one skiing the Vallée Blanche in Chamonix. It proved two things:1) skiing actually is a pretty good aerobic workout (justifying large cheese consumption)2) the sheer terror I felt walking down the ridge at the start was entirely reflected in my heart rate. Exceeded my anaerobic threshold whilst virtually stationary.

As a former sprinter and rugby player with a well-developed level of anaerobic fitness, but no real aerobic base, I don’t think I’d have managed to learn how to run at all without an HR monitor. My (several) initial attempts at trying to become a runner all failed because I was trying to cover an arbitrary 5k, thinking if I kept on repeating that distance I would eventually be able to run the whole thing without stopping. As soon as I tracked my heart rate during those runs, I realised immediately where I’d been going wrong. What I’d taken for burning lungs was in fact my heart pounding like mad and it would typically be north of 200bpm for the first mile, after which I could stand no more and had to run/walk the rest of it. Using the monitor, I was able to experiment and learn that if I kept my HR below about 180, I could run for a fair while (about 20 minutes, and very slowly) without stopping and, critically, without feeling anything like as much discomfort as I had been before. I then set the monitor so it would vibrate when my HR exceeded 180, that way I’d know immediately when I was on borrowed time and that if I didn’t back off before too long, I’d have to stop.As my fitness improved, I found I was able to run by feel much more and turned off the HR alarm but the monitors usefulness and my ability to use it to manage my training continued to evolve. I might not look at the watch on my wrist much anymore, but when I downloaded the data I could see why a bad run had been bad (usually overtraining or illness resulting in my HR being higher for a given speed than it ordinarily would be), why a good run had been good (usually my HR rising more slowly during the run thanks to better fitness, or a harder sustained push towards the end), or when a run has been too long. It’s also helped my motivation to see that I was still working hard, even if my overall times and speeds might’ve been disappointing for other reasons.One of the biggest benefits of wearing the monitor though, is when I’m running with others. I can manage my pace quite well when I’m on my own, but have a bad tendency to set off too fast when training or racing with others. Without the monitor, I probably won’t realise I’ve done it until it’s too late but with it, a quick glance at my wrist is enough to say “crikey, you need to dial it back some.”

I purchased a fitbit charge HR about 8 months back.I only found the HRM charts just a bit of a gimmick and was absolutely no benefit to my training. It's now being laying in the drawer since Christmas.Really IMO these devices are of no use to an ordinary person, in fact it seems to me they can trigger more anxiety about your health than anything else.

me too. I don't use it all the time either, just every other month to keep an eye on what's going on. It's also been interesting for comparing exertion over a 11 hour mountain hike compared to a 2 hour run. the MHR for me also bears no resemblance to what my heart seems to do on a run. I would feel like I was doing nothing is I used that calculation for training purposes.



Author::::ChrisT77

I've always thought they can be helpful to manage different intensity levels in training - the key thing is to have a good understanding of your working range so as to know what level of effort equates to your training objectives. I find them more helpful for long slow runs and rides when you have a tendancy to overdo it than fast/hard sessions when you can more easily tell based on how it feels.
