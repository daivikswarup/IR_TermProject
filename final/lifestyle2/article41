Want to get things done? Stop thinking, start doing

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he annoying portmanteau word “wantrapreneur” describes the (equally annoying) phenomenon of the person who’s constantly talking about the startups they want to launch – “like Airbnb, but for goats! Or for hats!” – without ever doing anything about it. This syndrome goes far beyond the tech world, as you can deduce by comparing the number of your friends who are “working on” a novel or screenplay to the number who’ve written one. But I hadn’t seen the problem clearly until the other day, when I encountered the illustrator <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://boltcity.com/">Kazu Kibuishi</a>’s term for it: “idea debt”. You run up an idea debt, Kibuishi’s fellow artist Jessica Abel <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://observer.com/2016/02/imagining-your-future-projects-is-holding-you-back/">explained</a>, when you spend “too much time picturing what a project is going to be like, too much time thinking about how awesome it will be… and too little time actually making the thing”.</p>

<p>Just as the accruing interest on a credit card makes it harder and harder to get back on your feet financially, idea debt impedes action. The more glorious and detailed the pictures in your mind, the more daunting it feels to start making them real.</p>

<p>The underlying hazard here is that merely thinking about a task feels subtly like you’re doing something constructive about it. This doesn’t only hamper ambitious creative projects, but mundane errands, too: mentally chewing over items on your to-do list feels vaguely productive, yet really wastes time. I love the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ask.metafilter.com/252250/Whats-the-1-change-youve-made-to-improve-your-time-management-skills#3663672">anti-procrastination advice</a> of the blogger and libraries activist Jessamyn West: start including the time you spend thinking about tasks as part of the time it takes to do them. “Some emails, by the time I’ve written them, I feel like I’ve spent five days not-writing them, and the damned things only took five to 10 minutes to write,” West observes. “Now I try to make the task itself take (less) life time by doing it closer to when I [first] think about doing it.”</p>

<p>An especially sneaky form of thinking as a substitute for doing is “deciding”, since it seems so bold and courageous. (“I’m the decider!” George Bush <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/18/rumsfeld/">famously declared</a> – making the point, however clumsily, that deciding means running the show.) Yet a decision alone changes nothing. As Gregg Krech writes in his book <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/06/art-of-taking-action-philosophy-oliver-burkeman">The Art Of Taking Action</a>, external reality remains <em>exactly the same</em> after your decision to ask someone out, to write a book, or leave your job. What matters is “creating ripples”, as he puts it – actions, however tiny, that alter things in the world outside your head.</p>

<p>Generosity is a striking case in point. Acting generously is both morally right and happiness-inducing: what’s not to like? Yet I’ve lost count of the times I’ve decided – truly, sincerely decided – to donate to a charity, thank someone, or offer to help them… then done absolutely nothing at all. (By contrast, I rarely procrastinate over typing a sarcastic tweet.) <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dharma.org/joseph-goldstein">Joseph Goldstein</a>, the meditation teacher, describes his personal “generosity practice”: to just do the generous things he thinks of, as soon as possible, even if doubts or counter-arguments arise. Most of us probably don’t need to become kinder people; we just need to be better at the part where we do a damn thing about it.</p>

Weird comment, RichardWilder. What's the beef? Oliver Burkeman's columns are one of my favourite things in the GUniverse.

I always enjoy reading this contributor's column because he always has something to write that connects with my life and I would assume a majority of the readers. Making decisions and how and when to put them into effect is always and issue for me.

I'm sorry to say I'm cursed by both perfectionism and procrastination. I constantly have to remind myself of the 75% rule - it doesn't have to be perfect, just finished!!

One of the best pieces of advice I received is not to wait until you feel like doing something - just do it!

Nature loves simplicity. If what you are about to do seems unduly complex - then sleeping on it will often produce a simpler solution, I reckon. Writers of fine print in contracts and lawyers excepted, of course.

So true. Whilst it's not a difficult concept, so many community and business projects fail to get off the ground don't know what the steps are / could be. Writing a practical plan with dates etc, is part of the doing, and where for many, the magic could start.

Hardly relevant but seeing as you're so interested in my finances, I work a good job and spent my 20s building a business in my spare time which I sold for enough to put a 50% deposit on a house. So...if cash was the only barrier to going to Patagonia I wouldn't be too worried.

I'm a doer. Always have been. I get an idea, and I do it. The problem is, everything I do turns out a bit 5hit, so I'm also a serial failure. Which can get a bit depressing (and expensive). I handle the disappointments by pushing water uphill on a new project. I wish I could just procrastinate, but I'd probably screw that up too. Not sure how to get off this vicious cycle.

Probably 85 % of people posting comment on line in the Guardian are doing so whilst at work, should be doing something else and/ or should be getting on with it. They are in fact reading this article (OK it's Saturday, when duty calls). Has anybody measured the potentially negative effect of comment addiction on productivity or GDP. God knows what damage Facebook has done to those companies that do not monitor internet usage and then there's other social media, TV and Netflix etc............From the black hole.....

I don't believe that you can learn to be a good writer. Most of them just sat down and wrote. It's a marketing machine that gets people to do all the courses. They don't usually write afterwards anyway or could write without the course.

There are more failed businesses than those that keep going so not everything is so simple . It is naive to think that if one will stop procrastinating everything will be fine. You are lucky that your business works, hope it grows nicely for you.

If athletes repeatedly go through a process in their mind to improve performance why then does it not seem to work in achieving other goals? I think it actually does help. The problem arises when you think of something you really are not motivated or equipped to achieve.

While I don't doubt the sincerity or well intended sentiment of this article, it presents a far too simplistic view. Perhaps on a day to day basis, with respect to 'getting things done' this applies, however time spent making a decision or contemplating how to achieve the desired goals should be proportional to the impact and perceived effect on one's happiness.
