Scientists identify cause of multiple miscarriages for first time




DateTime::::2016-03-08T00:59:43+0000



<p>Hopes of preventing women from suffering multiple miscarriages have been boosted after UK-based scientists have for the first time identified a cause.</p>

<p>Research into developing a treatment will be undertaken by the same academics behind <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.2222/abstract">the breakthrough research</a>, which discovered that a lack of stem cells in the womb lining is causing thousands of women to suffer from recurrent miscarriages.</p>

<p>One in five pregnancies are thought to end in a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/blog/2014/oct/08/miscarriage">miscarriage</a>, while one in 100 women trying to conceive suffer recurrent miscarriages, which has been defined as the loss of three or more consecutive <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/pregnancy">pregnancies</a>.</p>

<p>Researchers at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/universityofwarwick">University of Warwick</a> found that a shortfall of stem cells is the likely cause of accelerated ageing of the lining of the womb, which results in the failure of some pregnancies.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/19/grief-readers-on-overcoming-pain-miscarriage">'Don't push down your grief': our readers describe the pain of miscarriage | Guardian readers and Sarah Marsh</a> </p>

<p>Jan Brosens, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology who led the team, said: “We have discovered that the lining of the womb in the recurrent miscarriage patients we studied is already defective before pregnancy.</p>

<p> “I can envisage that we will be able to correct these defects before the patient tries to achieve another pregnancy. In fact, this may be the only way to really prevent miscarriages in these cases.”<br/></p>

<p>Siobhan Quenby, a co-author of the study and University of Warwick professor of obstetrics, said that the real challenge now was to develop strategies to increase the function of stem cells in the womb lining and that new interventions to improve the lining of the womb would be piloted in the spring of 2016.</p>

<p>“Our focus will be two-fold. First, we wish to improve the screening of women at risk of recurrent miscarriage by developing new endometrial tests,” added Quenby, who is also an honorary consultant at University hospital Coventry.</p>

<p>“Second, there are a number of drugs and other interventions, such as endometrial ‘scratch’, a procedure used to help embryos implant more successfully, that have the potential to increase the stem cell populations in the womb lining.”</p>

<p>The researchers examined tissue samples from womb lining donated by 183 women who were being treated at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/tsm/bru/clinic/">Implantation Research Clinic</a>, University hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust.<br/></p>

<p>Women who had lost three consecutive pregnancies were found to have a reduced number of stem cells in their womb lining.</p>

<p>The study, a collaboration between the University of Warwick’s medical school and Warwick systems biology centre, has been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/stem.2222/abstract">published in the journal Stem Cells</a>. It was funded by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.genesisresearchtrust.com/">Genesis Research Trust</a> and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/research/tsm/bru/">Biomedical Research Unit in Reproductive Health</a>, a joint initiative between Warwick medical school and University hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust.<br/></p>

<p>Support for anyone affected by miscarriage is provided by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/">Miscarriage Association</a>, which also works to raise awareness and to promote good practice in medical care.</p>

It is easy to prescribe levothyroxine. Few doctors will prescribe anything else and some, perhaps a considerable number, seem to need something other than straight levothyroxine.

How do I know? Might it be because it is my body? Might it be because previous to 2016 I wasn't living in a cave without expert obstetric care, was instead diagnosed and treated successfully for a completely separate condition? I am almost touched by your sudden, tender concern for my fertility/general well-being. Nonetheless, it seems quite clear to me that none of it is pertinent to this discussion. Certainly a person capable of such evident compassion for the fertility troubles of others would agree that the women referred to in this piece, victims of recurrent miscarriages caused by stem cell troubles in the womb, deserve to have those of us untouched by this scourge pay attention to a breakthrough that for them likely represents new hope, and celebrate it with them.

I felt lost when I miscarried my twins. I knew no words can ever make me feel better but I do know a lot can hurt me. I lost hope and didn't want to try again. And when I decided to try again, failed IVF treatments and other medications made me feel worse, that I lost my chance of becoming a mom. But after cycles of pregnancytips pills, I am now a very happy mom of one. The journey has been hard but worth it. And I thank my husband and family for all the support..

more importantly this points to a likely autoimmune component to the low number of stem cells as well , with many etiologies.

Nothing to do with it. This has been a problem as far back as medical records take us. There was no corresponding increase for pill takers.

How do you know it's not the cause of your fertility problems? Not many people who were exposed to DES are aware they were exposed (especially here in the UK, where the whole thing was swept under the carpet even more effectively than in the US).

Thank you for your kind reply. I am a bit further down my own timeline than you. My best friend is a lifelong vegetarian and has been extremely careful about what she and her family ingested. She was diagnosed with Lupus 10 years ago and has nearly died on several occasions, while her unvaccinated son was diagnosed at age 2 son, severely affected with autism and never developed language. It never seemed fair. But that isn't how health works. As you say, until it happens to you, luck would seem a very distant component to one's own health. My own father was similarly smug until he began to believe his own press, ignored his doctor's advice ("that money-grubbing cheat") and ended up causing his own permanent disability as a result. I wouldn't be so crass as to say he deserved it, but he certainly changed his tune and stopped advising friends and family to avoid doctors, eat right and avoid weight gain. Apparently slim people become ill too. Who knew?

That is all very informative, but it is not relevant to this piece, this research and new hope for women with non-DES related recurrent miscarriages. Please can we just allow them to enjoy this announcement without everybody sticking an oar in about infertility problems that don't relate to them???? PLEASE???

Not necessarily in the case of sub-clinical hypothyroidism. Doctors are happy if your TSH test results are obviously out of range but other than that it's a tough slog to get treatment.

I'm really glad to see progress being made in this area. I spend part of my PhD investigating recurrent miscarriage, our thinking being that certain mucus proteins that are supposed to be downregulated after implantation were being overexpressed, causing the embryo to be pushed off the uterine wall. I spent 18 months developing the techniques to test the hypothesis, but didn't find much to support it. Science.

"I wish more people would celebrate this new discovery rather than bring up every little unrelated nugget they've been carrying around hoping someday they could have their 5" of attention."Although DES was pulled off the market decades ago, it's still an issue as far as fertility is concerned, because there are several million people alive today who were exposed to it in the womb, some of whom are still of childbearing age (particularly in Europe, where DES usage peaked a lot later than it did in America). Also, there's some evidence to suggest that the fertility problems can persist into the third generation (DES grandchildren), and of course there's also the fact that, every day, millions of women around the world are taking contraceptive hormones with similar endocrine disrupting properties to DES!

I don't think a short luteal phase would be identified as a cause of miscarriage, but as a failure to get pregnant? I have a short luteal phase, and without progesterone support I never got to the stage of getting a positive pregnancy test. Possibly there was an egg being fertilised but either getting turfed out before it implanted or when it had only just implanted, but whilst that might be technically miscarriage it would never be clinically identified as such because I wouldn't have got a positive pregnancy test.

Yes, I can imagine that would be utterly infuriating. I have a friend who suffered similarly, and has now adopted after a 10 year journey through various unsuccessful infertility treatments, some of which were financially costly; all of which were emotionally costly. Breezy comments like the one you describe were jaw-dropping (often coupled with the suggestion that helping out social services is an additional bonus to the situation of not being able to have a tummy baby). I really hope your adoption goes well.

Maritz, thank you for this wonderful comment. As I have made my way through 51 years of life, I have been lucky enough to enjoy good health, and I haven't seen a doctor in more than 30 years (knock on wood for luck!). I'm a farmer and have been injured, but have been able to heal without medical intervention. Because I have decent genes, eat fairly healthy and exercise daily, but most importantly, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN LUCKY! I have friends who took better care of themselves than me and died through no fault of their own, and have other friends who have terrible health habits and are still around in their 60s, 70s and 80s -- because they're fortunate, and have had ample help from modern medicine.

Probably the solution, as stem cells are in so many situations.



Author::::Schadkitty

It is the cause in so far as putting more stem cells into a uterus will prevent miscarriages. What causes the depletion of stem cells is something that will investigated.

Oh, come on. Women who have had this many miscarriages will be desperate to conceive and carry to term. They will therefor have ceased drinking, smoking, will be eating very carefully and not eating paint chips between meals. Recurrent miscarriage happens to city women, country women, drivers, non-drivers. And how stupid do you have to be to conclude that these women are subject to stress???? REALLY???? What about the women who carry to term after 4 or more miscarriages? It's always something the woman is doing wrong, isn't it? That's the easy answer, for all the easy come, easy go types who find the most blindingly obvious reaction common to all in the face of such an awful set of circumstances only to turn in back on the victim and blame the outcome on their reaction to it. This thread seems to have attracted some of the most stupid moths to it's flame. Unbelievable.

I would respectfully suggest that "Everything comes down to" what you can understand given your life experience, training etc. Hence your very simplistic model of bodily malfunction being down to diet. Obviously, diet is important, but there are many other factors at work, not least the also very simple fact that we are living almost three times as long as what may be termed our "design life". It is a triumph of medicine and the science you dismiss so readily that so many of us manage to pass through this extended existence with relative ease and success. "Science always seems to look for the directly related cause but never for the starting cause" is an absurd statement, very far from the truth. Science demands that, in the context of the article, you examine each postulated cause of a malfunction in logical sequence. Clearly, this progression can get more complex with every success. We literally owe our lives to the success of this methodology which, incidentally, also provided the scientific basis for the sound diet you make so much of. Where did you think the knowledge came from - instinct? Leave that to the Paleo idiots.

Diet.. Everything comes down to your gut flora and the nutrition your body absorbs. Simply put without proper nutrition the body can't sustain itself as well as it should, and you get issues like these. The body is is an engine, feed that engine with poor fuel and your economy suffers. It's ALL related to diet. Food isn't just something to consume, it literally becomes you.

If a genetic abnormality is so catastrophic a miscarriage is the result no improvement in the uterine lining will prevent it. When such a miscarriage occurs it does so because the embryo stopped developing (pre-heartbeat) or died (post-heartbeat). When the embryo dies the body expels the tissue, and sometimes it must be forcibly removed. There is no "resuscitating" it, regardless of how and when it leaves the woman's body.

Unfortunately I know someone with Juvenile RA who was afraid she wouldn't be able to cope with children if she waited, got pregnant and had a child with two different men, both relationships collapsed (one dad ended up in jail, twice), is back to living with her mum and only one of her children, the other in the custody of the jailed dad's own parents. She's a mess.

I suspect that you are confusing miscarriages in which a pregnancy of a healthy embryo w/ heartbeat is lost and miscarriages which are the result of an embryo that has stopped developing and has no discernible heartbeat due to a genetic disorder.

For the record, I had one successful pregnancy and then suffered secondary infertility (inability to get pregnant a second time). After treatment we got pregnant but lost at 20 weeks. Eventually gave up and fostered two children and are currently looking into adopting them, but if anyone suggests that the infertile 'just adopt' - that's the one that really 'boils my piss' (wow - what a metaphor!) because fostering and adoption are soooo hard, and soooo not like having a tummy baby.

Thank you - I'm enjoying your assault on the 'it was not meant to be' narrative. I am lucky in that I have only had a single miscarriage (among 3 successful pregnancies) but the loss was nonetheless a sad one and the 'it was not meant to be' comments always boiled my piss a bit. I'm sure they meant well, and this is not meant unkindly to those who said it.

The link to cancer was first announced in 1971. Up until that time, as far as the public (and most doctors) knew, DES was a safe and effective treatment (although there had actually been numerous problems seen in animal testing right from the outset, and a large case-controlled study published in 1953, and several subsequent studies, showing that it was completely ineffective at preventing miscarriages).
