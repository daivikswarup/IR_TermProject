Ten things every first-time marathon runner needs to know




DateTime::::2016-03-03T12:05:56+0000



<p>It’s not hard to spot a first-time marathon runner. If the Lycra, antisocial running times, colour-coded training plan, running watch and constant look of fear don’t give it away, then the plates of pasta and stack of gels certainly will.<br/></p>

<p>However, what no one tells you when you sign up for a marathon – which is, let’s face it, a very long way – is that the word “marathon” isn’t just a description of the 26.2-mile endurance race you are going to run. In truth, the marathon journey is a lot longer than that (and I’m only six weeks in to training). It also involves a lot more than just running.</p>

<p>When you’re not clocking not up the miles, you’re thinking about them, talking about them, even dreaming about them. Days are no longer measured in hours but in miles completed and laundry baskets filled.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/aug/07/training-for-a-10k-while-undergoing-chemo-just-making-the-start-line-was-my-goal">Training for a 10k while undergoing chemo? Just making the start line was my goal</a> </p>

<p>For someone with a cancer-scarred body and a hip full of metal (from having my pelvis sawn in three and repositioned eight years ago), the starting line of the London Marathon means everything to me. I started thinking about it when I ran my first ever 10k during chemo. I started dreaming about it as I hobbled my way injured around my first half marathon last year. Now, six weeks in to my training plan, I am starting to think that this rearranged body of mine might just make it. </p>

<p>People talk a lot about those 26.2 miles, but they talk a lot less about the miles you have to run - and the hurdles you have to overcome - just to get there. Here are a few of the things I just wish I’d known before I hit the road.</p>

<p>Excuses, excuses, excuses: you wouldn’t be a marathon runner if you weren’t full of them. We think nothing of signing up for a hardcore endurance race, only to be put off training by a drop of rain. My favourite excuse so far? I would have run home if I’d had a bag for my phone and iPad. But the truth is, apart from a rather painful encounter with a treadmill, I’ve never regretted going for a run – or the feeling that comes with it. I have, however, regretted turning over in bed. Tomorrow isn’t always a better day; it’s just one day closer to race day. </p>

<p>Don’t believe me? Then get downloading and see if you can tear yourself away from those fluffy white clouds. Just remember: no amount of refreshing will change the picture, and a race in the rain can actually be fun, so long as you have taken the necessary precautions and found a bag for that phone (see 1). Just don’t expect your weather apps to always agree.</p>

<p>You can survive for decades without even thinking about the cobbled streets or the kerbs in your life. But start marathon training and I guarantee that you’ll think about nothing else. Who knew that life could be so hazardous? Even a trip to the bathroom takes on a new meaning when there are stairs involved.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but there’s a reason those party invites have dried up and it’s got nothing to do with your gruelling training schedule. Truth is, unless you’re talking to runners, running chat really isn’t that exciting. Talk about how far you’ve come and you’ll probably just be encouraged to get a move on, preferably in the opposite direction. I love nothing more than learning a new running term but now understand that this isn’t a view shared by friends, family and colleagues. </p>

<p>If you’re running London this year, you’re set to be <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/en-gb/event-info/oneinamillion/">#oneinamillion</a>. That’s a lot of runners and a lot of good tips. How was my life ever truly complete without a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2014/feb/28/foam-roller-runners-guide-muscles">foam roller</a>? Every running wardrobe really does need a second pair of trainers (in case the first pair fails close to race day). And, I will be for ever grateful to the nutritionist who told me that you can go a long way on one banana.</p>

<p>When you’re taking on a challenge of marathon proportions, it seems everyone has a view, whether that’s the ultramarathoner who tells you “it’s not that far” or the couch potato who advises on the placement of Vaseline. What you choose to do with your nipples is your business. </p>

<p>Now is the time to listen to your body, not the highlighter pen on the training plan. Yes, we all want to stick with the programme. But, I’ve been told on more than one occasion that there is enough fat in the plan to allow for a few injury breaks. I listen when my metal-filled left hip protests. </p>

<p>This great piece of advice was given to me by serial marathon runner <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lazygirlrunning.com/">Laura Fountain</a>. As point 4 suggests, no one wants to hear when you’re clocking up those milestone and not tripping on kerbs. But throw in a few tales of woe and you might find yourself with an audience. People switch off when I talk about my favourite ever run at the Royal Parks half marathon last year, but they can’t get enough of my “hornet stung my bum cheek” running tale.</p>

<p>Sadly, there is a reason why many people training for a marathon don’t lose weight. I think it might have something to do with the fact you only ever run 26.2 miles once but there’s a temptation to eat like you’re doing one every other day.</p>

<p>When I tell people I’ve got a hip full of metal, most start talking about whether or not I should be running a marathon, not whether or not I can. In truth, I still don’t know whether I will make the starting line. What I do know, however, is that a little bit of self belief and determination can take you a long way. And, by taking every step for the amazing charity <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.breastcancercare.org.uk">Breast Cancer Care</a> - who supported me when I was undergoing treatment in 2014 - I know I will do everything I can to go the distance. </p>

Three pieces of advice from someone who has run some marathons well, and others abysmally: 



Author::::MarathonPixie

I like to have a bowl of porridge a couple of hours before. Whatever you do, make sure it's tried and tested on your long runs - race day really isn't the time to try something new! 



Author::::jfd1960

I know this is anathema to some marathoners, especially faster runners, but don't be shy of taking walking breaks - better to take regular walking breaks than completely hit the wall at 17 or 18 miles and end up staggering along to the finish. And definitely do this in your long runs, gives your body a break and you'll be a lot less wrecked from an 18-miler the next day or two. And obviously, you need to do those long runs, most important part of your training.

Point 17..... You don't take Ibuprofen when running (or I Guess other physical exercise). It is paracetamol. Plenty of studies have highlighted the risks of the former. Something to do with the way it does damage to the intestine, kidneys and plays around with your muscles.

1. Don't drink too much in the morning. 2. Caffiene is your friend, use it wisely. 3. Take electrolyte tabs with you. 4. Plan when you refuel, it helps split the race into smaller sections. 5. Peanut butter and jam butties cut into bitesize cubes, frozen overnight. Perfect at mile 18 when you hit the wall.6. Ibuprofen to have with the butties at mile 18. Lifesaver.7. Use the pace runners. A good pace runner will keep the group around then engaged while keeping a set pace.8. For the love of god, do not eat the jelly babies that kids hand out. Think of all those sweaty penis hands that have been in that tub before yours. 9. There's no shame in talking to yourself at mile 20 and beyond.

Not really relevant, but as a former ultra runner I can assure you that one is capable of eating immediately before and during a run. I would start my long runs before dawn , stop and get a McDonalds breakfast then run some more!

That's your story, and it's great - the issue for me is you seem to be saying everyone should share your experience or perspective - that poster didn't, and that should be ok. For the record, as I read through the rest of the comments I noticed that you contributed a number of really thoughtful and kind entries; the one I responded to seems very out of place. I wish you many years and miles of happy running :)

Hi all - I'm not a runner but a walker - but thought you'd collectively have some advice! I've been suffering from Plantar Fasciitis in my right heel for 7 months and I'm really fed up now. I have had physio (NHS - a few exercises and acupuncture actually into the tenderest points - which has made it much worse!), private physio (lovely lady but can't afford any more of that and didn't do much for me) and seen NHS Orthopaedic dept who just offered to inject steroids (not keen on that idea after reading up on pros and cons). I also have a selection of specialist insoles for shoes, and sleep in a night splint . Have any of you found ANYTHING else that's worked for you? Really need my walking back again, as do my hounds!

The poster said it was their single greatest sports achievement, not that it was the fastest they had ever run. I can think of several reasons why this could be so. What a shame that you couldn't mirror some of that poster's pithy humility in your post.

Applications of 3M Cavilon barrier film spray or 3 ml wand applied layers to bits vulnerable to chafing such as inner thighs. An extra layer of Germolene new skin in such places works wonders although as it gets worn it will leave you with what looks like a nasty peeling skin disease.

Carloading the night before can be a bi dangerous. I just have a light pasta dish (last time it was squash ravioli in the italian near the hotel - small portion) and a small glass of wine to chill me out a bit!



Author::::2beFrank

Completely agree with 3 - that last training run is HARD and was a little de-motivating for me... The race was much easier and more fun!

11) Don't underestimate the taper. You won't gain any fitness in the last week (though could gain an injury if you do too much), so any runs should purely be to keep the legs moving. You'll be amazed how "fresh" your legs feel on the day after that last week of minimal running.

you ran a badly paced 2.47 marathon (the second hardest in the USA) aged 16 and never got around to bettering it? I know people who debuted slower than that in easy races who now run olympic standard times.

Thanks... useful tip. So you don't carb load the night before? And do you use gels during the race?The liquidy one I tried was nice. The marmalady one was like having a stone in my stomach... for hours!

Thanks... I need all the good vibes I can get. If all goes well, I should just pip in under the requisite 3 hours.. and that will be good progress.Yes, I saw the white star article. They sound fantastic. I'd be over like a shot if I won the pools! Sounds like a great day out rather than an exhausting race.

12 marathons PB 3hrs 1m (yes, I know it's a bummer). Training is the key: build up to a weekly mileage of 50-55 with at least a 20 miler a week before the race. Three beers a week. Taper down training with two non-running days before the race. Drink water only during the race. Wear hat if it's sunny. Work out your anticipated average minutes per mile and try to stick with it. Don't start off too fast. Obviously wear decent shoes that have been totally run-in.Trust me.

Did my first and only Marathon in 1981 (Leicester). Trained for a year - lost 3 stone in weight, but was a healthy 20 year old, not with any of the problems of the author. So loads of respect for doing this. For me it kick started a love for running that I've continued with ever since - max races now are half marathons, but enjoy 10 mile and 10k more.

Running for fun at this time of year is easiest on a weekend, in daylight, somewhere interesting. For me, that usually means off-road on one of the commons around where I live (lucky me, there are several) or down as many footpaths as I can string together. Don't set out with any objectives, just enjoy your surroundings.

I'm sure it won't kill you but 800mg of ibuprofen is double the recommended dose and can damage your stomach.

Nice article. Thanks. As a road builder and runner I've long despaired over why councils prefer a barrier type kerb to a rollover type which is almost impossible to trip over and safer for cyclists too. The answers I get is that its a more traditional look (who looks at the kerb except me? And why then arent the cars driving on something more traditional?) and that the barrier kerb stops cars parking on the pavement or nature strip (it doesn't).

Nice article, really good luck! I did my first one at 52, agree with all of those. Especially the one about putting on weight. I've done three now and have put on weight every time, but I just got so much more hungry. Very annoying indeed.

Do the training, and don't skip the long runs.



Author::::KentonCooooool
DateTime::::2016-03-03T16:21:27Z
I'm similar to you. I took the Summer off from football; and basically avoided any 5-aside and friendlies. I did all my training and completed the race in 4hrs (I was set for 3:50:00 but hey ho). After I finished, I decided I'd take 2 weeks off, before I returned to football. I played 45 mins and I was absolutely fucked for about 2.5 months after. I really can't envision me running another marathon unless I can lose a fair bit of weight. My body just would not recover probably. So I'll stick to 5k, 10k and Halves for now.



Author::::KentonCooooool
DateTime::::2016-03-03T16:17:27Z
I overheard some old chap during my first mararthon state - "it's a 20mile run, followed by a 10k race". I found out in hindsight that he was spot on.



Author::::chris199
DateTime::::2016-03-03T15:50:35Z
Incredible. You ran your first 10k while undergoing chemotherapy, half marathon a year later and now you're training for a marathon? I'm lost for words. You must have some kind of super powers. A little bit of self belief and determination? Even getting to the start line of any of those runs is a massive achievement. Good luck for the marathon (doesn't sound like you need it though!)



Author::::PeteTheBeat
DateTime::::2016-03-03T15:39:27Z
For point 21, I would go further. If you can, run the route in, say, 10km sections in the weeks before.

I did my only marathon when I was 29 or so. I had trained for 2 others but had to pull out a few weeks beforehand when it was obvious that the pain in my knee and then ankle needed rest.

I have lost weight.. Just not tons. I have to eat. I'm starving on training days. It's true that friends are bored by your chat. Find a blog to wibble on. My first half marathon, my first ever race, is just over two weeks away.It's a bit early and I've bitten a lot off.. I'm going to have to chew hard. But whatever happens I know I put the training in and that counts for a lot. I've come a very long way from five months ago when I couldn't run 200 metres without dying!



Author::::ID390331
DateTime::::2016-03-03T15:12:16Z
Do the training, and don't skip the long runs. Get to the start line fit and healthy, with adequate nutrition and hydration. Have a race plan and stick to it. Be conservative. First time is for getting around,, next time you can push harder. Better to finish and think you could have run faster than die at 20 miles because you pushed too fast too early.
