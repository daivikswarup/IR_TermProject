Is it worth it: weighted squats – exercise review




DateTime::::2016-03-05T06:00:56+0000



<p><strong>What is it? </strong>A full-body compound exercise. Basically, it’s sitting down on an invisible chair, then standing up, ideally with weights attached.</p>

<p><strong>How much does it cost? </strong>You can do them without equipment, free of charge. But, unless you have weights at home, you will need a gym membership.</p>

<p><strong>What does it promise? </strong>Squats are one of the most vital exercises you can do, the kings of the workout world. Julie Kroon, trainer at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://speedflex.com/" title="">Speedflex</a>, says: “Squats will strengthen your quads, hamstrings and glutes as well as your core. There’s also a cardio benefit if they are performed quick enough in high volume.” A strong bum is the key to fitness and strength, and will improve almost everything from your lower back to your core.</p>

<p><strong>What’s it actually like? </strong>I’ll get the horrible bit out of the way first: whenever I’ve thrown up in a gym, it’s always been thanks to squats. Squats with heavy weights involve such a huge movement that they can very easily bring you right to the point of exhaustion. However, I don’t vomit every time I do squats, so neither will you. The joy of them is their sheer versatility. If you’re new, you can squat without weights. For an explosive burst of energy, factor in a jump at the top of the movement. You can do squats with dumbbells, or barbells, or with weighted belts, and you can go as heavy as your body will allow. Maybe don’t eat a big dinner right before, though.</p>

<p><strong>Best and worst bit</strong> Squats work, plain and simple.</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong> Every trainer in the world will tell you yes, so yes.</p>

Oh god the gym squirts. Pee early, pee often, change your tampon when you change into your gym clothes, and pray. As I'm sure most of the women on here already know, but I wish someone had told me when I was green, so. Also, those pants with the built-in light pad are particularly comfortable and useful for embarrassment-free workouts!

but never deeper than legs at 90 degrees. Past that, I am informed, you risk blowing your knees.

I don't think that's really an issue for anyone other than the person doing half squats. We all know what the real issue is: people doing curls in the squat rack.

Must admit I really don't like ditching back squats but occasionally needs must when you just can't get out of the hole. Ditching a front squat is easy of course but unless you're in a real weightlifting gym with bumper plates it tends to get you in trouble.

It's not getting rid of it that's the problem, it's getting it up there! If you don't have a rack, only way to do back squat is C+P or C+J then lower to your back. Not ideal.

Biggest issue in squats - esp in globo gyms - people banging out reps thinking they are the proverbial dogs b...... but not actually breaking parallel.



Author::::CharlesC1983
DateTime::::2016-03-07T10:13:02Z
Depends on the weight for a front squat - you could clean the weight up into a front rack with lighter or more manageable weights but heavy heavy off a rack.Ditching from the back is easy as long as you arent bent over too much ! Elbows under the bar and shrug it off or walk forward.



Author::::CharlesC1983

More obvious stuff from the Guardian ! I am sure the weights can vary and taking into account peoples physical limitations or current/past injuries. But yes !

I am pretty sure weights could damage or hurt anyone done in an incorrect fashion. Lets all wrap ourselves in cotton wool...

'Bum-to-heels' seems deeply unwise, though I otherwise agree with you.

Ditching a back squat isn't so hard and providing you're not going for maxes all the time, which isn't really a good idea anyway, I don't see them as being that dangerous.

No. Didn't your granny warn you that if you did exercise during your period your womb would fall out? Best stick to a little gentle embroidery.



Author::::99John99

Sure - if done wrong, ie if you let your back arch inwards, which is what is invited the way it's described here.

Yes, you can eat the beans aswell when you've done your squats.

You can, if you excuse the pun, they are fine as a starting point, they won't really provide much resistance though. A bag of sugar or flour is good, or filling a bottle with water. Or you could next in a very cheap resistance band which is portable, lightweight, extremely versatile and you can do loads of exercises with.

You don't do just squats though, there are plenty of exercises and equipment you can use in a gym, a membership is only wasted if you don't use it, but that is true of anything in life, plenty of peole buy clothes they never wear, food they throw away, gadgets they don't need or books and magazines they don't read. My son pays £12.99 a month for his gym, a no frills gym bear our home, the mere act of paying ensures he attends regularly.

The list of professional and amateur athletes ruined by squats with weights is a long one. They crush your lower intervertebral discs. It is an exceptionally stupid activity. It is one of the few movements that can injure a previously normal intervertebral disc.

Used to do them in my early 20's up to 200kg for 8 reps, not anymore, I now do deep leg presses less pressure on my lower back and it isolates my legs more and my legs are shifting more weight.



Author::::BeegHerSelf
DateTime::::2016-03-06T04:15:27Z
For sure. Just know two things: you might squirt a bit (so be prepared), and you probably might want to do lower weights and higher reps).

Alan Thrall's videos on YouTube are pretty much the best advice you will get on squatting properly. eg http://youtu.be/bs_Ej32IYgo

I'm a wimpy cyclist (75kg @ 185cm) but even I squat 100kg, and deadlift 150. It's pretty hard to do that with bags of rice. Lifting heavy weights doesn't make you bigger, it just makes you stronger. There's a vast difference between strength training and bodybuilding.

You can't really do back squats safely without a rack. Front squats are a different matter of course but you are limited by your clean. Goblet/barbell/bodyweight squats of course can be done without a rack.

I'm assuming that Monkey Puzzle has never back squatted enough weight that he needs a rack to offload the weight safely after the lift. I'm assuming he doesn't quit understand the difference between a goblet squat, a back squat, or a front squat in the weight they work your body. I'm kind of assuming he doesn't know what he is talking about - otherwise his comment makes no sense at all.



Author::::cybersuperhero

Depends what kind. A standard goblet squat or front squat can be done at home with dumbbells, but if you want to do a barbell squat, then you do really need to join a gym.

Where can I get this 200kg bag of rice, and by what mechanism will i get it onto my traps?

Yes, because you will be in your own home anyway, keeping your impure body away from men and reflecting on your shameful condition.

Is it okay for me to do this on the heavier days of my period?



Author::::niall duncan
DateTime::::2016-03-05T13:14:47Z
Not really. My gym membership is £17 a month. Decent power rack is £250, 100kg weights plus bar (which won't last a man long) is about £200. Take into account all the other equipment available and it is better value to work in the gym. Plus save space in the house. Never need to replace anything etc. My gym is a very well known, 24 hr, national chain and their memberships are under £20, even in London.

I do them with a solid aluminium sculpture that just happens to be around the same size (but not shape) as a medicine ball; weights don't get more expensive than that!
