Experience: I fought off a mountain lion




DateTime::::2016-03-11T14:00:04+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span> spent most of my early life without direction. Raised in Minnesota, my family was so large – I have six siblings – it felt as if it was survival of the fittest and I began acting up for attention. I had my first beer in kindergarten, my first joint in seventh grade and my first line of cocaine at high school. I was making my parents cry every day. Aged 24, I threw everything in a van and left for Colorado. Three months after arriving, I was broke. To help clear my head, I often hiked through Roxborough state park, about 15 miles south-west of Denver. There are no dogs or bicycles allowed there. It’s just you and your hiking boots. From the top of the mountain the view is breathtaking – mountain ranges as far as you can see. I’d never felt a sense of calm like I did up there.</p>

<p>On 30 April 1998, I was 50 yards from the top of the mountain when I saw a long, brown tail poking out from behind a pine tree. There hadn’t been a mountain lion sighting in the park for over a year, but I immediately knew that’s what it was. I froze, watching the tree. The mountain lion’s head would come up and look around, then it would go back to whatever it was eating, its jaws crunching through the bones of its kill.</p>

<p>I started backing away, keeping my eyes on the lion. You couldn’t carry a firearm in a national park at the time, but I did have my two-and-a-half-inch utility knife and I started folding out the blade as a precaution. Then the screwdriver loudly snapped back into the case. There was the mountain lion, its yellow eyes looking at me as though it knew every thought in my head. The ears were slanted in attack position, its teeth yellow splinters buried in black gums.</p>

<p>I opened my mouth to say, “Hey, you can have this mountain, I’m leaving” but before I could, the mountain lion smashed right into my chest, knocking me off the trail. Its claws were in my knees, my neck, my chest. Its jaw stretched over my head from my hairline to the back of my skull. There was no pain, only the smell of rotting flesh, the smell of death.</p>

<p>I stabbed at it with my knife, but its hide was too tough. I saw blood on my hand and realised I’d stabbed myself through the palm. The lion ripped a gash under my left eye, then bit my head again. All I could see was blood.</p>

<p>Feeling the lion’s face, I found its right eye and pushed my thumb through the eyelid all the way to the muscle at the back of the eye. I managed to get my knife free and stabbed at the top of its head before pulling myself to my feet and running away, down the trail.</p>

<p>Blood covered my clothes. At one point I turned and saw the lion watching me from the bough of a tree. But instead of the lion I thought I could see the face of God. I ran on, screaming, “Help. 911. Lion!” Two women dragged me to a medical helicopter near the visitors’ centre. Eight minutes later I was in hospital.</p>

<p>I spent six hours in surgery. It took 70 staples to close my head wound – the hospital’s record. I had wounds across my neck, chest, thighs, shoulders, arms and stomach, but Colorado’s hot, dry air had clotted my blood and stopped me bleeding to death.</p>

<p>I was able to walk out of hospital four days later. At this point, bloody footprints were all park rangers had found of the mountain lion.</p>

<p>Almost a year later I received a phone call saying a female mountain lion had been cornered in a nearby garden. The lion had a one-inch scar on the top of her head and was missing an eye. I had the choice to have her shot there and then. Arguing that she’d just been defending herself, I persuaded the park rangers to set her free.</p>

<p>I’d hurt people through being malicious and careless, and the lion hurt me through natural instinct. In a way, it had more of a right to live than I did. The whole incident changed my life for the better. I gave up drink and drugs, and found religion. I’ve been saved twice, once from the lion and once from my own self-destructive urges.</p>

I ran across a wolf by myself in the woods when I was 10. Having an animal look at you to determine whether you might make an easy meal will release chemicals in your brain you never knew you had. The skin does very strange things too, the expression make your skin crawl is very accurate.

Kill the Cougar!!!???? Sometimes I write a little piece about a place I live at part of the year.It is home to a cougar and a black bear. Haven't seen the cougar but he is clearly there. His eating habits make that pretty clear. Haven't seen the bear, but have several photos of him from a wildlife camera attached to a tree. Ain't sayin' they are my friends, but there ain't now reason to kill these guys. For what? A trophy? They have a right to live too. Bring a whistle into the woods, make noise, look around and 99.999% of the time ya will be alright. Stories like this wouldn't make the newspapers unless they were very very rare. These critters really don't want to meet us. Mountain lions (cougars) though truly do not take kindly to being disturbed while munching. A neighbor had a similar experience as described in this article, but he did not get attacked. Bottom line: Let your presence be known, walk loudly, give the critters a chance to get out of the way.

Please don't belittle this person experience. Obviously he went through a harrowing experience and survived. He took what happened to him and learned from it to improve his life. I guess that you wouldn't argue with him giving up drugs, so what's wrong with him finding God? Maybe you will too one day.

That this animal would simply attack a person makes it clearly one that should be put down. Saying otherwise is ridiculous. But then they haven't been doing that religiously in Yellowstone with the bears that have killed people.

Because there is no evidence of a higher being, monotheistic or otherwise,which means the people who invented him/her/it are frauds and I'm sorry, but we've uncovered ancient civilisations, Dinosaurs and genetic science has allowed us to better understand life and its origins. Not one single shred of evidence exists to support the theory of a creator - let alone evidence of anyone ever having communicated with it.

> You should be first in line when it's time for culling.>So you'd advocate culling people instead of bison? Rather than attacking me, read about the reality of conservation and what needs to be done so that these large animals are around in future: http://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/bisonmgntfaq.htm .

> Deffinately but it should be sanctioned by the experts i nthe field>Since there is no shortage of cougars (in most of their range), and they are hunted, it seems really absurd to me to not put down one that is a known attacker of people. Now that it is missing an eye, it will be even more stressed and less capable of killing the usual food supply for cougars, which isn't supposed to be errant people wandering around in their hiking boots.

> Why would a thinking supposedly humane being take revenge > on an animal?>Revenge? This sounds like something that greeny tree hugger Leonardo What'sHisName would say. The reason an animal that kills people should be put down is because they are more likely to do it again. Since our goal should be to manage these animals for the long term benefit of their species, and since there is no shortage of the bear or the cougar, they are hunted every year, you know, removal of those that are dangerous is perfectly sensible. Go ahead and ask yourself what to do about the Yellowstone bison, there are too many of them as well and they are going to get culled. If there are bison in those herds that are known to attack people, shouldn't they be first in line to be culled?

Have you ever been alone in Yellowstone and come up to a temporary sign saying that this area is closed due to dangerous bear activity? People are killed in Yellowstone by brown bears, although it is rare compared to the millions of visitors. The fact though is that if it is you, you aren't going to be super happy about it.

> cougars are more endangered than humans>I think that cougars are at the carrying capacity of the land in most areas and are hunted. So the idea that they should be protected is absurd. Regarding people, I bet you advocate bringing more people into the US even though it already has 330 million.

Cougars are pretty damn dangerous. If you were to get in a similar fight with a real big cat, there is no 2 inch blade that could save you. The Mountain Lion was protecting its kill and wasn't hungry, or it would have finished the job on the OP. Lucky that lion already had something to eat.
