If your insulation was perfect, it wouldn't matter.

We have a warm room that gets wonderfully toasty with an electric oil heater in the evenings, rarely do we use the central heating. We're quite happy this way.

Set the thermostat to the desired temperature, and let the boiler switch itself on and off.

A question of running the boiler continuously versus having it on a timer only makes sense if the heating is not needed for a period of time, otherwise the timer would be set to always on.

I did a calculation of how much I would save by replacing my "D" rated boiler and water cylinder with an A+ combi and it wouldn't pay for itself in the 20 year expected life of the equipment. So I still have the boiler and water cylinder.

It's simple physics, people



Author::::whatwasigoingtosay
DateTime::::2016-03-12T01:01:03Z
Or just think about basic physics. The lower the temperature inside the house the less heat loss there is. A timer means that for a lot of the time the temperature is lower than it would be if the heating was always on. The answer is clear.

That's a ridiculous comparison. How could a supermarket take money off people even if they didn't go. Whereas there are loads of examples of service providers taking monthly payments rather than "as you go". Phone companies, TV and internet providers. Hire car companies don't charge by the mile etc... Etc... Just think about it before posting

I work shifts- nights, earlies and lates. No central heating timer has been designed for this. So I just turn on the heating after I feel cold. After wearing a jumper. Then I turn it off when I feel warm enough.

Yes! I have a Code 4 house with very good insulation and have my heating on a thermostat at 19 degrees - it is warm all day but the radiators never feel warm. I've gone from paying £180pm for gas and electric in my old Victorian house to £40pm for each in this one. Amazing.

It might take a long time to claw back the money but we have a few practical considerations of the space the boiler, immersion tank and water tank in the loft take up, as well as it taking ages for our water to heat and other annoyances. We're planning a few renovations so makes sense to have the pipes where they need to be etc.

Our old (very old) gas central heating system broke in the middle of a snowy spell three or four years ago, but it broke ON, not off. This meant that the heating was on all the time, like it or not. I was obliged to leave it on all night else the place would be uninhabitable in the morning but turned the main control off during the day. Cost a ruddy fortune in gas and British Gas wouldn't come out to us for three weeks (as it turned out) because we did have heat and hot water. Lost patience after the second deferral and pulled forward the planned boiler replacement instead.

I second the above. Heat one (preferably small) room and live in that. The kitchen's good as it has the cooker in it, which helps. I recommend acquiring a pair of cheap Ugg type boots (they're fur lined and about a tenner from Sports Direct) and a pair of salopettes or similar - army surplus cold weather suits are good.

A Dehumidifier left on all day should remove unwelcoming mid-winter chilly moisture. Put heat on when you want to heat the air, in the room.

If you have proper ventilation, especially in kitchen and bathroom, it should be OK. Have you got a room with a south facing window? I'd make that my 'warm refuge' and not worry about the rest too much.

Yes this works really well, stick the cling film on with double sided tape and then tighten up by blowing a hairdryer over it. You use to be able to buy special packs to do this, but clingfilm works just as well.

The problem with this is chilblains, mould and condensation, at least in my home. I have the thermostat at 11 degrees at night, 12-13 degrees during the day to a max of 15 or 16 in the evening. Due to illness I'm home (and broke) almost all day and all night and it's a bit miserable in the winter. I'm totally fine with low temperatures and lots of jumpers and socks on, but winters are very long, damp and cheerless. I can never work out if it's best to do as I do, heat on very low but comes on a few times during the day so I get some warm air circulating or crank it up to something higher twice a day but not have the radiators coming on at all during the day.

If you really want to save money, turn the thermostat down to 14 degrees, and learn to live at that temperature. We all used to - unless you are sick or infirm or a small child you'll be fine.

Try temporary "double-glazing", basically just strong clingfilm that you can fit over windows in winter.... and thick curtains really help.

I recommend you for the best comprehensive explanation. With the exception of heated floor systems, well known for their long thermal inertia, setting the central heating thermostat to your preferred temperature as required is the best method to economise. We set the day temperature at 18°C and raise it to 19.5-20°C for a few hours in the evening, then reduce it to 16°C at night – we sleep with the window cracked open all winter and we live near the Canadian Rockies. Due to our home’s good insulation, the gas furnace only comes on a few times overnight.

What a brilliant question I have always wondered about this and it seems that the answer is not straight forward! I am going to use the suggestion of a week of each and see how much gas, electricity I use per week. The other question which might not be answered by doing this experiment it how ecologically friendly is each method, although perhaps it does!

Get a Nest. This will replace the timer and give you a warmer (as felt) whilst saving money.

I have central heating - I dont have a thermostat but my cerntral heating part of my boiler has a setting that goes from 1 - 6. I have experimented with keeping the rooms warm and found that 15 mins in the hour at setting 4 and running constantly at setting 1 both result in a similar level of heat (during occupied hours) the thing goes off when I go to bed. Which version would you advise as using less gas?

You say that the current boiler is 'newish'. I wonder how long it will take with any reduced fuel bills to get back the cost of the combi boiler and what is the expected life of it compared with your current boiler?You could try remembering your on/off routine better - good for the soul!

Fundamentally it always uses less energy to let your house cool off as much as possible, because the rate of cooling is proportional to the difference in temperature between inside and outside.

You're all ignoring the type of heating.. if you have something like underfloor then it would be better left on all the time as it takes ages to warm up from cold. With regular radiators that can create almost "instant" heat then a timer is probably better. Also as others have said it is dependent on the quality of your insulation. Bit unnecessary to have it on at night though unless you get up a lot..

It is ALWAYS, under all circumstances, in any building, cheaper to switch the heating off when it is not needed. Understanding the basic principles of thermodynamics is enough to show that this must be the case.

The best option I think is a timer that comes on and is temperature controlled. In our old house we could set it to never fall below 16 degrees but adapt it to 20 degrees between 5 and 7pm, 18 between 7 and 10pm etc.

I tend to find that it takes about an hour to heat up my house (mainly the air and the walls) to the required temperature. We're going on holiday for a couple of weeks so do not plan to leave the heating on all the time just so that it's ready for us when we get back. Having it on for an hour while we unpack should be sufficient.

I have found over many years in several different properties (both flats and houses) that it is generally cheaper to use the timer to have the central heating come on in bursts, spaced around the day.

"Why not try a week of each and see what your meter readings are?" That is a really good idea. There are too many variables that might affect the answer - trying it for yourself is probably the only way to find out. Sometimes I like to think of extremes as a thought experiment. For example : you are in your house only one day a year / you are in and out every 5 minutes. Clearly for the first it's going to be cheaper to have your heating off for most of the year / for the second it's illogical to turn it on and off every 5 minutes. Your daily routine is between the extremes but far enough away from either to make an experiment the only way of finding out.

Depending on the home, this can just invite problems with damp. I find I need to heat all the rooms and have a dehumidifier. But then do have a timer that also adjusts the thermostat to make up for it.
