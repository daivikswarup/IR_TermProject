Ask Alanis: my best friends now share my secrets with their spouses




DateTime::::2016-03-11T16:00:21+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span><strong>’ve got to that age when my best friends have become wives, fiancees and serious girlfriends, and suddenly my secrets are not so safe. My innermost thoughts and feelings are being shared with their partners, and it leaves me feeling vulnerable. I’ve been told that as someone who has never been in a serious relationship, it’s something I can’t understand. And something I can’t change. So do I just start keeping things to myself?</strong><br/>It can be challenging to adjust to having your one-on-one friendship shift to being part of a triangle. There is loss in this for you, to be sure.</p>

<p>I can, however, relate to your friends making this choice. In my life, my husband is primary, and our marriage has benefited from this prioritisation. I appreciate that, if there is an important piece of information I am processing about a friend, I can bring it to my husband to get his perspective. Similarly, there came a turning point where I knew I was no longer sharing what was going on with me with just my girlfriends; they would be bringing this information home to their spouses – which makes sense, if they also consider their partners their primary relationship.</p>

<p>The key to this working is that you don’t feel judged. Ideally, it is less that they are gossiping about you, and more that they care enough about you to want to discuss your wellbeing with each other. I have spent a lot of time with my friends’ partners, and I feel safe sharing vulnerabilities with my friends – because I know I am cared for and supported by both parties. Of course, if you feel judged by your friend’s partner, it may not continue to feel as safe to open up with your friend, and this could negatively affect your friendship. Perhaps try finding someone else to confide in, until you feel safer with your friend’s partner, if that is possible.</p>

<p>There may well be a day soon when your friends will understand that you discuss what they have shared with <em>your</em> partner, knowing (hopefully) that your partner loves them as much as you do. And that instead of getting the insight, empathy and support from only one of you, they get it double-barrel, from both of you. This is what it is to be friends with couples: ultimately, you get double the love.</p>

I would never share a friend's confidences with my wife without permission, and would think less of her if she shared a friend's confidence with me without permission.

But that doesn't address my point. What it boils down to is you saying, "Hey, they're going to blab but you won't know about it so it doesn't matter."

This is crazy. Close friends and partners may exist in different universes. If someone close to you tells you their secrets, then this is what they are - 'secrets', unless there is some major legal or ethical issue at stake. None of us is obliged to share absolutely everything with our partners or friends, even if we hold total honesty and transparency as theoretical ideals. I do in most areas of life.I would like to believe that trust and confidentiality hold some meaning. There are some secrets I will take to the grave, however juvenile they may seem in retrospect.This may sound hypocritical, but there is no valid reason for me to blab about who committed some youthful transgression or other regrettable indiscretion or whatever.

There is always an issue in keeping secrets from your spouse, even if they are not your secrets. If in the future the secret becomes known then your spouse feels somewhat sidelined in your relationship and if the secret has impact then you may get the blame.

I can see this is hard, but generally when I share things with my friends who are either, lovingly, married or in long term committed relationships then I make the assumption that I am sharing it with them and their life partner. Occasionally and I mean very occasionally I will say this is just for you I want your advice don't share it even if X. And then I have to hope that it is respected. Similarly I share everything with my best friend/flatmate of serval years standing and people generally know that telling me something is telling her it as well.

They may well not want to but we tell them anyway as it helps us process info while they nod or generally use the mutual spousal selective deafness mode

If you've never been in a serious relationship, I can't imagine your confidences are up to much anyway, gossip-wise.



Author::::JenBC

You can't trust married people, it's quite simple. They think their partner should know everything they know, as Alanis has illustrated in her answer. If you don't want the spouse to know something, then just don't tell.

I must be one of those terrible people who's betraying friends' confidences then. I can't think of one thing that I would 'keep a secret' from my husband. It would feel weird to have thoughts/concerns I was working through in my head that he was not party to - whether that be empathy for my friend, worries, or whatever.  'What are you thinking about?' 'I can't tell you, sorry'. Nope, I'm afraid that wouldn't happen in my marriage. And it is not to the detriment of my friends, it just is not about 'betraying a confidence'.  I see it exactly the same way if I told my friend something in private about me. I have to assume I am telling her and her husband, they come as a 'unit' these days... Although, to be honest, it's hardly likely to come up in reality, I'm not that interesting and he'd not be that interested!

What mad advice Alanis! Clearly there is a trust issue here - the poster's instincts are telling her something ain't quite right with this friendship 'group' dynamic and it sounds like it's more of a chance for the 'friends' to smugly 'discuss' this person and their problems to make themselves in their little group, feel better. Also schadenfreude springs to mind. Get better friends or practice the art of withholding information you consider private. It's really not compulsory to share everything with friends despite what American sitcoms would have us believe. Good luck.

This seems to be a polarising issue between those who share all with spouses and those who don't!

It's probably not healthy to talk about "primary" and secondary relationships.

That may work for some people but many of us need to talk things out in order to make sense of them and gain insight.

Why do people seem to want to share confidences anyhow? You should relish your problems as puzzles only you can solve.

Not worth taking things so seriously. Most people love a good bit of gossip so expect to have the juicy bits shared.

Unless these confidences actively concern their spouses/partners this is just gossiping at your expense. Any one who needs to "share" a friend's secrets in order to feel closer to a man is immature and I'd be more careful who I confide in.

I think you may have the wrong end of the stick Popeia. This article is not discussing husbands or wives telling their friends intimate details of their relationship. It is the other way around. That is friends going off and telling their spouses intimate details that their friends have told them to their husband or wife.

There's a comment on here from a man who blabbed a secret to his girlfriend which later came out, so I guess you're wrong.

@black belt andy, that is deliberate betrayal. And given your name maybe jealousy. Weakness and ugliness from the female. Suggest you get attitude and different friends with respect. and confront it as well... publicly, that it is obvious that he had told her and she has passed it on, share that you have triumphantly come good and am better than ever. (lie if needed) Would not have missed the experience for quids. And for dessert you might publicly pass on their secrets.

Agree completely. Over the years I've learned which close friends and family members are worthy confidents by whether their "hubbies" begin to give off "amusement" vibes after I've share sensitive information. I've also learned to keep sensitive information to myself. It's a rare friend who doesn't trade confidences.



Author::::janetto

I have not shared my best friends secrets with my spouse nor my sisters.I suggest get some new real friends. And establish their values in friendship first before sharing.Beyond that , maybe one can live very very well without sharing ones secrets with others. I have no problem with that. Very clear what can be said then judged, scrambled and shared with others.

Even after 28 years together, my wife and I don't share our friends intimate thoughts; we don't even share our kids or grandkids discussion.Generally if you preface something with - this is confidential, don't share. I'm sure that any reasonable friend wouldn't tell their spouse.Have a bit of confidence in your friends.

No. But it was a very minor, overarching subplot in series 43 of Friends.



Author::::Tgreah

No. Men never talk about anything with anybody, ever. Men just listen, hoping beyond hope it will, eventually, stop. Yes, it's only women. They do it so much men have to keep secrets to maintain cosmic harmony.

(Gently sobs.) But, but...but they're my bestest friends. BBFF. And now it's all changed. They've (wailing sounds commence) betrayed me! To boys! They've put boys before me. And anyway what is it with boys...anyway? Huh, boys. Smelly, smelly boys. If I can't massively overshare with my BBFF, indiscriminately and without nary a thought for the consequences, I might as well be an adult. (Sobbing subsides, and holding her cat our heroine gently drifts off into a dreamless sleep.)

I am lucky enough that most of my close friends' partners have become close friends in their own right however it is still my decision to confide in them or not. I would not be happy for everything I said to be shared in this way.
