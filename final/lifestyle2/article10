Can chocolate make you smarter? (And thinner? And healthier?)

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>f there’s one thing that people love more than chocolate, it’s science claiming that chocolate is good for you. The most recent is a study that found a link between eating chocolate and improved cognitive performance. However, given how much fat and sugar most chocolate also contains, are the reports of its benefits worth taking seriously?</p>

<p>This <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/04/the-magical-thing-eating-chocolate-does-to-your-brain/" title="">new study</a>, based on nearly 1,000 people from New York, is not the first to link chocolate to brain function, but what it actually tells us remains very vague. “It’s not possible to talk about causality, because that’s nearly impossible to prove with our design,” said one of the researchers, meaning that we can’t tell whether clever people like chocolate or chocolate makes you clever. Or indeed if there is something messier going on.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/24/chocolate-digestives-best-worst-taste-test-mcvities-supermarket-brands">Chocolate digestives: the best and worst – taste test</a> </p>

<p>Can this really be true? It was certainly widely reported last year, but in fact, the news <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/i-fooled-millions-into-thinking-chocolate-helps-weight-1707251800" title="">turned out to be a scam</a>, perpetrated by the science journalist John Bohannon to prove how susceptible the media is to pseudoscience. Bohannon did conduct a real trial with some people eating chocolate and some not, but he measured so many things about them that he knew some sort of fluke “effect” would probably show up. And what do you know? The chocolate-eaters happened to lose weight; the abstainers didn’t.</p>

<p>There are mountains of research papers claiming this to be true. Some, such as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22933736" title="">a 2012 analysis of 37,103 Swedish men</a>, look quite authoritative, showing that the rate of stroke among middle-aged and older men was 17% lower among those who ate a lot of chocolate, despite controlling for other factors. Still, the results weren’t statistically significant. And eating a lot of chocolate certainly is a good way to become unhealthily overweight – probably better to hold off the Dairy Milk for now.</p>

<p>Research from UC San Diego suggests that chocolate might act as a kind of performance-enhancing drug – until you look at the detail. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/how-chocolate-can-help-your-workout/?_r=0" title="">The 2011 study</a> is really about a compound called epicatechin, which is present in chocolate, and its effect on mice, who are not people. Epicatechin dramatically improved the endurance of the mice while they were running on a treadmill. Whether this would translate to humans isn’t known, but even if it did, you’d probably need such a tiny dose of epicatechin that it would be like eating half a square of chocolate. Any more and the effect might be reversed. It also has to be dark chocolate – epicatechin is destroyed by the process of making milk chocolate.</p>

Carob, maybe raw cacao for it's health and stimulant properties but your average bar of dairy milk laden with animal fats and processed sugars I very much doubt it.

That's just the tourist diet. You can fit small amounts of the above into a diet that includes lots of vegetables and walking up mountainsides. Potatoes count as vegetables, unless served in McDonalds fries.

The real question is - why are the Swiss so slim, when their diet apparently consists of white bread, potatoes, melted cheese, sausages, and chocolate, washed down with lashing of fizzy apple juice or beer?

i would like to agree with the article but it is necessary to identify that healthy chocolate depends on the concentration of cacao. the problem is most commercial chocolates have more milk and sugar and fats than cacao by itself. On the other hand dark chocolate contains higher concentration of cacao that is the reason it is rendered healthy .

Happy to read that this was successful for you too. At the end of each semester, I brought very fine chocolate to my students, as a gesture of gratitude for all the times they were so generous with their being "subjects," as well as a great group of intelligent and motivated individuals that made my years as an instructor so profound. Best to you, Orsi Nagy.

If chocolate makes you clever, I hereby claim the prize of the cleverest person in the UK, if not in Europe. (Wouldn't want to claim the world - there is bound to be someone in the US who manages to eat more chocolate than me.)

Some sellers report a High Street trend towards chocolate that is 100 percent cocoa. It goes against traditional chocolate that has vanilla and sugar blended in, together with milk if it is milk chocolate. Cadbury’s for decades used ads which showed a glass and a half of full cream dairy milk being poured into one of their chocolate bars. Their Dairy Milk has a minimum 26 percent cocoa, while Mars Galaxy has 25 percent. Even Cadbury’s Bournville, a dark chocolate, has 36 percent minimum cocoa. On the Continent, especially in Belgium, chocolate has traditionally featured higher cocoa percentages...

I like having a chocolate binge now and then. It puts me in a good mood and life's cares disappear- for a short while. Who cares whether it makes you thinner, healthy or smart.Just enjoy it. And it's irresistible living here in Zürich with a good choice of chocolate shops to choose from.

I always ate chocolate during the exam session, so it's nice to see that someone actually made a study that's backing this up. I also experimented with coffee and I once had a red bull (it doesn't give you wings, just shaky fingers to dial 911 with), but those never worked, whereas chocolate gave me energy and it also stopped my sweet cravings. And the best part is that I never got fat, maybe because I like the high cocoa content ones. It might be a placebo effect, but it does work for me, so I still eat chocolate whenever I'm working on something complex or when I'm having a rather dull day :) plus, it's delicious

The stuff referred to in the article, full of sugar and fat, is scarcely chocolate. Eat 99% (or if you must, 90% or even 85%, though they are too sweet for my taste) to get the chocolate hit without the health problems.

Although not a "true research experiment," when I was an instructor of Psychology, at three different universities, I often created an experiment-like environment, and had my three group construct that is required in order to collect data, within the parameters that constitute an experimental design, with my various hypothesis, that I measured results with my students. It was a great opportunity for doing research for my own gratification.

I agree with the last part of your comment that healthy people make "healthy choices" most of the time - i.e. everything in moderation ! :) Clearly this applies to chocolate too.

Yes, but it has to be 90% cocoa solids, artisanal designer chocolate that'll set you back £5.99 per 300g. You'll be lighter (in the wallet), fitter (you've sacrificed your bus fare, so you're walking home) and smarter (you won't get hoodwinked by these nonsense articles in the newspapers again).

Chocolate - so many types with so many different ingredients! Cocao apparently has many health benefits and I get that. Sugar clearly doesn't and most people accept that. Dairy milk???? The jury seems to be out on this, but for me it seems unhealthy and unnatural for people to digest the milk of another species. Most of the facts are our there on food, but people see and hear what they want to see and hear and healthy people tend to make healthy choices most of the time......

However, word of caution.....Kraft have messed about with the ingredients of its chocolate since taking over, to make it more acceptable to American market...so I suspect the initial benefits have gone!

In its origins, Chocolate was considered a health drink as an alternative to alcohol. The early manufacturers,mostly Quakers, knew of its beneficial effects on their workforce. Their product was a drink initially before it became a solid bar, and it was darker,closer to Bournville.
