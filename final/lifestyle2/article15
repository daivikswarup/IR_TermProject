Natural's not in it: just because a product calls itself 'natural' doesn't make it good




DateTime::::2016-03-08T15:00:26+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>’ve repeatedly come across the idea that natural means good among eco-friendly folks like myself. It has emerged in online forums, conversations with friends, and discussions at health food stores. It has also popped up regularly in the comments section of this column, where astute readers can often be found cautioning against making this assumption.</p>

<p>I happen to agree with them: the assumption that natural equals good is wrong. But it’s understandable that people would feel that way, isn’t it? Natural just sounds good; easy. Natural sounds like puppies and sunshine and fresh air. Natural! The way nature intended! Before meddlesome mankind stuck our big noses in and ruined everything, that is. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/01/cosmetics-database-safety-ingredients-website-health-and-beauty">Give your cosmetics a safety makeover by using this simple website</a> </p>

<p>The problem is twofold. First: “natural” doesn’t mean good – not entirely and not always. Second: “natural” sometimes doesn’t mean anything at all, at least not in the way it’s most commonly used – to imbue a product with a vaguely positive attribute in the hopes that consumers will buy it. </p>

<p>Beginning with the first point, as we learned from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/10/vaginal-detox-pearls-lysol-douche-feminine-hygiene">vaginal detox pearls</a>, natural does not necessarily equate to beneficial, effective or even safe. In fact, here are some natural things which are also actually quite terrible: death, disease, beets, cute little zebra babies being eaten by lions, poisonous plants, mosquitoes, hurricanes.</p>

<p>All of these things fit the dictionary definition of the word natural (“existing in or caused by nature; not made or caused by humankind”) yet none of them are really all that appealing as they relate to humankind. Beets stain everything and taste like dirt; sunburns ruin vacations; the seeds of the castor oil plant have the distinction of being the Guinness Book of World Records holder for world’s most poisonous plant, yet its charming purple flowers litter gardens around the world.</p>

<p>It is therefore not enough to see “natural” and read “good for me” in its place. It’s no secret that I’m a fan of natural treatments and beauty remedies and homemade cleaning products, but in order for them to be useful, they have to do more than simply have “natural” as their main attribute. There’s no sense in having a natural cleaner that doesn’t clean, or a natural remedy that only makes you sicker. In these cases, natural isn’t doing you any favours.</p>

<p>The reverse isn’t necessarily true either. I’m reminded of this daily: without the dose of 11 decidedly unnatural pills I take twice a day, my chronic kidney condition would make it impossible for me to write this column. My daughter was born when surgeons strapped me to a table, cut an incision into my lower abdomen and then reached in and pulled her out – it really doesn’t get much more unnatural than that. But if it had been left up to nature, my full placenta previa would have meant that one of us would have died during labour. </p>

<p>So, on to point two. In the US, at the time of this writing, the US Department of Agriculture does not restrict the use of the word “natural” to describe food or beverage products unless there are added colours, synthetic substances, or flavours.</p>

<p>In other words, meat can be labelled natural while still containing growth hormones, and a fruit drink could be labelled natural while being full of high-fructose corn syrup, as long as it didn’t also contain red dye #40.</p>

<p>The FDA doesn’t do much better when limiting the use of the word on cosmetics and personal care products. According to its <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ResourcesForYou/Industry/ucm388736.htm#7">website</a>, the FDA “has not defined the term ‘natural’ and has not established a regulatory definition for this term in cosmetic labeling”. </p>

<p>The UK takes a more detailed approach toward labelling food as natural, with the Food Standards Agency <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/markcritguidance.pdf">stating</a> “natural” means essentially that the product is composed of natural ingredients, eg ingredients produced by nature, not the work of humans or interfered with by us. It later expands on that thought to add that using the term “natural” without qualification is only permitted “to describe single foods, of a traditional nature, to which nothing has been added and which have been subjected only to such processing as to render them suitable for human consumption”.</p>

<p>Of course, not all of us are crooks and liars. Products bearing the “natural” designation may truthfully denote ingredients produced by nature and minimally processed, but as of right now, no government body makes them prove it. </p>

<p>So what does all of this mean for all of us? </p>

<p>Our task, after first limiting our consumption, is to become more educated about what we do consume. This means asking why a product is good for us if it claims to be; not being fooled by fluffy terms used by corporations to suggest health benefits and learning about the ingredients that go into the products we use on our skin and in our homes. </p>

<p>Don’t assume that natural equals good. Actually, don’t <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svkgOsr7pUc">assume</a>, period. Ask questions, research, learn, and if you’re not happy with what you find out, work to change your products, your consumer behaviour, or both. </p>

<p>And then come back, so we can yell at each other in the comments.</p>

I didn't think people thought it was safe - but it isn't as processed as the more usual brands. Inhaling or imbibing tobacco is not good for you but neither are smoked foods in any quantity. And tobacco leaf is a plant and dried. So it's pretty natural, even if you grow it yourself and smoke it. Cannabis isn't good for you if you smoke it either.

"natural" is a theological concept, in scientific terms everything exists or can/could occurs is natural. So, it is a useless classification (unless you want to fight a ideological battle).

Agree, it's frustrating when people are clearly TRYING to make positive change, but getting stymied by sneaky labelling. Brings to mind the salads they used to (maybe still do?) have at McDonald's, which had more total calories and grams of fat than the big macs did :(

Food labeling needs to be completely redone because as it exists in the U.S., it is not helpful to the consumer. The front package will say "no added sugar" but the side label of ingredients will include "high fructose syrup" and all other types of sugars.

Around us there is not much in local plants, herbs, seeds that can be used. I've used supplements for a long time. The problem is when the vitamin companies don't comply with the ingredients they claim is in the bottles they sell. We have a right to have them accountable for what they sell to us.

The trouble with depending on context for the elimination of ambiguity is that not everyone is aware of the context in which a word is used (and quoted after the event). This is why I think it's a good idea to avoid using a word with allegedly different meanings in different contexts. You may be quite clear in your own mind what you mean by "naturally" every time you use the word, but not everyone is, and the ambiguity is often deliberately exploited.



Author::::TheCheeseWrangler
DateTime::::2016-03-09T19:44:18Z
Context.



Author::::Quackersyard
DateTime::::2016-03-09T18:53:33Z
And we already have a way of distinguishing between man-made and not man-made: we call things that occur naturally "natural". Almost everyone does it so that is what the word means, your opinion notwithstanding.

Some time ago. But then...this is not the context you said it was. However, it seems to me that our argument is about the use of the word "natural" to mean non-anthropoogenic. I can't see the point of using "natural" in that sense, since other, non-ambiguous, ways of conferring the same idea are available. You, on the other hand, are okay about it. Fair summary?

Where did I change definitions? And of course there is a context beyond that. That's why I think it's generally a bad idea to use the word "natural". In far too many contexts it is ambiguous. All you need is a way to distinguish manmade from non-manmade, since that is actually what the article is about. Non-anthropogenic?

I would not use the word "natural" to mean non-manmade, since that contradicts the fact that it is perfectly natural for mankind to make things, as it is for bees, birds, and beavers.

Of course! I'm a huge proponent of using a "natural" approach first (I still struggle to find a different way to refer to it without using this word!) before trying conventional/commercially produced/potentially harmful-chemical based products. there are alternatives, and many of them are fantastic.

Which words have I misused? Within the context of this article there is a distinction between "natural" (as in "occurring in nature as is") and "manufactured". Heroin is manufactured, this is a fact. It does not occur in nature, this is a fact. The examples you gave are not products of human endeavour and are, for the purposes if this discussion, natural.

If you want to launch into a philosophical discussion operating outside the fairly closely defined terms used in the article I was discussing then I already got that. However, in doing what you've done you are just erecting a straw man: you understand the terms as used by the discussion so far and have manipulated them in order to score a cheap point. Bye.

But by that argument there is nothing that humans do that cannot be classed as "natural".



Author::::TheCheeseWrangler
DateTime::::2016-03-09T14:52:09Z
But by that argument there is nothing that humans do that cannot be classed as "natural". Are you comfortable with the idea that, say, polypropylene and polyethylene are natural products, using your logic, because it they made from a natural resource? That methamphetamine is a "natural high" because one of it's base ingredients is refined from a plant? Fatuous non-argument.

But the ingredients in the soap aren't 'produced by nature' - they're the work of humans.



Author::::Quackersyard
DateTime::::2016-03-09T14:49:29Z
I don't think so. Nature is everything there is, unless you're religious. So it is also, unavoidably, the destination, the journey, the environment, and the traveller.



Author::::Quackersyard
DateTime::::2016-03-09T14:45:23Z
You can of course empty a word of meaning like that, but it's not very helpful, because it just means you have to invent a word (say, 'splurgeous') for 'existing in nature and not made, or modified, by humans'. It is easier just to say 'natural'.



Author::::Quackersyard
DateTime::::2016-03-09T14:43:24Z
It is not a natural product because it is manufactured.
