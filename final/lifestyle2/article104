<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>e came up with this for Mother’s Day, in honour of mums everywhere. It’s a twist on the classic <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_75_(cocktail)">French 75</a>, only blue (like valium), and we’ve called it Mother’s Little Helper. Serves one.</p>

<p><strong>20ml gin (we use </strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thelondon1.com"><strong>The London No 1</strong></a><strong>)</strong><br/><strong>5ml blue curaçao</strong><br/><strong>10ml lemon juice</strong><br/><strong>10ml sugar cane syrup (made the usual way, by dissolving 2 parts sugar cane in 1 part water)</strong><br/><strong>80ml champagne </strong></p>

<p>Put everything bar the champagne in a shaker, add ice and shake. Strain into a flute, top with champagne and garnish with an edible flower.</p>

Amazing recipe, I will love to prepare it for my mother and enjoy this with her on mothers day.I am planning to surprise her with a party and calling her old friends to it. Planning surprise party is no easy task but at least I am not worried about the drinks and bartenders as I have hired them from http://coupleofbartenders.com/.Just hoping she likes the gift and enjoy the evening..:)

Don't have any blue curaçao (oh the shame!) so might replace that with my precious Limited Edition Blood Orange Cointreau.

When is the earliest you are allowed to drink them? Is 11am too early? (Because if she starts on about when she is going to get grandchildren and have I seen Felicity lately and look at all the cards everyone else sent and I suppose the flowers I brought might perk up with a bit of water and...)
