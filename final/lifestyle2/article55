My partner lives in my home - but what is fair financially?




DateTime::::2016-03-06T06:00:26+0000



<p><strong>The dilemma </strong>I have been dating a wonderful man for a year and a half. Our kids are grown and we have both had previous marriages. My father passed away last March and in his will he left me his home in another part of the country. I decided to move there. The thing is, the house is more than 30 years old and needs a lot of work. So far I’ve paid a large amount in renovations and there is still a lot to do. The house will remain in my name, and I will leave it for my children. So it’s one thing to split bills but, as he is now living with me, and I’m paying for updating the house, should he help with the renovation costs? I can’t figure out what is fair here.</p>

<p><strong>Mariella replies</strong> What’s fair in life is a loaded question. They say money makes the world go round, but its mere mention can also draw the carousel of love to an abrupt halt. There’s nothing more mundane and conversely more taboo than money. Most of us would be happier to share bodily fluids with another human than be transparent about our earnings to them. Just look at the jitters being caused by the imminent disclosure of how company salaries differ between the sexes. It’s taken four and a half decades of injustice, such is the veil drawn over finance, to precipitate this revolutionary reveal. Yet the naming and shaming of those who fail to live up to the Equal Pay Act has plenty to offer both sexes. Find me one dad who doesn’t believe his daughter should earn the same as the dreary bloke on the desk opposite.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if the money market isn’t a great conspiracy. The same could be said of cash, which if you break it down is really just an elevated form of barter. The accrual of hard currency is often as dependent on luck and timing as it is on skill – oligarchs, drug barons, tax dodgers, career criminals and celebrities all offering perfect evidence that wealth creation is seldom something to be particularly proud of.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Most of us would be happier to share bodily fluids with another human than be transparent about our earnings</p>

<p>I’ve certainly met far more poverty-stricken geniuses than I’ve encountered impressive millionaires in my lifetime. Poverty is crippling and lack of money reduces our opportunities and makes the path through life seem much harder to progress smoothly along. Too much money seems to have a similarly reductive effect on those not compelled to make a living, and in-between are the billions of us who fret, obsess and just about manage to keep afloat by working hard, counting the pennies and not letting anyone take our hard living for granted.</p>

<p>You and your partner are lucky you have so little on the financial front to prompt discord between you. Solvent and mature, both sets of children gone and a fully paid-off roof over your heads leaves only who does the dishes and other minor domestic dilemmas to quarrel over. You may feel you’ve got a tricky dilemma but ultimately it’s about maintaining a sense of equality between you, and that makes it easier to resolve.</p>

<p>The obvious thing to ascertain is what the law has to say on the subject, as ultimately that’s where the greatest problem might arise. If you’re together long enough there may well be grounds for your partner to be entitled to a share of your estate, so before you turn the discussion into an emotional one, get the facts right on where you stand. So long as you’re investing in a home, which remains yours alone, and his tenure doesn’t come with rights attached to it, it seems perfectly fair for it to be your investment responsibility. The fact that he’s undertaking some of the work with no expectation of recompense suggests he’s a good guy with a sense of gratitude to you for the home comforts you’re providing.</p>

<p>It would also be a good idea to ponder on why it’s an issue for you. Does this desire to have him contribute more mask a general sense of dissatisfaction with his investment in the relationship? If so that’s an area you’ll need to give further thought to. Often money is a convenient stick with which to beat someone for altogether different reasons.</p>

<p>Having grown up in poverty I know all too well the pit-of-the-stomach sickness that can be inspired by fear of return to penury and also the unattractive but hard-to-cure habit of chasing mammon instead of less mercenary pleasures. Aren’t you lucky to have a roof over your head that’s guaranteed for your lifetime and can extend into your children’s? And isn’t it typically human that here you are wanting more? Ultimately, good fortune to share with someone you love is to be cherished rather than resented. As the saying goes, we can’t take it with us. My advice would be to check the fine print and then enjoy your blessings and the benefits they bring to those around you.</p>

If the property isn't theirs why should they pay towards improving its value?

This happened to me. My father and mother split up in old age. They settled their financial affairs. He went on to buy a house and his lady friend moved in with him. She how has the house since he has died nearly 20 years later.

It's not just "in this country" - every building if not maintained properly will have damage from water, weather, earth movement, insects, animals or "fur, wurr and turr".

Legally this isn't right. Even if the house is in her name then his paying for renovations can (but would not necessarily) entitle him to a share through the operation of equitable trusts. Mariella was at least partly right - she should get legal advice.

No, the house is in your name and neither your partner nor his family will benefit from the any equity accruing from the property. Unless you become joint owners it would not be reasonable to expect any support apart from daily living costs such as food, bills etc.

When I got married my husband and I had joint accounts and when we eventually bought a house it was in both our names. All our working lives I earned and he stayed at home and looked after the children, house and garden. He worked as hard as I did, so I never paused to consider whether it was fair financially. Sadly, he died, but we were very happy for 28 years.

Well again - as I said - this has not been my personal experience.

Again. You need to go out and meet better women. Perhaps you've conditioned yourself to only meet certain types. Hence the bias. I've no stats to back up my view either, only empirical. However, I do know that most women I know are honourable and pay their fair share. So, there's that.



Author::::Kevinpond
DateTime::::2016-03-08T00:36:56Z
Yes - I'm in favour of equality, but equality means equality. You can't have it both ways.



Author::::Kevinpond
DateTime::::2016-03-08T00:33:34Z
Actually, empirically, it's very much not my experience - it does seems to be however a pretty common attitude out there.

this maybe a chance - prior prenups tend to hold up here as long as kids arent involved. But why would he put money into an asset that she is going to bequeath to her children ... this could get ugly if not resolved before hand



Author::::ajs1988

I think the fairest and simplest way is for the partner to rent a room in the house as if they were a lodger. That room is then their own space within their partners home which they get to use as they like and the rental income is their partners to use as they like.

I think Mariella should be advising that she should speak to a solicitor immediately on advice under the law for cohabitees - TOLATA provisions apply - its not just what happens on death but also during the relationship if they separate.

Really bad idea. They get into debt and their creditors own your house.



Author::::jazzyfish
DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:19:21Z
or maybe give him a lifetime tenancy in your will - a not uncommon inclusion in a will these days so he will not face homelessness on your death. And it is an outright statement to him that the house is to remain yours and your children's



Author::::snark1
DateTime::::2016-03-07T14:27:44Z
This is essentially a legal/financial question. Wills and real property. No point worrying about what is "fair" until you have, as Mariella finally gets round to saying, checked the fine print. Then, when you know what everybody's financial rights are in law, start talking about how to achieve fairness.

For me the crux is if he starts to contribute financially to the renovation he may be able to claim some right to the value of the property. A fair arrangement(if you want to retain 100% ownership) would be to share the running costs such utility bills and council tax while costs that increase the value of the property remain your responsibility.

This seems to be more about your fear and resentment of women, it also seems to have been written in the 1960s.

This is an easy one. If the house is to remain in your name, and be inherited by your kids, then you pay for the renovations.



Author::::pavanne

It just says they "split bills" which sounds like food, power, water. Fair enough, he's not totally sponging. The big thing missing there is 'rent', which is real money - if he didn't live with the OP he would either have to pay rent or maintain his own place (if he owns his own place now, he could rent it out). I'm not suggesting the OP gouge him, but a regular rentlike contribution seems like the best solution. 



Author::::bubblingbeeble

It says he's paying bills, but that isn't the same as paying rent; it doesn't say that she's expecting him to pay towards renovations, however, it may something that he's suggested and she doesn't feel it's fair either - we've no idea what has prompted the matter.If he were paying some rent then I wouldn't expect him to pay towards renovations - she has some income to pay towards that.That also then resolves a little bit the issues of his status, if he's paying rent, he's paying rent and that determines his rights of living there - but some paperwork to cover everything always makes sense.



Author::::PanchoVillaLives

This guy has no security whatever - so why expect him to pay for renovation work? Certainly, split utility bills, but an more and you'll have to ask which way the relationship is heading.

Author::::sharpydufc

if he isn't inheriting and has no legal claim to it, then no he should not pay for the renovation costs. just don't be a dick about it.

It doesn't say anywhere in her statement that he doesn't pay any bills and is free-loading. She specifically says that repairing and doing up the old house costs money, but she expects him to chip into an asset that he will never own or get any financial recompense back from.

Conversely, he is living there rent free, whilst she pays the upkeep for the house - therefore she is supporting his free-loading.



Author::::franhunny
DateTime::::2016-03-07T05:27:01Z
But the rental system in the UK is not fair, it is biased towards the landlord. You have next to no claims as a tenant - and if you dare claim the few you have, it is easy and legal for your landlord to end the contract with a two weeks notice. Not so here!

This is over-generalising. I know plenty of professional ladies who contribute at least half.

Ok I usually avoid confrontations on internet forums but I have to comment here. I have relatives in the USA and have to say something in defense here. You're comment sounded a tad snobbish. There are many reasons for the style of housing or say one is better than another. Unfortunately a lot of forums there seems to be this "attack Americans or all things American" theme so it goes:

What happens if the woman dies? Does the guy lose tenancy if the kids(who gain a house in their mother's will) kick him out even if he has contributed time and/or money towards the renovations?



Author::::viper217
DateTime::::2016-03-07T03:58:05Z
I really think that it is very tawdry that you expect your partner to work on and chip in cash to renovate a house that you retain sole rites to. In effect by doing so you are saying to your partner you are good enough to be a DIY skivvy and pay to do up my house, but just remember its mine and not yours and never will be.

This brings to mind a double standard that not many feminists attack. When a man owns and earns more than a woman, it is just expected that, at very least, he share - 50/50. And I say - at very least - because it is often expected of a man that he shares all and pays all. 



Author::::pearcesleftfoot
DateTime::::2016-03-07T02:53:22Z
The reverse is true also. In that instance why should he pay for the renovations of a house he has no stake in?



Author::::pearcesleftfoot
DateTime::::2016-03-07T02:48:25Z
In my last relationship, which lasted 8 years, we both put what we earned into a shared account and treated it as 'our' money. I happened to earn significantly more than my partner but I recognised that being in a relationship was far more than a financial agreement.

The short version didn't mention that he was contributing to the work. How much? I would say if the work was something like painting which he will enjoy and won't last forever then he should pay half. If it a new kitchen then maybe not if he does a lot of the work.



Author::::maxsolo
DateTime::::2016-03-07T02:09:57Z
regardless ... after 24 months he can possible claim half ... or have an amicable financial arrangement drawn up in the event you split up or whoever dies first. If he contributes to the renovation he can rightly assume he is entitles to as share of the capital improvement in the least.

Don't move to Australia if this worries you. Move in together for 24 months and the house is half his. "De facto" marriage is viewed as marriage under the law. Funnily enough, this is true for same sex couples (who can't marry) too.
