My pet snake: ‘It says I’m not a judgmental person’




DateTime::::2016-02-28T06:00:14+0000



<p>“My snake says I’m not a judgemental person. As a pet, pythons are quiet – a contrast to my two kids.”</p>

<p>A python called Thor. Somehow I imagined it to be… well, to be bigger. Still, Peter looks happy with Thor, which is good to see. I like a man who’s relaxed about the size of his snake. Peter’s python might be petite, but it’s all his. Fnarr.</p>

<p>Sorry. Couldn’t resist. Jokes about snakes are impossible to avoid, so best to imagine a fnarr at the end of every paragraph. Anyway. Thor is Peter’s new pet, and he’s a good choice. Snakes make great pets, as long as you have a big tank with a tight lid for them to live in, and as long as you give them enough places in that tank to hide. Thor is a ball python and they get stressed if they don’t have a small, dark space to tuck themselves into…</p>

<p>Only a certain type of person wants a snake as a pet. Someone who’s not bothered about cuteness, who doesn’t like noise, who doesn’t want the trouble of regular walkies, or of serving up a lot of meals. Someone who operates outside our everyday social norms of tamed fluffy-wuffiness. Pythons are low maintenance, high impact pets. You get a lot of bang for your buck, with a python…</p>

<p>I wonder how Peter and Thor’s relationship will change as Thor grows. The maximum length that a ball python grows to is around 6ft (though males usually peak at 4ft). Peter doesn’t look like a man who scares easily, so I’m not worried about that. It’s more the weight of Thor when he’s fully grown. Peter seems fit, but he might have to do special workouts to keep doing that trick of wrapping his impressively lengthy snake all the way around his neck…Yes. Yes, I know. Sorry about that.</p>

Defrosting mice is easy. You just put them in a mug in the fridge and wait twelve hours. (Pets at Home even sell them in little individual packets so you don't have to handle them if you're squeamish.)

Well, I'm certainly not lacking in self esteem and I'm way too lazy to be a control freak. I got my corn snake because I was interested in snakes. Eighteen years later he's still doing very nicely, not a day of illness or obvious stress.

The question as to whether or not a snake should be a pet is a moot one. All our domestic pets were, at one time in the past, wild animals. Like dogs and cats, many snakes are the result of a long line of captive breeding and domestication. In parts of the world where snakes are common, it is quite usual for a constricting-type snake to be kept around the house in order to keep down the rodent population.

Wild animals/snakes/reptiles are simply not pets!Fact: This begs the question, “says whom?” As previously mentioned, many herp (reptile and amphibian) species have long been widely bred in captivity for many generations, often selectively for hundreds of different colors and/or patterns. While there can be some valid debate on the level of “domestication” in which many species have undergone through selective breeding and propagation, captive bred reptiles & amphibians in general are not “wild” animals in the sense that many are no longer wild caught or otherwise directly removed from the wild, and clearly undergo some form of human intervention through breeding. Domestication also does not completely eliminate natural drives or behaviors from animals undergoing the process that may be a negative consequence of poor or irresponsible care and negligence, be it a dog, a snake, or horses, for example. The American Pet Products Association (APPA) estimates there to be at least 4.9 million households with reptiles, and at the very least 9.3 million reptiles owned in the U.S., which is based on respondent data alone. Therefore, these animals most certainly are pets.

Like keeping dogs and cats? When it comes to the ownership of pet snakes and other reptiles, the vast majority of the species in question are now widely and regularly bred in captivity for numerous generations, oftentimes in particular color and/or pattern variations known as “morphs”. These morphs and captive born counterparts simply lack the necessary characteristics for survival in the wild. Simply put, all animals kept as a pet or for any other purpose in captivity originated, at one point or another, from “wild” counterparts.

Sorry, but your reply is simply incorrect. Firstly: The statement "Children are not quiet", is not a statement of fact but an assumption.Secondly: "Che Guevara was a sociopath enjoying the sound of execution by his firing squad before he had breakfast" is a statement of fact, an obvious moral valuation and judgmental.

'Measuring you'....I don't want to repeat what Larry said, but it's so true. Snakes don't need to measure prey to know if it can eat it or out. Do you see snakes 'measuring' there prey in the wild? Just to make sure it'll fit? Like crocs? No, you don't. Because they don't 'measure' there prey. If the women feed the snake right, the snake would have no reason to even think about eating the women.

A statement of fact (children are not quiet) is free of moral valuation and cannot therefore be judgemental. An acceptance without disgust or other negative valuation of that which other people find disgusting or fear inducing is evidence of non-judgementalism. Does that help?

Cases of ball pythons eating human beings (of any age) currently running at a huge zero. This is almost certainly a captive bred snake that never seen the outside of a house let alone an African plain. Its survival prospects in Africa also zero. But thanks for playing.

Control freaks or people lacking self-esteem? So, pretty much everybody then?

My pet snake says I’m not a judgmental person either, what a coincidence, two talking snakes.

Exotic animals are bought and owned by control freaks or those lacking in self-esteem. A very sweeping statement but that's been my experience of said owners.

Wild animals need to live in the wild. Animals that are forced to live in unnatural environments suffer from mental illness. The people that insist on keeping these animals against their will also suffer from mental illness. They have tried to form relationships with other humans but it hasn't worked out for them. Those pesky humans will insist on having minds and opinions of their own that can't be ignored. These people will tell you that it's OK because they are "rescue animals" but the truth is they were "rescued" from some other idiot like them. Keeping wild animals in inappropriate conditions is cruelty, simple as.

What a load of tosh, snakes do not behave this way at all. I'm not sure that going and having a lie down next to your prey would be a sound hunting tactic. A snake knows if it can eat something, no need to measure.

You sound like an ideal owner of a python. Unfortunately, a lot of owners in the Florida area (of America) are not like you. They like the python when it's small and manageable but dump it when it matures. Now there's an ecological crisis because pythons are taking over the Everglades. They aren't much of a threat to humans, of course. Just to virtually every other species.

My sister has a pet ball python. Called Monty of course. He's about three foot long and won't grow further, so he's only really a danger to pet chinchillas. But he's a lot of trouble (fancy defrosting mice, anyone?) and while he's very pretty I can't see the point. For about ten minutes, maybe, but Monty is fifteen years old and has plenty more to go. I think your pet snake might say a lot of things: that you really like snakes, maybe, or hate dog hair. I am not sure it can say anything much more fundamental...

I guess it might be more of an issue when it escapes and eats his children! it should be in Africa.

I don't get it. Why does owning a baby snake indicate one isn't a judgemental person? And in the second opening sentence, the snake owner appears to be making a judgmental statement about his own children.

I had a friend, a woman, who's about 5'3". She had a pet python that she was very enthusiastic about. It had freedom of her apartment. She would lie on her bed and the python would stretch out alongside her. She mentioned this happening several times to a vet. He strongly advised her to give the snake to to a zoo. When she asked why the vet replied the snake is measuring you .......
