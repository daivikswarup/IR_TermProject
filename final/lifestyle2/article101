One shoulder of roast lamb, four recipe ideas

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>amb shoulder – the poorer, less desirable cousin of the leg – has a reputation for being tricky to cook and laborious. In fact, the shoulder has to be one the most forgiving and versatile meats – and by far the most delicious.</p>

<p>To make the most of its amazing qualities, marinate the lamb for a few hours and then slow-cook the meat. Over time, the layers of fat reduce to sticky, unctuous, lip-smacking perfection and help keep the meat moist, so it’s great to reinvent the next day and beyond ...</p>

<p>North African-style spicing works so well with lamb. I do this in an oven and on a barbecue too – both work incredibly well and both benefit from a good long marinade – preferably overnight.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/27/charred-leek-recipes-batch-cooking-get-ahead-olia-hercules">One batch of charred leeks, four recipe ideas | Get ahead</a> </p>

<p><strong>Serves 6-7</strong><br/>1 lamb shoulder (about 3kg), bone in, fat side scored with a very sharp knife<br/>50ml olive oil<br/>3 tbsp smoked paprika<br/>4 tbsp coriander seeds, crushed<br/>2 tbsp ground cumin<br/>8 garlic cloves, roughly chopped<br/>50ml red wine vinegar<br/>Salt and black pepper</p>

<p><strong> For the dressing</strong><br/>100ml buttermilk<br/>20ml white wine vinegar<br/>½ bunch fresh coriander, chopped</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Lay out a large double layer of foil and put the lamb on top. Pour the oil over the meat, then rub in plenty of seasoning, the paprika, coriander, cumin and garlic. Then drizzle with vinegar. Massage the spices into the meat. Wrap up the foil to completely cover, then put into the fridge for at least 5 hours, or overnight.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Roast the lamb on an oven tray for 2 hours with the foil on. Remove the foil, baste the meat with juices and cook for 1 hour longer to caramelise. Check the meat – you should be able to easily pull the flesh away from the bone. If it is still firm, turn the temperature down to 150C/300F/gas mark 2 and cook for a further 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Meanwhile, whisk together all the dressing ingredients. Season to taste.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Remove the bone, then serve the shoulder whole at the table for people to help themselves, with the dressing.</p>

<p>Pasanda is such a comforting curry and appeals to all palates – rich, delicious and exotic, but also very mild and accessible. If you can manage to organise an overnight marinade then great, otherwise a couple of hours or so will suffice.</p>

<p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br/>350g slow-cooked lamb shoulder, cut into thin slices<br/>2 onions, finely sliced<br/>6 green cardamom pods, crushed<br/>4 whole cloves<br/>½ small bunch coriander, roughly chopped<br/>Olive oil, for cooking</p>

<p><strong>For the marinade</strong><br/>200g yoghurt<br/>1 tsp chilli powder<br/>2 tsp ground coriander<br/>1 tsp ground cumin<br/>½ tsp turmeric<br/>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br/>2 tsp ginger, grated <br/>60g onion, chopped <br/>1 tbsp tamarind concentrate<br/>Salt and black pepper <br/>Lemon juice, to taste</p>

<p><strong> For the dal</strong><br/>200g chana dal (dried yellow split peas), rinsed until the water runs clear<br/>2 shallots, finely sliced<br/>2 green chillies, finely chopped<br/>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br/>2 tsp cumin seeds<br/>1 tsp turmeric<br/>1 tsp garam masala<br/>Lemon juice, to taste</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Combine the marinade ingredients, then cover the lamb with the mix and set aside for at least 2 hours.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Bring the lentils to the boil then cook until they have started to collapse – around 30-45 minutes. Meanwhile, gently fry the shallots, chilli, garlic and cumin in a little oil for 10 minutes, or until the shallots have caramelised.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> When the lentils are soft, add the shallot mix, turmeric and garam masala along with some seasoning and lemon juice. Reserve and keep warm.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> To make the curry, fry the onions, cardamom and cloves in oil over a medium heat until nicely caramelised. Layer in the lamb, cover with about 200ml water and season well. Bring to the boil, then turn to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced to a rich, sauce-like consistency. Turn off the heat and season to taste.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Sprinkle with coriander, serve with the dal, some yoghurt and fresh roti.</p>

<p>It’s a myth that only pork can be pulled ... The pickled vegetables here are zingy and delicious – the perfect foil to the rich, fatty lamb.</p>

<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br/>250g slow-cooked lamb shoulder, fat and skin included<br/>1 small red chilli, finely chopped<br/>1 garlic clove, finely chopped<br/>A handful of fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped<br/>Olive oil, for cooking<br/>Salt and black pepper</p>

<p><strong>For the pickles</strong><br/>750ml white wine vinegar<br/>½ tsp fennel seeds<br/>10 peppercorns<br/>1 star anise<br/>250g caster sugar<br/>1 small head of fennel, very finely sliced<br/>½ small green cabbage, core removed, very finely sliced</p>

<p><strong>To serve</strong><br/>4 flatbreads, warmed <br/>Plain yoghurt<br/>Harissa</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> First, make the pickles. Put the vinegar, spices and sugar in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Cook for 5 minutes and turn off the heat. Pour the liquor over the fennel and cabbage, then cover and set aside for at least 2 hours. They’ll keep for up to two weeks, covered and refrigerated.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Shred the lamb meat, fat and skin into a bowl, then season with salt and pepper. Add the chilli, garlic, coriander and a glug of olive oil.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Warm some oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Fry the lamb for a few minutes, turning as you go, until it has started to caramelise and is nice and hot.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Serve on warm flatbreads with a smear of thick natural yoghurt and a spoonful of harissa paste.</p>

<p>Spezzatino is essentially a rich-tomatoey meat casserole, usually made with pork. I think lamb works beautifully in it and I serve it tossed through with some delicious, light, pan-fried potato gnocchi. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br/>Olive oil<br/>400g cooked lamb shoulder, cut into rough chunks<br/>1 tbsp plain flour<br/>1 onion, peeled and diced<br/>1 large carrot, diced<br/>2 celery stalks, diced<br/>3 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped<br/>250ml red wine<br/>500ml fresh lamb or chicken stock<br/>1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes<br/>3 sprigs rosemary<br/>250g gnocchi<br/>Salt and black pepper</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Heat a glug of oil in a frying pan or casserole dish over a medium heat. Add the lamb chunks, then fry for 3 minutes to brown all over. Stir in the flour and cook for a further 1 minute to lightly brown.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Add the vegetables and garlic, then brown for 3 minutes. Pour in the red wine and scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Reduce the wine until almost evaporated. Add the stock, chopped tomatoes and rosemary and bring everything back to the boil before turning down to a simmer.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Cook for around 1 hour, skimming off any impurities that rise to the surface with a ladle as you go. The tomatoey sauce should have reduced to a rich, thick, gravy-like consistency. If it’s too thin, cook for 20 minutes longer.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Just before the casserole is ready, stir through the gnocchi and simmer for 3 minutes. Season to taste, then serve immediately.</p>

Is this meant to be cooked with the skin on or removed?

I throw one in the oven on a Sunday morning before me and my wife go for our morning swim - she does like to get at least one length in before lunch!

I agree. The thing about lamb studded with anchovies is that they enhance the flavour of the lamb without imposing their own often distinctive taste. It's alchemy. I score holes in the skin and and fill it with an anchovy fillet. You only need a few, as if you were doing the same with garlic.

Sorry, that's what I meant! (Should have added a hyphen, maybe.) The bone helps to conduct the heat, or so I've always believed. Result, a sumptuously falling-apart lamb shoulder. Impossible to carve tidily -- but who wants to do that, when untidy chunks of the thing are what everyone most craves.

If this was the NYT recipe, it's missing a few elements: http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013100-slow-roasted-lamb-shoulder-with-coriander-seeds. What's your point?

indeed. the animal death footprint is much higher for the average plant diet than one high in products from grass, or waste ed animals, or responsible hunting.unless size makes a difference.then 20 field mice per loaf of bread or 1 million gophers per year in cali to protect almond trees, and many ,many more animals for Roth crops killed as pests or ''accidentally'' killed/displaced during tilling and harvesting is of course ok.but veganism looks, and feels so nice, don't it?

Utter nonsense. It's not remotely comparable.

One of the tastiest cuts. We buy a whole shoulder and slow roast for about 7 hours at 160 on a bed of vegetables and with some stock or wine thrown in. Lots of garlic and a bit of rosemary too, a covering of foil and you're good to go.... Well, in about 7 hours :-) Take the foil off for the last 15 minutes and whack the oven temp up.

I very much understand. Given that the method of killing ( without the prayers) is one that as existed for ever. If my neighbours in France have a lamb or a pig killed the method carried out is virtually the same. If I butcher my own rabbits , game or poultry the technique is almost the same as halal/ kosher.I assume you never go out for a curry.

Anchovies taste AMAZING with lamb - yum yum

I don't like the method of killing for halal and kosher meat and won't knowingly eat it

Absolutely. Unboned, it practically cooks itself.

so is growing plants. habitat destruction, harvesting, but most of all; pest control, even after harvest.

Thankfully, I can get good lamb and mutton here in Germany from the local Turkish butcher and he bones it too, if I want. Problem is that he doesn't always have mutton, which I believe tastes better than lamb. I'm going to give that Moorish (and moreish) lamb a try next weekend.

Ah, corrected to spezzatino now, I see. Still looks appallingly gloppy and way overcooked.

Shoulder of lamb - tricky to cook? Who says?It's a bit laborious to bone one, as I sometimes do, but throwing a whole one in a meat tin and bunging it in the oven does not require a staffed kitchen.



Author::::trevorgleet
DateTime::::2016-03-05T13:02:25Z
Me too. Tastier and juicier than leg. The trick is to roast it long enough to sweat most of the fat off, and tenderise the meat with it. It's great roasted with just rosemary and pepper. Or coated in a goo (I'm sure there's a smart name for it but I don't care) of grated ginger, garlic, curry paste (balti, rogon or madras, doesn't matter) and lemon juice mixed with yogurt. Quite like two of the recipes above, though not needing aluminium foil which I refuse to waste like this.

Good recipes. I have to say that with spicey recipes I prefer mutton. In fact my halal butcher in Bradford dealt almost exclusively in mutton. If I wanted lamb outside Eid I had to order it. For non spicey dishes I loved Yorkshire lamb.

Pork? Whenever I have had spezzatino (the usual form) in Italy it's been either beef or veal. And never ever made from already cooked meat. Spezzato as a noun means 'piece', as an adjective 'in pieces, broken' as in cuore spezzato (a broken heart). It's also got a specialised meaning in fashion as a rough equivalent of 'mix and match'. Pecorino - the everyday Roman cheese for pasta and much else - 'decadent and theatrical'? Letting your imagination run away with you I think.

I usually just stick a shoulder on a load of root veggies, pour in some stock and cover the whole thing in foil. Cook for about 3 hours. The above recipes look nice, will try them next.

I am a big fan of lamb shoulder (or even better, mutton) and these recipes all look delicious. I tend to cook two roasts at a time - one for immediate eating and the second I portion-up and freeze for exactly these types of recipes.
