<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hat could be more wholesome than Johnson &amp; Johnson’s talcum powder? It is the fragrant way to dry the bits towels can’t reach. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2343974/Women-regularly-use-talcum-powder-increase-risk-ovarian-cancer-24.html" title="">Up to 40% of women</a> may use talc at least occasionally. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/johnson-johnson-72-millon-babuy-talcum-powder-ovarian-cancer" title="">But last week a Missouri jury awarded $72m (£51.5m) in damages</a> to the family of Jackie Fox, who died of ovarian cancer having used the well-known brand of powder for years. More than 1,200 other cases are still waiting to be heard.</p>

<p>The scientific evidence linking talcum powder to ovarian cancer is not overwhelming, but the trial saw an internal memo from a medical consultant employed by Johnson &amp; Johnson that suggested that “anybody who denies [the] risks” between “hygienic” talc use and ovarian cancer would be publicly perceived in the same light as those who denied a link between smoking cigarettes and cancer.</p>

<p>Three years ago I wrote about a paper linking talc to an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/should-i-stop-using-talcum-powder" title="">increased risk of ovarian cancer</a>. It is a debate that has rumbled on for decades. Talc is naturally occurring and consists of magnesium, silicon, hydrogen and oxygen. It is mined from the soil and, before 1973, was often contaminated with asbestos (a naturally occurring close neighbour in the ground).</p>

<p>Last year, a court awarded a woman in California $13m <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.asbestos.com/news/2015/05/05/asbestos-in-talcum-powder-lawsuit/" title="">for developing a mesothelioma</a> (a tumour of the lining of the lungs) from using talc with asbestos in it – the tiny fibres in talc are easily inhaled. Removing the asbestos, however, did not stop some studies continuing to link talc with ovarian cancer. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12820486" title="">A 2003 meta-analysis looking at 16 studies</a> involving 11,933 women found talc was associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer, but a 2014 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25214560" title="">study of 61,576 women found no such link</a>. The<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.iarc.fr/" title=""> International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (part of the WHO) has classified talc applied to the genitals as “possibly carcinogenic”. The studies that have found the weak links have been case-control studies that compare the use of talc by women with ovarian cancer to those without it. They rely on self-reported talc use, which is not terribly reliable.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/should-i-stop-using-talcum-powder">Should I stop using talcum powder?</a> </p>

<p>There is a plausible mechanism by which talc could promote cancer – by triggering long-term inflammation. But since ovarian cancer is uncommon, the use of talc will only raise a small risk by a smallish amount (up to a third). There are stronger risks for ovarian cancer, such as genetic abnormalities, hormone replacement therapy and being overweight. Studies do not show a relationship between the amount of talc used and the likelihood of ovarian cancer – if there was a strong link they would do. But while talc may not be unsafe, a fluffy towel is safer. The popularity of talc is already waning and won’t be helped by more lawsuits.</p>

Even a small cancer risk for a product regularly used on infants is significant don't you think?. I keep thinking about the child lying there breathing in baby powder after every diaper change.

It's good for doors that stick -- run a bit on both sides of the sticking point and though it may still be tight, it won't stick anymore in that irritating paint-to-paint way that makes you have to yank with all your might to get it open. Works on sticking drawer runners, too.

The only household uses for my bottle of talc that I have found in the 45 years since I left thome are: as a lubricant for bicycle inner tubes inside the tyres (tires), and to stop running shoes (trainers) from squeaking.

I once had a weird flatmate who was addicted to talc. Whenever she used the bathroom she would liberally spread it around (most of it must have missed her actual body). We cleaned the place once a week and ther would be a good quarter inch deep layer of white powder on the bathroom floor...

Johnson's baby powder has traditionally been used on babies around their genitals to keep them dry (and help prevent nappy rash)...and also because it smells nice. I gather from this, that some women have bought into the idea that if it works for babies, then it must work for them. Advertising and the media have been promoting the idea that women's vaginas are not nice unless they are smelling of sweetness/perfume, (clearly so that they will buy their products), so many women believe this and use the product in the mistaken belief that they need it. A woman's vagina is a delicate balance of natural secretions and bacteria. If anything chemical or 'unnatural' enters the vagina, then it can cause imbalances of these secretions and bacteria. There is no need for anything to be used except water and un-perfumed soap to keep it clean. Here endeth the lesson!

I'm not sure that's a good benchmark: I generally don't eat soap, but (considering the inverse) I would gladly eat hot curry sauce - although I'm not sure that it would be very comfortable when applied to my underarms.

Talc is used to coat inner tubes, and insides of tires. Divers use it to protect and lubricate the latex seals on drysuits.Talc formations that have been metamorphosed may have asbestos, and soapstone. It could be used to manufacture catalytic converters.

That is not what it is intended for at all. You use it after washing / showering / bathing / swimming or on hot days to stop chafing.

They don't put it inside their vagina, but in the folds and creases between the legs and around the vulva as it is hard to get this area dry (because it's not supposed to be)

ah, that makes sense, I always use tampons so never had to worry about chafing, thus my puzzlment.

It still makes no sense to me, you need a hell of a lot of talc to mop up the bodily fluids.

Except long term building dust is unlikely to travel up your vagina, through the uterus, up the fallopian tube and into your ovary unless you are in the daily habit of wandering building sites in a skirt 'commando style' in which case stay away from ladders and scaffolding.

Get a slip stick. From a running shop though smaller versions are available from the foot section of Boots that will fit in a handbag for touch ups. It works for me on very hot 20+ running miles so should last you for a day of bra wearing.

Try using a slip stick instead, get from a running shop. Sold to prevent chafing and blisters. A combination of aloe vera, carnauba wax and allantoin. I can testify as to it's anti-chafing properties from hot 20+ miles of running.

Interestingly talc can be used in a surgical procedure called pleurodesis which is used to prevent recurrent pneumothorax and malignant pleural effusion caused by mesothelioma. This involves introducing talc into the pleural space - the gap between the lining of the inner chest wall and the lining of the lungs which causes the two layers to be become inflamed to such an extent that they stick to each other thus obliterating the pleural space. No pleural space means there's nowhere for fluid to accumulate (prevents pleural effusion) or air to enter (prevents pneumothorax). As far as I am aware the use of asbestos free talc for pleurodesis has not been shown to increase cancer risk. Might be a different story wrt the ovaries of course.

it's quite an old-fashioned thing these days but ladies were encouraged to use it for drying 'damp' areas, if that explains it sufficiently for you in polite terms, in the same way that someone referred to using it for sweaty men's nether regions in summer.

It isn't used for cleaning, it's used to keep the skin dry and chafe free on humid hot days.

In another news article about this lawsuit, there was a mention of this woman using "feminine hygiene" products by the same manufacturer. Now, they didn't specify what those products were exactly, but if they were douches I can more easily imagine them being responsible for the cancer. Such products would introduce un-necessary chemicals and fragrances far closer to the ovaries than talcum powder could.
