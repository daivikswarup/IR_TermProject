Ask Eva says goodbye: seven lessons I learned from answering your questions




DateTime::::2016-03-10T16:26:49+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen I started writing this column just over a year ago, I wasn’t sure how long it would last. How many questions, I wondered, would people really have about online dating? Answer: many! From getting started with online dating in middle age, to the ethics of juggling multiple online paramours, I heard about the anxious-making unreturned right-swipe, the ecstasy of finding partners for niche sexual activities and the challenge of finding partners from particular ethnic groups; I pondered the trouble of falling in love with people who are probably robots, and considered how to make your profile stand out in a field of shirtless Netflix fans.</p>

<p>Today, I’m signing off, but before I go, here are the most important things I learned in my year as your electronic agony aunt.</p>

<p>Many of the emails I received were from people who were concerned that they weren’t getting “enough” matches, or going on a sufficient number of dates. Of course dating online increases the pool of people you can meet with speed, but it’s<br/>not just a matter of throwing mud at a wall until some of it sticks. The fact that you have gone on dates with five people has zero bearing on whether candidate #6 will be your ideal partner.<br/></p>

<p>Most common in my inbox were tales of woe – from both men and women – who would go on dates with people they’d met on dating apps, thought it had gone very well, but never heard from their dates again. They were left confused, and wondering what had happened. In most cases, I think it was because the person who disappeared just wasn’t looking for anything serious. You can meet someone attractive who shares all of your interests, but if you’re not both looking for the same kind of relationship, whether that’s “marriage” or “five minutes in a bathroom stall”, one or both of you is very likely to end up disappointed. You have to make sure you’re on the same page. The earlier you do that, the better.<br/></p>

<p>Tinder was launched as a hookup app but has evolved to something that people use to find long-term relationships, too – I know of several real Tinder-sparked marriages. That said, judging from my mailbox, it seems to be broadly the case that among heterosexual daters, women want to use Tinder to find love and men want to use Tinder to find casual sex. Which is the ultimate mismatch. What’s the answer? Be clear about your intentions, and then everyone will be kinder and happier, and actually probably end up having more sex.<br/></p>

<p>Ask not: is this person who I met on Tinder yesterday my soulmate? But rather: am I having a nice time on this particular evening, and would I like to have a nice time with this person again? Movies may tell us that we should set eyes on a person and know that we love them in an instant. But expecting to know immediately whether someone you’ve met on your phone is the love of your life is unrealistic. And rejecting people because they don’t give you an instant desire to love them<br/>forever in the hopes that someone else in your phone will give you that feeling can lead to missed opportunities.<br/></p>

<p>Many people wrote to me at their wits’ end: they were sick of online dating, and wanted clear advice about how to find what they were looking for. But dating is a leisure activity, not a doctor’s prescription. Sometimes you just need a break from it. Return to it when you think: “Meeting new people will be fun and interesting, and if it leads to something more, that’s a plus!!” and not “Why haven’t I met the love of my life yet? My thumbs are so, so tired.” That thumb fatigue will lead you to make bad choices – for you, and for other people.<br/></p>

<p>Culture tends to tell us that being in a relationship is the best way to be, and yet it is somehow taboo to admit that you want to be with someone, and that you’re making an active effort to do so. Many people wrote to me about how embarrassed they are to be searching for love online. (To all the folks below the line who advised each week that people should stop looking because “love finds you when you least<br/>expect it”: rest assured, many people who are using dating apps haven’t been expecting it for years.) This creates a strange condition whereby people who are looking for dates online often feel a degree of disgust for other people who they meet online: what’s wrong with someone if they can’t find love in the real world? Of course this comes from a place of self-loathing, and of course it does not lead to<br/>romantic success.</p>

<p>Many people seem to be so embarrassed about being single that they don’t ask the people who could really help them change their situation: friends, family, the people who know and love them best and want to see them happy. That doesn’t mean you have to go out with your grandmother’s handsome dentist. But it does mean that there is really no harm in saying to your best friend: can you help me with my dating profile to make sure it shows me at my best? Or: can you take a<br/>nice photo of me in natural daylight where I’m smiling and relaxed and<br/>not sitting next to a drugged tiger?<br/>No one has ever swiped right because of a drugged tiger.<br/>Love,<br/>Eva<br/></p>

The wording implies she thought him gorgeous from his profile photo(s). I was just asking what if he wasn't. But that's fine, you speak for her.

I have enjoyed this series but I feel the advice given to men who are unattractive to look at has been lacking somewhat . Getting someone to look over your profile is pointless. A friend isn't going to tell you that the reason you're unsuccessful is because you are not good looking. I went to one female friend who told me to change a couple of things. Then a month later I went to a different friend who advised that any change these things back to how they originally were. Because they can't just say that you're ugly and so are going to really struggle, they have to get you to tweak for tweaking's sake. What advise ce we need is general advice for how an ugly guy can cut through and actually have some success.

She thinks he's gorgeous. Who knows if you would. That is kind of the point.

Yes thus is true. But the difference is that many average looking women get dates with good looking men who view it as an easy way to get casual sex. The woman though rationalises it as a compatibility problem or some such and believes that she's much more desirable. In the case of the man chasing the hot 25 year old, unless he's rich, he's just not going to get anywhere so he's likely, if he's not a total moron, to reassess how attractive he is pretty quickly.

When u was at university this average looking charisma free guy somehow managed to convince everyone in our college that his dad was worth 338 million pounds (always will remember the exact number). The number of women who were all over him for that first semester was unreal. Then he got found out at the Xmas ball and was forced to switch colleges pretty sharpish.

This clearly happens A LOT. Half the profiles I read have some variation of a complaint about this. Funnily enough it seems to make them even more amenable to the good looking men who clearly have the surplus options to pull this trick off. The rest of us who actually are looking for a relationship are generally ignored. You get what you deserve.

This is one of those things that's fine if you're good looking. I'm not and the advice when I say I'm having no success online is that saying funny things make a women not take you seriously. Obviously it's just nonsense. People will try desperately to find any reason other than your looks to explain it. But on profiles with good looking photos, the funny line goes over a storm.

I'm aware of that dynamic, the term you're looking for is prostitution.

Topless photos, big turn off. As one of my friends commented when I showed him one "that is code for I just want sex". Boring profiles. Negative lists of what they are *not* looking for in a woman. 



Author::::ChicagoGirl2

That presupposes that people can't learn from their mistakes and make positive changes in their lives. I dated ten (or more) bastards and married the worst of the lot. But when I was younger I suffered from low self esteem and the experience of growing up with a fairly narcissistic mother. Cue two years of therapy and a lot of self exploration and I'm not dating bastards any more. I'm not saying I'm done making mistakes, but they are not on the scale of the earlier ones. When I broke up with the most recent one, my friends' reactions were not "never mind, you'll find someone better" but "did you leave a door open?" Mind you I've found someone better since, but I thought it was telling that none of them secretly thought he was a bastard - because he wasn't. Just not right for me.

This is spot on. I came out of a six month relationship at the start of the year with someone who was lovely - and the sex was great - but in retrospect the talking was just the filler between dinner and bed. Now starting to see someone who confessed very early on that he'd only joined GSM because he'd relocated and was looking for friends in the area, though happy if it led to something else. Well, it's still early days but we talk all the time, by email, on the phone, three dates so far - and it all feels a lot more positive. And we've taken down our profiles while we see where this thing goes.



Author::::ChicagoGirl2
DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:25:06Z
Or if they are looking for a "god-fearing woman" - had that from a fellow American early on in the process and had no qualms at all saying I didn't think we would be compatible. Whew - that's the sort of thing I ran away from in the first place!

As others have said, a lot are similar across genders. Group shots, drugged tigers, kids, religion. What used to annoy me about some male profiles was blokes who said things like "I'm not interested in women who dye their hair/wear makeup". Nearly all women do these things to an extent. "Don't expect me to pay for you on our first date." Actually, I wouldn't, but announcing to the world that you expect your dates to pay their own way just sounds a bit tight.

So sudden! Sorry to see you go, it was a fantastic column and your advice was always very insightful and helpful. I've already recommended it as "basic background reading" to several friends who are online dating.

You've got it spot on with the confirmation bias idea. Anyone who has this idea about women (or men), then observes someone not fitting their preconception- not particularly rich or attractive- has to think they're either not seeing something, or its' just an anomaly. Because they justify their own behaviour on their low opinion of others.

The guardian contributor wouldn't say what his job is. I'm gonna contend it's his job that attracted women if he is genuinely saying it's not his looks.

Gawd ! too much pain and introspection you have to wonder do some people just seek out stinging experiences so they can spend several long solitary months writing wishful wisdow in life affirming blogs. Meanwhile I'm just wonder when a Guardian dating article will put as much thought and detail into explaining how to get laid on soul mates.

1-don't use a photo with you and a whole load of young hot women. If you are that popular with them why are you on the site.2-your main profile pic should be just you or others should be cropped out 3-your main profile pic should not be one of you (semi)naked or in fancy dress /silly clothing4-at least one full body length would be good 5-don't try and hide the fact that you're bald/receding by wearing hat /helmet or cropping photo. Save for a hair transplant.
