IWD 2016: how women are finding new ways to fight inequality




DateTime::::2016-03-08T11:58:00+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">G</span></span>reen, white and purple sashes, powerful placards and large-scale marches – these are the hallmarks of feminist protest from days gone by. But while the suffragettes, and other activists, might have firmly etched such images on the public consciousness, a new wave of protesters are taking up the fight in inventive and surprising ways.<br/></p>

<p>Marches are still important – and effective – of course, but with protests that don’t always involve rallies or banners, women around the world are also finding their own unique ways of making their point.</p>

<p>To celebrate <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/international-womens-day">International Women’s Day</a>, here are a collection of recent and varied examples that might inspire you to take your own stand. Some are individuals, who have reported their actions to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.everydaysexism.com/">Everyday Sexism Project</a>. Others have hit the headlines with their unconventional and startling techniques for disrupting gendered oppression. Whether deeply personal or very public, all of them are finding new ways to stand up to inequality.<br/></p>

<p>When media outlets in the Indian state of Kerala reported that 45 female employees had been strip-searched after a used sanitary towel was found in a factory toilet, feminist activists didn’t take it lying down. Campaign group Kiss of Love launched an action called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1016428895039650/">Red Alert</a> in January last year, calling on women to send sanitary towels (“used or unused”) to the marketing director of the company where the incident occurred.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/live/2016/mar/08/international-womens-day-2016-iwd-live">International Women's Day 2016 – live!</a> </p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the beginning of this year, a group of women in Mexico City calling themselves “Las Hijas de Violencia” (Daughters of Violence) found a novel way to tackle street harassers, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.refinery29.com/2016/01/102093/mexico-city-hijas-de-violencia-fight-catcalling-confetti">using confetti guns and punk rock</a>. The group told online news channel <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ze4AH_5kJw">AJ+</a>:</p>

<p>“When we are walking down the street and someone harasses us in any way … we run after this person, we grab our confetti guns, we shoot once, we turn on the speakers and we sing Sexista Punk.”</p>

<p>Their <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ze4AH_5kJw">song</a> includes the lyrics, “What you’ve done to me is called harassment,” and explains how these women are choosing to “respond” to such provocation rather than accept it as the norm. <br/></p>

<p>Young people around the world have also been finding new and attention-grabbing ways to protest against sexist school dress codes, which enforce societal gender stereotypes, and often send the message that girls’ bodies are sexual and dangerous. In the most insidious cases, girls are told the reason they asked to cover up is that they risk distracting male peers from their studies. So when girls at a middle school in Illinois were <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thenation.com/article/girls-speak-out-against-sexist-school-dress-codes">banned from wearing leggings in March 2014</a>, they turned up to protest bearing placards that read “Are my pants lowering your test scores?”<br/></p>

<p>When a transgender student in Brazil was fined because she chose to wear a skirt to school later that year, her male classmates supported her by turning up for lessons wearing skirts themselves. A <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/22/boys-skirts-protest-transgender-brazil-voudesaia_n_5863920.html">photo of the students in their skirts</a> went viral, causing the school to announce it would consider a change in uniform policy.<br/></p>

<p> In Afghanistan, performance artist Kubra Khademi made a powerful statement about women’s bodies in public spaces last year when she <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/12/afghan-artist-armour-street-harassment-walk-kubra-khademi-kabul">walked through the streets wearing metal body armour</a> specially designed to emphasise her breasts, crotch and bottom. The performance, designed to highlight the discomfort caused by men groping and harassing women in the street, drew leers, thrown stones and death threats – perfectly proving Khademi’s point.</p>

<p>Gender equality remains a hot topic and something that women continue to strive for at every level. Entries to the Everyday Sexism Project suggest there are also thousands of individual women finding their own, personal methods of protest. Here are just a few:</p>

<p>Whether it’s coordinated collective action, a personal stand or even an unplanned instance of bystander intervention, there is something each of us can do to tackle the widespread normalisation of gender inequality. You don’t even have to go looking for opportunities to take part in the movement, because – unfortunately – sexism is likely to cross everybody’s path at some point; whether it’s witnessing street harassment, overhearing workplace discrimination, or seeing the impact of gender stereotypes on a young person you know. So the next time you come across the problem, let these women be your inspiration to get stuck in and become part of the solution.</p>

Of course I don't object to that, it's the only good symptom of the original falsehood of your shared struggle. The rest of your arguments are to fragmented and strawman filled for me to even bother debating you, you sound almost religious in your beliefs.

What shocks me about those bullet-points is not the 'still a long way to go' line in self-pity and condescension they exemplify, but rather the illustration of humourlessness, stupidity and cowardice they provide. It would be funny if I didn't know you were serious. Cultural vandals target women and children because they confuse feeling with thought, the inherent plasticity of their psychologies [see the excellent Erin Pizzey on female thinking] encouraging them to invent grievances where none exist. It's a testament to the way women actually lord it over us in fact that the article concentrates on non-European countries whose affairs we have no business meddling in [taxpayers' money back channelled even to unregistered 'charities' providing little incentive to pack up and go home when you've achieved your ambitions because of course you never achieve them at all in perpetual wars fought for perpetual peace]. Mrs/Miss Bates would find a more fruitful source of evidence outside comfy, centrally-heated offices she frequents. Are we not deafened after all by demands for remedial justice at the almost complete absence of female 'operatives' on local authority 'refuse collection' vehicles, street-sweeping units, building sites and the like? Oh, wait....

Ok, I've read the article you linked and now have an opinion about it.

You're right. I come across that mentality a lot (I work in education in the ME) - however, you could argue that the ability to see the value of study, whether as a stand-alone one related to bettering one's ability to reason and understand, or as one linked to getting an intellectually satisfying job, or as you mention, as a way out, is in itself indicative of a bright and active intelligence.

Its not as simple as that Miss, most ME males wish for the easy route to success and wealth (as befitting a noble male!!?) like business, or some employment agent, been a landlord, (via getting a loan from the bank). A lot of ME males don't want to actually study or work in service roles and that's what they think about Science or engineering is. On the other hand Females see it as a way out. Whatever the situation is, good luck and more power to women's rights everywhere, especially in the ME.

Forgive me for butting in.If women are trying to force their own culture on the men/patriarchal way of dong things, without the power-over which the system has, which is mostly run by males but which many women have adapted to or fit in by their nature, then is it not the case that such an attempt to change the reigning culture is like banging your head against a very thick and solid wall?

Blah, blah, blahWomen need to realise that the genders are different, biologically and physically.Men are better at some things, STEM springs to mind, whilst women tend to be nurturers.It is how it is and unless men become physically weaker and more in tune with their feminine side, this won't change.If we were all like women, we'd still be living in the stone age.If we were all like men, then we'd have killed ourselves off.A bit of both suits the human race fine.

Since women have half the vote where they are allowed to vote and, at least in the West, have the means to educate themselves about the world through the internet if they can afford it and libraries, as yet, if they are struggling financially, there is a huge potential for women to make a difference.If they could change themselves, they could change western society.Then the West could have a go helping the rest of the world, instead of spreading corruption, eloitation and environmental degradation.Protesting and funny action to make a point with men is not going to cut the mustard, other than help women themselves be more comfortable as they are doing something, however ineffectual, about their lack of political purchase in society.I have often been modded for comments about women's emancipation because it does not fit the PC brigade's views.

I think, if you look at the world around you, even in the uk, you will see there is not equity. Have a look at government, business and television. Although only approximately half the population men are over represented in positions of influence and power. Think about how the world is portrayed and the gender stereo types our children have to grow up with, subtly influencing and modlding their views and decisions. Look at sport, its not about who would win a straight out strength test between man and a women, it's about effort, participation and being the best you can be. Women sporting event are different not better or worse. Because we have only had men's sport widely available we are not used to the difference, therefore don't automatically view it as being as good or valuable. Tennis is an exception, cycling is making a real effort, equestrian is just strange where show jumping, cross country etc is gender neutral, but racing, remains dominated by men. If you had a daughter, would you not want her to thrive and see her genders efforts equally applauded and recognised for the value they add to society? Would you not hope that she would have male friends that would support and respect her? Can I ask why some men get so angry and upset at the thought of equity and equality? It benifits both genders? Thanks.

The only one I can agree with there is the tax on essential feminine products. Those are a hygienic necessity, much like deodorant or soap. It's ridiculous to tax them. For the rest of your "points", I agree with GropeaPanda. Well, that and catcalling. I mean, define it. Is it, "I really like your dress. It looks really nice on you." As opposed to "You're so hot come and do me, baby." And even if it's the second one, do you actually feel threatened? For myself, I feel the same as I do any time someone is rude to me.

It was in response to men have never been under control of the mother's or their wives, it was one example, didn't say it was the same kind of power as women have lived under in the past. However and my original point was that I recognise the wrongs that men have done and still do to women. I just don't understand how on one page you can compare a woman supposedly being asked if the man of the house is around to a woman in Afghanistan who can't leave the house without getting molested. All you have done is assumed that I'm a "sexist" and have tried to come up with a load of examples of how women have and are being treated badly. Has nothing to do with my accusing western women of comparing ridiculous things because of a shared gender.

Hmm, I'd vote for 5 sets as they are obviously quite capable and as fit as a men (and let's be honest are quite often a more interesting game to watch), but I guess that decision would be up to the professionals who play it, and wouldn't it be a great choice for them to be able to actually have!

I can't quite believe you are trying to say that a modern woman trying to keep a man away from their children is the same kind of power wielding as women have lived under in the past. Women were owned by their fathers and then their husbands (who they were often forced to marry to better the family). They could not own property or money and even if they had some before a marriage it then became the husband's. She also could not own her children, the belonged to the father and the father could decide to have them adopted without even telling their mother. This happened when women left their husbands - out of spite a husband would decide she couldn't have them but he didn't want to look after them himself.

You're clearly missing the point. It's about choice. Men get to choose whether they "die on the front line" as you so delightfully put it. Woman get that choice made for them. That's not equality. And yes I'd be happy for us all to play against each other in sport, but that's not going to happen in the near future is it? In the meantime, woman who train just as hard often get paid significantly less - professional tennis springs to mind (oh and bet some woman tennis players would whoop men's arses)!
