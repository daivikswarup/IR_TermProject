What I’m really thinking: the mother of a baby with disabilities




DateTime::::2016-03-12T06:00:09+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t’s a year since my 20-week scan. That night, rather than texting our families “It’s a boy!” we were Googling terrifying medical terms, while leaflets for late-term abortion burned into the kitchen table.</p>

<p>I struggled with the prospect of becoming a mother to a disabled child. The turning point was finding an online community of parents of children with the same condition. They shared photos and stories – the children looked different, yes, but they were also happy and loved. I decided I couldn’t let a worst case scenario determine whether a life was worth living.</p>

<p>We’d read about a surgeon who could close the hole in my baby’s back while he was in my womb, preventing further damage to his spine and brain. There were risks to both of us but at 23 weeks’ gestation, we both went under the knife.</p>

<p>We were unlucky. Three weeks later he was born. We spent most of the following year in hospital. A year of fraught vigils and never-ending nights, praying to a God I don’t believe in for the chance to hold him just one more time.</p>

<p>Home at last, normal now means a routine of tube-feeding, tracheostomy care, catheterisation, physiotherapy, overnight shifts and endless logistics – all while my son is connected to a ventilator. His daddy adores him, so much so that we often clash over how to do things. At least neither of us has the energy to fall out for long.</p>

<p>Regrets? Not for a second. I never imagined such love in my life. Smiling, bouncing, adoring little man. The harder you have to fight for something, the more fiercely you cherish it.</p>

He's a "smiling, bouncing adoring little man", sounds like he has happiness in is life, and he is giving and receiving love. How many able-bodied people go through life without that? It is what it is, and they are finding the joy in what they can. How dare you judge.

I hope this parent and her child get all the support they need, and I wish them the best.

It seems better than the alternative, and there isn't anything they can do but care for their child the best they can. What do you hope to achieve with your comment? Give them something to agonise over that they've undoubtedly considered themselves? Even if you're right, you don't really have any basis for making a judgement and it hardly affects your life, does it?

Read Andrew Solomon - Far From the Tree. This is a non-fiction book about parents with children unlike themselves in some way (e.g. deaf, disabled, gay, prodigies, mentally ill, etc). It is an amazing, sensitive, thoughtful, considered approach to the subject.

Do you have much experience of what life is like for babies or infants on ventilators?

I respect your decision, but I doubt very much that your child is "enjoying" life connected to a ventilator + all the other stuff you mentioned that he has to go through on a daily basis.

I have come to feel that there is a big gap in understanding between people with a child with disabilities and people without disabilities. My impression (as a mother without children with disabilities) is that true involvement with and understanding of these children is very fulfilling. But it requires that you shift into their pace and to open your heart. As a friend of mine with an autistic son with Down says: "I feel that I was born so I could be his mother." I wish you all the best, even so it is definitely not easy at all. Try not to loose yourself in it completely.

Many parents do not know what is wrong with their baby and go through hell for years until there is a diagnosis. I am glad you were spared this at least. When the disability is not visible there is no community and no support. Things have not changed much in that respect.
