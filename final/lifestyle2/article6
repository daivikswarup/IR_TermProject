Kitchen gadgets review: Brew Buddies – the ravings of a lunatic




DateTime::::2016-03-09T12:34:02+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.findmeagift.co.uk/gifts/duck-mug-with-biscuit-holder.html">Brew Buddies (£7.99, findmeagift.co.uk)</a> is a hot drinks receptacle with a cutaway alcove at base, for the storing of snacks.</p>

<p>We have outlived our usefulness.</p>

<p>Look, I get it. We all have “ideas”. Just last week I awoke from a vivid dream, babbling: “How about a segregated pizza restaurant, shaped like a pizza? One half could be for VEGE-TABLES, the other half would be MEAT-SEATERS. It cannot fail!” In the cold light of day, these are the ravings of a lunatic. Yet the idea still makes more sense than Brew Buddies. Brew Buddies is a “novelty mug with space for two of your favourite biscuits”. Think about that. It is a sentence that makes humanity sound as though it has the collective intelligence of one dog. Is this where we’re at? What kind of plankton wants a mug with “handy biscuit storage”?<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/11/lazy-man-mug-kitchen-gadgets-review-rhik-samadder">Kitchen gadgets review: Lazy Man Mug – a storm in a teacup</a> </p>

<p>There are only three things wrong with Brew Buddies, which are: there is no problem to solve; if there was a problem, this is not its solution; and if this was the solution, it has been executed with great crappiness. No one needs a cup with a cookie stowaway. You can eat them out of the packet, or have them on a saucer if you’re the Queen. If you were dropped on your head as a baby and do desire such a thing, this is really not the one. The storage cavity, having been built into the base of the cup, means the space remaining for tea is very small, which in turn means the tea cools too quickly.</p>

<p>I was lying earlier. There are many more things that are terrible about Brew Buddies, including but not limited to 1) the slot’s position on the cup, meaning anyone left-handed will tip biscuit toward themselves, ruining a good jumper. 2) The name. 3) The fact that if two of your favourite biscuits are chocolate digestives with a layer of caramel, they will melt under the tea into useless poo coins. 4) The face on the mug appears to be screaming, which says it all. You and me both, buddy. You and me both.</p>

<p>The disgusting yellow of the cup is the nicest thing about it, but I’m still more likely to drink from yellow snow than this.</p>

<p>If I discover who invented it, I will put one in their biscuit hole. <strong>0/5</strong><br/></p>

Had to shop for food today - and guess what I bought? Yes, I did it ... NO, not the cup, my fellow readers - the caramel milk chocolate biscuits of course. Only good I never dunk my biscuits in my tea!

But this is 'inspect a gadget', most of us are regulars who know how it works, and most of the reviews are negative.The only objection I have to this column is that I spend most of Wednesdays with the cartoon Inspector Gadget theme song as my earworm...

Not read this column before, have you? Apart from providing a public service in being anti-advertising, it also gives CiF's middle-aged female readers with their weekly fix of Rhik. Careful, or kizbot will be tracking you down...

I used to suffer from panic attacks. One of the first symptoms was my mouth going dry. Carrying water around with me meant that I could fend off an attack. And the fact that my generation regularly felt thirsty when we weren't allowed access to water is another good reason for people to keep water nearby now that they can.

When it's nearly 40 C in the summer, it's actually quite intelligent to carry a bottle of water round... and since I refill mine from the tap, also ok environmentally... every 15 min is pretty bizarre tho'... whose idea is that?



Author::::snailsandslugs

Still worst, the water bottle in offices, meetings, schools, buses etc etc. I found very odd that people need to have a plastic bottle with water carrying all the time like toddlers with their little stuffed bear. When plastic was not so prolific as today, yu see children and grow ups without the water next to them and nobody dropped dead. Now you see them any were!! I do not see the reason, of course if the person is ill or exercising, etc and really needs water every 15 minutes, of course. However when people have water just some meters away, it looks innecessary and anti-enviromental, to be with a bottle of water. How many plastic produced for this new invented necessity?

When I broke my left hand I had a shocking time with socks, knickers, opening wine but would've found the biscuit-on-board mug a nightmare - you have to be able to open a packet as well!

They inserted that later, really! I looked up after I read this comment and there was no hint (unusual) - but a few hours later they had changed that!

I've got a better idea for a sort of towel rack (biscuit rack?) that you can put on any normal sized mug and hold those precious dark choc digestives... also works in any orientation even left handed...

It's a regular feature so pretty much. Also not seen many plugs that call the product "disgusting" and the people who want it "plankton" but there you go...

Up to today this column was free of "YGPFTS"-comments ... We had "Doesn't the Guardian have more important/urgent/intelligent ... things to report?" or "This is a blatant plug/advert/commercial"-kind of comments, plenty. But the "YGPFTS" is new to this thread ...

It might be meant to be funny and indeed may even be entertaining for some folk but I don't take it that way, however it is gratifying to learn that you're working on a sense of humour.
