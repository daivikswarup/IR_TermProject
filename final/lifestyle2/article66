My Kitchen, my inspiration: Aimee Twigger

<p><strong>My kitchen is … </strong>quite small, but very neat. I did it up quite recently – my brother is still tiling the walls. I went for quite an industrial look with white subway tiles and shelves made of old scaffolding boards with metal brackets. It’s mostly open shelving, with ingredients in glass jars, and one cupboard with doors for things that don’t work in jars! The worktops are a really dark wood and I’ve a lot of copper accessories, which adds accents of brightness. I keep all my props and the other things I use for my photography is in another room. There’s a big window in front of the sink and a back door that gives on to a little courtyard, with steps going up into the main garden. The one thing I’d change if I could is the stone floor– it was there when we moved in, and it’s just so cold.</p>

<p><strong>My favourite kitchen tool is … </strong>my Kitchen Aid mixer. It’s cream-coloured; I’ve had it for about two years and I use it every day.</p>

<p><strong>My storecupboard staple is … </strong>Nielsen‑Massey vanilla bean paste. I buy a big jar and it lasts for ages. Vanilla brings a sweetness that means you can get away with using less sugar than normal. If you have a sweet tooth, like me, that’s a useful thing!</p>

<p><strong>When I’m starving I … </strong>have Greek yoghurt with honey and granola. I always have a batch of my own in the house – I shove everything in it: nuts, rose, candied stem ginger, seeds … you name it.</p>

<p><strong>My culinary inspiration is … </strong>from blogs, Instagram and Pinterest: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://call-me-cupcake.blogspot.co.uk/">Linda Lomellino</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://mynameisyeh.com/">Molly Yeh</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.hummingbirdhigh.com">Michelle Lopez</a>, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://bettysliu.com/">Betty Liu</a>. I love seeing different photography styles – it’s really inspiring. I love <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="lilyvanilli.com/">Lily Vanilli</a>, and I’m obsessed with Mary Berry. She’s brilliant. Her recipes are foolproof.</p>

<p><strong>My best-kept kitchen secret is … </strong>to always cream the butter and sugar for ages, until really, really soft. Then add the eggs one at a time, mixing for 2 minutes before adding the next. It makes your cake really light. It’s important to really mix in the eggs well, otherwise they can curdle. Also, if you fold the flour in by hand, you don’t make any gluten, so the batter stays soft.</p>

<p><strong>My current obsession is … </strong>vegan avocado and lime coconut cream frosting. I put it on a vegan sponge with <em>aquafaba </em>– the brine from a can of chickpeas. I don’t know who figured out that whipping this brine with sugar makes a vegan meringue, but it does.</p>

<p><strong>Everything tastes better with … </strong>salt. I particularly like using flaked sea salt on brownies.</p>

<p><strong>When I go shopping I … </strong>always have my notebook. I know exactly what I’m getting, but if I find something beautiful that is in season, I’ll also think of ideas for that, on the spot. Whatever catches my eye.</p>

<p><strong>For dinner tonight … </strong>I’m having Chinese steamed buns and chicken chilli and rice.</p>

Too small?

Well she says she likes the vegan avocado and lime frosting, not that all her baking is vegan.

I's the protein from the chickpeas that will froth and make the vegan 'eggwhite' [quite logical actually].

Vegan baking - Greek yogurt, butter and eggs - I don't think so.

Why no pictures of the actual kitchen?
