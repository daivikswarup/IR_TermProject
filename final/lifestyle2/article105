The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers’ Seville orange recipes




DateTime::::2016-03-04T17:00:40+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">S</span></span>eville orange season is an almost religious affair in my family, such is our collective love of Mum’s famous dark whisky marmalade. As the time draws near, my siblings and I vie to book bedrooms at home, so we get our mitts on a larger share of those precious jars. I love the bitter, fragrant juices of these oranges so much that I always buy extra and stash them whole in the freezer. The sharp juice is particularly good at cutting through rich meats, duck especially; it also makes a wonderful, exotic posset in which the bitterness is softened by cool, sweet cream. If you can’t find Sevilles, use normal oranges, but reduce the amount of sugar: you just won’t need as much.</p>

<p>This very simple braise combines the dark, fruity tones of oloroso sherry with star anise, fiery ginger and those gloriously sharp citrus juices to offset the soft, rich duck meat. Serve with piles of mashed potato and/or celeriac. Serves four to six.</p>

<p><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br/><strong>4 duck legs</strong><br/><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br/><strong>12 baby shallots, peeled</strong><br/><strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled and halved</strong><br/><strong>2 Seville oranges, cut into slices, rind on</strong><br/><strong>4 thyme sprigs </strong><br/><strong>4 bay leaves</strong><br/><strong>250ml dry oloroso sherry</strong><br/><strong>2 star anise</strong><br/><strong>3 tbsp dark brown sugar</strong><br/><strong>1 thumb fresh ginger, peeled and grated</strong><br/><strong>½ chicken stock cube dissolved in 300ml boiling water</strong><br/><strong>1 savoy cabbage, cut in half, cored and cut into 12 wedges</strong></p>

<p>Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Heat the oil in a large casserole on a medium flame. Season the duck, lay it skin side down in the hot oil and brown well on both sides. Transfer the legs to a plate, then pour off most of the fat in the pan (the duck will release a fair bit; save it for roasting spuds), leaving just a couple of tablespoons.</p>

<p>Return the pot to the heat, add the shallots and garlic, and fry for five minutes, until golden. Lay the orange slices on top of the shallots, then throw in the herbs and sit the duck legs on top. Pour over the sherry, add the star anise, sugar and ginger, then add enough stock to come two-thirds of the way up the meat. Season generously, bring up to a simmer, cover and transfer to the oven for 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Remove the lid, tuck the cabbage under the legs, so it’s submerged in stock with the duck sitting on top, then return, uncovered, to the oven for 45 minutes, until the duck is golden and falling off the bone and the cabbage is very tender.</p>

<p>Lift out and discard the orange slices. I find that a whole leg is too much meat for one person, so I cut each leg into thigh and drumstick and serve them astride a spoonful of mash (potato and/or celeriac) with a pile of cabbage and masses of sauce.</p>

<p>Kamut flour is made from an ancient grain, khorasan wheat. I find that it’s gentler on the stomach than standard flour, and it has a gorgeous nuttiness, too. These crumbly little biscuits go perfectly with the cool, creamy possets. Serves six.</p>

<p><strong>600ml double cream</strong><br/><strong>125g light brown sugar</strong><br/><strong>Juice and zest from 3 Seville oranges, scrubbed first</strong></p>

<p>For the cookies<br/><strong>210g pecans</strong><br/><strong>115g unsalted butter, at room temperature</strong><br/><strong>50g soft brown sugar</strong><br/><strong>65g caster sugar</strong><br/><strong>210g kamut flour</strong><br/><strong>½ tsp baking powder</strong><br/><strong>¼ tsp fine sea salt</strong><br/><strong>5 tbsp maple syrup</strong><br/><strong>1 tsp vanilla extract</strong></p>

<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Put the cream, sugar and orange zest in a heavy-based pan on a medium heat and slowly bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves. Once little bubbles start to form around the edge of the pan, stir in the orange juice and take off the heat.</p>

<p>Pour the cream into small glasses or ramekins (if you prefer a smooth posset, strain the mix first to remove the zest), then give them a gentle tap to clear any bubbles on the top. Leave to cool, then bake for two to three hours, until set.</p>

<p>To make the shortbread, spread out the nuts on a baking sheet and roast at 180C until golden – about eight to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave to cool.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, cream the butter with both sugars, either by hand or in a mixer with a paddle attachment, until light and fluffy, for about three minutes. Blitz the nuts, flour, baking powder and salt in a food processor until the mix is the texture of fine breadcrumbs. Slowly beat three tablespoons of maple syrup into the butter mix, followed by the vanilla and the ground nut/flour mix, until the dough just comes together.</p>

<p>Line two large baking sheets with greaseproof paper. Using your hands, shape walnut-sized balls of dough and lay on the sheets, leaving 3-4cm of space between them.</p>

<p>Bake for 18-20 minutes, swapping the trays between shelves halfway through: the cookies will look golden on the edges and slightly cracked. Leave them to cool on the trays, then brush with the remaining syrup. Serve with the possets.</p>

<p>Any leftover duck is glorious in wraps with hoisin sauce and slivers of cucumber, spring onion and baby gem lettuce. The sauce, cabbage and duck combo also lends itself very well to a spiced pilau: cook some rice in stock with a cinnamon stick, then mix with cooked lentils, sauteed onions and leftover duck, cabbage (shredded) and sauce. Make marmalade with any excess oranges: add some darker sugars to the preserving sugar for a richer, deeper flavour – molasses, demerara and treacle all work well.</p>

We just made your posset recipe, and wasted lots of lovely ingredients. Don't you check the recipe before you post it? There's a big difference between cooking something for 2-3 hours, and chilling it for 2-3 hours.

Here's the answer. I haven't got round to this yet, but looking forward to it as a reward for making lots of marmalade (Without whisky. Good marmalade doesn't need it and I do!). http://www.cheftalk.com/t/57094/duck-with-olives-in-the-spanish-style

I know this has been said further down - more than once actually - but when will the editorial staff at the Guardian actually bother to fit seasonal recipes with the season? We had rhubarb a couple of months back and now, when Seville oranges have gone, out come the recipes. Buy a relevant book about seasonal foods and make an effort. Unless if course you think cookery columns are mere entertainment.

Me too; don't even have to wait for next year, Sevilles and duck legs in the freezer, sherry in the cupboard. That's Sunday supper sorted.

Wigeon rhymes with pigeon; it's a duck, and if that's what he's thinking about, he's right? But, I'm with you re. domestic birds raised for consumption. A 3 kilo bird has substantial meat on the leg. However, my wife and I usually buy "canettes" -- young females -- that aren't any larger than a smallish chicken. I could handle two of their drumsticks, but my wife eats one, too.

Not your method. Very cold winter last year with hardly any rain, and the hottest summer for 150 years. Not many fruit crops did well this year

Not available here in Spain, really at all!! Mostly for export and the biggest importer is Dundee Marmalade Company. The nearest Spanish answer to marmalade is orange jam.

This genuinely made me laugh out loud. I am actually tempted to try this recipe as is, but I respect my food way too much.

I think it should be "chill for two to three hours" - a fairly sloppy mistake! She probably was thinking of the biscuits when writing, although I hate to think what biscuits would look like after three hours in the oven - probably the house would have burnt down before the time was up.

Posset is equally good with blood oranges...the zest finely grated with sugar in food processor until the sugar is fragrant and brightly colored, then add to the cream and juice. I prefer it unstrained since the zest is so fine, others might prefer to strain. Love possets of all citrus varieties, lemon, lemon/orange, mandarin, lime, yuzu. Any crisp cookie, like a langue du chat, is a nice accompaniment.

Interesting - and good on you for doing it for charity. Try the chutney - I used the usual 4:1:1, content:vinegar:sugar ratio, with onions, some apple, the slivered peel and orange pulp and juice, and some sultanas, for the content, and cassonade sugar - can't get soft brown around here. Flavored it with some crystallized ginger, cloves, ground cardamon, and harissa for some punch - could use a bit of cayenne pepper instead. I think it would be brilliant with Seville oranges.I always buy Bonne Maman - good price and nice - love the Cerises Griottes with a croissant.

A single duck leg too much for a portion? Nonsense. Two per person is about right.

I used to make marmalade professionally when I had an épicerie in La Vienne. I sort of kept up the habit so I order 15 kilos of sevilles a year and sell the marmalade for the benefit of our local church restauration fund. Luckily I have enough in stock to keep going this year.You orange chutney sounds great. I make with lime but have never made with oranges of any kind. I must try.As far as Bonne Maman. Marmalade is marmalade and that is as good as many on the market.

I live in the south of France and I have a small blood orange tree which had a good crop, but too sour to eat fresh and not very 'bloody' either. Not quite the right balance of warm sunshine followed by cold weather in January. So I made a really nice chutney with them, flavored with cardamon and cloves - just opened the first jar today after a month ageing. I bet it would be good made with Seville oranges too - since you already have so much marmalade!

I live in Brittany. I had ordered a case of Sevilles from my supplier but none arrived this year. Seems there was a problem with quality . Pity as foie gras duck as been in plentiful supply this year due to the Russian embargo.I have a supply of marmalade which will last me 20 years but will miss cooking with them fresh. I will have to eat my duck with my whisky marmalade and orange sauce.

interesting comment. I made the annual marmalade and while still 'good', despite using the usual recipe, it wasn't as good as usual, lacking a bit of flavour and tang.

This article would have been much better published at a time when Seville oranges are actually available in the shops. Its a very short season ( in my town, they're only available for two or three weeks in January, maybe into very early February ). 



Author::::Innowaybored
DateTime::::2016-03-04T17:21:04Z
The season is over so this is a bit late. The batch we bought were also pretty poor - not a killer marmalade this year like last which is a pity.
