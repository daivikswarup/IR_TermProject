<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">R</span></span>eading about rhubarb makes me love these vegetable stalks posturing as a fruit even more than I already thought I did. Siberian in origin, rhubarb as a medicinal rootstock made its journey west via passage up the river Volga sometime in the 16th century. Reaching Europe in or around the 1800s, gardeners in Britain and France were soon growing rhubarb for ornamental use. It wasn’t long before Queen Victoria had her very own variety cultivated in honour of her coronation. The gap in the northern European soft fruit-growing calendar meant rhubarb readily took off as a popular culinary ingredient.</p>

<p>Cooked into a variety of sweets from pies to fools to crumbles, rhubarb also makes excellent jam, jelly and cordial (syrup). For me, however, rhubarb really sings when served as a condiment for savoury foods. Made into a piquant relish or chutney, or roasted and served alongside some oily fish (soused or fried) or a roasted piece of pork, it’s fruity sour snap makes an intriguing match for so many flavours.</p>

<p>Whether you choose the bright-pink forced rhubarb (available between January and March) or wait until late spring/early summer for the outdoor crop with dark-green stems flecked pink or deep red, make sure to select firm, skinny stems with no holes or blemishes. Be sure to remove the leaves as these are poisonous and contain toxic oxalic acid, which can be harmful if ingested.</p>

<p>Jane Grigson, in her Fruit Book, writes of eating raw rhubarb: “Sitting with my sister on a doorstep, each with a stick of rhubarb and a saucer of sugar between us. We dipped and chewed, dipped and chewed in the warm sun...” A sort of sour-sweet lollypop: try this with any spare raw stalks.</p>

<p>1.8kg fresh rhubarb<br/>150g sugar</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Rinse the rhubarb and shake off the excess water. Trim the ends and cut into 2.5cm lengths. Put the rhubarb in a baking tray, sprinkle with the sugar and toss it all together, shaking the rhubarb out into a single layer. Cover with foil and roast for 10‑15 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Remove the foil. The sugar should have dissolved. Gently shake the tray and roast uncovered for another 5 minutes, until the rhubarb is tender and the juices syrupy. Test with a sharp knife; the rhubarb should feel tender and have retained its shape. The rhubarb will keep well for up to a week stored in the fridge.</p>

<p>Yoghurt lightens the muffin mix here and compliments the fruity thwack of the rhubarb. Stem ginger and its syrup is a storecupboard’s best friend. With a gentle spicy heat, ginger with rhubarb is a classic combination.</p>

<p><strong> Makes 8-10</strong><br/>240g plain flour<br/>160g golden caster sugar <br/>1½ tsp baking powder<br/>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda<br/>2 eggs<br/>4 tbsp plain yoghurt<br/>75g butter, melted <br/>250g rhubarb, drained<br/>2 tbsp stem ginger, chopped <br/>1 tbsp of ginger syrup</p>

<p> <strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Line a muffin tin with cases. Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder and bicarb into a mixing bowl.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Whisk together the eggs, yoghurt and melted butter, then add the rhubarb and ginger. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Mix briefly, but thoroughly, to combine.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Spoon the mix into the muffin cases. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and firm to the touch.</p>

<p>Roast pork crowned with proper crackling and stuffed with pink rhubarb. It is worth trussing the pork as best you can to secure the rhubarb stuffing in place. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Serves 4-6 </strong><br/>4 tbsp olive oil<br/>1 onion, finely diced<br/>A small handful of thyme, leaves picked<br/>2 tbsp honey<br/>2cm piece of ginger, grated (or 1 tsp ground ginger)<br/>50g fresh breadcrumbs<br/>500g rhubarb with juices<br/>Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br/>2¼ kg pork belly, boned, skin on</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes until completely soft. Tip the cooked onion into a bowl with the thyme, honey, ginger, breadcrumbs and rhubarb, season and mix well until combined.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Using a sharp knife or a clean Stanley knife, score the pork belly skin at 2cm intervals, then rub 1 tbsp sea salt over the top. Turn the belly over and season a little more, then lay the stuffing down the middle lengthways.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Roll tightly and secure soundly with kitchen string. Put the pork on a wire rack in a roasting tin, then pop it in the fridge, uncovered, for a few hours or preferably overnight, so that the skin dries out, the meat takes on the stuffing flavours and any liquid pools in the roasting tray, away from the piece of pork.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Set the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Rub the pork with the remaining oil and a little more sea salt. Roast in the centre of the oven for 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Turn the oven down to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and continue cooking for 2–2½ hours. If the skin hasn’t crisped enough by then, turn the oven back up to 220C/425F/gas mark 7 and crisp the skin for another 20 minutes, taking care to not burn it.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Remove the meat from the oven and leave the joint to rest in a warm place for 15 minutes or so before carving. Serve with soft polenta and steamed greens such as purple sprouting broccoli, for example.</p>

<p>Rippled pink and turned out to serve, this frozen pudding is as beautiful to look at as it is to eat.</p>

<p><strong> Serves 8-10</strong><br/>100ml milk<br/>200ml double cream<br/>1 tbsp rose water (not essence)<br/>½ tsp ground green cardamom seeds<br/>6 egg yolks<br/>120g sugar<br/>3 egg whites<br/>½ tsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice<br/>500g rhubarb, with juices</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Heat the milk, cream, rosewater and cardamom together until just beginning to boil. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for 5 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Beat the egg yolks and 60g of the sugar together with a whisk. Add the infused cream mixture to the eggs and sugar. Transfer to a saucepan and reheat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens like custard.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Strain the mix through a sieve into a clean bowl and leave it to cool completely. Transfer to the fridge for at least 20 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>4</strong> Meanwhile, whisk the egg whites with the vinegar until thick in a clean bowl. Whip the remaining 60g of caster sugar into the mixture.</p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Gently mix the rhubarb and its juices with the chilled rose and cardamom custard mix, then fold in the whipped egg whites.</p>

<p><strong>6</strong> Pour the mixture into a 20cm terrine dish lined with clingfilm, then put in the freezer for several hours until it has set.</p>

<p>With good ingredients such as these, it is really no more than an assembly job. Just be sure to make it look incredibly beautiful, which shouldn’t be too hard.</p>

<p><strong> Serves 2</strong><br/>A small bunch of watercress<br/>2 slices rye bread<br/>100g goat’s curd or soft goat’s cheese<br/>1 tbsp rhubarb per slice of rye bread<br/>6–8 radishes, finely sliced<br/>Salt and black pepper<br/>Olive oil</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Wash the watercress well. Toast the bread, smear half the curd on to each slice of toasted bread.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Halve the watercress and divide between the two pieces of toast, then add the radishes. Add a generous spoon of the rhubarb mix to each piece of toast.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> Season with a little salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Plate up and serve immediately.</p>

All excellent ideas but I'll probably still be sticking mine in a crumble :)

a recent discovery for me was that rhubarb goes fantastically with coconut. I made a rhubarb and coconut 'flan', basically a madeira cake base with a rhubarb jelly layer ontop and then a custard on that which was made with a hefty amount of coconut cream and then with toasted dessicated coconut ontop. it was delicious.
