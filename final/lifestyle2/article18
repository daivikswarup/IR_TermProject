Things I’ve learned in time for Mother’s Day




DateTime::::2016-03-06T06:00:26+0000



<p><strong>Bloody hell, I’m going to get a card. </strong>On Valentine’s Day I received a card from our one and a bit year-old daughter, covered in fingerprints. It read: “Thumbody loves you.” Her childminder had obviously gone to a lot of trouble. There were Biro smiley faces and heart-shaped sequins, and despite all that great stuff, I was a bit... thanks? Which is not to say that I don’t love her – the child (the childminder’s a nice lady with a cool bumbag, but we haven’t really got to “love” yet). Not to say that I don’t love the child so much that my life feels like an indie horror film, every 10 minutes another moment of shakily filmed terror, every fear tested until, half-bored, half-wired, a fresh shock alerts you to another nerve. I didn’t know, until I saw her almost slip on a staircase, that my <em>knees</em> could feel love. I didn’t know that when I saw her laugh with my own mother, it would feel like somebody was pressing the “refresh” key in my macerated heart. Cards are for us to give to mothers when we are no longer falling asleep on their necks, or screaming for them at night, for when we are no longer showing them we love them with our entire bodies. I have put it on the fridge though, because that’s what you do.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Cards are for us to give to mothers when we are no longer falling asleep on their necks, or screaming for them at night</p>

<p><strong>Everything related to parenting feels impossible.</strong> It starts with sex. Some level of cognitive dissonance is required to lie naked with the intention of having a baby, surely. The maths is wrong. From that to this – I’m not going to argue with “science”, but you know. It’s unlikely. That’s the first impossibility. The second is the birth. I heard myself talking about it recently, merrily chirping away about the hushed argument between doctor and nurse, the blood on the wall. I have a friend who has to get a different bus home from work because they will cry if they pass the hospital. Another who realised she wasn’t sufficiently anaesthetised during a caesarean. There are good stories, too, but far fewer. And this is partly because, of course, birth is something we haven’t quite worked out yet. Not properly. Even during labour I knew there was no way a baby could come out of me. Just because she did does not mean it was possible. It means there are grey areas. Though I’m only virtual seconds into motherhood, the impossibilities multiply. That I would ever sleep longer than two hours. Impossible. That she would ever fit into this cardigan. Nope. That a day will come when she looks after me. We move from one impossibleness to the next, only pausing for a holiday – candles on a cake, the giving of a foot spa. A reminder that another year of impossible things has been survived.</p>

<p><strong>How to say no without guilt.</strong> Since having the baby I’m better at knowing the limits of a day, a relationship, a holiday, a job, myself. It’s not just that I don’t have the time, it’s that I am now aware of how precious that time is, a full hour with only one thing to do. But for the three jobs or nights out I’ll skip, there’ll be one that I will throw everything at. I enter a pub as if walking into my own surprise party, shooting my zingers off liberally, covering the gossip in record time, home before the last tube. No makes it all possible.</p>

<p><strong>Judgment and competition around parenting cannot be extinguished entirely,</strong> merely noted in oneself, like heartburn, and managed. If only there was room to stick this reminder on my fridge between the bloody cards.</p>

<p><strong>When I shared a house in Brighton with four other people, </strong>if someone went upstairs alone we’d say they’d “gone to tidy their room” or: “He needed some me-time,” and it would always be funny, in that way that everything carries innuendo if you are 19 and nobody has died yet. Back then I had no idea I’d ever want time by myself. Myself is boring. But today I crave it like cigarettes. Yet any snatched moments alone are so precious and rare that they often go wasted - I stand in the kitchen, crippled by possibility. Much as I adore my tiny daughter, with a hard and wounding love, the best Mother’s Day gift she could give me is an afternoon without her.</p>

Don't be sorry, she thinks it's nonsense too.

Anna Jarvis, who invented Mother's Day, hated the commercialisation of the day and said "A printed card means nothing except that you are too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone in the world"

The countertop microwave oven was introduced in 1967, dishwashers have been around since the 1950s and Mother's Day was invented by Anna Jarvis in the early 20th century, but Mothering Sunday has been around sonce the sixteenth century. Constance Penswick-Smith created the Mothering Sunday Movement in 1914 in the UK, which merged the two days and it has been celebrated in the UK ever since

As you can see from my second response. I am not dismissing medical intervention when necessary. I am just saying it's used way too often as a routine where not necessary. The woman's body is amazing and in most cases able to birth a child without interventions.

As one of those mothers who probably would have died without medical intervention, and whose daughter definitely would have, I find your attitude dismissive.

Sorry for your mum. I'm in the UK, but one year we were in New York for US Mother's Day, and I got another present, without daughter getting any prompting from her dad.

Funny, I remember making Mother's Day cards at primary school in the 60s. Because after my mum died in 1968, I was told, 'Oh give it to your granny, then'. Way to miss the point...

Exactly which bit of "mothers day wasn't invented until 1982" failed to alert you to the comedy nature of the post ? You just missed the joke. Just accept it and move on. It's not a crime. Stop beating yourself up.

After reading the article I was so surprised by her attitude to her child and childbirth but then I -again-remember my mum wisely telling me that all women are not born to be mothers.

Isn't taking the mick meant to be actually vaguely amusing, though? As opposed to just sounding like a shit parent with a martyr complex?

This is the one benefit of having a dead mother. I can say I find Mother's Day quite upsetting (true) and my partner will take the kids to see his mother for a few hours. Win win.

Disagree clairebaby. I think women just never had a medium before to marvel at how crazily life-changing and enormous a shift motherhood marks in our lives. We might have marvelled in private to our own mums and grandmothers and sisters and friends, but the internet has magnified our voices - and to deny Eva the chance to express her own feelings on the matter is, in my view, sexist rubbish.

It is not mothers day. It is mothering sunday. An old celebration of spring and all things new and fluffy. Mothers day is offensive to women, it is commercial nonsense, never intended to be personalised.

I was surprised at her reference to 'the child'.But then it might be because she puts it in the same bracket as 'the' childminder and 'the' au pair.

Of course, nothing in life is preordained or guaranteed. When people write they often write of their own experiences, obviously there are many experiences in life to be had and how or what you do is up to each person.

Well my darling, I lost my Mum in 2000 and sometimes apropos of nothing (it happened a few weeks ago when I was cleaning the bath!) this overwhelming sadness will hit me and I just say aloud but in a very sad little voice 'Oh Mum...So probably never.And like the other poster, I've had big globby tears in my eyes all day for various reasons.Mainly because of things my wonderful son and daughter have done for me but also reading people's Facebook posts about their mothers, those still here and those that have passed on.How much heartfelt love and gratitude there is in each one.If there's that much love in the world it's not a bad place to be.

Hmm, that's a difficult one - funny, although I was curious about my birth parents, I never felt rejected by them as such, I just accepted that they (well, mainly my natural mother) just wasn't in a position to look after me. Your kids are a bit young for the moment, but I think your only option here is being very open about why they were given up for adoption, even if the details are not necessarily what they want to hear. I was about 18 when I first tried to trace my birth mother - it took a while, but I eventually got some info. Some of it was nice - I learned she'd given me a name, and hesitated a lot before giving me up - some of it less nice, in that I learned my 'father' hit the road the minute he found out about my birth mother's pregnancy. Maybe you could tell them that perhaps one day they can maybe find out the story for themselves and, in the meantime, they have a family, that they are loved and cared for and that's what's important for now? Easy to say, I know, but reassurance like this is important.

Your description is almost exactly how we have handled it. And it worked when they were younger but as they have reached 7 and 8 they have started to feel rejected by their birth parents. Is not a big issue all the time but it gets triggered by the almost total use of 'mum' when people mean parent. Even the Christmas panto had a big scene about how 'no-one loves you like your mother' which set them off for about a week.........

Dismissing someone's thoughts on childbirth as 'completely absurd' is invalidating and could be really hurtful. You could offer your own thoughts without belittling another's.

I was adopted and my parents explained to me that they had 'chosen' me because I was special and they knew I would make their lives very happy. I always imagined they had gone to an orphanage and rejected a load of other kids and picked me out especially (think I was in my teens before I realised that had probably not been how it worked!). They also told me my mum was very sad to let me go but that she wasn't able to look after me and she wanted me to have a better life. I don't know your kids' ages or the context in which they were adopted, but sometimes putting a certain positive spin on the whole story can help!

The church my mum and dad went to used to do flowers for all the ladies to thank them for being great mums, aunties, teachers, neighbours, it was all surprisingly egalitarian! I think they still do.

We adopted two children, and for most of the year it goes very well, but mother's day is a trial and a half.It is mentioned on the radio, on tv, in adverts, in shops, they did a week long spectacular at school, there are signs up outside pubs when you drive anywhere, even the cinema makes a big thing of it. And not just on the day, or in the week before, but all month.And our two children have got more and more tearful and withdrawn and questioning about their life and why their mother did not want them, as they see it.I wish it was less all pervading.

Hear hear. What a strange and nasty comment Oomph made to you! Birth should absolutely be approached with positivity and celebration. It is in the extreme minority it goes severely wrong. Love the positive birth story and any mother or woman-lover would happily advocate positivity around birth. X

That's completely understandable. It's been nearly 13 years since I lost my mum, and I still find Mother's Day hard. It does get better with time, but it never goes away completely, especially on days like this. Be patient with yourself and give yourself all the time you need.

You will be waiting until the next time they are free and you can visit and worry when you find them tired and stressed and raising children of their own, craving their alone time. The best mother's day gift of all is realising what you gave them.

The bit about childbirth is completely absurd. I think woman have figured childbirth out pretty well. Trust your body and your instincts. Don't listen to the horror stories. Birth should be surrounded by positivity and not fear-mongering...

Ha! Our son and daughter never manage to produce two cards in the same year It's either one or other, or neither, since they were teenagers, though the grandchild's cards are the most welcome. I don't mind, as they are here regularly to visit us, so that is the important thing.

I lost my mum (who was my best friend for more than 50 years) just four years ago from Alzheimer's. It never feels better. But I try to remember the good things,not the 7 years of increasing hell. I'm crying as I type this, but some tears are good tears, and its only right to honour the love we have for the women who gave us life, love and so much more. You are a mother, so honour yourself and the gift for mothering she gave you. Buy flowers and candles for her, and enjoy the them yourself, for her sake.

Most importantly, make sure the glitter and sequins are liberally sprinkled on the flowers and the breakfast from the card you've put on the tray. Watching mummy eat a glittery fried egg makes it so much better. "Go on have another bite ... don't you like the breakfast the kids have made for you" ... this will be a new tradition. And don't worry, I will get payback on Fathers Day ... so it all works out.
