Cheryl and One Direction’s Liam Payne spell out their LOVE




DateTime::::2016-03-11T08:07:39+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> busy week for the formally post-surname Cheryl, whose new relationship has been released to critical fanfare. A collaboration with One Direction luggage Liam Payne, its unveiling has been masterfully managed via a series of carefully placed stories, teasing tweets, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCdQbw-wpF_/">faux-coy Instagram posts</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly, some hearts have been broken – Aung San Suu Kyi was said to have been spitting chips when she saw Liam <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCsxB9mg1d_/">caption a photo</a> with the words: “Happy International Women’s Day to my favourite woman in the world”. But that’s showbiz, and she knows it.</p>

<p>Even so, Cheryl and Liam do appear intent on literally spelling things out for their audience. Wednesday night saw the couple hit the town for their first formal paparazzi two-shots, with Cheryl sporting a necklace featuring the word LOVE in giant letters. And why not? It’s always arresting when a celebrity vertically integrates into providing their own picture captions.</p>

<p>We’ve seen it before, of course – Victoria Beckham wearing a BORED OF THE BECKHAMS T-shirt, or a clearly troubled Britney Spears being forced to promote her IN CONTROL perfume. But Cheryl’s giant neck caption forces a reordering of the various stages of celebrities telling us Where They’re At. This progression now reads:</p>

<p>1. Sledgehammer jewellery.</p>

<p>2. T-shirts.</p>

<p>3. Wrist tattoos.</p>

<p>4. Fragrances.</p>

<p>5. Lawyers.</p>

<p>6. Tattoo sleeves.</p>

<p>7. Repeat.</p>

<p>Publicists and stars are instructed to update their records accordingly.</p>

Irony, I hope.

The tattooed arse, the 10 minute marriages, the assault charge, the cooing at Cowell, the forgettable solo career.

I think you are right about needing to step away. Wouldn't want to attract any virtue-signallers, would I?

And so, unable to neither recognize nor accept that her particular 10 minutes of fame has now concluded, we are witness to yet another desperate attempt to remain in the public eye.Cheryl, take a lesson from all the other non-entities that tried to outstay their welcome and have been left broken. Leave it alone now and retire somewhere quiet while you still have some ( small ) amount of dignity left.You are blindly ambling dangerously close to Kerry Katona, Daniella Westbrook territory.

Marina, there's a much more interesting One Direction story you could cover - the fans, including professional journalists, who think Liam Tomlinson's new baby is just an invention to get publicity / keep him in the closet (delete as preferred). Apparently it's a doll in all of his Instagram photos ...

who cares?? .......hell, if nothing else this story is a distraction from the maelstrom of 'real' news aka the EU referendum, war in Syria/Ukraine, more cuts to public services, the junior doctor's on going battle with an intransigent Jeremy Hunt, the self destruction of the Labour Party........so, though I real don't give a damn about Cheryl and her latest beau, (recognising this is all a PR stunt anyway), it does help me detox a little for the hell that is the news at the moment.

The tattooed arse, the 10 minute marriages, the assault charge, the cooing at Cowell, the forgettable solo career. And yet she's hoisted on a pedestal.

Don't be fooled people. While I can tell Liam is a nice bloke he is severely lacking in charisma which will be a problem if as expected he makes an attempt at a solo career. He was the 'grandpa' of One Direction (the boring one) ..This showmance is nothing but an attempt to make him more interesting and keep him in the public eye. It should give a boost to Cheryl's pitiful solo career also. I suspect Mr Cowell had a say in arranging all this.
