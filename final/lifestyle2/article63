Ask Alys: which flowers can I plant on a damp grave?




DateTime::::2016-02-20T06:00:41+0000



<p><strong>Can you suggest anything I can plant at my mother’s grave? The ground is exposed and waterlogged. </strong><br/>I can quite understand that you want her grave to look loved and cared for. You don’t say whether the ground is waterlogged all year round, but I am going to assume that it remains damp all year.</p>

<p>Cemeteries tend to have a lot of wildlife, which means plants do get munched. <em>Vinca minor</em>, the lesser periwinkle, will survive anywhere, though you may have to give it an annual trim in spring. It has lovely lavender-blue flowers and will flower from April through to September. And it won’t be nibbled, and will look after itself.</p>

<p>If there aren’t too many rabbits or deer, you could also try primulas, such as the giant cowslip, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/13757/i-Primula-florindae-i-(Si)/Details"><em>Primula florindae</em></a><em>, </em>which has scented, nodding sulphur yellow flowers. If it’s happy, it often self-seeds, and it’s tough enough to cope with being planted in grass, as long as you remove some of the grass around it so it can establish. There are a few other primulas<em> – </em><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/13785/i-Primula-japonica-i-(Pf)/Details"><em>P. japonica</em></a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/90564/i-Primula-prolifera-i-(Pf)/Details">P. <em>prolifera</em></a> and<em> </em><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/13860/i-Primula-pulverulenta-i-(Pf)/Details"><em>P. pulverulenta</em></a> – that like damp conditions, but you may need to remove some of the grass in order for them to establish. And they won’t like to be in full sun all day long, unless the ground is very damp indeed.</p>

A Danish friend told me that fritillaria were planted on Viking graves, and they like the damp.

Laburnum is a hardy plant and produces bright attractive blooms. It is also lethal to any fauna that may wish to munch on its delights - as evidenced by the large number of dead rabbits lying around my grandparents' grave when I visit to tend to it.

Snowdrops have grown very well on my parent's (also) waterlogged grave, and they don't get eaten by the bunnies as everything else I have tried has. Gives hope each spring.

You might want to check, if it's in a graveyard or cemetery, that you are allowed to plant anything!

Ligularia "The Rocket" thrives in damp soil and looks spectacular when blooming. Great big leaves give it a tropical look.http://www.perennials.com/plants/ligularia-the-rocket.html

Just make sure you get vinca MINOR, and be prepared to trim it back if it spreads.. Vinca major can race out of control.

The Arum Lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) would make a tasteful graveside plant for damp conditions. Astilbes perhaps too.

Siberian iris could be lovely as could monkey flower (mimulus). Seems odd that you can grow much on a grave but must be local regulations. Anyway, there are many native species as well that could do well.

Belladonna likes damp soil.
