How can I help my adult son cope better with chaotic meal and bedtimes?




DateTime::::2016-03-04T15:00:38+0000



<p><strong>I am writing after returning from a week’s holiday with my son, his partner and their two children, who are both under five.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I have been concerned for several years that their management of their children’s sleep and meals is chaotic, causing all four of them a great deal of distress. Having recently seen it under the same roof, I am at my wit’s end to know how to help them or how best to cope myself. I know holidays are stressful but their daily routines were already very fragile. </strong></p>

<p><strong>There was a scene on holiday when both children refused to eat their high tea, my son exploded with rage, some china smashed on the floor, the children howled and their mother took them away to bed where they all immediately fell asleep. It was disturbing to witness and afterwards I absented myself from earshot of their mealtimes. I get very tense just watching their mother offer them large pieces of chocolate shortbread and/or large quantities of milk within an hour or less of their high tea. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Both children still drink large quantities of milk first thing in the morning before breakfast, before bedtime and mid-afternoon. They have to be coaxed to eat solid food at breakfast, are given snacks all morning, pick at lunch, and then there are further crisps, chocolate, cake and milk in the afternoon. They are given their main meal at 5pm, which is mostly thrown away.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I am wary of trying to talk to my son – he has been dismissive of mild comments I have made in the past, and I have a polite but distant relationship with his partner. I do not know how to help without provoking a breakdown in my relationship with them but feel I ought to do something more constructive than arranging to absent myself from mealtimes. I love my grandchildren dearly and get on well with them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Both adults are very sleep-deprived and my son has a demanding job. He is irritable, surly and subject to temper outbursts when frustrated with the children. His partner is more placid but also falls asleep at odd times, leaving my son to cope. They seem stuck.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The children are clean and healthy and their parents intelligent and otherwise competent.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can I help my son handle his frustrations and negotiate small changes (not the enormous task of reforming their whole regime) and how should I accomplish this for myself? </strong></p>

<p>It’s immensely frustrating seeing people making life more difficult for themselves, especially when they do the same thing over and over again. I agree that giving unhealthy snacks before a meal every day seems like insanity. But sometimes people do that when they are seeking short-term solutions to problems they are too exhausted to deal with.</p>

<p>I’m sure you remember how tiring being a parent is, especially in those early years when sleep deprivation can be really acute and you’re finding your feet. You often can’t see the wood for the trees and lose perspective: you simply don’t see that changes to the way you handle things might change outcomes. It does take a brave person to say “maybe you need to do this differently” and the advice, though well meant, is hardly ever well received when from a family member.</p>

<p>So, even if you were bold and said “don’t give the children huge snacks before dinner”, it wouldn’t make it happen. Being on holiday is a weird set up anyway – is it indicative of how it is in their everyday life, do you think?</p>

<p>Deirdre Dowling, a child and adult psychotherapist who has worked extensively with children (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.childpsychotherapy.org.uk/" title="">childpsychotherapy.org.uk</a>), says: “Under-fives are full of difficult, powerful feelings – we can almost forget what it was like.” She feels the key may be if you can give practical support. “Lower your expectations and offer [your son and his wife] practical support.</p>

<p>“No one can think when they’re emotional and no one can survive without sleep. Could you offer to look after the children for a weekend, say, to give your son and daughter-in-law a break? Are you worried about your son?”</p>

<p>If you are – beyond the children’s routines – could you spend a bit of one on one time with him? It doesn’t have to be for very long, and you shouldn’t try to prise open how he feels. But if he feels connected with you – safer – he may open up a bit more. Does your daughter-in-law have her mother around? I agree that your son seems highly strung but your daughter-in-law may well be depressed.</p>

<p>I think the way forward is to support the parents as best you can to enable them to parent to the best of their ability. Concentrate not on the children’s routines or lack of bedtimes, but on your son and his wife.</p>

<p>If things get heated and frantic, don’t sit there in silence, don’t absent yourself from the room – these responses can come across as judgmental and uncaring. Instead, say, “How can I help?” That is a great phrase: kind, empowering, helpful and it puts the parent in charge with you as ancillary. You may also be really surprised at the response.</p>

I don't think people understand how temperamental parents can be devastating to a child, they just do not stop and think about how they are scaring the child and if it is regular then it is emotional abuse

You wouldn't want to go on holiday with someone who was actually capable of anger?I presume you holiday alone then.

Have you ever brought up children?If so, have you done this without ever losing your temper even once?

Indeed it is rather harsh, but is just as likely a possible explanation of the facts as the version presented by the complainant. Which I think was the point.

Or perhaps he is like this because he is sick of his chaotic home-life, badly behaved children and incompetent wife? I know no-one wants to face up to this as a possibility, but it could actually be true.

Do nothing. Don't leave at meal times - it's an implied criticism. Stay in the room and make no comment, no expression, no nothing. You are permitted to move the china out of reach. In private you can go as far as to offer sympathy and tell them how difficult it is. Offering advice will start an argument or at least provide fuel for a simmering resentment.

As the parent of a one year old and constantly having to smile and nod and criticisms from my own mother, don't start any conversation with "I used to do it like this", "that's not going to help", "why are you doing that?". Giving your son, or daughter in law, a chance to talk and perhaps asking how they feel about the current feeding/bedtime etc would be far more productive. Offer simple help and support and if its accepted then work out detail.

I wonder whether the other adults even remember the holiday mealtime scene that the OP recalls as having been 'disturbing to witness'?

Are you sure it isn't just when you are around? I find having my in-laws very stressful, they are lovely but they need feeding, there are extra dishes, the children play up it is awful. Our house is very similar, I often fall asleep with the children, it's my favourite time of the day - all quiet but cuddling up. I agree helping is good but don't take over or offer advice, just do the simple stuff cook meals, take the children to the park when dinner is being prepared. Clean up, eat quickly. Fit in, I find my in laws think they can follow their usual routine instead of slotting into ours.

That's not high tea, that's afternoon tea; after a funeral, however, it's called 'the wake'.

She said herself she gets tense watching them eat foods she disapproves of at times she disapproves of. Would show on her face no doubt.

Exactly, I have tea every day after work. I'm northern. High tea usually involves a mushroom picking trip into the Pennines in November (well, it did when I was a young un)

I have 2&4 year olds. We almost always sit down to dinner at the same time each night and my four year old will sometimes eat with us, ranging anywhere from a few bites to a full adult sized meal, or refuse to eat. Two year old always eats solidly whatever is served. We don't make a big deal out of it and leave his plate on the table, which he often comes back to later when he's hungry. No one knows your kids better than you do. Grandparents can come in and judge a situation without knowing the years of day-to-day back story that has led to certain behaviours. Sometimes parents can't see the forest for the trees but sometimes they just deal with their odd little people the way that works for them.

Because judgemental grandparents speak volumes without saying a word sometimes. It is really not fun having someone watching you deal with a tantruming toddler with an air of 'I could do that so much better than you' about them. And from her letter she's not just concerned, she wants to save them all from the horrible mistakes she thinks they're making, which in fact are probably minor details in parenting while on holiday.



Author::::ForestFolk

"...they are otherwise competent" - so you basically think they are incompetent parents. How judgemental. There is not much more irritating than someone hovering over your parenting with the attitude that they know better than you. You will only alienate them further if you continue on this way.

there is nothing worse than a part time family member swooping in to tell everyone what they are doing wrong. If you don't live with the kids 24/7 you don't really know what its like. 



Author::::mamarama
DateTime::::2016-03-07T09:15:36Z
I know they are clean and healthy because the OP says so. I just checked, and the phrase 'clean and healthy' is still there. You obviously didn't read the article, and just came straight below the line for an argument



Author::::mamarama
DateTime::::2016-03-07T09:13:56Z
Who said he smashed it? The OP doesn't state who smashed it. It was more likely the kids who knocked it on the floor. (And why are kids this young being fed off china?)

I don't understand why my comment was inappropriate when I affirmed how common the approach to parenting in the paragraph about the routine was! Bizarre...

How do you know they're "clean and healthy"? Do you personally know these people?If they're being fed junk food and milk instead of proper meals, then they probably aren't all that healthy.

You have had an easy ride from most commentators here because, honestly, you are the problem. You are manifesting expectations, passive aggressively criticizing and you have failed to build a relationship with your daughter in law over a long period preferring to act as an all knowing superior and smug with it. You shouldn't have written them up for the Grauniad either. To improve things take the kids out for a few days to Legoland and enjoy them as they are instead of being judgmental. If that works takes them to Centerparcs for a week and loosen up, you might gain from it.

What is wrong with mother and son spending time together occasionally. That's pretty normal. Not devisive. I don't know one person who doesn't enjoy one on one with their parent. It also may create a positive time to talk without granny getting terribly distressed about excessive milk drinking and biscuit eating. Only devisive if you chose to it that way. Partner doesn't have to keep pretending to nap either !

You're assuming that it was the mothers presence causing the rage. Which is possible, but I find it fairly unlikely. People tend to make an effort when others are present. The fact it was on holiday is not really relevant, it was only a week.

The issue would be if this was a one off or very occasional outburst or something more regular. If it's the latter the the father (and mother) would need some support.

I can't see much here that's passive aggressive... in fact she admits to saying and doing virtually nothing. Why does everything that's not overtly aggressive have to be passive aggressive. Can't she just be concerned, embarrassed and wanting to help?

Why do you feel the need to pick at someone because of the words they use? I don't know if you have any older people in your life but some of them do use terms which aren't used by the younger generation - and vice versa.

'see your son on his own for supper occasionally' - this is so divisive it made me gasp. And I am tough.

You can not win with some grandparents because the issue is not really the routine, eating or what ever. Its deeper than that.



Author::::emmajordan
DateTime::::2016-03-06T12:49:20Z
I think the grandmothers passive aggressive criticism may have caused the pressure on the holiday which caused the loss of temper.

Good Advice. You will not get a second chance to get this relationship rightSupport your sons choices, offer practical help to ease the stress and respect their choices.

Its a holiday ! so what if they have a biscuit or milk. Jesus some of you need to see real poverty, abuse and deprivation that many children in this country live in.



Author::::emmajordan
DateTime::::2016-03-06T12:39:46Z
or even better let them stay at yours and respect the parents by actually giving them a break not using it as yet another opp to criticise by changing the routine.



Author::::emmajordan
DateTime::::2016-03-06T12:38:52Z
No do not give this advice. Everyone knows this is what is suggested to parents of young children. Offer to help practically. Babysit, have the children to stay, pay for a cleaner, an ironing service. Make some frozen meals.

The point is, is it not the granny's business. The children are not at risk. Its cultural.



Author::::emmajordan
DateTime::::2016-03-06T12:28:00Z
yes she should come to help not as an expert super nanny service. Just give the parents a break and take the children away and stick to their routine.



Author::::emmajordan
DateTime::::2016-03-06T12:25:45Z
Its what US/UK british all inclusive holiday firms give children so that the children can eat early and then go to bed (usually unattended) so the adults can have a proper meal. Its an utter nightmare and would never happen in a normal European resort.
