The problem with ‘unfriending’

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">H</span></span>aving a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/17/how-to-rehabilitate-a-stalker">stalker</a> can be a living nightmare: preying on your mind every waking minute, but hard to prove to the police. And social media, where everything and everyone is just a click away, may be making things worse. Most Facebook users will have felt the urge to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/20/facebook-stalking-your-ex-online-take-a-break">browse an ex’s photographs</a> or look up an attractive acquaintance. Taken to extremes, however, this kind of behaviour can have similarities with stalking.</p>

<p>While celebrities Noel Edmonds and Alex Jones were in the news this month after suffering at the hands of stalkers, the vast majority of similar cases do not attract any media attention. Even the police can be oblivious. Out of the spotlight, thousands of ordinary people experience what has been described as a form of psychological rape.</p>

<p>Take the case of Frank Mendoza, who booby trapped his ex-girlfriend’s car with acid bottle bombs designed to explode when she turned the ignition. His relationship with her began in 2008 in Florida, but rapidly became abusive. He once broke into her apartment and covered her bed in newspaper while she slept, then threatened to burn her alive unless she agreed to resume their relationship. When the victim fled to Connecticut, he began a campaign of harassing and threatening phone calls to her and anyone who knew her.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">There is evidence that the incidence of various forms of obsessive love is increasing</p>

<p>Mendoza then followed her across America and planted bottles of hydrochloric acid in her car. But when the victim later approached her car, she detected signs that it had been tampered with. Mendoza was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2014.</p>

<p>The reasoning in some stalker’s minds appears to be: if I can’t have you, then no one else can. Rejection leads to narcissistic rage when a need for control reveals a fragile ego.</p>

<p>Possessive desire means the other person becomes an object to be owned and controlled. Adolescent love starts out possessively, yet this can also reflect a quasi-religious mindset which views women as chattel. But men are stalked, too, and the incidence of various forms of obsessive love might be increasing.</p>

<p>It may be that modern social media encourages fixation. Before the internet, when you broke up with someone, it was difficult to “follow” them or uncover what they were then up to. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook">Facebook</a> ensures that it’s tough to avoid being confronted with how quickly your ex-partner is getting on with their life. Many may find this painful or provocative.</p>

<p>In an attempt to understand fixation in the internet age, we have undertaken the first prevalence study of online stalking in Britain. We surveyed 4,000 people to ascertain the answer to, among other questions, whether cyber-stalking is a new phenomenon or simply another tool in the stalker’s armoury. The disturbing results will be released in collaboration with anti-stalking charity the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.suzylamplugh.org/">Suzy Lamplugh Trust</a> during National Stalking Awareness Week in April.</p>

<p>The chief constable of Durham has spoken out about forces being swamped by complaints of online harassment through social media which are putting a strain on their resources. There is a pervasive sense of uncertainty about how to respond to what is depicted as a “new” problem.</p>

<p>Yet at the heart of any doomed fixation has always been a failure to grasp that romance requires us to ignite desire in our lovers, rather than just seeing them as a vehicle for our own longing. Thanks to the internet, however, perhaps passion means learning to let go as well as adore.</p>

I don't agree with that. For example, if I buy a product at a store that is defective or I am unsatisfied with, i should be able to contact the store and try to resolve things. How ethical would it be for the store to just hang up on me. If I call back, the store just hangs up again. The store refuses to respond at all.

I agree to that. The street goes two ways sometimes.

While not advocating murder as a solution to every stalker if I was being followed by someone so determined and well, bat-shit-crazy as Mendoza and the police and courts were powerless to prevent him going away, a kill or be killed approach would be the only way. Bit harder in the UK where self defence is basically illegal.

what you just described is a 'feminism thing'? (nup)

Well, yes. Stalkers are by definition unstable. Be they male or female.

Agreed, in some cases the accusation of 'stalking' seems to be motivated by vindictiveness, out of a wish for attention or to harm reputation. There can also be a lack of emotional intelligence or consideration for the other, a selfish unwillingness to contribute meaningfully towards reaching a mutual resolution of feelings.

I think they put the wrong title to the article. No doubt there is an article somewhere about the perfect chocolate roulade entitled: "The Roll of the Stalker."

You cannot and should not try to force someone to listen to you, to explain themselves to you. And if you do try to keep getting them to listen to you or to explain why they left you / don't love you anymore, you are bordering on turning into a stalker. It is painful not knowing why s/he left you / doesn't love you anymore / doesn't want to talk to you. But it is their right.

As a feminist, I have to kind of agree with you. Stalking laws or threats of stalking charges is used to squelch free speech now. Also if someone breaks up with you, and you call them like twice to resolves things, now you are stalking them. It's silly.

This is a millennial, 3rd wave feminism thing. They can abuse you verbally and when you try to make your point they say 'you're harassing me and I'm ending this conversation. '

Doesn't unfriending an ex help prevent you from stalking them? Or not actually stalking but getting maudlin and resentful over pictures of them having a good time without you which isn't really the same now is it?

That is what the Hide posts / Unfollow but remain friends settings are for. Personally mine is employed whenever someone posts that turmeric cures everything or quotes Linus Pauling on cancer more than once.

One thing I think we have done nowadays is exaggerate the idea of stalking. Now if you try to make your point to someone, you are automatically "stalking and harassing" them.

I felt robbed of a conclusion at the end of this article, as it sort of teetered off into 'writer's indifference.'

Not a very well written article ... a meandering stream of consciousness that could not hold a line of reasoning ... using physical stalking as his only examples of cyber-stalking ... I suppose infomercials are less about content and more about revenue

This article does not do anything like what it says on the tin. What is the problem with unfriending? I have no more idea than before I read the article. What, if anything, is being done about it, and by whom? Dunno. Does unfriending encourage online stalking or vice versa or neither? No wiser. In fact the term "unfriending" does not appear in the article at all. It appears that somebody has just randomly created the headline because something like "Social media facilitates online stalking" is obvious and sounds boring.

worse, the new jumper they just bought from Harrods for their chihuahua. No wait worse, look what a great mum I am, I just baked this cake! Look what a great mum I am I just placed a coin under my daughter's pillow like the tooth fairy. Look what a great mum I am I just did somethign normal that the rest of you do without boasting abotu it on facebook. Those people. No doubt boasting on facebook now about a great mother's day they're having.

Very misleading headline. I thought it would offer help to those wishing to rid themselves of 'friends' who post inspirational quotes from will smith and pictures of deformed people in India.

You jump from unfriending and looks at an ex!s profile online to acid attacks and lump them together as one. Very poorly written and researched piece.

The article has nothing to do with unfriending. .. another poor headline.
