<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>mazing greys! What are they? No, don’t tell me – the walls are Spitalfields Shroud, marvellous, that absolutely contemporary but completely matt been-there-for-ever thing? No, then that’s got to be Ruined Flesh, with the paintwork in English Corpse eggshell – the darker one, of course: the lighter Corpse comes out horribly yellow. Cornice and ceiling both Tamoxifen? Thought so, that’s such an amazing warm grey, with the underlying lilac. Without being remotely pink, that’s the beauty of it.</p>

<p>I don’t know if you’ve seen an entire wall done in Sackville White, God knows how they call it refined. We did the hall without testing, came out looking like a bordello, took three coats of Broiled Cod to cover it up, lesson totally learned. Now I wouldn’t dream of repainting a room without proper preparation. Six months, minimum, alternating natural and artificial light through the seasons, though it took nine to get the right grey for the nursery bathroom – Mildewed Pancreas, kind of chalky rain cloud with a hint of internal organ? The perfect east-facing grey, now that Filthy Sludge is such a cliche.</p>

<p>Yes, a lot of people think Pancreas is too blue, but that’s only on a winter morning, or twilight. Mostly it’s this wonderful, almost-neutral-but-not-quite grey, and it goes with everything – we’ve got Tinker’s Arse on the floorboards, this deep, almost murky grey, then Brassiere on the dado rail, with Dog’s Breakfast underneath, an intenser grey with an almost fathomless quality, that’s once we stopped trying to get it colour-matched. Joke! I know, never listen to a professional decorator unless you want to go insane, especially not with greys, the pigments are so critical, but try telling them. I said to ours, listen, if you just want something washable you can see your face in, be my guest. </p>

<p>Personally, I don’t want to live in a dishwasher, plus grey won’t be in for ever, who cares about hardwearing if we’re redecorating in two years? You know the real secret? If a paint goes on brilliantly, and doesn’t mark when you look at it, don’t touch it with a bargepole.</p>

As a decorator, this is not parody. This has been my life for the last three to five years. ....that’s once we stopped trying to get it colour-matched. Joke! I know, never listen to a professional decorator unless you want to go insane, especially not with greys, the pigments are so critical, but try telling them.
