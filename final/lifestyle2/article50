Redrawing history: the feminist cartoonist putting women back in the picture




DateTime::::2016-03-07T16:07:05+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>s with many good ideas, Jacky Fleming’s started with a Google search. Having watched a documentary about “genius men in New York’s art scene in the 50s, with no mention of any women from start to finish”, the feminist cartoonist Googled a simple question: “Can women be geniuses?”</p>

<p>And, as with many Google searches, she was met with a lot of nonsense. Most memorable was the response from Charles Darwin, which Fleming summarises as: “Women are at a different stage of evolutionary development, so genius is a biological impossibility for them.” His proof? He’d <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.icr.org/article/darwins-teaching-womens-inferiority/">made two lists</a>: one of all the eminent men he could think of, and another of all the eminent women. “He chose,” argues Fleming, “to turn a blind eye to any possible reason why women might not make it onto his list.”</p>

<p>So she created a book of cartoons that, she hoped, would not only be funny, but would also lay bare the “enormous effort that has gone into maintaining the illusion that women are somehow less able than men”. She wanted to show that “the internet is new but not the trolling, that the misogyny we find so shocking in other cultures is not so different here.”</p>

<p>Her most recent book, The Trouble With Women, is her seventh and was published last month. Her first published cartoon was about a girl trying to understand what it is that society wants from her – it made it into an issue of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/spare-rib">Spare Rib</a> in 1978. Her cartoons have also been published on postcards, which “travelled the world, pre-internet” and have a “much longer lifespan than you’d think, like giant turtles”.</p>

<p>For this book, she has been reading up on the brilliant women largely left out of the history books – “I didn’t discover them, obviously, but it seems what historians have discovered isn’t making it on to the school curriculum.” From the first female doctor, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/21/medicine.mcelhone">Margaret Bulkley</a>, who disguised herself as a man in order to study medicine, to activist <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.guardian.co.tt/columnist/2015-02-26/claudia-cumberbatch-mighty-woman">Claudia Cumberbatch Jones</a> who, in a bid to counteract racism in Britain at the time, established what would go on to become the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/nottinghillcarnival">Notting Hill carnival</a>. And architect <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/elizabeth-wilbraham-the-first-lady-of-architecture-2215936.html">Elizabeth Wilbraham</a> who it is now claimed was centrally involved in designing many of the churches attributed to Sir Christopher Wren.</p>

<p>For Fleming, it’s not just about those one-off women we hear about from history – the Florence Nightingales and the Joan of Arcs. “Ironically, the exceptional woman myth keeps us believing if there had been any others they would have been mentioned,” she says. </p>

<p>Fleming wanted to retrieve women from what she calls the “dustbin of history” and try to redress the imbalance we are often taught“Depriving girls of their history is control through lowered expectations,” she says. </p>

<p>Looking to history feels apt for someone who, as she puts it, has lived “through two feminist waves” and whose way of thinking has been changed by that process. “I witnessed the first [wave] being dismantled,” she says. “Things don’t just move forward, they also unravel backwards again.” </p>

Erm. No, I don't believe he did. Your point?

Don't really agree. If women are absent from history books because not documented at the time, then it's going to be challenging, centuries down the line, to get information about them. If, on the other hand, they are absent from the books because they were being kept in the roles of mothers and out of education, then there's not much we can do about that tragic waste of potential talent, bar making sure it doesn't happen ever again.

You're obviously new to this planet. Welcome! Can I suggest Google as a route to a getting caught up quickly on the basic facts of the social history of humanity?

When we think about Darwin looking around and seeing a lack of female genius, and drawing the conclusion that was down to the fact that women were simply not as bright as men, it seems obvious to us now that the lack of education and the effect of social limitations for women was the explanation for that.

We are not 'far better suited to the real needs of the world'. We are the female half of a social, sexually reproducing species. Both sexes breath air, need water, food and shelter, and are thus equally suited to life on this planet. The world is an inanimate object which has no 'needs'. It is us who have a need to keep the world in a state that suits us.

Once upon a time, when the world was young, God was female. It was a retrograde step when God became male.

It is not self-evident that changing the gender perception of God was a retrograde step. Early societies worshiped multiple gods, male and female, and a lot of nasty things were done on behalf of both.

Women have contributed though history, but many were denied admittance to universities at the time or were not honoured for their work until hundreds years later after their death, and so they are not part of the known data base, unlike men in history. There is Ada Lovelace (born 1815): chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer. There is Hedy Lamarr, a hollywood actress from the 1930s-1940s, who co-authored with George Antheil a a radio signal that would jump more or less randomly from one frequency to another, making it harder to jam. This was the earliest form of spread spectrum communication - today found in most digital devices that communicate wirelessly (ie. wi-fi). These are two interesting one I like. There are more but space is an issue.

Women can indeed be geniuses. My sister is a proof of it. I don't even know why the Guardian is asking this question.

Once upon a time, when the world was young, God was female. It was a retrograde step when God became male. Let's not forget that. Perhaps we shouldn't try to compete with men since they've made such a mess of the world that they have shown their unsuitability for the task of running it. Away with the absurd idea that we have to imitate men to be equal - we are not equal, we are far better suited to the real needs of the world. It doesn't worry me in the least that men seem to be more creative in certain ways. Too much of that sort of creation may turn out to be a bad thing.

Women have always contributed as much as men in our history. The respective roles and responsibilities may have changed over time but there has never been any justification in the suggestion that women have been "kept under" by men.

Huh, I thought there'd be some information in here about a bunch of genius women or something. Nice drawings though.

I heard Jacky Fleming being interviewed on Women's Hour and pre ordered 3 copies. Laugh out loud funny text accompanying fabulous drawings of women with small heads...we are such delicate creatures.

If he had done needle work it would surely have been the best of all time. You see, chaps naturally excel more than the gals because they do not waste time on, um, idle banter.

The cartoons and extracts are priceless. Thanks for making me laugh. I especially loved the cartoon about Darwin choosing his eminent men. And your joke about why women fail to make it much into history books is brilliant. Congratulations on your achievement.

I'll look forward to this - looks witty and interesting and might even include a few surprises (dare I say it may include matter which purports to be surprising but probably is not...)

Jacky Fleming, brilliant idea and funny! I love the artwork. I'm going to read your book.
