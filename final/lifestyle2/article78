Kanye and 50 Cent go for broke




DateTime::::2016-03-11T07:00:27+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>ntriguing developments in rap beefs, which move in a radical new direction. Time was that hip-hop stars might taunt each other over money, with each claiming to have more than the other – a fact likely to be reflected in better cars, better jewellery, better hoes … better garden implements in general.</p>

<p>Back in the day, Messrs 50 Cent and Kanye West were engaged in just such a face-off, as album launches in the same week saw them engage in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://visionthought.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/50cent-vs-kanye-rolling-stone-cover.jpg">wallet-to-wallet combat</a>. To the richer go the spoils.</p>

<p>Today, the virtual reality dojo in which they meet could not look more different. This sort of flash swaggery now looks impossibly passe. Though Kanye and Fiddy have yet to formally engage with each other on the subject, both are hugely anxious to stress how cash-poor they are. Although not quite the hip-hop version of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1a1wHxTyo">Monty Python’s Four Yorkshireman sketch</a>, we are certainly moving into an era that might be captioned “Bitch better have my negative equity”.</p>

<p>In the case of Kanye, you may recall that he recently took it upon himself to announce that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698699904303132672">he was $53m (£37m) in personal debt</a>. In the case of Fiddy, he is keen to foreground similarly parlous states. Indeed, he is formally <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3484560/LIAR-LIAR-50-Cent-admits-never-owned-Africa-mansion-stacks-cash-poses-just-props-make-sure-keeps-P-M-P-image.html">required to do so by a Connecticut bankruptcy judge</a>. And contrary to what subsequent social media pictures of him posing with bundles of cash might indicate, he stresses to this judge that he does not have so much as the proverbial 50 cents.</p>

<p>Yes, he will concede that he put up a picture of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/sep/10/50-cent-shows-off-his-new-house-bankruptcy">his new crib “in Africa”</a> near the end of last year, but he stresses that no such African crib exists. “I do not own, nor have I ever owned, any real property in Africa,” he insists. “If I did own any property in Africa or any other real properties, I would have disclosed them as required by the Bankruptcy Code.” As for the wads of bank notes – which in one ironic masterstroke had been arranged to form the word BROKE – Mr Cent would like her honour to know that these are pretend. As his lawyers put it: “The cash depicted in the social media postings is not real. The postings, which among other things, make use of stage or prop money, are part of the debtor’s routine social media marketing activities and relate directly to the debtor’s various business interests. Prop money is routinely used in the entertainment industry, including in movies, television shows, videos and social media postings.”</p>

<p>Were that not poignant enough, Fiddy is keen to stress that he is so poor that posting pictures of toy money is one of the significant means by which he generates real money. As he reasons, via his legal team: “Cold-turkey withdrawal or abstinence from social media would, in all likelihood, be commented upon negatively in the entertainment media and result in damage to my brand and earning capacity.” Very much hoping he will explore this condition in a forthcoming album entitled something like Look Rich or Die of Embarrassment.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we must turn our attentions to Kanye, who places his personal debt at $53m, explaining to the world: “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/699308024792371200">If I spent my money on my ideas</a>, I could not afford to take care of my family. I am in a place that so many artists end up.”</p>

<p>Like various notables before him, Kanye declares: “I wanted the world to know my struggle.” (Then how about writing a $10 book entitled My Struggle? There must be at least 5.3 million ironists who would buy a copy of the German edition.)</p>

<p>Admittedly, his wife did claim this week to be <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/kimkardashian/status/707077609964699648">“transferring 53m into our joint account”</a>, but the suspicion must be that Kanye wishes to place himself on a more independent footing than one underwritten by the Bank of Kim.</p>

<p>Not that he is against bailouts. In fact, the sense that Kanye is simply too big to fail was my takeout from a series of tweets he posted shortly after the debt ones, imploring Silicon Valley bigwigs to invest in his “ideas”. These ideas remain tantalisingly unspecified, though the past few days of tweeting alone have yielded such standouts as: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/707705291056541697">“I don’t personally like suit jackets any more”</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/707707222390906880">“I believe that Kim is our modern day everything”</a>, and the peerless <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://">“super-inspired by my visit to Ikea today”</a>.</p>

<p>But back to his plea for financial intervention. Lost in Showbiz would argue that what is taking shape is nothing less than a new theory of celebronomics: a theory that argues that an entirely free Kanye West market is not the most beneficial model for society. Yes, you can hope that the billionaire private sector plays a part. But governments have a responsibility to intervene at various stages in the cycle in order to provide the shared goal: full Kanye. Thus, far from encouraging thrift in a downturn, the state should actively encourage spending on <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/kanyewest">Kanye West</a> products.</p>

<p>I hereby christen this theory Kanyesian economics, in honour of its leading thinker, and implore governments across the world to subscribe to its principles without delay.</p>

Making broke cool. Its the in thing today. Must relate to hopeless millenials with full beards, blocky glasses and no hope of making a decent income.

I used to think 50 Cent was a real twat until Kanye came along .Now 50 Cent is a real stand up guy compared to King Twat .

Fiddy really is broke. Kanye simply has a good publicity machine. His PR team are very good and they show a lot of pomo irony... it makes them tons of cash too.

Honestly, I read this article and I simply could not understand anything. It's written in English, yet any time they were quoted or something was explained about their life, the words had absolutely no meaning or sense whatsoever, which I imagine is very similar to their lyrics.

if you look at the shitshow involving the Tidal only release of the new Kanye album, the loony excesses of the the Madison Square launch, the last album sold approx 1.5 m WW ( not exactly Adele, and set against prodigous spend) it's apparent Kanye's financial challenges are likely to be very real , mad or not

Kanye's mad and losing the plot, but 50 Cent is trying to avoid having to pay compensation of sorts to a lady who was in a sex tape he released without her permission.

Kim will leave Kayne in 2016. First, he's gay, now he's broke, it's too much to handle.

At least they've both had fun, lived the dream if you will. They could have followed the British rock star route - buy a farm in Surrey and occasionally contribute to the dramatic rise in the price of classic Ferraris.
