Are we all too tolerant of our differences now?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span> recently read <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2015.1110195#.Vt14R2ThByo" title="">a survey on the impact of growing up in an LGT family</a> (no bisexual children participated) taken from the perspective of children who were now adults. Although the sample was small – 13 women and one man – the results were striking. None of the individuals felt they had been damaged by the experience per se (although some felt that the prejudice they suffered may have had negative outcomes). On the contrary, most felt it had left them more inclined to be open and accepting of others’ lifestyles. Most emphasised that they were “normal”, just like any other family – pointing out that many families experienced difference of one kind or another, and that love was more important than sexual orientation.</p>

<p>None of this surprises me – rather, it heartens me – but what struck me about the survey was this suggestion that normality was a form of virtue, even from those people who, from a traditional societal perspective, do not fulfil that definition. Children – most particularly adolescents, from the survey results – value the idea of being normal even when from a sociological perspective they are atypical. Normality is a quality to be aspired to, if only as a feeling or a self-definition.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">No one really stands out. Gay and straight people look much the same</p>

<p>I bring this up in a wider context, that of the urgent desire of young people to be thought of as normal by their peers. I speak as someone who has always felt different – even though I grew up in a traditional nuclear family – partly because I am <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/i-owe-everything-to-the-nhs-7286728.html" title="">facially scarred</a>, partly because I had middle-class aspirations in a working-class background.</p>

<p>Things differ today. In the 60s and 70s there was a strong impulse to be different as a statement, in open defiance of the strictures of so-called normality. “Normals” were looked down upon by anyone who considered themselves hip or fringe in character. Punks, goths, new romantics, skinheads, suedeheads, greasers all emphasised difference from the herd (even though they had strict rules within the in-group). By belonging to one of these groups, you were counter-normal, and took a pride in it.</p>

<p>It was easy to be “‘deviant” then – and desirable. To have long hair and wear earrings – as I did – was enough to make you a provocation to your teachers and society at large. But now normality has become more of a demand, and stricture, than ever before. Whenever I see a large group of adolescents, I am struck by how uniform they seem. No one really stands out. Gay and straight people look much the same. Yes, some might have body piercings and tattoos, but these are now pretty much mainstream. Normal is the new normal.</p>

<p>A gay friend once told me he preferred it in the old days, when being “other” was transgressive and interesting, when it represented a real counterculture. No one wants to go back to the time when homosexuality was so strongly stigmatised that it forced countercultures to generate in defiance. But I know what he meant.</p>

<p>Soft social liberalism – embraced, nominally at least, by the Cameronian Tories – is now so widespread that difference, in a strange way, is disappearing (although admittedly some of the LGT children were bullied because of their difference). But the rainbow society, where pretty much anything is acceptable, is getting closer every day.</p>

<p>Who can say that this is a bad thing? However, I have a faint nostalgia for difference – of rebellion, if you like. In a world where everyone is accepted, individuality itself in some strange way is diluted, because where everyone is an individual, no one is an individual. Heterogeneity becomes a form of homogeneity.</p>

<p>I sometimes think that children and adolescents have lost the ability to shock – at least in interesting cultural ways, rather than by violence or bad behaviour. Yes, we all accept difference now as normal. But that might be another way of saying that difference is dead. There’s much to celebrate about that – but also, perhaps, something to mourn.</p>

Hahaha, true, there's that. I work with college students all day, and every time some 20-something calls me 'sir' a hair turns grey.

There's few things more depressing than finding out your bank manager or boss used to be a punk, it merely underlines how much of teenage rebellion is just for show and the ageing process will trample over that urge soon enough

Thanks for that. What do you think about the actual point of the article which is are we all normal now?

A 'survey' - of 14? Hardly 'scientific' is it? What a joke!

I have a scar on my face and I loved it as a child. But I suppose it depends how bad the scarring is.

Oh I don't know about the comment of children not being able to shock. I was quite shocked yesterday to see a schoolboy (12-14 range) puffing on one of those vapour things. I just didn't understand it.

What Mr Lott is missing in his observations is the massive societal transition from collectivism to individualism that started in the late seventies. Although acceptance of individualism - often in tandem with levels of narcissism - has led to a far more tolerant society, we have also lost much of our ability to unify for a collective good . Pretty much all the social taboos that can be legal have been accepted as mainstream. I presume there is nostalgia from people that really had to fight for their right to be different before the eighties, and who feel somewhat peeved that a form of social trangression as powerful as visible tattooing, that literally used to mark you out, and often proscribed your life chances, is now just an everyday fashion accessory.

Tim, have you ever considered that teenagers aren't performing their appearance for your benefit? There are plenty of differences between them, they're just not visible to you.

In the 60s and 70s the rebellion against the norm was a demonstration that you weren't going to follow in your parent's footsteps. That you would shape a new world.When you're in the situation that you won't have the opportunity to follow in their footsteps if you wanted to.. well.. seems a bit pointless to protest. What you doing to do, drop out and take a service job?

There's few things more depressing than finding out your bank manager or boss used to be a punk, it merely underlines how much of teenage rebellion is just for show and the ageing process will trample over that urge soon enough. So woolly beanie hats off to my son's generation for not trying to artlessly rebel simply by dressing one way, or growing their hair out, getting piercings, tattoos, whatever. Been done, it's a beginners' guide to rebellion, you're shocking no-one.

I'm amazed that he took the slightest notice of their "outrage and disappointment". Young people used to be made of sterner stuff! Now, I'm sure I remember my Dad saying something along those lines, and probably my Grandad too .....

Its not about being different or being uniform, its about pretending to be different superficially, or just accepting you're just another randomer whose opinions really don't matter. I dress how I want and see who I want but i'm still just some guy.

Ha! There was a lad I was at school with who had similar parents who joined the Young Conservatives. It caused shockwaves. I only realised later he was probably the most rebellious kid in the year...

Yes, some sound points there. We have friends in their late fifties who are liberal, relaxed, ex dope-smokers who moved on from hippie culture to work in the caring professions. They were aghast when their son told them he was thinking of giving up his job and joining the RAF. Once they had registered enough outrage and disappointment, he quietly gave up the idea.

Maybe it's harder to shock because the audience has changed?
