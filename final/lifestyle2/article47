Why I love... Rihanna




DateTime::::2016-03-12T06:00:09+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here are many ingredients that go into the recipe that cooks up a great pop star. It’s all alchemy, of course, but the one thing you can’t ever fake is that elusive X factor. I want to look at a pop star and be excited – and no pop star on Earth serves up excitement quite like <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/rihanna" title="">Rihanna</a>.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Barbados, before a record deal brought her to America, she had an iconic haircut, released the song of 2007 (“<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvBfHwUxHIk" title="">ella-eh-eh-eh</a>”), <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/25/rihanna-chris-brown-sentence" title="">survived domestic violence</a> and released ever more glorious pop music.</p>

<p>What sets Rihanna apart is the feeling that she could burn everything to the ground if she had the notion to. In a world of carefully packaged music stars, that unpredictability is thrilling. It means we can overlook less than flawless vocals and focus on what she’s good (no, great) at: being fabulous. It helps that Rihanna is stunning; she’s like a cat you desperately need to like you, and she moves like one, too. Her nails are always long and manicured, her top lip on the verge of curling into a pretty-girl sneer or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/58SmGlhMxY/?taken-by=badgalriri&amp;hl=en" title="">smile</a>.</p>

<p>Then there are the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/rihanna-tattoo-goddess-isis-grandmother-369030" title="">tattoos</a>. My favourite is the under-breast one of the goddess Isis, because it’s beautiful, and its placement is just so Rihanna: maximum, in-your-face impact. She’s the embodiment of fun – the cool older girl you gawped at in the loos at school, and wanted to be.</p>

<p>I haven’t stopped playing <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/28/rihanna-anti-one-to-scare-casual-fans-first-listen-review" title="">her new album</a> (God, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/27/rihanna-work-first-track-anti-featuring-drake" title="">Work</a> is sublime) and am struck by how much she sounds like a woman on a mission to define herself. And while we might not know exactly who she is just yet, isn’t it wonderful that someone this dazzling exists in the pop landscape right now?</p>

I would say he is culturally aware.

Ah yes. The under-breast tattoo of the Godess Isis. So Rihana. What on earth would we do if Rihana didn't exist?

Don't forget her encouragement of domestic abusers. So brave, so in-you-face.

Maybe change the headline to: Why I love... Being an idiot.

Do wish that she would sell her voice and not her body. Tired of her nakedness and over raunchy videos. Give me the Rhianna that started out just dancing in a disco in her videos instead of doing soft porn.

I did wonder who was buying her painful howling.

Rihanna is an 8 time Grammy winning singer who is the best selling digital artist of all time in recording history and is the best selling singles artist of all time in the UK. She has topped BBH100 14 times, making her the artist with the third most #1 singles in the history of the chart (Only behind the Beatles (20) and Mariah Carey (18)). She was honored as a fashion icon by the CFDA and was the first artist to be honored with the AMA icon award. She is the first and only artist to have surpassed 100 million RIAA certifications. Her album ANTI, released in January 2016, was certified RIAA platinum in under 14 hrs, and is the fastest album to go platinum in history. She holds the record for the most VEVO certified music videos. Her album "LOUD" is the best-selling album by a black artist from this decade. She ranks #8 on the list of best selling music artists in recording history and is the only artist that debuted in this millennium to feature on the top 10 of this list. And these are just few of the many achievements that this 28 year old has achieved in her 11 year old career. Any questions?

I read it three times. Then I went back and read some previous columns. Then I checked out the author. Nope - I give up.
