We used to have long-distance dirty talk but, since I banned it, the spark has gone




DateTime::::2016-03-07T08:00:58+0000



<p><strong>My husband and I married two years ago after two years of a mostly long-distance relationship. This meant we engaged in sex chat and dirty talk. I had some problems with that, but finally accepted it as something specific to the time and mood. But then he moved near me, and I forbade any dirty talk. Since then, he has had a low sex drive and we have sex maybe once in three months. I really need it but he does not.</strong></p>

<p>It was wonderfully creative of you both to develop such an exciting, non-contact sexual style while you lived apart – it’s a pity it stopped. The art of erotic conversation often thrives in long-distance relationships, and it is partly the obstacle of distance that enhances the spark.</p>

<p>I understand his sense of loss – which may have led to his lowered desire – as well as your longing for an exciting physical connection. However, what you originally established as your usual form of lovemaking cannot be changed overnight. Try to be patient, and focus on accomplishing a smoother transition. As a bridging mechanism, consider initiating some sex play that is similar to your earlier style: you can still make an erotic call, even if you are in the same house.</p>

<p>Once he he is erotically motivated again, you can introduce different, full-contact scenarios, led by your own fantasies. There are many ways to reawaken the spark between you, and I am sure you can forego the stereotypical notion of what constitutes “normal” sex to thrilling mutual satisfaction.</p>

"any people seem to be insisting she keeps doing something she's uncomfortable with because her husband likes it. Seems very unfair to me."

There's a difference between discussion and forbidding something. One may lead to compromise and resolution. The other is emotionally damaging. Is that difficult to understand?

That comment is entirely gender neutral, the inferences from the letter are entirely yours. in fact it could be said that more of men have behaved like that. its probably how most relationships that end in domestic violence begin. Your baggage mate.

Many men and women attempt to change the rules once they are married, usually with disastrous results.

It's not nice to change the rules once you are married, but you are not the first man or woman to try to do that. Usually, with bad results.

I wondered about the neutral phrasing of "we have sex maybe once in three months". How does it happen, when it does? Does she initiate it? Does it happen spontaneously? If she asks for it does he simply refuse (whether graciously or otherwise)? Just waiting for it to happen isn't a very good strategy, though I can (very well) understand how being the only initiator becomes something of a turn-off after a while.

Getting married is a big commitment to being partners. You can't start off by forbidding stuff. What were you thinking?

And Worser, I think it's often used by rank hypocrites, or at least people with a low self-awareness let's say (not so long ago I had a close encounter with a man who was Total-Porno tm and he refused to use the more vulgar term for the aforementioned 'love-making' it made no sense to me at all).

It seems to me this is less about the talk than the long-distance ending. When you lived apart, how often did you have sex? It is a huge shift to go from a long-distance relationship, where every meet-up is exciting and fresh, to a relationship where you see each other more often. I am also concerned about the use of the word, "forbade". Relationships work on communication and give-and-take. While it is completely fine for people to have "hard limits" of things they are not prepared to do sexually, it doesn't sound like the sex talk was one of the OPs as they were happy doing it for some time. It sounds like there are more serious issues here than just whether phone sex happens or not, which may be helped by some professional counselling, or at the very least some open and honest two-way communication.

Sex once every three months? I know, I have heard about 'low sex drive/s' (or to be more accurate read about it in the Guardian) but surely the woman be asking some questions here of her spouse? Without wanting to be paranoid ... I'd be thinking he's sexting and more some other lass while he's saying he's too tired with her.

Why do people who are obviously sexually incompatible keep getting married? They caused their own problem.

Apparently wanting to have sex with your husband more than once every three months makes you a scheming prude. Lol, ok



Author::::MARK MANNERS

It seems clear that the OP's husband has decided on his own ban: all sexual contact on a three-month cycle. I would say it is as preposterous as the OP unilaterally banning this or that category of their sex, except it appears to be out of his control, whereas her action was conscious. The OP needs to consider initiating discussion about the relationship. This will have several benefits, increased intimacy being one, of which dirty talk is a form. It is quite possible that he feels intimacy has been brutalised and is not sure how to rub it better, so to speak. Her being more open will possibly initiate more (necessary) openness in him; he might be reactive to her positive initiative here, he certainly was to her negative one.

Author::::ID5335033

It seems she holds all the cards, banning part of their sexual behaviour simply because of logistics no longer called for it. There's nothing sexier than anticipation, seating, dirty talk, your own secret sex language keeping the fires burning until you can be together. My husband and I always have this sexual banter going, even if we're in the same room, a double entendre, a look, texts, phone calls when we're apart, it creates intimacy and longing and is vital in our relationship. Even if half of it is akin to a carry on film! Lighten up I say, if you want to increase his sex drive let him hear what you've got planned for him.

This sort of talk/texting etc is common to many relationships, I don't think it's anything to be ashamed of in fact it can be a good way to find out if your partner shares similar tastes to you...

In my case, he was very loving and attentive until I moved in and then he did everything possible to not be around (after working 24 hours at the fire station he would go work on houses with a friend, or going on long bike trips with his brother).

Actually the real issue is that she probably didn't tell this man that she didn't like it because if she did tell him, and he did it anyway, and then she married him then she screwed herself. If she didn't tell him and she has a valid reason for hating it then she screwed them both.. Hopefully he can get over it and they can live happily every after.

Brilliant! Doing something you don't like to stay with someone then being surprised that things change when you stop doing it is just what has been getting men and women into trouble since romantic love became fashionable. If you are no longer prepared to do it then it was a compromise you shouldn't have entered into in the first instance. If he likes racy sex then marriage is probably going to be disappointing in the long run. There are many consolations of course.

It's more than he likes it though. It seems he can't get turned on any other way according to the OP so he should have warned her about that.

You've taken away a lot of the intimacy between you, and haven't left him a replacement. Maybe he's longing for that intimacy. Be very careful, he might go looking for it elsewhere.

Well, no. He says he likes something. Assuming he only likes it when he's away is not very clever? Why would he not like it when they are together? It's not so very unusual?

I was in a long distance relationship starting about five years ago then one of us moved to the same city and we're now married. I don't believe you can overgeneralize this. Communication was good in our case.

It's seems a great shame that you didn't realise how much the sexy talking meant to your husband. You say you have 'some problems' with it, but were obviously able to over-ride these and engage in it while you were far apart; he seems to have more than just 'some problems' with the lack of it, in that sex apparently becomes something he doesn't want without it. Maybe some compromise would be possible? Maybe you have certain things you'd love him to do which he isn't at all sure about, either - a bit of give on both sides would be good, but for that to happen you're going to have to talk about it in a non-combative sort of way.
