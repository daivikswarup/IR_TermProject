Is the Sunday roast over – or just getting posher?

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen historians come to pinpoint the decline of British life and its once great institutions, they may not look at the death of the NHS, or the demise of the BBC, but something more imminent: the day <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pub-chain-wetherspoons-to-scrap-roast-dinners-a6899781.html">Wetherspoons served its last roast dinner</a>. That would be this coming Sunday, by the way.</p>

<p>To judge by the reaction on social media, it is a sad state of affairs, and one which even the pub chain’s spokesman doesn’t seem to understand: “It would make more sense to say sales [of Sunday roasts] are plummeting therefore we decided to take it off, but it’s not the case in our pubs,” says Eddie Gershon. The pub company updates its menus a couple of times a year. “Some meals go on, some come off, and the company decided they wanted to concentrate on their core menu that they serve throughout the week, rather than one specific meal that is only served on a Sunday.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/mar/02/how-to-eat-roast-dinner">How to eat a roast dinner</a> </p>

<p>“I was surprised because I would think they are popular,” says Chris Wisson, a senior food and drink analyst at Mintel. “The main reason must be because the profit margins are not huge.” He points out that Wetherspoons sold a roast for about £7, which included a drink. “There is not a huge amount of profit there for them to keep doing that.”</p>

<p>Is the roast dinner dying out? It could well be in decline in British homes. Spending was down on all roasting joints in the year to January 2016, according to figures from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, with chicken (5.5% down) and pork (13.2% down) faring the worst.</p>

<p>But Wisson doesn’t believe the pub roast is dying out. Instead, he says, we are seeing the rise of the £10+ roast. “[Pubs are] using better cuts of meat and more premium ingredients. I don’t think we’re going to see lots of pub companies following Wetherspoons because all the trends are pointing to food being a really profitable way of boosting sales.”</p>

<p>The Sunday lunch at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theponyandtrap.co.uk/">Pony &amp; Trap in Chew Magna</a>, which recently came second in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/pubs-and-bars/the-top-50-gastropubs-in-great-britain/">a list of the best gastropubs</a>, costs £26 for two courses. “It is reflective of what we are paying for our produce,” says chef-owner Josh Eggleton. “Our beef is local and so are lots of our vegetables.” He loves a Sunday roast and does all he can to ensure his customers enjoy theirs, even though everyone seems to have a different opinion on what constitutes a good one “because it’s such a tradition, they grew up with it. I have strong memories of eating Sunday lunch at my nan’s house. Everyone does it differently.”</p>

<p>Restaurants, too, are offering high-end roasts. The steak restaurant Hawksmoor was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/17/ofm-awards-best-sunday-lunch">awarded best Sunday roast by Observer Food Monthly</a>. “We take Sunday roasts really seriously,” says founder Will Beckett. “I think people want, with restaurants increasingly, something that is beyond what they can make at home.” There isn’t a decline, he says – it’s the opposite. Next year, Hawksmoor is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2016/01/hawksmoor-to-open-in-world-trade-center/">taking the traditional British dinner to the United States</a>. “We’ll be doing a roast there and seeing if we can make it work.”</p>

ukslmer; true, lifestyles do differ and I will not make a value judgement on that. What I do remember was the bond between my father and I due to the Sunday/Saturday ritual. I am just saying this was a precious time that I remember, also with my grandparents too. I cannot reinvent or recreate it, but it was important. I have just come back from London and mother being alive I have also had a taste of home that one does miss - especially away. Everyone has circumstances. Just it is good to enjoy something personal if one can.

I don't doubt your point. Because of my wife's profession and mine, we have been obliged to dine out more times than we have cared for. Its been part of our job and fine, only very rarely we have felt bad about the food. I'm talking 5* hotels, rather than carveries, but of a standard, I have no hesitation to admit. Even 'spoons, I am sure have tried to do well within whatever limitations they have, including making a profit, so I am (unlike many) not knocking the institution. There is a difference in cooking large scale. It certainly can be done well. Sunday Roast is the taste of home. It is nostalgic. It is greater than the sum of its parts. There are restaurants I enjoy and can and do wonderful things, even if it is on larger than family scale. Sunday roast is something else; the taste of home... HOME!

Someone has to stand up for animals and I've taken the conciouse decision to do that and I feel all the more smug because of it. No amount of high handed manner by me comes even close to being as socially unjust as the killing of even 1 animal, so I will take everything that you and everyone else can throw at me and continue to speak out against ridiculous articles joyfully discussing the happy smiley loveliness of cooking dead creatures

Being in Q8 might have something to do with it. A maternal great-grandfather went out to South Africa pre-1900 and my grandfather was born there. I imagine times have changed. Still like the Durban Sharks though.

There's many a good carvery nation wide cooking roasts for thousands every Sunday for under a tenner. Many are pretty close to home roasts - 'spoons unfortunately we're never that good at it.

There's no "should"; people's lifestyles differ. I've lived over 3 hours' drive from my parents ever since leaving school. A home cooked Sunday lunch has always been a pleasure when the family gets together, but that's only a few weekends a year.

I beg to differ; I believe it is both. In any case (for me) eating is a social habit so the family/social/sharing habit is as important as eating fine food prepared with care. Even if I have coin in my pocket, if I am on my own for any reason I lose my appetite and that does not apply to Sunday lunch only. I am passionate about cooking, food, food history, but I can only... only eat, or at least feel any enthusiasm for eating with company.

Had a splendid 3 course lunch the other Sunday at our local Bistrot Pierre here in Torbay. The cost for three of us came to just over £45 including drinks and the food was very edible indeed with good sized portions and beautifully cooked vegetables. Pricewise, this was excellent value with a great choice of food at every course.

Yes, yes.... but I believe 'spoons is cooking for more than one family and on, if you like, an industrial scale. There is a point where normal home cooking methods do not work and then what works for 20 covers is not the same as catering for a hundred or multiples thereof.

I live alone, but I do enjoy a roast lunch with all the trimmings. In order to do this, I buy large joints and cut them down into smaller ones which I wrap and store in my freezer until needed. This means no waste and a delicious Sunday lunch complete with homemade gravy.

Absolutely! As my much better half and I frequently work several evenings in the week, we tend to cook a large roast (usually) so we have left-overs to sustain us in the week when we get home late or tired. Nothing is grim if prepared with a little loving care. Shepherd's pie probably has a bad name because of industrial school or so called TV dinners, the bane of my childhood anyway (the school variety - my mother never bought pre-cooked meals). Prepared with care shepherd's pie can be lovely and rise to a high level.

While I never shunned pubs since (I can date it!) the day of decimalisation. Sunday family lunch was a ritual that has never changed. I would meet my friends at all times, Sunday lunch was sacrosanct, even during my twenties. When my father was alive and before I worked abroad, the ritual would start on Saturday when we knew what was to be cooked and a fair time would be spent deciding which wines would be selected for the following day. Apart from wine being something of a hobby for my father, it was also a bonding thing, the decent to the cellar and a discussion as to what was to selected for the morrow. DeeBuzz does paint a lovely picture, and surely that is how the picture should be; no?

Nonsense about time and loss of skills! Both my wife and I work, both of working 'anti-social' hours because of our jobs (that we love). We have a maid, but both of us cook with pleasure. The maid is for washing and cleaning. I imagine, because of eating well as a child, somehow I absorbed how my mother and grandmother cooked and once I started cooking it developed into a passion. My wife tells me I inspired her, though I think she has a natural talent and its in her genes (her brother and two nephews are chefs). We tend to slightly overcook on weekends so there are plenty of leftovers for the days we are working in the evenings. Its a simple matter of passion and planning.

Suggest you buy Welsh lamb online. Not only the quality is excellent, but 850 gr. of boneless shoulder goes a long way. I am not a great lover of lamb, but (not just because its St. David's Day) last Sunday's roast made many meals, so it was economical as well.



Author::::Albert Harvey Pincis
DateTime::::2016-03-01T18:23:24Z
Yes... and last Sunday I cooked Welsh Lamb for the family lunch for my mother and my son. It was exceptionally nice too. I can also add it is a pleasure to have three generations around the table enjoying the food, the wine and most importantly the company. This took place south of Watford as it happens. Back in Q8 Friday dinner takes its place (different weekend), but the same principle applies.

I do roasts periodically but on a Saturday evening. That way I can crack open a bottle of something appropriate, use some of it in the cooking/gravy making and then spend the rest of the evening consuming the rest of the bottle.

I love the idea of going out for a Sunday lunch, but the reality is so often disappointing. It's the one dish that most people could cook better themselves (especially if there's a few of you helping out), rather than paying over £20 each for with a couple of glasses of wine for some bland, overcooked meat and boiled veg. I understand if you've got kids, or simply can't be bothered because it's Sunday, but personally I'd rather go out for something I couldn't cook on a Friday night with the money I saved by cooking (and drinking) with friends on Sunday.

Cooking an entire Sunday lunch can be a right hassle, particularly if there's only a few of you. I agree though that pub Sunday lunches can be a bit bland, certainly something you can cook better yourself at home if you've got the time.

Who goes to a restaurant to eat something that simple or familiar? Restaurants are for adventures in food or for meals you haven't the time to go home for.

There may be a growth of £10+ Sunday lunches where the place are using better ingredients, but theres still a lot of lunches made up from frozen veg, packet gravy and burnt meat being charged out at £10+ as well, its almost as if some places think they are guaranteed to be full on a Sunday so why make any effort, I avoid eating out on Sunday to avoid the bad roast dinners.
