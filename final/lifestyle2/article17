What does your favourite colour say about you?




DateTime::::2016-03-06T06:00:26+0000



<p><strong>Look at the four colours above and then decide which you like best. If you chose…</strong></p>

<p><strong>Red:</strong> You’re a winner: extraverted, outgoing, impulsive and athletic!</p>

<p><strong>Blue: </strong>Although sometimes rather fussy, you have good taste, and enjoy the best in clothes, food and wine.</p>

<p><strong>Yellow: </strong>You are an idealist, and are great at thinking through problems before arriving at a logical conclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Green:</strong> You are freedom-loving, outspoken and…</p>

<p>…I can’t go on. Although there is no shortage of experts prepared to read your personality off your colour preferences, it’s all bunkum. The best-supported theory is that how much a person likes a particular colour is determined by their feelings towards objects that are always or usually that colour. In fact, if – like University of California psychologists Stephen Palmer and Karen Schloss – you ask people to rate 200 or so objects for how much they like them, you can predict 80% of the variance in their colour preferences (a figure that is almost unheard of in psychological research).</p>

<p>To take an everyday example, people who love the sea and the sky are more likely to choose blue as their favourite colour (the most popular choice) than are people who love parks and plants, who obviously plump for green (not far behind). And the reason you’ve never met anyone whose favourite colour is brown is simply that few of us are fans of mud, rotting food and dirty nappies.</p>

In classic colour theory green is still a secondary colour and I for one cannot see why this should be wrong all of a sudden. The RGB theory is strictly digital. You would not be able to get yellow with, say , mixing oil paints together, but you still can get green by mixing blue and yellow.

I've never understood the principle of a favourite colour. If my favourite colour is dark purple, it will not be my favourite colour for the living room wall. Surely it depends on 'what for'. Favourite hair colour: auburn. Favourite colour for clothes: turquoise. And so on.

If people supposedly do not like brown why do so many people fill their homes with stuff that is every shade of brown from beige to mahogany? It's so dull.

Lately under pressure caused by obstacles and excessive burdens. Does not relish having to face any more demands, because lacks enough strength to continue struggling. Longs for peaceful, restorative comfort, and needs to be spared and treated with consideration.

I was advised this on two occasions. We were also told that windy days, the full moon and a week of wet playtimes made the kids wild. I can safely say it's true.

Well, the three systems for defining primary colours using modern colour theory are CMY or RBG. Assuming we're using RBG, the three primary colours are red, blue and green NOT yellow. These are the three lights that are mixed together to make your tv or computer picture.

Who says you cannot wear pink? Yes you can! I see you in my mind, flaming read hair, fair skin and a dusty pink silk shirt! perfect. The combination of red and pink is quite classic and looks great. My mother also said I could not wear blue and green together - what nonsense!

My preference for colours is very seasonal, browns and dark reds in autumn, greens and yellows and cerulean blue in spring, dark and icy blues in winter and all sorts in summer. I so totally fit into the theory! My all time favourite colour is the 'International Klein Blue'

Heh? Why is green not a creative colour and what actually IS a creative colour?My art teacher once pointed out that green is the only secondary colour that is always perceived as 'green', no matter of either content blue or yellow.

The implication, on my reading, is that object preference explains the variance in colour preference. But the causal relation could surely be the reverse.
