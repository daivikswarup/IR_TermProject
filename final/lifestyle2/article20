Everything but the groom: why I faked my own wedding




DateTime::::2016-03-05T10:00:01+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span> lie awake in my hotel room in Kyoto, nearly 6,000m from home, my stomach in knots. My mind is racing with thoughts of my wedding tomorrow. What if I can’t go through with it? I take a deep breath and tell myself I don’t have anything to worry about. I can’t be stood up at the altar, because the person I’m marrying is myself.</p>

<p>The solo wedding is a growing trend in Japan: young single women getting dressed up as brides and staging a bridal photoshoot. “You are single and you don’t know if you would be able to get married and have a wedding ceremony in the near future,” suggests the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cerca-travel.com/english/tailor-made-kyoto-taxi-plan/kyoto-solo-wedding-experience-tour/">Cerca Travel website</a>, which offers this experience, “but you would like to have some pictures of yourself in a wedding gown or in a gorgeous bridal kimono now, when you are young and beautiful.”</p>

<p>Like many of the women who use the service, I am a self-proclaimed spinster. I’m 42, and while all my friends are married or in long-term relationships, I sort of forgot to do it myself. In my late 20s, I thought I was dating the man I would marry but, while he was working abroad, he broke up with me abruptly and with no warning. It was nearly 13 years before I had another relationship.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">I look in the mirror and can’t help catching my breath. I barely recognise the radiant, elegant woman in the mirror</p>

<p>I used to think I was single because I lived in New York City during my 20s and 30s, where single women outnumber single men. Or because I travel so much for my work as a photographer, and men don’t want to wait around for a woman who is off globetrotting. But I have many friends in New York in the same industry as me who have managed to meet, date and marry a man. Meanwhile, I enjoy sleeping on whichever side of the bed I choose (though I barely move an inch at night), eating cereal for dinner most nights and doing whatever I want, whenever I want. Sure, I enjoy the company of a man once in a while, but I’d rather just borrow a friend’s beau to help me put up shelves than be in a full-time relationship for those kinds of perks.</p>

<p>I’ve watched many friends get married, but I never thought I’d have a wedding of my own. Now here I am in Kyoto, awaiting my big day.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Yukiko Inoue has been running Cerca Travel for 10 years. She is a 48-year-old divorcee whose main business is to arrange packages for Japanese women who want to travel alone in Europe and feel safe. Two years ago, her colleague, 37-year-old Natsumi Akai, expressed interest in having her photos taken professionally in a wedding dress and the solo wedding was born. Since then, 130 Japanese women have paid Cerca ¥380,000 (£2,500) for a two-day package, including a dress fitting, hair, makeup and a photo shoot – in short, everything except the actual ceremony.</p>

<p>On the first day of my solo wedding package, I am met by Natsumi Akai at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ayumi-net.co.jp/">Ayumi Bridal</a> dress shop. Natsumi is tall, slim and strikingly beautiful. She tells me she has had many relationships and was once engaged, but called it off because she realised that if she were to get married, she would have to quit her job, and she didn’t want to do that. For her, the solo wedding was all about the dress.</p>

<p>“For Japanese women, the wedding dress is a symbol of beauty and being beautiful,” Natsumi explains. “In the story books I read as a child, there was always a princess in foreign countries. For me, getting married and wearing a wedding dress are totally different things. I wanted to wear the dress without getting married.”</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, have never fantasied about wearing a wedding dress, and feel slightly nervous as Natsumi leads me into a private fitting room lined with poufy white gowns. But trying one on, I am shocked. I look in the mirror at the tightly bound bodice and I can’t help catching my breath. I barely recognise the radiant, elegant woman I see in the mirror. Sensing my amazement, Natsumi smiles. “Kawai! You’re a princess!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, I understand the appeal. “In <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a>, we don’t often have the opportunity to dress up,” Natsumi explains. “We wear casual wear. That’s why we dream about wearing the wedding dress – it’s a once-in-a-lifetime event.” She looks at me. “Do you want to wear a kimono? It’s the same concept. It’s a little foreign, you’re playing a role.”</p>

<p>In the end, I try on eight dresses, each one a little bit more over the top. I end up choosing the first one I tried, strapless and snug around the bosom and waist, shooting out below the hips with multiple layers of tulle.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/29/leap-year-brides-meet-the-women-who-popped-the-question">Leap year brides: the women who popped the question on February 29</a> </p>

<p>That evening, as I fight my way through a rain shower, I think about whether my fiercely independent nature means I will never meet my soul mate. I duck into a ramen shop and eat a bowl of steaming soup, in a packed restaurant where everyone is dining alone.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>In the morning, I wake up for my big day, only to look in the mirror and see that my eye is red and oozy with conjunctivitis. Hardly ready for my closeup. In the hotel lobby I meet Natsumi, who graciously pretends not to notice, and we take a taxi to a fashionable part of town where we will meet wedding stylist Mayumi Hayashi and leading wedding photographer Yuhino Suzuki.</p>

<p>I rarely dress up – in fact, putting a brush through my hair is a big occasion, so why I requested finger waves is beyond me. Mayumi is up for the challenge, though, and places my hair in curlers to set before beginning to apply my makeup, expertly covering up my weeping eye. I have visions of looking like a 1930s beauty queen, but the reality is matronly. I put on my dress and look in the mirror. I look like the Queen Mum.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">I pose for the customary wedding shots: bride gazing downwards chastely, bride looking virginal and blushing innocently</p>

<p>If it feels strange to be getting ready with no one to greet me at the other end, the photoshoot itself is surreal. We make our way to the Shugakuin Kirara Sanso Japanese garden, where I am photographed getting out of the car, walking in the garden and standing beneath the blossom. I pose for the customary wedding shots: bride looking away dreamily, bride gazing downwards chastely, bride looking virginal and blushing innocently. No shots with the groom, sadly. Cerca Travel used to offer an “image partner” for the shoots: an age-appropriate man to stand in as the groom. But not one client requested this service, so they stopped offering it. I personally would have liked to have had a fake husband in my photos, if only for the kitsch factor: here’s me with my fantasy Japanese husband.</p>

<p>There is no actual solo wedding ceremony, which is a shame, because I had imagined promising to love myself for richer, for poorer. But Natsumi says it is a life-changing experience. You need courage to apply for a solo wedding, and clients are often surprised by the self-confidence they gain from the experience. “In real weddings, the main character is the same, the woman, but the goal is different,” she says. “A solo wedding is a jumping-off point; a celebration of yourself. Many women have already given up on meeting someone or getting married, and this makes them realise marriage isn’t the only goal in life.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>On my return home, I am surprised to find that I love showing off my wedding album – I was recently in a posh pub and happened to meet Oscar-winning actor <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/marion-cotillard">Marion Cotillard</a>, so I showed her my wedding pictures. “It’s like <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jan/15/cindy-sherman-interview">Cindy Sherman</a>, only sadder,” she said. “More depressing. These photos are very sad.” I enjoy hearing people’s reactions: most think it’s funny, weird or peculiar.</p>

<p>Natsumi takes her wedding album everywhere, too. “I don’t need to show it to anyone, I just like to know I have it,” she says. “When I get angry or irritated, I can look at it. That was when I was at my best. Many women keep their solo wedding a secret. I want it to become something that is not shameful. There is not a large culture of therapy in Japan, and the solo wedding is therapeutic.”</p>

<p>Upon my return from marrying myself in Japan, I started dating someone I had known for many years. I wondered if my experience had changed something, that my luck with men would now change. Sadly, this relationship also ended abruptly. But I’ve decided I’m happiest on my own. Perhaps I’ll find someone one day – but I don’t need to have a big wedding. I already have my photo album. I can just use Photoshop to add the groom. <br/></p>

Really? I thought she was sitting on top of the steps at the entrance to the shrine and her dress covers the steps. It is similar to photographs taken at the entrance of a church.

Seriously though, in that last photo the subject looks like an amputee she has a pair of enormous knees atop a very odd offset wooden leg. I know she is sitting on some sort of table but at first glance it is a very odd composition.

I have never been to Japan, but had Japanese female pals in university in the US.... and for college kids they were always amazingly turned out. This weekend I was at Tate Britain and a group of Japanese women made the Caucasian majority look very scruffy. So, yes, not sure why the article mentioned that Japanese women normally wear casual clothing.

What a wonderful idea! Celebrate your singlehood - as the comments here show, few others will celebrate it for you. I was married, briefly - biggest mistake of my life - and am now truly happy as a single woman. I never felt the need for the big wedding dress and photos but I do think a celebration of single status, for those who are happily unattached, is a fabulous idea. Go, girl!

Darling, I think you're beautiful. Why waste your money? I'll marry you any time. Time on my own? No problem. Ideal setup.

I did go through cognitive behavioural therapy a few years ago when I emigrated to another country. I was feeling a bit down and went to the doctor to ask why. He asked me a set of questions and recommended that I was a bit lonely so to go out and make some friends, and pay attention to my social life. I did, and my spirits lifted. Social acceptance is very important to human beings, that is why traditional societies have ceremonies for accepting people into the community and making them feel part of the community. Things like communion, bar-mitzvahs even debutantes are a way of feeling accepted and feeling happy. We make fun of such things without appreciating the psychological benefits they give to an individual.

A bit sad, that so many little girls are inundated with the Disneyfied idea of marriage, then grow up without casting those ideas off. A marriage is a contract between three parties: you, your partner and the government. It is not what it seems, doesn't usually contribute significantly to the longevity of a relationship, and is messy to get out of. I've been there and done that. I don't attend weddings, never have, and urge my single daughter to focus on her career.

I remember being asked by busybodies when I was young: "So, when are you getting married?"The temptation to say "Well, I haven't got a groom yet, but I've set the date for January 10 1987 and booked the hall already" was almost too much to resist.There is something costume-party about the whole big wedding thing. Maybe just buy the dress and wear it at Halloween?

I really tried not to be judgemental about this article but, whilst I appreciate that this whole experience has made her really happy I genuinely find it all a bit tragic. There are a myriad of ways in which you can celebrate your life. Marrying yourself really is a step too far.

Ax a woman, and as a human, i pity anyone who even feels the need to have A "special day" on which - and ONLY then, apparently - to be the centre of attention.

Didn't you know that in some Asian countries which shall remain nameless people actually do that? No, seriously. People buy photos of families that aren't really theirs - they are posed by models.And there are agencies that bring together elderly people with no grandchildren and young families with no grandparents, so they can have pretend "family" get-togethers. Rent-a-family.

My thoughts exactly.I am "single and independent (gosh, I do hope so)" for life. I've never felt the need to "celebrate" it - the thought itself never occurred to me. I "celebrate" it by liVing.

True. ;)

She said (as you quote) "marrying MYSELF".It's silly - but where is the deception?

Just so! The headline is misleading as there is no fake ceremony with one person, just photos. The photos reminds me of photos in magazines of thirties debutantes. She actually looks a bit like Elizabeth Taylor as well.

Author::::Cynosure
DateTime::::2016-03-06T08:42:00Z
No, I don't think it is - therapeutic, I mean. Not in the slightest. She clearly isn't "celebrating" the fact that she is single (and the rest of the article confirms it, if not in so many words) - she hates it. But instead of confronting the reasons for her aversion to single life, she goes and borrows the "iconography" of wedding (minus the groom).

In short, all those things that so many married people miss dearly in their lives. :)



Author::::Cynosure

If anything, it's stupidly offensive to those of us who actually do celebrate our being single (by living it and enjoying it every single day).

How does "society" MAKE one do anything?I think it's high time for people to start accepting that it's they themselves who are all too willing to comply and eager to have whatever the Joneses are having.

Good for you. :)You got a marriage (a good one, I hope).So many insecure women only want the wedding.



Author::::Cynosure
DateTime::::2016-03-06T08:12:17Z
I don't understand the negativity. Why can't a woman love herself and treat herself to a white wedding if she wants it? Does she really need to hang off the arm of a bloke?



Author::::Cynosure
DateTime::::2016-03-06T08:04:07Z
Huh? You sound like a really nice and kind person, but why on earth should she "trust" you on that?!Do you have any idea of how many people never "find" love?



Author::::Cynosure
DateTime::::2016-03-06T08:02:02Z
At least those men (or women, by the way) running after a ball aren't pretending to be doing the opposite of what they are doing.And any person who has to "accept" their being single (isn't that our natural state?) - not to mention find it difficult - needs serious work on herself/himself.



Author::::Cynosure

The quinceanera thing is nothing like a fake wedding. It's sort of a "debutante" presentation. Ridiculous, garish and anachronistic.But to each their own.

Thorough behavioural psychotherapy would be far more therapeutic.

You found THAT sad?At least those were real weddings!



Author::::Cynosure
DateTime::::2016-03-06T07:47:36Z
If she is "celebrating herself", why is she pretending to be getting married, which by defintion requires commitment to someone else?



Author::::Cynosure
DateTime::::2016-03-06T07:38:49Z
Assuming you are not being sarcastic, I have to say you sound almost sadder than she is.No offence intended.

I genuinely wish my ex-wife would have done this instead of marrying me - we'd have both been MUCH happier with the outcome!
