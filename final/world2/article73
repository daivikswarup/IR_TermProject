<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>ocked behind a steel door in a tiny cell of America’s most formidable prison, inmate number 27896-016 follows the development of far-away peace negotiations between the Colombian government and leftist <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/farc">Farc</a> rebels with keen interest.</p>

<p>As government and rebel negotiators meeting in Havana come closer to a final agreement to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/colombia-end-in-sight-longest-running-conflict">end more than half century of war in Colombia</a>, Ricardo Palmera has a particular stake in the outcome: if the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have their way, he will be one of the signatories to that accord. </p>

<p>Despite being in solitary confinement behind the high walls and barbed wire of the Florence SuperMax prison high in the Rocky Mountains of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado">Colorado</a>, Palmera has become a point of honour for the Farc in the negotiations.</p>

<p>Since the start of the peace talks in November 2012, the guerrillas have demanded Palmera, known to them as “Simon Trinidad”, be part of the process, standing a life-size cut-out of him beside them in the first rounds of negotiations. They have since tamped down their public demand for Palmera but sources close to the negotiations say they continue to quietly insist the United States release him. </p>

<p>A former banker turned guerrilla, Palmera is the highest ranking member of the rebel group to have been extradited and convicted in the United States. He is serving a 60-year sentence in for his role in the kidnapping of three America defence contractors in 2003 by <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/farc">Farc</a> rebels. Though he did not directly participate, as a member of the group’s central command, he was held responsible by a US court.</p>

<p>The Americans, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/03/colombia.usa">along with a dozen other hostages including former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt</a>, were rescued in 2008, six months after Palmera was sent to serve his sentence in the prison known as the Alcatraz of the Rockies, which one former warden once described as “a clean version of hell”.</p>

<p>It holds the federal system’s most dangerous prisoners, including Terry Nichols, the Oklahoma City bomber, Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, Zacarias Moussaoui, the 9/11 conspirator and Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.</p>

<p>According to Sam Morison, an expert in the US pardon process, Palmera’s only hope for release is through a presidential pardon or commutation of his sentence. </p>

<p>“It’s a foreign policy judgment,” Morison told the Guardian. “There are no rules.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/18/barack-obama-visit-cuba-march">Barack Obama will be in Havana 21 and 22 March</a>, and there is widespread speculation that he may be on hand to witness the signing of a bilateral ceasefire between the Colombian government and Farc. The two sides had originally set 23 March as a deadline for signing a final peace accord but with many details yet to be agreed, that looks less possible. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/19/colombia-peace-talks-farc-rebels-us-envoy-bernard-aronson">The key to ending Colombia's five-decade civil war could be the US</a> </p>

<p>The Obama administration has supported the peace talks and assigned veteran diplomat Bernie Aronson as a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/06/world/americas/a-democratic-diplomat-at-ease-with-both-guerrillas-and-the-gop.html">special US envoy to the negotiations</a>. Aronson said the US would consider removing the Farc from its list of terrorist organizations after it renounced violence, gave up weapons and ended hostility against Americans. </p>

<p>However, he and other senior US officials have repeatedly said that Palmera’s pardon is not on the table and that the Colombian government had made no formal request. But Sergio Jaramillo, the government’s peace commissioner, told the BBC’s Hardtalk: “If you ask me, ‘If you reach an agreement, should he be part of that deal?’ the answer is definitely yes.” </p>

<p>Some movement on that front appears in the works. Leftist Colombian senator Iván Cepeda, who says he has played a facilitator role in the peace process, and Farc legal counsel Enrique Santiago visited Palmera in prison in January, several sources have confirmed. Cepeda declined to comment on the nature or purpose of the visit.</p>

<p>Their meeting with Palmera is significant because inmates are usually only allowed visits only from family members and their lawyers. </p>

<p>Obama has used pardons on two recent occasions to advance American foreign policy goals. In December 2014, Obama <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/17/us-cuba-diplomatic-relations-obama-raul-castro">commuted the sentence of three Cubans convicted of espionage</a> as part of the thawing of relations with the communist nation. In January he <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-legal-idUSKCN0UU0UL">pardoned three Iranians convicted of violations to economic sanctions</a> as part of a rapprochement with Tehran. </p>

<p>But in both those cases the clemency was part of a prisoner swap. And unlike with the Cubans and Iranians who were convicted for victimless crimes, in Palmera’s case four American victims are seeking reparations. </p>

<p>Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves and Tom Howes were held by the Farc in jungle camps for nearly five and a half years, while a fourth, Thomas Janis, was shot by Farc rebels in 2003 after their plane went down in the jungles of southern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia">Colombia</a> as they were flying a surveillance mission.</p>

<p>Jo Rosano, mother of Marc Gonsalves, said she felt that Palmera “should get no privileges, just like his hostages were stripped of all their privileges”.</p>

<p>The Associated Press reported in January that in a letter to a federal judge, the three men had opposed a possible release. “There is no compelling, extraordinary or humanitarian reasons to release this international terrorist,” they wrote.</p>

<p>The former defence contractors were awarded a $318m judgment in a suit against the Farc but given the difficulty of collecting, they have resorted to petitioning US courts to be granted part of the assets of the Farc and alleged Farc front companies frozen in the United States. “Thus far the victims have recovered a relatively small fraction of the $318 million judgment,” their attorney Richard Rosenthal said in an email. </p>

<p>If Obama does consider a pardon for Palmera, securing some sort of compensation for the victims from the Farc may be an acceptable swap. </p>

<p> “Obama’s going to want to get something out of the deal,” said Morison. Financial compensation for the victims “would quell the (victim’s) family opposition”.</p>

<p>But Palmera’s family has its own qualms about his possible release. </p>

<p>Palmera was born in 1950 into a well-heeled family in the provincial capital of Valledupar. After studying economics in Bogota, he became a regional bank manager in his hometown in the mid 1980s. He got involved in leftist politics at a time when activists were regularly targeted for murder by rightwing paramilitary groups aided by the military. </p>

<p>After repeated threats, Palmera took up arms with the Farc in 1987, sending his wife Margarita and two children to Mexico. He took the nom de guerre Simón Trinidad after South American liberation hero Simón Bolívar. </p>

<p>Soon some of Palmera’s own friends and family in Valledupar were kidnapped by the rebels for ransom, and they blamed Trinidad, who had intimate knowledge of the regional elite’s assets. </p>

<p>“Colombians are very resentful,” Palmera’s older brother Jaime Palmera said. “If Ricardo gets out and comes back to Colombia, all of us in the family will have to leave the country.”</p>

<p>Jaime Palmera, who most recently visited his brother in February, said Ricardo “understands that perfectly”. </p>

<p>The elder Palmera said his brother spends much of his time in his 87 sq ft cell following news of the Colombian peace process on television and studying English. But he has little chance to practice his language skills because although he does have contact with other inmates for one or two hours a day in the exercise yard, most of the others speak only Arabic. </p>

<p>The highlight of Palmera’s prison stay so far was a recent day when he was taken out to a nearby town to consult with a doctor for a throat ailment. “It was the first time he’d been out since he was put in there. He said he was beside himself with happiness just looking at the town and seeing people,” Jaime Palmera said. </p>

<p>One of Palmera’s darkest days came in 2010, when he learned that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,333774,00.html">his partner Lucero Palmera</a> – also a Farc member – and their 16-year-old daughter Alix had died in an air raid on their camp. The girl, who was mostly raised by her maternal grandmother, was visiting her mother when the bombs struck. </p>

<p>Jaime Palmera says his brother holds out some hope of being released as part of the peace deal, but “he’s not counting on it”.</p>

<p>According to his sentence, Palmera is scheduled for release on 10 April 2056. </p>

<p>He would be 106 years old.</p>

60 years for kidnapping US military contractors (euphemism for mercenaries?) - who were operating for one side during a murderous civil war? Surely they were POW's?

At the rate they are going the negotiations might last as long as the war itself: 50 years. But one should not be critical as is the former president of Colombia: Uribe. Can you imagine, say, Bush stepping in to meddle with Obama's negotiating with Iran? That us what Uribe has done.

You're right, but if it can help Colombia be peaceful and prosper? Better to buy off the corrupt men.

The Colombian civil war is an interesting history. Both sides look good and both sides look bad depending on the decade you are studying.

President Obama along with all the people involved supporting these "peace talks" are blindfolded by decorated strawberry covered lies the corrupt Colombian government spread to seek universal support on these issues. As a Colombian, and currently living in Colombia, president Santos is only looking for propaganda to earn an aspired Nobel Prize for himself and the current leader of these extreme leftist/terrorist group (FARC) which is ridiculous. People can't imagine the horrors these terrorists have caused in Colombia, from kidnapping, human torture, genocides to narcotics, slowing down the process of development in an already undeveloped country. People couldn't travel anywhere (this changed a bit during president Uribe's regime) inland by road because of fear of being kidnapped and scraped of liberty to succumb to years of torture unless they had enough monetary resources to pay for their release. The FARC also take over lands to claim as their own so they could harvest all their cocaine , slavering the people of those areas for little to no pay so they could make huge amounts of money, using weapons as intimidation or ultimately killing at their liking. What started out as "leftist" group, became a paramilitary group with interest in drugs, corruption and just straight up destroying our country.

His extradition and detention in the US is more because of the unreliability of the prisons in Colombia, were he (like any other high-profile 'guest') would get special treatment and would have been able to continue with the propaganda, and, of course, staying in touch with his fellow terrorist friends in FARC and elsewhere.As bad as kidnapping US citizens is, his crimes against the Colombian people are far, far worse and as a member of FARC's central command he should be held accountable for war crimes, which is the main 'symbolism' of his being in the US.Even though Colombians are dubious about peace talks and the impunity resulting from any agreement signed, freeing Simón Trinidad would be an insult to the victims too far. Even more so as his arrest, extradition and trial took place long before the peace talks began.Let's hope he remains behind bars. There's no peace with impunity.

Looking around for a jail to hold El Chapo when he gets extradited, this sounds like it might fit the bill
