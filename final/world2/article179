Syrian peace talks: release of political prisoners is next hurdle




DateTime::::2016-03-09T16:42:51+0000



<p>The early release of thousands of political detainees is being seen as the next stumbling block to the Syrian peace talks, due to start in Geneva next Monday and lasting initially for two weeks.</p>

<p>Parties to next week’s proximity talks are already starting to arrive in Geneva, amid signs that a partial ceasefire is holding better than expected. The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has made clear he wants the talks to be substantive, covering a constitution and elections – both presidential and parliamentary – in 18 months’ time. He said the talks would run until 24 March, before a pause for as long as 10 days to give the parties time to consult. It is unlikely the talks will recommence in March without tangible progress on prisoner release. </p>

<p>Britain is backing calls from the Syrian opposition operating under the umbrella of the High Negotiations Committee for the release of detainees, especially women and children held by the Syrian government. The HNC has already submitted a list of more than 170 political prisoners, and points to support for their release in successive UN resolutions.</p>

<p>The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, is likely to raise the issue when he meets his US, French, German and Italian counterparts in Paris on Sunday. </p>

<p>The partial ceasefire <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/fragile-syria-ceasefire-enters-second-day">that came into force on 27 February</a> is likely to come under pressure this weekend as various groups including Islamic State try to sabotage the restart of the talks, which are the most hopeful sign yet of an end to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2016/mar/09/a-visual-guide-to-the-war-in-syria-what-happened-and-where-we-are-now">the five-year civil war</a>.</p>

<p>“Releasing prisoners and revealing the fate of the disappeared are both steps that all actors, particularly the regime, which holds tens of thousands of detainees, should take as confidence-building measures towards a negotiated peace,” said Gareth Bayley, the UK’s special envoy to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a>.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/05/amnesty-damns-syrian-regime-over-thousands-of-enforced-disappearances">It has been estimated</a> that 65,000 people were forcibly disappeared in Syria between March 2011 and August 2015, many either killed or detained in appalling conditions, mainly security prisons established by the Syrian government in Damascus. In most cases death certificates have not been issued.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/01/they-were-torturing-to-kill-inside-syrias-death-machine-caesar">‘They were torturing to kill’: inside Syria’s death machine | Garance le Caisne</a> </p>

<p>Bayley said: “The subhuman conditions experienced by detainees of Assad’s prisons were highlighted in the photographs <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/11/images-syrian-torture-shock-new-yorkers-united-nations">smuggled out of Syria in August 2013</a>. These included more than 28,000 photos of deaths in regime custody. They reportedly show at least 6,786 individuals – tortured, strangled and starved people – who died in detention. The reports leave no question that the mass detentions by the regime are part of a widespread attack against the civilian population.”</p>

<p>UN officials acknowledged the seriousness of the prisoner release issue as they briefed on plans for the talks. Opposition negotiators argue that progress on prisoner release is a practical as well as moral necessity and that they need to be able to show that participation in the talks will lead to tangible rewards. UN Resolution 2254 calls for the release of all political detainees.</p>

<p>The UN said at a briefing that there were seven geographic areas within Syria to which they are still being denied humanitarian access, six controlled by the Syrian government and one by Isis. Aid had reached 10 previously besieged areas in the past four weeks, several with multiple convoys, said Jan Egeland, the chair of the UN taskforce on humanitarian access. Egeland said aid convoys still could not reach areas inhabited by hundreds of thousands of people due to the absence of security guarantees from both the government and opposition forces.</p>

<p>The UN wants to reach 870,000 hard-to-reach people by April in rural Homs and Aleppo.</p>

<p>The UN also reported that due to obstruction, almost all of the aid to Deir el-Zour, the largest city in eastern Syria, which is besieged by Isis, is to be delivered by air drops – the first time the UN has attempted a sustained air drop to relieve hunger. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/25/syria-un-wfp-airdrop-food-high-winds-technical-difficulties">An initial air drop was tested on 24 February</a>, but failed largely due to pallets landing either broken or outside the drop zone due to high winds.</p>

<p>Egeland said he expected agreement by next month on “a more rational speedy and less cumbersome procedure” to gain permission to take convoys to hard-to-reach areas. </p>

<p>The last round of Geneva peace talks <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/faltering-un-syria-peace-talks-paused-until-end-of-february">were suspended on 3 February</a> due to Russian bombing of opposition positions, but since then Russia and the US have hammered out a partial ceasefire that is jointly monitored and excludes al-Nusra and Isis-held areas. </p>

<p><span tabindex="-1">Breaches of the partial ceasefire will be addressed </span>in a separate strand of the talks, to prevent disputes becoming an alibi for refusing to negotiate Syria’s future political structure, <span tabindex="-1">de Mistura said.</span></p>

<p>Although the continued role of President Assad in a transitional government is repeatedly cited as the biggest barrier to peace, it is likely the Russians and Iranians will propose a new federal structure in which the role of the president is reduced. </p>

<p>The Syrian Kurds are likely to support such a move, as they have in Iraq. Federalism, it is argued, would prevent the full partition of Syria or the country fracturing along sectarian and ethnic lines.</p>

Its a matter of contention what a political prisoner is. Strictly it is one imprisoned for political beliefs and actions. When the actions are non peaceful and downright muderous and cruel then the person is a criminal first and foremost and while claiming those actions were of a political nature the plain fact is the criminality overtakes any political underpinning. This people should not be eligible for release, exchange etc but punished for their crimes. To not do so brings the minimal justice system into more disrepute.

The western barbarians lost the bargain with Turkey. Turkey cleverly blackmailed self imagined world leaders such as Mr. Cameroon, Mr. Hollande, Ms. Angela Merkel etc. and made them silent over Turkey's media crackdown, ethnic cleansing of Kurdish population and even dictate them over Syrian refugee compensation, EU membership and visa free movement of Turkish citizens across EU and shown to the world that how impotent these leaders become in front of Turkey. They brought nothing but shame to their countries and the people who elected them. How can those leaders can ask Syria to release prisoners the government imprisoned for war crimes. Let them show the courage to push Mr. Erdogan obey court order to release the opposition journalists imprisoned by Turkey and prove that they are morally countable leaders. Let Syria warring parties reach a compromise first before demanding anyone's release and making such precondition for attending peace talk will not give any yield Mr. Hijab and associates should keep in mind.

"Opposition negotiators argue that progress on prisoner release ... need to be able to show that participation in the talks will lead to tangible rewards" - well, if not being bombed and blocked is not tangible enough probably they should resume until such time that opposition negotiator become more reasonable.

The jihadi terrorists operating in Syria did not keep prisoners and they have admitted as much. They showed us how they cut their heads off in public in their many celebratory videos. Why then should Assad release prisoners when the jihadis cannot reciprocate?

Although torture has definitely been used in Syria, including as an agent of the cowardly US rendition program, the scale of the photographic 'evidence' provided by this shadowy Caesar character has to be examined rather more carefully than the automatic acceptance by anti-Assad MSM media. One of the main reasons is that the report was paid for by one of Assad's main enemies Qatar, which must arouse some scepticismhttp://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2014/0121/Syria-smoking-gun-report-warrants-a-careful-read

Syria and Russia are winning the war so it would not be logical for them to divide up Syria to please a few minority interests. Maybe they could offer them safe passage to Germany.

That's where I was heading, we have shitty media who only present the case of our countries foreign policy, rather than being even handed. I think you will find any POW's captured by the moderates, would have been moderately executed, while it seems Assad has put his into prisons.

There are no political prisoners in Syria. The political prisoners were all released at the outset of the war. Most jihadist leaders who are Syrian were at one time or another political prisoners. The people Syrian government are holding are all terror combatants. They have picked up on the battle fields.

Whether it is a true Islamic state or not is irrelevant. Iran is not a secular state by any means. The country's significant executive power is in the hands of a small group of clerics currently led by Khamenei. There are elections, but they only elect people to positions of small power. The elected President of Iran is of lesser authority to the Supreme Leader. Foreign policy is pretty much dictated by Khamenei and co. Of course, the amount of power between the clerical establishment and the elected establishment differ and change over the years, but the country is very much Islamic and its legislature is based on Shia Islam, as well as its constitution.

I haven't seen it reported anywhere but from what is happening in terms of cooperation I expect Assad , possibly with a bit of nudging from the Russians, has agreed to an autonomous Kurdish region months ago.

More likely to be just an autonomous region for Kurds as an ethnic group. Kurds and Syrian government both have the same enemies.I doubt secular Sunni's would be interested in sectarian jihadist style autonomous regions.
