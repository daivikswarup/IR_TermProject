Point, counterpoint: does 'reformists versus hardliners' still cut it in Iranian politics?

<p><strong>‘The reformists’ electoral strategy has beaten fundamentalist conservatives at their own game’</strong></p>

<p>Mahmoud Sadri<br/></p>

<p>Some called it an oxymoron; others saw it as the proverbial camel, a horse designed by a committee. But Iran’s constitution, hammered out in the wake of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, remains the only one of its kind to combine the conflicting principles of democracy and theocracy. </p>

<p>It has ushered in a dual system of government that has survived for nearly four decades. However, the hybrid has come with a hefty price tag: a relentless contest between the opposing principles and their advocates has bedevilled the Islamic Republic and hampered its ability to manage internal and external crises. A string of debacles including the American hostage crisis, the protracted war with Iraq and the bloody suppression of the “the Green Movement protests” are traceable to the tension between democracy and theocracy enshrined in the constitution.</p>

<p>This is the context within which the election on 26 February should be understood. Iranians will elect the representatives for the tenth term of the Iranian parliament (Majlis) and the fifth term of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/feb/24/iran-elections-view-from-qom-clerical-establishment-tehranbureau">Assembly of Experts</a>, which is charged with choosing the next supreme leader. </p>

<p>The contest resembles the latest round of an ongoing chess tournament between old rivals. The theocratic (fundamentalist or ‘principle-ist’) camp, aware of its lack of popularity, resorts to the levers of power it controls: the security forces, public broadcasting, supervisory bodies, and the judiciary. The democratic (reformer and moderate) side controls the presidency and the parliament through regularly winning elections despite the increasingly intrusive and partisan vetting process for candidates – as well as the veto powers of the authoritarian bodies overseeing the president and the parliament. </p>

<p>The reign of the reform-minded president <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/sep/20/iran-khatami-revenge-rouhani-victory">Mohammad Khatami</a> (1997-2005) taught principlists and their allies that even a fettered democracy could threaten a theocratic regime. Ever since, they have been determined to prevent the election of another reformist president or parliament. They have resorted to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/19/iran-guardian-council-blocks-reformists-february-parliamentary-poll">sweeping disqualification of reform candidates</a> (to the tune of 99% in the recent round) and vote rigging - manoeuvres known as “engineering of the elections”.</p>

<p>The democratic camp, for its part, has learned that, given its vulnerabilities, openly challenging or boycotting the electoral process is detrimental to its long-term objectives. Its new strategy involves working with whatever qualified candidates the regime selects, while voting for the most moderate individuals on that roster. </p>

<p>This plan worked during the last presidential election. After the prominent reformist candidate <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/27/iran-ali-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-comeback-assembly-experts-election">Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani</a> was unceremoniously blocked from running for president, the movement turned to a centrist approved candidate, Hassan Rouhani, and carried him to a landslide victory. Hence, the “engineered” election was “reverse-engineered” by the collective genius of Iran’s electoral majority.</p>

<p>Now the reformists are looking to repeat their feat. Having quickly recovered from the shock of widespread disqualification of its candidates - including <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/sep/17/hassan-khomeini-signals-ready-enter-politics">Hassan Khomeini</a>, Ayatollah Khomeini’s erudite and reform-minded grandson - the reform movement has organized a nation-wide alliance, aptly nicknamed ‘The Second Step’ (<em>Gam-e Dovvom</em>). </p>

<p>The strategy includes casting ‘negative ballots’, that is, holding one’s nose and voting for a distasteful candidate to block a far more odious one. It also includes courting moderate loyalists who, having secured official approval, would welcome a windfall of popular support. This move has the added advantage of dividing the conservatives. </p>

<p>The announced goals of the new alliance include defeating the highly influential and widely detested ‘JYM triangle’ – Ayatollahs Ahmad Jannati, Mohammad Yazdi and Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi - in Tehran and their counterparts in other provinces, including Sadegh Larijani, Ahmad Alamolhoda, Mohammad Momen and others. The alliance is urging its supporters to vote for the entire roster of its candidates (in Tehran, for example, 30 for the parliament and 16 for the Assembly of Experts) to ensure a major defeat for the arch-conservatives. President Khatami recently dubbed the list: “The roster of Hope.”</p>

<p>President Rouhani, Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani are openly backing the reform alliance under the banner: “We will not vote for the extremists”. The most prominent political prisoners of the reform movement, too, have united in an impassioned appeal for massive participation to turn the elections into a plebiscite against the theocratic camp. An increasing number of musicians and movie stars are joining the campaign by airing short clips in which they invite their fans to vote; a move that ought to alarm the other side because is it likely to mobilize a fan base that is otherwise largely apolitical. </p>

<p>One sign of the effectiveness of the reformer/moderate alliance is that it has frightened the right wing. Several of its leading figures, including the candidates singled out for defeat, have angrily lashed out against the ‘negative ballots’ strategy of the reform alliance. They have resorted to the spurious argument that since the western media (particularly the BBC) have reported on the reformists’ strategy, the west must have inspired it – or that the reform candidates have been “infiltrated” by sworn foreign enemies of the regime. </p>

<p>The official reform spokesmen have remained triumphantly reticent against these charges while a gleeful public has taken to the electronic media with sarcastic rebuttals. A popular ‘telegram’ channel features hundreds of comments like: “I don’t understand, even aerobic bacteria have been filtered out by the diligent vetting of our Guardian Council. Where are all these ‘infiltrators’ coming from? All we want is to do is vote for the ‘30+16’ from their roster of the approved candidates. None of these folks are disloyal to the regime or else they would have been disqualified … all of them have stated their unwavering commitment to this wondrous regime … They have even cursed the ancestors of conspirators, schemers and plotters against the regime. Now, we would like to vote for these ‘approved’ and ‘vetted’ candidates. Is there a problem with that”?</p>

<p>The reform alliance has made its move. The next move belongs to the principlists and their allies. They are furious about being stymied. </p>

<p>Will they take their losses and face a more reform-minded parliament and a slightly more moderate Experts’ Assembly or will they resort to electoral fraud or force? The success of the new reform strategy may not improve the situation that much but it will prevent it from getting much worse and, additionally, packs an enormous symbolic punch. It will mark a significant defeat for the theocratic election-engineers. They will have been beaten in their own game.</p>

<p><strong>‘With politics reshaped by the nuclear agreement, the Iranian elections have moved beyond the divisions of yesteryear’</strong></p>

<p>Gareth Smyth<br/></p>

<p>Elections in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> have often confounded expectations. The upstart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a landslide in the 2005 presidential poll after much of the international media had already lauded Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as the winner.</p>

<p>In 2013, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hassan-rouhani">Hassan Rouhani</a> turned the election in a television debate when he linked the poor state of the economy to the nuclear issue, so opening up a divide with rivals on an issue on which there was supposedly consensus and so winning crucial edge just days before polling. It was the economy, stupid.</p>

<p>This may well remain the case this week for the parliamentary election and even the election for Majles-e Khobregan, the Experts Assembly, the body charged with selecting a supreme leader should a vacancy arise. Especially away from the political hothouse of Tehran, most of the 55 million voters around the country do not see the election in the clear-cut terms beloved by some commentators. Regional, tribal and local factors are all at work as Iranians judge who might best offer jobs and affordable homes, or stimulate business.</p>

<p>The absence of national lists, much less effective political parties, also precludes any simple binary divide. In any case, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/dec/11/realignment-irans-political-factions-before-2017-elections">realignment of politics</a> with the nuclear agreement has overtaken the old distinctions between ‘left’ and ‘right’ of the 1980s, and between ‘reformists’ and ‘conservatives’ in the 1990s. </p>

<p>As president, Rouhani has succeeded where he failed in leading negotiations with the European Union in 2003-05 - in reaching a lasting nuclear agreement with the backing of the bulk of Iran’s political class and so reducing dangerous tensions with the United States. With sanctions easing, Rouhani now wants economic reform to stimulate the private sector, attract and manage foreign investment, and so improve growth.<br/></p>

<p>But the nuclear deal presents challenges. Many of Iran’s elderly clerics are concerned at western cultural influence. Many strong supporters of the Islamic Republic, less adept in their thinking than pragmatists like Rouhani or his ally Rafsanjani, wonder whether the US remains set on changing the regime and prepared to use all means – including the Islamic State group (Isis) ­– to achieve this end. </p>

<p>The Middle East is badly divided between Sunnis and Shia, with Saudi Arabia more assertive and less predictable than anyone in Tehran can remember. These are dangerous, threatening times. Over 400 Iranians have died fighting in Syria, where Isis this week added Sayida Zeinab to the Shia shrines they have bombed. Thousands of Iranian pilgrims have been killed in neighbouring Iraq. Political change is not always for the better, security is better than chaos.</p>

<p>Yet Rouhani’s critics have presented no convincing alternative to the nuclear agreement and the president’s wider emphasis on diplomacy. While <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a>, the supreme leader, has maintained rhetoric of resisting “infiltration” to enthuse his core base, particularly through the Basij, the nuclear agreement would not have happened without his approval.</p>

<p>The reformists have been isolated from mainstream politics since their candidates were crushed in Ahmadinejad’s 2005 victory. However popular in north Tehran and other cities, and among the educated, and however well Khatami polled in the 1997 and 2001 presidential elections, they have struggled to widen their base of active support.</p>

<p>But the reformists have also drawn lessons from the crushing of the street protests after the 2009 presidential election, judging that with Rouhani in office a more considered approach can slowly regain admittance to the mainstream as memories of the 2009 “sedition” begin to fade. </p>

<p>Hence, even with most of their candidates disqualified by the watchdog Guardian Council, the reformists’ advocacy of tactical voting is stronger than ever before. ‘‘We act within the system,’’ Mohammad Reza Aref, former vice-president and prominent candidate in Tehran, told a campaign rally. ‘‘Nobody loves the revolution more than us. Like a mother, we feel concern for it and want to preserve it.’’</p>

<p>A wide swath of the political class – including many principlists as well as Aref – believes this means supporting the Rouhani government. In Qom, Ali Larijani, the parliamentary speaker who helped steer the nuclear agreement through the legislature, is standing for election with support from the Society of Qom Seminary Teachers but opposed by other principlists, including some allied to Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi.</p>

<p>Supporters of Rouhani’s path may well back Larijani, reflecting the co-operation between the two since 2013 that has overcome the hostility between government and parliament that characterised both Ahmadinejad’s presidency and Khatami’s later years in office. It is hard to imagine more of an insider – indeed more of a ‘principle-ist’ - than Larijani, partly because both his father and father-in-law were ayatollahs, and partly because of his long-term record as a commander of the Revolutionary Guards, labour minister, culture minister and secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. </p>

<p>As minister of culture after 1992 under president Rafsanjani, Larijani said his main task was to resist a western cultural onslaught through “holy Islamic learning”, an approach he continued as head of state broadcasting from 1994 to 2004. But nothing in Larijani’s beliefs gives him any reason to oppose Rouhani, while his long-term support for private enterprise – going back to his opposition in the 1980s to the egalitarianism advocated by leftists like Mir Hossein Mousavi, later leader of the ‘green movement’ – will be useful for the president if the parliament elected on Friday votes to return Larijani as parliamentary speaker.</p>

<p>The election for Khobregan – the Experts Assembly – has aroused unusual interest because of the reasonable chance it will be called upon during its eight-year term to choose a successor to Khamenei, who is 76 and in 2014 underwent prostate surgery. But while the election is for sure an important step towards the succession, this is a journey of twists and turns.</p>

<p>The apparent demise of Ayatollah Shahroudi – considered a frontrunner until a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/mar/13/iran-supreme-mohammad-yazdi-leader-in-waiting">report last year</a> of a judicial investigation into financial irregularities apparently led to his withdrawal as a candidate for chairing the assembly – has thrown the contest wide open. Clues as to the next stage of manoeuvring around the succession may emerge from results of Friday’s Khobregan election, from the subsequent choice of a chairman, and from Khamenei’s subsequent dealings with the senior clerics. But no-one should hold their breath.</p>

<p>Rouhani recently drew attention to the combined <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.irna.ir/en/News/81965167/">‘religious’ and ‘democratic’</a> nature of the Iranian system – whose lynchpin is the leader. “According to the constitution, sometimes several people are on equal standing in jurisprudential, social and political terms and so the vote of the Experts Assembly will decide who among two or three individuals can become the leader,” he said. “Under certain conditions, even a single vote of the Experts Assembly members will be important for election of the leader.” </p>

<p>This is no doubt true. Clerical rivalries – not just in Shia Islam - can be bitter. Reducing the succession to a battle between a ‘moderate’ and a ‘hardline’ camp, or suggesting the leadership will be simply decided by Khamenei or by any other interest or bloc, belies both the opacity of the Experts Assembly and the complexities of Iran’s factional politics. As the Iranian proverb has it: mountains do not meet, but people do.</p>

'Vibrant and competitive', really ? The way it is set up makes it impossible to ever penetrate the 'system' to even get to a 'leader' ! Running the guantlet of the so called 'Experts Assembly' just takes away the whole purpose for voting in the first place ! Like I said thats even if 'reformers' live long enough to express a different opinion !Sorry love but how is that 'better' than our completely open and honest voting system ?

With 40 state-run media outlets in Iran last week raising $600,000 (£420,000) to add as bounty to Ayatollah Khomeini’s death fatwa on the writer Salman Rushdie because of his novel The Satanic Verses, Iran is still a religiously fascist state and deserves to be put out in the cold.

There are some countries around the world that are having worse political system than Iran and are the real supporters of terrorism, but they are US allies, and that is why you are not hearing as much as Iran about them! There is no saint country in the world! Each country has its own problems, some of them have the same set of problems, the others had few decades ago (e.g. gays had the same issues in European countries few decades ago as what they have now in Iran)! Each nation has its own set of dynamics based on their culture, traditions, and religion, and consequently should have it's own pace for adapting to the time! It was always like that through the history! Sometimes westerners were behind sometimes ahead! You cannot expect all countries to move forward with the same pace! You cannot expect people from the other side of the world have exactly the same values as yours at the same time! The problem with people of this side (West) is that they judge the other side based on dynamics of their own society! And well, politicians perfectly use this through media to justify their actions to mess up there!

Did the corrupt judiciary or intelligence services make any arrests.... no soprry, they were all on it including the fool that call shimself the supreme leader and his corrupt to the bone marrow sons and their families.

Reformists or hardliners, they must all be seen as dangerous bigots until they show plausible evidence of compatibility with their neighbors. Let's not forget that Persia was renamed Iran (which means the "Land of Aryans" in Persian) in 1935 by a direct suggestion of the Third Reich. By 1939, Iran was one of the strongest Hitler's trading partners. Persians have been waging wars against their neighbors since the beginning of time. Shiism, the Persian flavor of Islam, inherited these racist Aryan attributes triggering major wars from China to Syria. Some of the comments above and below are snapshots of such bigotry. So, the majority of Iranian politicians will continue to use the Aryan emblem in order to rally the citizens against their neighbors causing serious and irreversible harm to the whole world.

A golden opportunity for a peaceful and true democracy was completely destroyed by a joint American/British criminal coup detate in Iran and went six feet underground with Dr. Mossadegh's death in 1953. Now let the Iranians fight their internal painful but necessary battles to save their infant democracy without destroying it for them AGAIN! I am very excited for Iranians. Well done!

Thank you for your reply it is of course a reasonable argument to make. I also would agree with many of the points you make. But use of the liberal term for the very principle that stands against liberal values, freedom of choice rule of law etc is questionable to my mind. Thank you for your reference to mojtahed but I did grow up with a sound understanding of theologies Shiasim movement as well as the repercussions of the Arab invasion in a religious environment. Alameh majlesy and his holayatolmtaghin represents the sort of traditional intellectual you speak of, if you have read any of it you can see how by no stretch of imagination this could be called intellectual to any sound mind. Effectively since Ghazali refuted based on correct interpretation of the religion possibility of reinterpretation of religious principles and called Avicenna an apostate there has been zero movement in intellectual progress forward of theology. What existed as progressive before that time was effectively the continuation of Iranian thought under Islamic guises, not Arabic Islamic thought. I would also refer you to the concept of taklif, which effectively permanently rules out freedom of choice for any adherent to the faith and the concept of return to the Sadr which effectively rules out progress. These two concepts being part of Ancient Iranian traditions which at least for a while during the last dynasty (Pahlavi) was in the process of being resurrected. To my mind there is no place to reconcile these diametrically opposed values and any such attempt results in corruption of both. Personably, I hail from sensible secular Iranian and views of Hedayat and Kasravi, think of shariati and others like him as charlatans so you must forgive me if I look at the last 14 centuries and the last century and from the invasion to faz ol allah noury to today I can't see any upside.

Dear Mr. Ariardyef: We agree on the thrust of your argument that a religious learning does not qualify a person to run the affairs of a modern state. We also agree (indeed that there is a fundamental contradiction in Iran's Constitution) My article hinges on understanding the nature of that contradiction. However, it is clear that you do not hold seminary education in high esteem under any circumstances and object to my use of the adjective "erudite" to describe a liberal cleric. For a more detailed explanation of what a "Mojtahed" (Hassan Khomeini's undisputed title) running the equivalent of a graduate seminar in a central religious seminary would have to know, please read the first chapter of "The Mantle of the Prophet" by Roy Mottahedeh (Professor of History, Harvard University). An expert in the exegesis of a religious lore, be it Talmud, Bhagavad Gita or Quran, does not have to know a modern science or language in order to qualify as a traditional intellectual (which the clerical guild, by any sociological definition, are). Finally, it seems that we share positive sentiments about democracy, rule of law, and modernity. The difference may come from the fact that I consider it (in a country like Iran) a slippery, messy zigzag climb while you seem to consider it as a simple binary choice. RegardsMahmoud Sadri

Mr Sadr these Arab fossils and the grand son of the man who single handedly all but destroyed modern Iran, Hassan Khomeini are not erudite as you suggest. By what measure is he or are they educated? most have never held real jobs in their lives, education in the seminary about Arab traditions, history, religion and regulations of cleaning and toiletary is not an education suited to running a state, especially the oldest country in the world with a proud history. When they learn to speak other languages fluently, stop referring to advanced and freer countries as corrupt, learn some Iranian history, get educated in sciences that count (and a law degree from a third rate Scottish university does not qualify), respect others and the law you can think about calling them erudite, they are repulsive parasites. You posit this as a complex game with a potential for a rule of law democracy. Such a thing with this constitution and this Islamic Republic of Iran, all of the three words representing diametrically opposed ideas is impossible. As Masht Ghasem said in My Uncle Napoleon the house is ruined from its foundations. It's a sand castle based on corrupt irrelevant invasive Arab traditions and history it has no place next to a secular democratic state nor Iranian values found in the book of Kings or the Gathas.
