Leading candidate for Peru presidency barred from election over technical error

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/peru">Peru</a>’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.jne.gob.pe/">electoral tribunal</a> has barred the second-placed presidential candidate Julio Guzmán from the electoral race over a technical error in the registration of his candidacy. </p>

<p>Just a month before a presidential election on 10 April, the electoral body rejected an appeal by Guzmán’s political party <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://todosporelperu.pe/">Todos Por el Perú</a><em> </em>on Wednesday, excluding the 45-year-old economist from the race.</p>

<p>Fourth-placed candidate Cesar Acuña, the millionaire owner of three universities accused of plagiarism, was also barred. The tribunal upheld an accusation that Acuña had broken a new electoral law against vote-buying by handing out money to voters.</p>

<p>The pair had appealed the decision made by a lower court, the Special Electoral Tribunal, last week. The ruling had sparked indignation and accusations of meddling by other powerful but less popular presidential candidates. </p>

<p>Guzmán supporters called it an attack on democracy. The exclusion of the two candidates leaves around a quarter of Peru’s potential votes available.</p>

<p>Guzmán, a former vice-minister and Inter-American Development Bank economist, had called the decision an “anticipated fraud” and part of a “corrupt system”. In a race dominated by familiar faces, Guzman appealed to 63% of voters who wanted a new figure, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.gfk.com/fileadmin/user_upload/dyna_content/PE/GfK_OP_Febrero_2016_-_Gobierno_y_Lima_6.pdf">according to an pollster GFK</a>.</p>

<p>A virtual unknown a few months ago, Guzmán had surged in the polls to second place and was mooted as the only candidate capable of defeating frontrunner Keiko Fujimori in a run-off vote on 5 June. Fujimori, who polls indicate has around one-third of the vote, is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/08/comandante-first-lady-peru-election">the daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori</a>, who was jailed in 2009 for human rights abuses and corruption during his decade in power from 1990 to 2000.</p>

<p>In a statement, Guzman’s Todos Por El <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/peru">Peru</a> party rejected the electoral tribunal’s ruling calling it “flagrantly illegal and unconstitutional” and insisted it would continue in the race.</p>

<p>In a pointed reference to frontrunner Keiko Fujimori, whose opponents accuse her of illegally handing out prizes and gifts to voters on the campaign trail, it said several political groups had broken the rules but had not been asked to withdraw from the race. Fujimori’s political party has rejected the allegations.</p>

<p>“If their cases are not treated with the same criteria, the current election and potential elected authorities become illegitimate,” Guzman said in the statement.</p>

<p>In response to the ruling, political scientist at Harvard University, Steven Levitsky, told The Guardian: “This sets a terrible precedent and is likely erode the already low legitimacy of Peru’s democratic institutions.”</p>

<p>“I cannot think of a democracy anywhere in the contemporary world in which major presidential contenders are excluded from the race for minor infractions,” he said. </p>

<p>“In fact, there is a real possibility that Keiko Fujimori will win, and that Julio Guzman will be able to point to polls and say that had he not been excluded, the outcome would have been different,” he added.</p>

<p>“In other words, the very outcome of the presidential election may be called into question.”</p>

Aqui habla una peruano residente en Peru y puedo constatar veridicamente que el señor Guzman es un candidato muy acogido por el pueblo peruano, en especial en la zona sur del país por lo que representa el 20% del voto de la población de mi país. Es una injusticia lo que están haciendo ahora con él, robándonos la esperanza de votar por candidato que es transparente. En cuanto a la Plaza San Martin no pudo haber incluso aun mas gente (por que hubo muy buena cantidad) por que la policía había bloqueado los pasajes a la plaza, no nos querían dejar pasar. Por favor adversarios hasta aquí incluso vienen a querer dejar mal a Julio, Esta es la realidad y ella es que se están vulnerando los derechos de todos los peruanos, este articulo esta muy bien escrito...

Luis is Right. Guzmàn cannot have the percentages he supposedly has on surveys. Polls most probable show the sentimental in Perú. I live un Piura, the the Second most populated City in my country, and the support for Guzmán is minimal. Besides, several facts make Guzmán appear to be the real candidate sponsored by the current government, the worst one in the last 40 years.

Well, as most of the peruvians who wants to follow the law in our country, we are agree with JNE´s veredict. If the JNE could have aceppt Guzman ´s claims then we democracy in our country will be affected. We need to follow laws and rules, no matter if this laws could be strange for non peruvians.

I am sorry but you should research a subject properly before writing an article like this. The two political parties removed from the presidential elections did more than just having administrative problems and the JNE did well in removing them from the presidential elections. We need to stop the corruption in our country at once and hopefully a decent candidate with integrity and a decent plan will succeed this time.

You may know that some pollster in Peru receive money to change the real data into fake percentage. One proof of that is that Guzman has not the power to convene a public meeting to his fellows supported. In the last public meeting ,there were only 2000 people.

The problem here is that all the parties has broken the rules, so JNE has to apply the same law to them, but nothing happened. Another critical point is that peruvian democracy is so weak, in 2000 we had similar problem with Fujimori and is so difficult to trust in our institutions, if a murderer can obtain freedom less than 24 hours in Peru is easier to bar a candidate.

It is great to see someone who understands the issue! I just wrote a long post explaining this; unfortunately I just realised it has some typos. This is the first time I write a post here so I didn't know we can't edit a post after it has been submitted. I think the decision is great! The laws are being equally applied, this sets an example for future candidates.

Seriously guys, some of you are just talking without much knowledge when you know very little of this topic. Politics in Latin America area a complex issue, you really can't compare different countries. The decision taken is correct. All the candidates have to follow certain rules in order to be candidates. Guzmán completely overlooked the rules and not just in this case, this has been the final straw, he has had other issues that were overlooked drugint the process and that affect his candidature. Furthermore, unlike what many of you seem to believe, Guzman has received an enormous support from the media and the Peruvian Government -ehich he has triedto deny-; and not the opposite. For instance, Guzman's lawyer is the advisor of the actual president of Peru. Guzmán has been lying in order to gain popularity. He refuses to debate his plan with other candidates because he doesn't have a good plan and he knows it. If he didn't break the elections law he would still be there, but he didn't follow the rules that all candidates have to follow, so why should he be the exception? Obviously, the ethical decision has been taken-finally!- for it shows that laws do not just accomodate to favour particular candidates just because they have government support. That is positive! The intended consequences of this decision as clear, and unintended consequences of this decision are actually good because that means that great and respected candidates such as Alfredo Barnechea (who has a modest campaign and he is not spending much money) and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski now have good chances to got to the next round. The most educated people in Peru and a great percentage of the Peruvian population are happy with this decision. This gives the citizens hope that finally certain institutions are going to take the law more seriously. I dislike Keiko Fujimori but blaming her for this is simply preposterous and shows people's complete ignorance and lack of insight. For Keiko Fujimori, it was convenient to keep Guzman because she would have defeated him in the second round whereas she won'tdefeat PPK or Barnechea (who is rapidly growing due to his great political career and ethical conduct). Please, get informed before making comments, and The Guardian too should check its sources; alas, The Guardian is not the most reliable paper. Those of us who study and understand South American politics would be able to write a more informative and unbiased article.

What world is The Guardian living in? I can attest that the "technical errors" were not merely technical. The candidate was elected by a group of buddies and financed by one millionaire, owner of a cosmetics empire. They rented a newly formed "political party" with no structure nor representation, to serve as vessel for the project. They did not elect the unknown Guzman as a candidate by any democratic process, as mandated by their own party rules. In addition, the party itself was registered by means of fake signatures. The guy is no more than a puppet, the country is better off without him. The electoral board did its job.

The fact is that nobody within TPP party has ever complain about their rights being violated. They all accorded that Julio Guzmán was the only candidate for presidency. So what right had been infringed from anybody to start off? They had also corrected the only technical error they comited which was presenting the documentation of the modification of their own statute. Nobody ever complain about this. So I don't see the point trying to care about an issue that the very militants of this party don't care.

This article presents tendenctious omissions. this so-called "technical error" was reported and informed since december 2015. 1.- Our law prohibits changes in the statutes of political parties about Internal Democracy rules (for wich presidential candidates are chosen) once started the electoral call. They changed the rules to choose Guzman only between 55 people.2.- This inner court of 55 people was not reach full quorum for voting on decisions.3.- These legal inconsistencies were reported by the electoral autority in December 2015 but Guzman refuse to accept the fault.4.- The entire month of January they appealed to the authority with many resources but unsuccessfully.5.- Miraculously February 5, during the last of the hearings, they showed a document of a meeting on January 20 in wich they rectified the lack of Internal Democracy. The electoral authority demosntrate that "the January 20 meeting", besides the signatures, could not have occur in reality (cronological inconsistencies).All this is a result of political improvisation in my country where political parties "sleep in freezers" until elction times and are offered to the "highest bidder". It is ironic that always claim more "institutionality" to fight corruption and achieve efficient State Policies, but when they are affected by the aplication of our laws, they run acussing of FRAUD (which shows an authoritarian concept of his democratic rights).Five years ago, Ollanta Humala had only 28% of vote intention against Keiko Fujimori, so surveys should not decide whether or not to apply the LAWS of OUR COUNTRY.

The "technical error" that left Julio Guzmán out of campaign is related to the internal party process that chose him as candidate. Justice argues that Guzmán promoted a party assembly to reform some party rules without respecting the time period and seat limits required by the party charter.

Dear Guardian, what was the "technical error"? I would have thought that is an important piece of context. Did he miss the application deadline by 2 seconds? Did he shit on the application form before submitting it? These could both be technical errors. I think the latter might justify a number of sanctions but the former probably wouldn't.

Acuña comes only as 7th in the polls (despite what the article says), but this is definitely a blow for Guzman - probably the only decent alternative to the populist Fujimori. By the looks of it the Electoral Court has just won the election for Fujimori. And I wonder what the future holds for Peru, which, despite having had Garcia and Humalla as presidents, has done very well in recent years. El Peru merece algo mejor...

This is an extremely serious issue, and it now depends on the internatinal community to convince Peru that, in the, name of democracy and to avoid social unrest, this decision should be reversed forthwith.
