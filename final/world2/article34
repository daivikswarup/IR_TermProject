<p>Harmony of the Seas, the world’s largest cruise ship, set off on Thursday on its first sea trial from Saint-Nazaire, western <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a>, with just two months to go to delivery.<br/></p>

<p>The city’s STX France shipyards began building the €1bn ($1.1bn) mammoth for US shipbuilder Royal Caribbean International (RCI) in September 2013.</p>

<p>Thousands of people gathered at the dock to watch as the 120,000-tonne ship was helped out to sea by six tugs.</p>

<p>Some 500 people, mostly crew as well as officials from the owners and engineers and suppliers, were on board for the first trial, set to continue until Sunday.</p>

<p>The ship, with a height of 70m (210 feet), has been an imposing presence in Saint-Nazaire, visible from miles away.</p>

<p>For months, tourists have been allowed on board to gape at the innards of the ship that has 16 decks and stretches 362m (1,187 feet), 50m longer than the height of the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>Three pilots, who have trained on a simulator in nearby Nantes for the past year, helped the captain in the tricky manoeuvres needed to guide the hulking ship out of the Saint-Nazaire estuary.</p>

<p>The tugs first helped the ship back out of its berth before turning it around and then guiding it out to the open sea.</p>

<p>The pilots will leave the vessel once it is 20km (12 miles) out at sea.</p>

<p>Some 2,000 crew are to cater for the needs of more than 6,000 passengers on Harmony, which is a metre wider than the current twin ocean-going monsters of the pleasure cruise world, the RCI-owned Allure of the Seas and the Oasis of the Seas, which are also 362m long.</p>

<p>The next trials will take place before the end of April, with delivery set for 12 May.</p>

I wonder what it will be like to be on board when the first outbreak of gastroenteritis hits?

Looks ugly and rather top-heavy to me. I'm guessing it's designed to fit (barely) through the Panama Canal?

I know that not everybody can go on holidays in small, paradisiac, still to-be-discovered places, but to go on holidays with 6000 other people, what's the allure??!

Yeah but they used dodgy steel. You do realise that maritime laws have changed since 1912 and safety standards have been upped considerably, right?

Along the string of comments I read several times about "third world staff with third world wages to serve 1st world client"...US Cruise ships employees are not in the same situation as Filipino maids in the Middle-East : it is fair game to pay a competitive Filipino wage to Filipinos and I am sure they are happy about it compared to their perspectives back home...

Thanks for that.I hope not, but with that amount of superstructure I fear that she may well be viewed upside down one of these days.One would have thought that an elegant and beautiful design would have sold the cruise, but maybe today's ''pasengers'' don't care as you say.

Except that our economic system allocates a billion euros to be spent on a luxury instead of for the well-being of our other people in need.

Thanks for your reply. Given your specialist knowledge, perhaps you know whether the captain in question is still employed (as a captain)?

France is a high wage economy.If France can produce a ship of this size why not Britain?Britain used to lead the world in shipbuilding.What went wrong ?We seem only able to build aircraft carriers whose only purpose is to further destabilised the middle East.Why just death machines ? Are they more profitable perhaps ?

How very un-French, it is an ugly utilitarian monstrosity totally lacking in grace, beauty or redeeming distinction, there is little virtue in bulk for its own sake - if made to the American owner's design the French shipbuilder's should have rejected it.

At least the Titanic had elegance.There is something rather classless about its exterior, reminiscent of a large 1960's-style office complex in the city; however I expect it will be amazing inside. Not my idea of a relaxing holiday, but each to their own. Footnote: There don't appear to be many lifeboats for such a large vessel.

You are right, the staff are all drugged and dragged on to the ship and forced to work for a pittance.

Even a classics cruise could not save this ship from being butt ugly, as well as possibly damaging to the environment.

No. I can listen to the music I like and watch wonderful ballets at the same time! Each to his own, dear Chips, but I take regular holidays in a very beautiful place which has been voted the most romantic town in the whole med, even James Bond likes it, and I have many friends there. You are always surrounded by the sea and you have two large islands to visit by boat (or sometimes swim to as my daughter has done, though it's not safe with too many speed boats now).
