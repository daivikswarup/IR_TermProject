North Korea fires two short-range ballistic missiles into sea

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea">North Korea</a> has fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea, South Korea’s military said on Thursday.</p>

<p>The firing is a likely show of anger at continuing war games by Washington and Seoul and another ratcheting up of hostility on the Korean peninsula.<br/></p>

<p>The South Korean defence ministry says the missiles were fired from north Hwanghae province, south of the capital, Pyongyang, and flew about 500 km (310 miles), before falling into the water off the country’s east coast.</p>

<p>Missile firings by the North are not uncommon when animosity rises in the region. North Korea hates the large annual military drills staged by Seoul and Washington, calling them invasion preparations. </p>

<p>US and South Korean troops began the military drills this week, which the North calls “nuclear war moves” and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-us-and-south-korea-to-flames-and-ash">threatened to respond with an all-out offensive.</a></p>

<p>The allies call the drills defensive and routine. This year’s are described as the biggest ever. Pyongyang is also angry over tough <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/01/north-korea-un-human-rights-never-ever">United Nations sanctions</a> following its recent nuclear test and long range rocket launch.</p>

<p>The firings come a day after North Korea publicised a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/kim-jong-un-claims-north-korea-has-miniaturised-nuclear-warhead">purported mock-up of a key part of a nuclear warhead</a>, with leader Kim Jong-un repeating a claim that his country has developed miniaturised atomic bombs that can be placed on missiles.</p>

<p>The North’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried photos on its front page showing Kim and nuclear scientists standing beside what outside analysts say appears to be a model warhead part with a ballistic missile or a model ballistic missile in the background.</p>

<p>The newspaper said Kim met his nuclear scientists for a briefing on the status of their work and declared he was greatly pleased that warheads had been standardised and miniaturised for use on ballistic missiles.</p>

<p>Information from North Korea is often impossible to confirm, and the country’s state media has a history of photo manipulations. But it was the first time the North has publicly displayed its purported nuclear designs, though it remains unclear whether the country has functioning warheads of that size or is simply trying to develop one.</p>

<p>South Korea’s defence ministry disputed the North’s claim that it possesses miniaturised warheads. It called the photos and miniaturisation claim an “intolerable direct challenge” to the international community.</p>

<p>US state department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, saying it was an intelligence matter, but he told reporters the US takes Pyongyang’s rhetoric seriously. </p>

<p>He said the North Korean leader, who is thought to be in his early thirties, needs to pay more attention to the needs of his people rather pursue “reckless capabilities.”</p>

<p>North Korea warned on Monday of pre-emptive nuclear strikes after the United States and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea">South Korea</a> began the war games, which are to continue until the end of April.</p>

<p>North Korea has previously said it has nuclear warheads small enough to put on long-range missiles capable of striking the US mainland, but experts have questioned those claims.</p>

<p>The round object shown in the photos appears to be a model of a warhead trigger device which would contain uranium or plutonium, according to nuclear expert Whang Joo-ho of Kyung Hee university in South Korea. </p>

<p>He said it was obviously a model because Kim and others would not stand near an actual device because of concerns about radioactivity.</p>

<p>Karl Dewey, a senior analyst for IHS Jane’s, a defence and aerospace publishing company, said the sphere could be a simple implosion weapon, possibly with hydrogen isotopes added to make it more efficient.</p>

<p>“It is unlikely that the object in the photo is a thermonuclear bomb [also referred to as a hydrogen bomb],” he said in a statement. “Thermonuclear weapons are multistage devices and in modern weapons the need to place two separate stages together would result in a more oblong-like structure.”</p>

<p>Also shown in the photos is a KN-08 ballistic missile or its model, which reportedly has an estimated range of 10,000km (6,200 miles), according to South Korean analysts. </p>

<p>The KN-08, which North Korea showed off in 2012, is said to be capable of being launched from a road-mobile vehicle, which would make it difficult to monitor via satellite. The South Korean Defense Ministry said it believes the missile hasn’t been proven functional.</p>

<p>North Korea says it tested its first <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/north-korea-rocket-launch-us-reaction-john-kerry">hydrogen bomb on January 6</a>, followed last month by the launch of a rocket that<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/north-korea-launches-long-range-rocket-it-claims-is-carrying-a-satellite"> put a satellite into orbit</a> but which violated UN resolutions because it employs dual-use technology that could also be applied to long-range ballistic missiles.</p>

<p>North Korea’s development of smaller nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has long been a matter of concern and could shake up the security balance in Asia.<br/></p>

Okay list the number countries China has changed regime or started wars or bribed or twisted the arm of for its own gain and compare it the US or are you to blinded by McCarthyism and willing to bed over for your US masters who will fuck you over if they could make some money with a phrase of " As long as I make a buck, I don't give a fuck". And it is very Ironic you talk about hypocrisy and the US when they are the ones pointing the finger at people and acting like they are the righteous ones when they are not.

I remember the 1980's and looking at all those Eastern European tyrants such as Ceausescu, Honecker, Enver Hoxha, Jaruzelski and Brezhnev and thinking that would never change either. When it did though, it all happened surprisingly quickly. As you say, China-US relations are rather strained at the moment, but that could well change in the future.

The same might happen to him but the fat kid seems to have such a grip on power, and is preventively purging his surroundings that one wonder how things are going to change. Added to that the fact that the China-US relations being more strained than ever, China will probably want to preserve the North Korean buffer headed by its buffoon.

The difference is, the North Koreans are starving and enslaving their population for their pitiful military, while South Koreans are wealthy, happy and well fed. The war is still going on because North Korea is so stupid, so it wouldnt even take a new declaration of war for the US to roll up the Norks if they get too obnoxious. The US wont strike first, but if the Norks push it far enough, there will be a reaction.

We were suppose to split up in 1861, 1965, and 1990. We didn't and we won't ever. The only way to get the world you want is through an invasion and occupation of the US. You don't have the army or the stomach for that.

It was the Americans fault that Korea was split up as the Americans in fully fledged McCarthyism paranoia feared the spread of communism.

You are right, but I think that the USA will disintegrate before it will have time or the leisure to start World War III. And it will be a relief to the World. There will be no more drones killing people in many countries; there will no longer be an American army and navy parading stupidly in the plains of South Korea, Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Persia, etc. Korea will be whole again and colour revolutions will end.

Your absolutely correct but so many people want to toe the US narrative and refuse to see it any other way just like the disputed islands where its a reactive move against the US military build up or "Asian Pivot" but is portrayed in western media as offensive.

The US will continue to provoke North Korea until they react and use it as a basis to start a proxy war which will cause economic problems for China who the US fears will over take them and will do anything to stop them because of American geopolitical arrogance and financial greed.

Surrender now. It's time South Korea just gave up it's futile battle with the North and invited the Kim to take over and show them the enlightenment that is the family enterprise known as the DPRK. This will undoubtedly initiate (hasten) the political collapse on the North Korean family enterprise.
