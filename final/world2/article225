Fianna Fáil rules out Fine Gael coalition as Irish election count continues




DateTime::::2016-02-28T12:32:50+0000



<p>Fianna Fáil, which is expected to emerge as the main winner in Ireland’s most uncertain general election for decades, has ruled out a coalition with Fine Gael, as votes continue to be counted.<br/></p>

<p>Fianna Fáil, the main opposition party before the election, will also not seek to form an alternative coalition with <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein">Sinn Féin</a>, which is hovering at 14-15% of the vote and will secure more than 20 deputies in the next Dáil – the best ever performance for Gerry Adams’s party in the Irish Republic.</p>

<p>Senior sources in Fianna Fáil, which expects to double its representation from 21 TDs in the last parliament to around 41 this time, said they would resist pressure to force them into government with their old Irish civil war enemies Fine Gael.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/irish-election-results-show-fine-gael-misread-public-mood">Irish election results show Fine Gael misread public mood</a> </p>

<p>“It doesn’t suit Fianna Fáil to enter into government and hand over the leadership of the opposition to Sinn Féin. And Micheál Martin [the Fianna Fáil leader] will not countenance going into government with Sinn Féin. If Fine Gael are the biggest single party, it will be up to them to find partners among the independents and smaller parties,” one party source told the Guardian.</p>

<p>Fine Gael entered the election alongside its coalition partner Labour with the biggest majority in the history of the Irish state. But this contest has proven to be disastrous for both parties. In the 2011 election, Fine Gael was returned with 73 seats and Labour with 33. This time it is expected Fine Gael will get over 50 while Labour will struggle to get into double digits.</p>

<p>Former Fine Gael luminaries say part of the blame for the party’s poor showing is popular anger over austerity policies imposed in the early years of the coalition government to plug a multibillion-euro gap in the national finances. </p>

<p>The former leader Alan Dukes also criticised the party’s election strategy, especially the focus on the need to protect the economic recovery when so many voters had not yet experienced any upturn.</p>

<p>“In some ways it’s not surprising that the vote was down given all that has happened in the last five years but it’s a bit of a shock to find out that it’s quite down so far,” Dukes said. “I think it’s partly a reaction to what had to be done over the last five years. As the president of the European commission [Jean-Claude Juncker ] said some time ago, we know what to do, the trouble is getting re-elected after we do it, and I think there is a very strong element of that here.</p>

<p>“Also, there were some problems with the way that the campaign was run. Some of the messaging was not well handled. The campaign had a number of faults in it.”</p>

<p>Dukes was the architect of a political strategy in the late 1980s that saw Fine Gael support a minority Fianna Fáil government to allow the administration to deal with a recession. It earned credit for acting in the national interest. </p>

<p>One option on the table for Martin, the Fianna Fáil leader, is to copy that strategy and allow a minority Fine Gael government to rule alongside independents while promising not to bring the coalition down in a confidence vote.</p>

<p>Another option would be to run a second general election. Sinn Féin’s Adams has told his party activists to prepare for that scenario.</p>

<p>His deputy, Mary Lou McDonald, said Sinn Féin would not be a minority party in the next government. “We will not be the facilitators or enablers of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to run rampant across an unequal society. In other words, we are very different from Labour in that respect,” she said.</p>

<p>With 95 out of 158 Dáil seats filled by mid-morning on Sunday, the state of the parties was: Fine Gael 28, Fianna Fáil 28, independents 14, Sinn Féin 13, Labour 4, Anti-Austerity Alliance/People Before Profit 4, Social Democrats 3, Green party 2, and others 1. </p>

I won't change your mind, but the latest group of immigrants to cross over into Greece are mostly women and children. That came after it was announced that it would be made harder for Syrian and other accepted asylum seekers to get family reunion visas - result, some of the most vulnerable attempt the crossing during the winter months and more people die. No country wants to be overrun by asylum seekers, but nevertheless, the west did its share to destabilise the middle east, and we'll have to offer some help to the people that are now displaced by war. There are no easy answers to this problem.

You are correct about the refusal of the British political establishment and media to call the state in the south "Ireland" and using terms such as "Eire", "Republic of Ireland" and "Irish Republic". This goes as far back as a cabinet meeting chaired by Clement Attlee (I'm a huge fan by the way) in 1949 in response to Ireland declaring itself a republic "N.I. [Northern Ireland] Ministers accepted the name "N.I." eventually (the Northern Ireland Government would have preferred the name Ulster). They wanted us, however, to go on using "Eire" (for the Irish state). But other countries won't do so. Suggested therefore we sh[oul]d use "Republic of Ireland". N.I. prefer "Irish Republic". But let us not speak of "Ireland". Can we put Republic of Ireland on Bill: but use in official pp. [papers] etc. (:) Irish Republic or Southern Ireland. Agreed."This policy continued right on down to the Good Friday agreement when the British government finally agreed to call the state Ireland. However the media in the UK have been a bit slower on the uptake on this one!

Except of course this government has brought in taxes and charges that hit the poor hardest. Vat increases, water tax, property tax, prescription fees, college tuition, cuts to social welfare for the young and single mothers, an end to subsidizing further education, the list really is endless. All this while lowering the top rate of tax. They did what they could while they were there to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted. And they want gratitude!

Yes. Essentially the policies were constrained by the Troika anyway, which FF had already agreed to. The 'recovery' was Dublin centric and based on a spillover of QE from US and UK, low Euro and renewed property bubble. Labour could have reaped water and property tax discontent, instead they gleefully implemented them.

I said after the last election that Labour made a mistake going into coalition with FG. It was still thinking like a minority party when it was the second largest and should have taken the role of opposition. That might have finally broken Ireland out of the old civil war political divisions and placed Labour in a strong position to capitalise on any disenchantment with the government this time around.

Ireland has one of the most progressive tax regimes in the world. 52% marginal tax rates on income over €33,800.If you are a PAYE worker and make 30k a year you take home 25k. 83% of gross.60k a year you take home 41k. 68% of gross.90k a year you take home 56k. 62% of gross.120k a year you take home 70k. 58% of gross.The very definition of progressive I would think.

I disagree. The confusion you speak about is a manufactured one. There are two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, one is called Ireland and the other is called northern Ireland. The british press have a very hard time accepting that the Irish choose to call their country by the name of 'Ireland'. The colonial mindset hasn't gone away you know?

Perhaps its has something to do with the fact that roughly half of the population of the north of Ireland identify as Irish and are entitled to an Irish passport. Are you suggesting that they should not be entitled to vote in that particular part of the UK because they identify as Irish?

It's thanks to the British that we have the insane electoral system we have. Their demand in the Treaty negotiations that STV be the electoral system of the new state has been a disaster. Dev tried to change it to First Past the Post in a referendum in 1959, and then Lynch tried it again in 1968, but in both instances the proposed change went down in flames. The Irish people are wedded to an electoral system that was imposed by the British in 1921, an electoral system that chooses losers rather than winners, the idea that you can recycle your vote and put someone you didn't initially put down as your first choice over the line is ridiculous. It's a fucking joke, unfortunately, the joke is on us.

Can't say what's in the constitution but I've never heard of the Irish president doing any of that. He invites various people in for tea usually.

The President's power is very limited in every respect. The power resides in the Dail. They reconvene on the 10th of March to elect, first a speaker, then a Taoiseach, who then chooses his cabinet. Though in the coalition era this has meant engaging with other parties to form a majority that is viable and then flesh out a program for government. So by the time the Dail convenes an agreed candidate for speaker and Taoiseach has majority support. There is no chance that given the time frame and the complexity of these election results, with government formation hinging on a willingness of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail to do business with one another, that a new speaker or Taoiseach will be elected. However the current speaker from the outgoing Dail remains to organize the business of the House, with the only order of business his replacement, but he can in the mean time suspend the Dail until the following day and so on. The current government also remains in place until a Taoiseach has been voted in by the new Dail. It'll become apparent rather quickly after the Dail is convened whether a new government can be formed, if not, then Enda Kenny as the current Taoiseach, has the sole power within his Constitutional remit to head to the Phoenix Park and ask the President to dissolve the Dail and signal that the country is going back to the polls with three weeks from this young Dail's dissolution. That will likely mark the 32nd Dail as the shortest is Irish history. The President can refuse, however, he is not a passive observer or un-cognizant of the realities of the drama within the Dail and its inability to form a government, he'll factor the reality that the current configured Dail cannot execute its first order of business, the election of a speaker, or secondly, that of Taoiseach, concluding the need to once again consult the people with a new election. There has never been a instance thus far of a President refusing a Taoiseach's request to dissolve the Dail. There has been much discussion that in 1994, President Mary Robinson was minded to refuse Albert Reynolds a dissolution of the Dail, when his Fianna Fail-Labour government collapsed, but he never sought that dissolution, because when the Dail convened to place a motion of no confidence in Reynolds, the Labour Party had already struck a deal with John Bruton's Fine Gael and Democratic Left Party to form the Rainbow coalition. The only instance in Irish history that a fallen or full-term government was not followed by a dissolution and election.

The answer is very simple and concise. The Irish Civil War of 1922-23. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail were born from the Treaty split in 1922, over the issues of partition and the oath of allegiance, though most people were resigned to partition, the oath of allegiance however was a more problematically sell for many. These divisions split Sinn Fein in two, Micheal Collins advocating acceptance, thus pro-treaty, and Eamon de Valera, arguing for rejection, thus anti-treaty. The Dail accepted the Treaty, and the people ratified it through a popular vote as well, with more pro-treaty deputies elected to the succeeding Dail. But anti-treaty forces refused to accept the electoral result and resorted to oppose the treaty in arms, thus setting up a confrontation with pro-treaty forces, which came to ahead when anti-treaty forces stormed and occupied the Four Courts in Dublin. With little resolution to the crisis other than conflict, pro-treaty, Free State army forces, shelled and stormed the Four Courts to flush out the anti-treaty forces. This signaled the start of a short but bloody civil war between both sides which embittered Irish politics for generations, and to a very great extent is still keenly felt within both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail today, though not Irish society more widely, with the civil war having little modern resonance.

Ceremonial monarchs and presidents across the world have small powers that come in to play during elections e.g. the King of Spain is currently trying to get someone to form a government, the King of Belgium famously spent over a year trying to, and the President of Portugal famously tried to stop anti-EU parties from forming a government.I am asking if the Irish President, being a Labour politician, will have a say, even only in a summoning sense, over whether Labour will or will not be in a coalition?

Perhaps, but if your looking at it from the point of view of whether there's any political advantage in raising it as an issue, there isn't yet because Irish people don't have enough exposure to the issue to care yet.

I don't see that as a realistic concern. Enda Kenny's party is politically the closest to Angela Merkel; what he offered (a token amount, while retaining the opt-out) was a good diplomatic move, but will probably have zero impact on Ireland overall. I don't know what the maximum acceptable number of Syrian refugees would be, but if you assume that Ireland could take 1 family per town above a certain number of inhabitants, you'd arrive at a number somewhat higher than 4000.I can't see a FG/FF coalition government offering to take a substantially higher quota in the future if Fine Gael/Labour didn't.

FG & FF formed from the remnants of the Irish civil war. FG Pro Treaty & FF Anti Treaty. No real ideological differences between them currently. FG have always been centre right and appeal to a mainly middle class rural vote. FF slightly more populist and can position themselves as centre left (this election) or centre right (Celtic Tiger) and appeal to a more lower middle class / working class vote. FF traditionally the more successful of the two but generally seen as slightly more corrupt although things have somewhat improved since the cowboy days of the 80's on that front. SF as you possibly already know come from the Provisional IRA movement in the North and represent the political wing of that organisation. The official wing was eventually gobbled up by Labour in the 90's. SF are a mid left wing (less left than they were) party with a United Ireland as the overall objective but mainly defined by their opposition to everything FF or FG do with an almost exclusively working class vote. Not really trusted yet by the electorate as they never seem to be able to break a magical 20% but becoming more sophisticated all the time. Probably need to dump Adams as leader and all that baggage to make the next step. Labour who are the oldest political party were formed from the Tade Union movement and represent 2 strands of the Irish left (liberal intellectual types / trade unionists). Mainly based in around Dublin although they have a national presence. They'll do business with FG or FF to get into power (usually FG as there are trust issues with FF) but inevitably pay the price at the ballot box for abandoning their ideological convictions while in government. The rest are a mish mash of small parties and independents who have either lost the whip in the major parties , come from local dynasties , single issue candidates or form loose affiliations with the extreme left AAA/PBP. It used to be a 2 and 1/2 party system up until the 2000's (FF , FG & Labour) but the feeling is now that we're slowly crabbing towards a more European style classic left / right divide. Hope that answers some of your questions and thanks for taking an interest.

I believe that taxation on savings, property and inheritance was vastly increased over the past 8 years or so as well as there being progressive rates on USC, meaning that weath was taxed far more and the wealthier sections of society in Ireland were subjected to far more taxation. However it is alays covenient for some to use nothing but income tax as a measuring stick.

Its complicated Queenie. Both FG and FF are centre right parties with little ideological difference between them. They represented pro and anti sides towards the treaty with the British after the 1920s war of independence. Both FF and FG realise coalition would highlight their similarities, move Irish politics to division based on political ideology, eliminating the need for two centre right parties, and reducing their seats at the next election. After playing the junior partner in an austerity government, Labour have been virtually wiped out. Sinn Fein, the other leftwing alternative, suffer from a lack of trust because of their IRA associations. The other complication is the large number of independents and minor parties - of the left and right - winning seats on an 'anybody but FF/FG' ticket or on anti austerity tickets. Herding them to make a coherent coalition looks near impossible.
