Fianna Fáil truce will allow Kenny to continue as taoiseach




DateTime::::2016-02-28T19:33:31+0000



<p>Ireland’s largest opposition party, Fianna Fáil, will respect a “political ceasefire” to allow Fine Gael’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny">Enda Kenny</a> to continue as taoiseach, sources inside the party said on Sunday night after most of the votes had been counted in the most indecisive Irish general election for decades.</p>

<p>Fianna Fáil will not enter a coalition with its rival but will avoid bringing down a minority Fine Gael-led administration in the short to medium term, the Guardian has learned, after an election that has produced no possibility of any coalition holding a majority.</p>

<p>This would allow Kenny to remain as prime minister for the centenary commemorations of the 1916 Easter Rising and for Fine Gael to govern for at least a year, thus avoiding another election in the new few weeks or months. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/irish-election-results-show-fine-gael-misread-public-mood">Irish election results show Fine Gael misread public mood</a> </p>

<p>The Dáil will meet on 10 March to elect a new taoiseach but no new government, not even an minority one, is expected to be formed until the end of the month.</p>

<p>In return Fianna Fáil would reform the Irish parliament, allocating more powers for members of the Dáil, or TDs, to scrutinise government legislation and crucially allowing the opposition to have some input into the shape of this year’s budget.</p>

<p>“There are two things in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland">Ireland</a> that bring any government down: a vote of no confidence and a government’s inability to set a budget. If conditions are met to allow for real Dáil reform and the opposition is allowed to scrutinise and have input in relation to the budget then there will be no votes of no confidence,” one veteran Fianna Fáil source said.</p>

<p>Fianna Fáil expects to re-enter Dáil on 10 March with about 42 to 44 seats, while Fine Gael will still be the largest party with about 51 to 52 seats, the source said.</p>

<p>There has been pressure for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, mainly from Dublin media commentators, to form a “grand coalition” along the lines of the Christian Democrat-Social Democrat government in Germany, and in turn bury the bitter divisions between them that are rooted in the Irish civil war.</p>

<p>Instead, there is likely to be a political truce that will last for at least a year if Fianna Fáil’s conditions are met. But the party would not take up any ministerial positions or sit in a cabinet with Fine Gael having the final say in decisions.</p>

<p>“Fianna Fáil would still be on the opposition benches and still holding a minority Fine Gael government to account,” the source said.</p>

<p>Another source saidit would be “utter madness” for Fianna Fáil to link up officially with Fine Gael in government and hand over the leadership of the opposition to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein">Sinn Féin</a>.</p>

<p>The leader of Fianna Fáil, Micheál Martin, who is widely regarded to have had the best campaign of the four main party chiefs, as well as former Fianna Fáil ministers such as Willie O’Dea and a number of newly elected TDs, have come forward over the weekend to dismiss speculation of formally joining Fine Gael in government.</p>

<p>By early evening Sunday, the breakdown in terms of seats for the parties was projected as: 51 for Fine Gael, 44 for Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin on 24, Others, ranging from left-wing parties to independents, are expected to win 34 seats and Labour five.</p>

<p>For Kenny and Fine Gael this has been a disastrous election, given that they and their Labour coalition partners took power five years ago with the largest majority in post-independence history. Fine Gael had 73 seats and will lose at least 20, while Labour has crashed from a historic high of 33 in 2011 to under 10, possibly even as low as six seats.</p>

<p>One of the biggest casualties of the backlash against Fine Gael in particular was the loss of a seat for Dr James Reilly, who was minister for health between 2011 and 2014. He lost Dublin Fingal to Sinn Féin and acknowledged that this was mainly due to the austerity cuts the coalition imposed to plug the hole in the national finances.</p>

<p>“My time in health would not have been exactly helpful. But the country had no money and hard decisions had to be made,” Reilly said.</p>

<p>He avoided questions at the Fingal count about the future of Kenny’s leadership and conduct during the campaign. The electorally bruised taoiseach, portrayed in one newspaper today with his head superimposed on a picture of a badly injured Irish rugby player, performed poorly in all three live television debates in the three-week battle. </p>

<p>Sinn Féin has been a big beneficiary of Labour’s catastrophic drop in support, with Gerry Adams’s party up to 14% of the vote and about 24 seats. But other leftwing parties such as the Anti-Austerity Alliance, People Before Profit and the Social Democrats saw their share of the vote and seats rise. However, Sinn Féin’s aim of supplanting Fianna Fáil as the leading opposition force at the ballot box in the year of the Easter Rising centenary has not been realised.</p>

<p>The deputy leader of Sinn Féin, Mary Lou McDonald, challenged the two major parties to coalesce in a new government while emphasising that her party had no interest in entering any administration with either of them.</p>

<p>“We will not be the facilitators or enablers of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to run rampant across an unequal society – in other words we are very different from Labour in that respect,” the Sinn Féin TD said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a former media adviser to Fine Gael and PR campaign director for President Mary Robinson in the early 1990s has criticised the party’s decision to hire consultants from the British Conservative party for the election.</p>

<p>Eoghan Harris, who helped run Robinson’s successful election to the Irish presidency in 1991, said: “The coalition brought in Tory advisers. But political advice is seldom a ‘one-size-fits-all’ affair and I doubt they understood Irish political culture … The very fact that Fine Gael thought Tory advisers could help showed how totally out of touch with Irish people they are.</p>

<p>“Possibly influenced by Tory consultants, Fine Gael ran a low-tax campaign that presumed a selfish electorate. In contrast, Micheál Martin, leader of Fianna Fáil, took a huge risk and prioritised public services over tax cuts. Recent polls confirmed that Martin read the public mood right as a big majority put improved health and social services well above tax cuts.”</p>

<p>Some of the counts across the 40 constituencies of the republic are expected to continue until Monday due to Ireland’s single transferrable vote system. One illustration of the marathon nature of the counts can be seen in Dublin Central, where the last seat was won by the independent candidate Maureen O’Sullivan, who had to wait until the 11th count in the early hours of Sunday morning before it was confirmed that she was going back to the Dáil.</p>

"Hundreds of people"? That's amazing, given that the sources I've read tend to estimate about 350 civilian deaths in the 26 county-area, and the Brits accounted for a hell of a lot of them (ever heard of Bloody Sunday in Croke Park?).As to those civilians killed by the IRA in 1919-21, well, the British have never really come out and confirmed how many had been spies and informers of theirs. Given the efficiency of the IRA's intelligence at the time, it wouldn't surprise me in the least if the majority of the civilians targeted were indeed either engaged in intelligence-gathering for the British, or alternatively were prominent supporters of the Union and of Orangeism. Of course, maybe you are taking your info from Peter Hart, but in that case, why don't you just cite the official history of the Essex Regiment or of the B-Specials and have done?True atrocities like the La Mon, Enniskillen, Guildford and Woolwich, Birmingham, Warrington etc. were very much more typical of the Provos than of Collins' IRA.

So you do want to keep capitalism. How "radical" is that ? Spare me from "leftists" who think they can run capitalism better then the capitalists! Neoliberalism is not "dying", and the capitalists would only return to the pro capitalist Keynesian model, if they felt that it was to their advantage to do so. Neither neoliberalism nor Keynesianism, can work in the longer term. Both result in economic collapse.It was the collapse of Keynesianism in the mid 1970`s, that made the capitalists return to neoliberalism.A wealth tax is puny, and still leaves the economy in the hands of the capitalists---and capitalism. It would not work.

If they agreed and joined up imediately, we would have an instant monolith of sorts, and nothing to argue about. Anybody my age, who would have attended an Irish cattle fair, will remember the nodding, frowning, walking back to show disdain, the hand-shaking after spitting on palms, the eventual arms-about-shoulder of the cattle buyers and the walk to the nearest pub. There are no cattle fairs any more, but the art of bargaining has, thankfully, remained in our system, thus we have the 'stalemate', which will only last as long as the parties wish it to do.

What's any of that got to do with the number of 'disappeared' ? Up to 100 were disappeared in West Cork in 1920-21 alone. Compare that with 17 from 1970-81.As for your link, of the amount of civilians listed as killed, the Provos weren't responsible for the majority of them. Of the 249 civilian deaths in 1972 they were responsible for about 65. Most were carried out by Loyalists and the British Army.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1972.html

You're eligible if you're a TD. Their pensions are calculated by dividing their salary by 40 and multiplying it by however many years they served. Whips, Junior Ministers, Ministers etc get top-ups.

Agreed. If they thought they were almost wiped out as a result of their role* in the banking crisis, they will be obliterated if they govern with FG to keep Kenny et al in power. We need a fairer society which actually gives a crap about the poor, sick and elderly. Not a society that strips people of their dignity and self-respect.

Yes, and according to the link I provided, the number of civilians killed by the IRA in the 3 years from January 1919 onwards - in an all-Ireland conflict, involving 4.4 million people - is something around the same are as those killed in Northern Ireland, with just over a third of that population, in the 3 years from Bloody Sunday onwards:http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/troubles/deaths_by_year.html

Media bias regarding the electoral process represents as much of a threat to our society as our financial solvency. Media ownership, editorial balance and a uniquely myopic approach to the alleged historical transgressions of some politicians are not headline grabbing issues. However, such bias can have a profound impact on the balance of power here. Just three of many examples of inconsistency make uncomfortable reading. In 2012 Senator John Kelly said that the truth about the murder of Fr Niall Malloy in 1985 would, ‘rock the foundations of the State’. The Irish Independent reported in 20012, “senior Fianna Fail politicians were in the house on the evening of the priest's murder, one of them a well-known household name and close friend of the Flynn’s. The original Garda investigation was botched and shambolic. Vital evidence was contaminated, bizarre statements were taken and given and key witnesses were never interviewed” The subsequent behaviors of the (politically appointed ) Judiciary in this case was equally bizarre. The Irish Times reported last year, “A high level Government-commissioned review has concluded that no further inquiry into the matter is warranted because the passage of time makes it impractical”. So, the mere ‘passage of time’ can put pay to a murder investigation and the subsequent, alleged establishment cover-up? “ Take too, the strange case of Pádraig Flynn, former minister and EU commissioner, who, according to the Mahon Tribunal final report transcript, was guilty of profound abuse of public office, "having wrongfully and corruptly sought a substantial donation from (developer) Tom Gilmartin for the Fianna Fáil Party, and having been paid IR£50,000 by Mr Gilmartin for that purpose, proceeded to utilise the money for his personal benefit". In this case, Flynn was known to have used the corrupt payment to buy a farm with his wife in Mayo. Receiving a corrupt payment is an offence in law, as is failing to declare income for taxation purposes. However, to date, no charges have been preferred. We know from the recent Tom Murphy case just how serious an offence tax evasion is. So why aren’t Fianna Fail politicians asked during every television and radio interview to answer questions about the people who killed Fr. Malloy, who was present on the night of his murder, and why no one was ever prosecuted for his murder? Why aren’t Fianna Fail politicians asked on every occasion to explain why Pádraig Flynn hasn’t been charged with his alleged corruption and tax evasion? The Moriarity Tribunal concluded, regarding the behaviour of Former Minister Michael Lowry and the awarding of the States second mobile phone licence, "beyond doubt" that Lowry gave what it termed "substantive information to Denis O'Brien, of significant value and assistance to him in securing the license". The Tribunal report found that Lowry, displayed "an appreciable interest" in the process and had "irregular interactions with interested parties at its most sensitive stages". It also found that one of Lowry's interventions, which cut the selection process to the advantage of Esat, was "disgraceful" and "insidious", and that he had misled the Government, his party leader John Bruton and his own civil servants to influence the selection process in Esat's favour”. This matter, the degree to which businessman Denis O’Brien owes his vast wealth to an act of abuse of public office, is perhaps the most under-examined of these three examples of corruption in Irish public life. No fair minded observer would deny that Sinn Fein are pummeled for its past in a way that Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are not. The relentless pursuit of Sinn Fein leaders for past, alleged transgressions has no context in the current political debate, dominated as it is by an ongoing financial crisis, homelessness crisis, ongoing payments to foreign banks when our health service remains desperately underfunded. If it is deemed by those with editorial control to have context, then the issues described above also require relentless pursuit.
