Irish election: exit poll shows no overall majority for ruling coalition




DateTime::::2016-02-26T15:51:54+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland">Ireland</a> may be facing a second general election as an exit poll from one of the country’s most reputed media organisations has found that the Fine Gael-Labour coalition has fallen far short of a working majority.</p>

<p>An Irish Times/MRBI exit poll released on Friday night found that the ruling Fine Gael party is less than 4% ahead of the main opposition force, Fianna Fáil.</p>

<p>According to the results of the poll, taken among a sample of more than 5,000 voters outside 200 polling stations across the Republic on Friday, Fine Gael has 26.1% of first preference votes.<br/></p>

<p>The exit poll shows a considerable gain for Fianna Fáil with 22.9%. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein">Sinn Féin</a>, meanwhile, has gained four points from its 10% performance in the 2011 general election.</p>

<p>Labour, who have been Fine Gael’s partners in government for the last five years, are on 7.8% according to the exit poll. <br/></p>

<p>The seat projections from the poll indicate that Fine Gael would return with roughly 56 seats, while Labour will come back to the Dáil, the Irish parliament, with between eight to 12 seats. Even at its highest estimate, a combined Fine Gael/Labour vote of 68 would be 12 short of an overall majority.<br/></p>

<p>The exit poll does indicate that an amalgam of independents are on more than 16%. They could play the role of kingmakers in any new coalition although such a government would be politically unstable. <br/></p>

<p>For Fianna Fáil the result is a remarkable turnaround in fortunes from a party that suffered a historic defeat in 2011 and only returned 21 TDs to the last Dáil. This time, according to the exit poll figures, Fianna Fáil could return with 40 seats. </p>

<p>A second exit poll will be published early on Saturday from RTE and will be a further indicator if this election has produced a hung parliament in Dublin. Ballot boxes are opened at 9am for counting across the Republic. <br/></p>

<p>The overall result may not be clear until Sunday or even Monday..<br/></p>

<p>More than 3 million people have been eligible to vote in 40 constituencies, and there are 552 candidates contesting 157 seats in the Dáil..</p>

<p>Some commentators have called on Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to create a “grand coalition”, on the same lines as the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats when they came together to govern Germany.</p>

<p>However, leading figures in ruling party Fine Gael, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/24/irish-general-election-fianna-fail-leo-varadkar-fine-gael">including health minister Leo Varadkar</a>, have described such a coalition as a “nightmare”. Fine Gael and its Labour coalition partners instead appealed to voters to return them to power in the name of stable government. <br/></p>

<p>The taoiseach, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny">Enda Kenny</a>, returned to his native County Mayo on Friday and cast his vote at a polling station in Castlebar. He would make history if he is re-elected, as since the state was created in 1921 no Fine Gael taoiseach has been returned for a second term of office.</p>

<p>Speaking after casting his vote, Kenny said: “I just hope that everybody around the country accepts their responsibility today and that people go out and vote and do their constitutional duty.”<br/></p>

<p>The Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, cast his vote with his family in Ballinlough, Cork, refusing to talk about any potential electoral outcomes but predicting a good result for his party. </p>

<p>Fourteen years of continuous Fianna Fáil rule came to an end when the party <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/26/fianna-fail-irish-general-election">was trounced at the 2011 election</a> – its worst electoral showing in the republic’s history. The party took a hammering from an electorate that blamed it for the collapse of the Celtic Tiger and the loss of fiscal sovereignty to the International Monetary Fund.</p>

<p>This time around, all opinion polls – now supported by the exit poll – have forecast that Fine Gael will retain its No 1 spot and that the electorate will punish Labour for the coalition’s austerity programme, which has caused widespread anger, particularly over the imposition of water rates for the first time in the country’s history.</p>

<p>Sinn Féin is expected to capitalise on much of this anger, as will a number of leftist parties and an amalgam of independents. The Labour leader and deputy prime minister, Joan Burton, is in danger of losing her Dublin West seat.</p>

<p>Any coalition needs at least 79 seats to form a government. A Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil link-up would produce a huge working majority. </p>

<p>Although Northern Ireland has not been a major issue in this election, the spectre of the Troubles raised its head again on Friday morning at a polling station in the village of Hackballscross in County Louth. <br/></p>

<p>Photographers who had arrived from Dublin to take pictures of former IRA commander Thomas “Slab” Murphy after he voted were warned not to by a Murphy associate. Hours later <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/ex-ira-commander-thomas-slab-murphy-jailed-tax-evasion">Murphy was sentenced in Dublin</a> to 18 months in jail over tax evasion. </p>

what are you on about? You do realise that Ireland has been spending many billions more on "social welfare, public sector pay, pensions" than it has been getting in taxes since 2008? That money actually has to come from somewhere you know? Really, this is very basic stuff! At the depths of the crisis the state was spending 55bn on basic services while only collecting 35bn. Do you see the difference? Do you understand that the money that makes up that difference has to be borrowed from those nasty capitalist market?

There has been growing persuasion by leading media figures for a FG/FF coalition. The argument is that the Belfast Agreement removed the ff deValera article in the Irish constitution claiming Northern Ireland. But there is no move towards this so far by both parties who remain convinced there are major differences. FG is centre right and FF centre left with a few minor differences. The fear is the party of violence and envy,Sinn Fein, will want to be in coalition and wreck the country more. The national debt is 212 billion euro as it is. The vote expressed indignity for economic policies the ECB and IMF brought in to bail out the country and by and large they have been effective in restoring growth.

Please...whatever anti Irish sentiment your making out exists in the UK is a drop in the ocean compared to the anti English sentiment in Ireland (scratch the surface indeed, you'll not need to scratch far)..which is usually aimed at second generation Anglo Irish that are naive enough to think they will get a welcome in the ol sod, but if you've an English accent your a Brit end of story...But as your gonna persist with the victim status, much like the Isralies and not even the majority of Ireland has time for them (anyone for a Gaza flotilla)...it's not the 1970's or 80's and no there isn't much anti Irish feeling in the UK these days, not with most people under 50 anyway and anyone older that with "racist" tendencies would typically rather the country was flooded with the Irish rather than Muslims don't you know..if there was any significant prejudice against the Irish in the UK you wouldn't have seen the explosion in Irish theme pubs in the 90's rather than explosions in British themed ones in the 70's.Unfortunately some people can only define themselves as a victim and without that badge they wouldn't know what to do with themselves...I mean it's a whole persona were talking about here and one to pass along to the kids and grandkids...you know like in Northern Ireland...where it's full of Irish born in the same country but still needing walls to segregate themselves from each other...

Author::::Readout_Noise

It's just been pointed out on RTE TV that the 46% of voters in the exit poll wanted Fine Gael in government in some form - either alone or in various coalition combinations.

Why, it's a voting nun! All that's needed now to complete this refreshingly uncliched picture of life in contemporary Ireland is a pair of grubby-faced, barefooted urchins atop a donkey-drawn cart, patiently awaiting the emergence of their flat-capped father (no votes for women as we know), sporting an ink-stained thumb whose illiterate, calloused hand has never held a writing implement. Christ on a bike! (that's how he gets around in Ireland, we've never seen cars). Just kidding really, I'm not so sensitive that I'm actually offended.
