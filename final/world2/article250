How Eritrea is turning to Dutch courts to silence its critics




DateTime::::2016-03-01T12:56:35+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> quiet but well orchestrated campaign is under way in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/netherlands">Netherlands</a> as individuals associated with the Eritrean government try to use the Dutch courts to silence its critics.</p>

<p>Eight such court cases have been launched against liberal newspapers, a radio station, a website, the Dutch government and an academic who have criticised its authoritarian regime.</p>

<p>The cases have been initiated by leaders of the youth wing of Eritrea’s ruling party, the Young People’s Front for Democracy and Justice, but the campaign appears to be guided by senior government officials, including some close to the president, Isaias Afewerki.</p>

<p>Last year Yemane Gebreab, President Isaias’s closest adviser, told 550 young Eritreans attending the party’s youth rally in Germany that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgybg30fyRo">fighting the country’s “enemies”</a> was their top priority.</p>

<p>“Enemies who don’t tire and don’t sleep, who try to bring our downfall … Therefore, our first objective – as YPFDJ and as Eritrean youth, and as community … is to conclusively defeat this hostility hovering over of our nation. That remains the job,” he told the conference. </p>

<p>The first to face the courts in the Netherlands was Mirjam van Reisen, a professor of international relations at the University of Tilburg. As an adviser to the European Union and the UN, Van Reisen is a well-respected Eritrean expert.</p>

<p>In May 2015 the Dutch website <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.oneworld.nl/wereld/ind-laat-aanhangers-eritrees-regime-nog-steeds-tolken">Oneworld.nl published an article</a> claiming that some of the interpreters working for the Dutch immigration service were linked to the Eritrean regime.</p>

<p>Eritreans make up <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/22/eritrea-migrants-child-soldier-fled-what-is-going">the third largest group of people</a> risking the journey across the Mediterranean to Europe, with up to 5,000 leaving every month to flee poverty, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/eritrea">political repression</a> and indefinite military conscription.</p>

<p>The translators were hired to interpret sensitive conversations between officials and refugees seeking asylum. The article claimed that, contrary to Dutch regulations, some translators had ties to the regime that the asylum seekers were fleeing.<br/></p>

<p> “Many Eritrean asylum seekers are immensely traumatised,” Van Reisen was quoted as saying. “When they discover that the interpreters are linked to the regime they fled from, this undermines their trust in protection by the Dutch authorities.”</p>

<p>She said the situation was potentially dangerous. “The interpreters get sensitive information about the asylum seekers through the interviews that they translate. With this information, they may threaten or extort these refugees. Relatives in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eritrea">Eritrea</a> may also be threatened.”</p>

<p>The article identified the brother and sister of the leader of the ruling party’s youth wing as being among those employed as translators. “The interpreters are linked to the centre of the intelligence in the Netherlands and in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>,” Van Reisen was quoted as saying.</p>

<p>In May 2015 the former president of the youth wing, Meseret Bahlbi, filed a charge of libel and slander over the article. He asked for an apology, a correction and compensation of at least €25,000.</p>

<p>But when the case came to court on 10 February the judge found that the youth wing had indeed received instructions from the ruling party, that it supported the Eritrean regime, and that its members’ goals were to “act as informants for [the embassies of] the regime in Eritrea”. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.indepthnews.info/index.php/global-issues/2732-court-rules-in-favour-of-dutch-human-rights-advocate">Bahlbi’s claim was rejected</a> and Van Reisen’s right to freedom of speech was upheld.</p>

<p>Perhaps at least as damaging for the Eritrean government was an admission by Bahlbi in his <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2016:537">submission to the court</a> that the country “is a dictatorship and that torture takes place”.</p>

<p>Bahlbi’s siblings brought another case against the Dutch migration agency on 24 February, but once again the court found against them.</p>

<p>Although these cases backfired, at least six others are still being pursued. There are two cases against the Volkskrant – the Netherlands’ equivalent of the Guardian. The paper was in court on 24 February and judgement will be delivered on 11 March. And there are four other cases against media organisation, including Oneworld and Radio Argos.</p>

<p>Critics of the regime have also been the subject of vociferous attacks by users of social media. Van Reisen has been physically threatened. She and I have both been have been demonised:</p>

<p><span tabindex="-1">The United Nations has reported that the Eritrean government has an extensive network of agents who work for the regime around the world. It has also imposed sanctions against Eritrea for sponsoring attacks on its opponents abroad.</span></p>

<p>In this context the Dutch cases takes on a particularly sinister significance.</p>

China' influence in Africa is growing and that is one of the reasons why the US is taking the actions it is; as a way to frustrate Chinese influence. At the end of the Second World War the US said in its planning documents and in its conversations with its British and European allies, that Latin America and Asia and the Middle East were its to exploit and plunder and Africa was to be allocated to Europe to exploit and plunder to enable Europe to re-build itself on the backs of the African people. But in more recent times the US has realised the vast resources of Africa and have been seeking for the last few decades to re-assert its primacy there. That is why it was supporting the Apartheid regime in South Africa and why it has been supporting various dictatorial regimes around Africa as they exploit their own peoples. It didn't work in South Africa as the Cubans defeated the US supported South African government in Angola and Namibia. It has had more success in a number of other African countries, but also more notable defeats as in Sudan and the Congo.

As you can understand the country of choice had more or less to do with how friendly towards the 'cause' the destination country was, if there were any ties with the said countries (relatives friends etc.) - This was the main reason why USA and Canada and Germany had such an appeal to the Greeks as many people had relatives there and therefore de facto support. To be honest I do not remember any of them mentioning the benefits as their reason for requesting asylum in specific countries. I do not exclude it but nobody said anything about it either.

Star ON Sky, what is the difference between Eritrea and N.Korea.I think it is even worse than N. Korea.Which are lies please? Is it the hundreds of Underground detention centers where thousands of people are being detained for years without justice, where they are tortured and killed.What can you say about Adi Abieto, Mai Edaga, Alla, Aderser, Mietir and others? Are they recreation centers for you? You said Eritrea is unstoppable, it would have been better if you would say PFDJ is unstoppable.I am saying this as am living in Eritrea.What people are saying about Eritrea and the finding of UN Commission of Inquiry on Human rights in Eritrea is just a tip of the iceberg. You guys who are denying what is going on in Eritrea and who are cooperating with PFDJ are playing a great role in the suffering of our people.One day your children will ask you what your role in the current situation in Eritrea was...what will your answer be....am sure you won't have an answer only shame...

I can rightly guess that you are one of the Eritrean regime's mouth pieces, a brain-washed loser and an embarrassing and ignorant cult follower of a murderous thug like the president of Eritrea Afeworki. I reckon your cult hero has gotten way deep in your head like a brain cancer, which you will never be cured from.

I absolutely don't care about Eritrean politics or the regime in place however I cannot stand hypocrisy and liars. The level of idiocy of these young people is mind boggling...1.- if they love their country so much what are they doing in Holland? if you give them free tickets they will absolutely refuse to go back even for a holiday... 2.- when is the last time you saw a Dutch migrant escaping the Netherlands and migrating to Eritrea? 3.- no matter how much they lie they cannot hide the number of migrants leaving the country everyday once they cross the border. The problem of Eritreans is that they cannot separate their love of country and their government ... you can love your country without necessarily supporting the government in place just like Republicans love the US even under the Obama administration. Until you make this distinction you will never ever progress as a country whether you support or agree with the current regime or not...

All that said, people don't flee a place that has security and opportunity. And a dictatorship that practices indefinite conscription while not at war is a slave state. I'm sure, as in places like Mexico, that life at or near the top of society might be reasonably enjoyable. But that lifestyle is surely supported by denying it to the majority. You are surely one of those trolls.

Eritrea is as secretive as North Korea, and sits alongside Pyongyang in global human rights rankings - with no independent media or political opposition. With a cruel and defiant dictator like Isaias Afewerki in power, the prisons are overflowing. Thousands of young people leave the country yearly to escape the harsh regime that for most means a lifetime of service to the state. There are some who had fled to Switzerland, and the Swiss government is trying to gauge whether Eritreans should be granted refugee status. Swiss MPs travelled to Eritrea had all been shown the sunny side of the political situation. Afewerki still has a friend - China, where he received military training in 1966. Last year he received a delegation from China. He underscored the "long-standing relationship" between the two countries and China has invested heavily in cold mines in Eritrea, to help boost the economy.

Ever since the Ethiopian army humiliated Eritrea by breaking through the front lines using donkeys, the Eritrean regime has completely lost its way. It has no direction, no expertise; it's just a vicious sadistic nanny-knows-best tin-pot dictatorship. Its latest boob is failing to provide currency for ordinary people to spend in the markets.

There are Ethiopians who were born in Eritrea, lived there, fled Ethiopia, lived there and then left Ethiopia pretending to be directly from Eritrea. People from outside Eritrea would find it impossible to convince anyone that they were from there.

If the government of the Netherlands really wants to do something good, then it should confront these Eritrean thugs, who are spies of the Eritrean security services, by stripping them of their citizenship, take away their residency permits and deport them back to Eritrea to live with the devil they have chosen to worship and serve. If they cannot do that, then at least the Netherlands' judicial bodies should deal with these frivolous lawsuits by counter-suing these thugs, who are hell bent on intimidating and distracting their institutions. There is no other way to deal with these thugs but by making them realize the consequences of frivolous lawsuits, which wastes precious court resources that can be employed to deal with real and pressing legal matters.

The president of Eritrea calls himself "father of the nation". Then he issues "shoot-to-kill" orders on youth and children fleeing from poverty, despair and state-imposed slave labor. Only a delusional hack would murder Eritrean children and have the craziest and messed up of sensibilities to call himself "father of the nation [Eritrea]".

The west would destroy or try to destroy anything they do not control.http://www.siliconafrica.com/never-trust-the-west-rules-for-african-leaders/ Few rules for our statesmen Rule#1. Never trust what they say. NEVER. Act like if you believe them or trust them, but stick to your plan and deceive if that is in your state interest. (Check the Chinese doctrine on the art of deception). Naiveté is your weakness. Rule#2. Never centralize your society and power. Get autonomous powers all around, which would fight the last mile even when the head is cut. Run a network of equals with gentlemen agreements. Rule#3. Get good in intelligence collection and spread your net. Know how to keep a secret for at least three to five years within a group of trustees. Rule#4. Trade with the world, don’t ask for favor. Favors are more costly. Do your best to be highly independent. Rule#5. Debt is the new military invasion. Limit state debt, and create value with each cent. Rule#6. Get good at backdoor diplomacy. Western politicians are very corrupt. Buy them if needed. They respond very well to few well known incentives. Rule#7. Don’t trust foreign experts. Limit the topics they could work on. Trust your people, local experts and scholars. Help them grow, and outsmart the foreigners. Rule#8. NGOS, UN agencies had never developed any country. Invest in self reliance and push your people to conquer territories. Rule#9. Military is first mission of the statesman. Spend at least two hours with top military experts and literature a week. Make sure you have militarize your thinking and your people. We are living in a dangerous world. Rule#10. Pray like if God exists, but act like if he is dead, or became deaf since Mary got pregnant by the holy spirit. Everyone think Africans are naive and simple people, use that smartly for our interests.
