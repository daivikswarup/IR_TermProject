Revealed: the 30-year economic betrayal dragging down Generation Y’s income




DateTime::::2016-03-07T11:00:14+0000



<p>The full scale of the financial rout facing millennials is revealed today in exclusive new data that points to a perfect storm of factors besetting an entire generation of young adults around the world.</p>

<p>A combination of debt, joblessness, globalisation, demographics and rising house prices is depressing the incomes and prospects of millions of young people across the developed world, resulting in unprecedented inequality between generations.</p>

<p>A Guardian investigation into the prospects of millennials – those born between 1980 and the mid-90s, and often otherwise known as Generation Y – has found they are increasingly being cut out of the wealth generated in western societies.<br/></p>

<p>Where 30 years ago young adults used to earn more than national averages, now in many countries they have slumped to earning as much as 20% below their average compatriot. Pensioners by comparison have seen income soar.</p>

<p>In seven major economies in North America and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>, the growth in income of the average young couple and families in their 20s has lagged dramatically behind national averages over the past 30 years.</p>

<p>In two of these countries – the US and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</a> – disposable incomes for millennials are scarcely higher in real terms than they were 30 years ago, while the rest of the population has experienced handsome gains.<br/></p>

<p>It is likely to be the first time in industrialised history, save for periods of war or natural disaster, that the incomes of young adults have fallen so far when compared with the rest of society.<br/></p>

<p>Experts are warning that this unfair settlement will have grave implications for everything from social cohesion to family formation. <br/></p>

<p>A two-week Guardian project, supported by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.jrrt.org.uk/">Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust</a>, aims to explore this predicament in depth and ask what can be done.</p>

<p>Using exclusive data from the largest database of international incomes in the world, at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lisdatacenter.org/">LIS (Luxembourg Income Study): Cross-National Data Center</a>, the investigation into the situation in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the US has also established that:</p>

<p>“The situation is tough for young people,” said <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/angel-gurria">Angel Gurría</a>, secretary general of the west’s leading thinktank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). “They were hit hard by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/09/income-inequality-great-recession">Great Recession</a>, and their labour market situation has improved only little since.<br/></p>

<p>“This is a problem we must address now urgently. Kicking it down the road will hurt our children and society as a whole.”</p>

<p>Gurría said there had been a shift since the mid-80s in poverty rates, which started to rise among younger cohorts while falling among pensioners. However, the world of barren opportunities facing today’s young people should be of concern to all age groups, he added. </p>

<p>“Current working-age, middle-class groups are increasingly concerned with their and their children’s job prospects. An increasing number of people think children in their country will be worse off financially than their parents,” he said.</p>

<p>Using <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/millennials-how-we-revealed-predicament-generation-y-data">LIS’s household survey data</a>, the Guardian examined the disposable incomes and wages of young families in eight of the 15 largest developed economies in the world. Together these countries made up 43% of the world’s GDP in 2014.<br/></p>

<p>These surveys, carried out over decades, are intended to pick up what is happening on the ground in people’s homes, and are the best way of distilling <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/soc_glance-2011-en/04/01/g4_ge1-02.html?itemId=/content/chapter/soc_glance-2011-6-en&amp;_csp_=048bf5a4e0cb098ff846908f382f63e1">domestic realities</a> from governmental level data.</p>

Find out how your income compares with every other generation</a> </p>

<p>The data accessed by the Guardian found that in the US, France, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany">Germany</a>, Italy and Canada the average disposable income of people in their early 20s is more than 20% below national averages.</p>

<p>For the first time in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a>, recent pensioners generated more disposable income than families headed by a person under 50. In Italy the average under-35 became poorer than average pensioners under 80. Using the most recent US data, in the midst of the downturn in 2013, average under-30s had less income than those aged 65-79. This is the first time that has happened as far back as the data goes.<br/></p>

<p>Millennials interviewed by the Guardian said they felt their generation was facing far greater hurdles to establish themselves as independent adults than previous generations did.</p>

<p>Fiona Pattison, a 30-year-old accounts director at a fundraising agency, said that despite pay rises and promotions her lifestyle hadn’t changed in six years. “Everything I’ve made in terms of a pay rise has gone into living and saving. My lifestyle has remained exactly the same. Any dent in employment or income would mean I’d have to go back to sharing again.”</p>

<p>Londoner Tanaka Mhishi, who works in a bookshop, adds: “I definitely think in a lot of ways my parents’ generation was luckier. They had a lot more freedom to do things younger: they were able to go straight from university and move to London and afford their own flat.</p>

<p>“We definitely have to make more compromises. Compromises like if I want to have kids by the time I’m 30, or even 40, can I still have the career I want to do?”<br/></p>

<p>Several economists told the Guardian that policymakers should do more to even up the balance between young and old to avoid economic stagnation.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-johnson">Paul Johnson</a>, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said he feared intergenerational inequality would fuel wider inequality in society because youngsters with rich parents would retain such an unfair advantage in the important years of early adulthood.</p>

<p>Johnson said: “I think the real unfairness issue comes in the sense that it’s become more and more important whether your parents happen to have a house.”<br/></p>

<p>For the next fortnight the Guardian will delve into the fortunes, feelings and finances of the developed world’s young adults, as well as looking at fallacies surrounding them.</p>

<p>In our series, we will reveal that today’s young people are not delaying adulthood because they are – as the New Yorker once put it – “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/02/spoiled-rotten">the most indulged young people in the history of the world</a>”. Instead, it appears they are not hitting the basic stages of adulthood at the same time as previous generations because such milestones are so much more costly and in some cases they are even being paid less than their parents were at the same age.</p>

<p>In Australia, millennials are being inched out of the housing market. In the UK, new figures will show the notion of a property-owning democracy has already been terminated. In the US, debt is the millennial millstone – young people are sitting on $1.3tn of student debt.</p>

<p>Across Europe, the issue centres more around jobs – and the lack of them. The numbers of thirtysomethings still living with their parents is stubbornly high in countries such as Italy and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/spain">Spain</a>, with grave implications for birthrates and family formation in places whose demographics are already badly skewed towards elderly people.</p>

<p>“We’ve never had, since the dawn of capitalism really, this situation of a population that is ageing so much and in some countries also shrinking, and we just don’t know whether we can continue growing the economy in the same way we once have,” said Prof <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/video/diane-coyle-businesses-sustainability-change-video">Diane Coyle</a>, an economist and former UK Treasury adviser.</p>

If the young bothered to vote in elections and went in for collective negotiation they might find they had more power and that politicians took more notice of them.

Interesting attempt at sarcasm? Of course, 17% interest on a mortgage of three times average income (which was roughly the average house price in 1995) is the same as 5.1% interest on a mortgage of ten times average income, which is what a house in large swathes of the South East cost now. Interest rates are slightly lower than that (in the same way as they were almost always lower than 17% in the 1980s and 90s except when inflation spiked - the same inflation that eroded the cost of the outstanding debt in real terms). However, the extra capital to pay more than makes up for any saving in interest.

I am part of "Generation Y", but I don't think we lack oppertunity, so many comment on here looking to blame someone and everyone else for their problems, truth is if you are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices then there is no reason you cannot be successful. the world doesn't owe us anything. If you want something you have to work for it, and in all likely hood make sacrifices to get it. Blaming everyone else for the things you have not achieved is the surest way of ensuring you never achieve them because 9 times out of 10 it's no one else's fault. So blame the older generation/the rich/the goverment/the Tory party/big business or who ever you want if it makes you feel better, but reality is the world is a tough place an we have it much easier than most, there are opportunities, (and people desperate to come to this county to take them) but only for those willing to put the work in.

I wonder whether this show of sudden empathy to the plight of the stung young will mean that Guardian towers will no longer expect interns to work for free in the slim hope of getting a job in the mainly middle aged British print media. I have every faith that the Scott trust will pay all young people doing work experience the minimum wage; ha , ha !

Well, there are those that think our antiquated management structures and class bound elitism led to stagnation throughout the 60's and 70's. It's easy to blame "the unions"but ultimately their goal was full employment, not greater returns for shareholders. I believe a number of economists have theorised this should be the aim of economic policy. And since neoliberal monetarist policy appears to have spectacularly failed (which is the point of this series of articles), perhaps those antiquated Union ideals of workers rights and full employment weren't so wrong

At least in the UK the old are taxed on their pension income so the only way to achieve this would be to charge a supertax on pensions (seems a bit unfair), or withdraw the state pension (which IS a benefit given to the old but paid for by the current generation of taxpayers, so more by those in employment than not).

Well, in 1995 one of my brothers, aged 22 and at the time working in not very well paid position for the local council, was able to get a mortgage, on his own, to buy an entire 3 bed house in Lewisham for £30,000. The same house is now worth £800,000. The other brother at the same time, bought a big flat in North London for £58,000, now worth £740,000. And all their friends did the same - university, a year or two of work and a mortgage somewhere around the 50k mark.

I employ a number of millennials and it is true that the cost of property is high and salaries have been fairly flat for a few years. But they still seem to spend more money on iPhones, holidays and clothes than I ever did. Priorities have shifted to a live for today mentality. Nobody wants to commute very long so it is no surprise they can't afford to buy. Life is about choices not just blaming other generations.

For some reason the graph seems to have excluded quite a significant group aged 30-65 years old. All it tells us is that people aged over 65 (who have paid off their mortgages and who's kids have left) have a higher disposable income than those aged under 25. With increasing housing costs it's hardly surprising that the difference between the two groups is greater.This is hardly a shock - horror revelation and one has to suspect in 10, 20, 30 or 40 years time the situation will be exactly the same.

An interesting article!However a few items are missing?Most salaries, pensions,etc.,are lagging behind the cost of living increase.People are programd to accept that an annual increment of say two percent is a wages increase.Where as reality is a decrease of about one percent.Pensions,are frequently quoted as the b all and end all of finance.Frequently these do not come with an annual cost of living increment, hence the are reduced annually by about three percent.Present day salaries are designed to keep. The majority living standards below the past levels.!Education is continuously be pushed as the past too happiness however the corporation's selling these qualifications ensure "graduates," are heavily in debt after completing their chosen course.Hence, in the West the present generation are in real terms looking forward to a reduced standard of living, probably or the rest of their livesIe., back to feudalism?

You missed the point. It's about the relative share of income and how much is being transferred from the young to the old, particularly through the buy to let party that needs immediately demolishing and those homes returned to the market as homes, not people's damned pension investments.

Someone wrote in the comments. "So let's just steal money from the old that will fix it." This cynic actually found the solution. Let me give you the political vocabulary. "Tax the rich." = "Tax the old." We need to use government to radically redistribute wealth from the top 1% to the young.
