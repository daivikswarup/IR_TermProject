Russia warns North Korea over threats of nuclear strike




DateTime::::2016-03-08T14:34:04+0000



<p>Russia has warned <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea">North Korea</a> that threats to deliver “preventive nuclear strikes” could create a legal basis for the use of military force against the country, suggesting that even Pyongyang’s few remaining friends are growing concerned about its increasingly confrontational stance.</p>

<p>The Russian foreign ministry statement, which follows a<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.nknews.org/2016/03/n-korea-threatens-to-liberate-s-korea-strike-u-s-mainland/"> North Korean</a> threat to “annihilate” the US and South Korea, also criticises Washington and Seoul for launching the largest joint military drills yet to be held on the peninsula.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-us-and-south-korea-to-flames-and-ash">North Korea threatens to reduce US and South Korea to 'flames and ash'</a> </p>

<p>“We consider it to be absolutely impermissible to make public statements containing threats to deliver some ‘preventive nuclear strikes’ against opponents,” the Russian foreign ministry said in response to North Korea’s threats.</p>

<p>“Pyongyang should be aware of the fact that in this way the DPRK will become fully opposed to the international community and will create international legal grounds for using military force against itself in accordance with the right of a state to self-defense enshrined in the United Nations Charter,” continued the statement, translated by Itar Tass news agency.</p>

<p>Washington and Seoul launched their annual joint military exercises on the peninsula on Monday, stepping up the manoeuvres in response to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/north-korean-nuclear-test-suspected-as-artificial-earthquake-detected">North Korea’s fourth nuclear test</a> in January and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/north-korea-launches-long-range-rocket-it-claims-is-carrying-a-satellite">rocket launch in February</a>.</p>

<p>But while the statement said Moscow was opposed to the tone of North Korea’s response, it also said the scale of the American-South Korean joint exercise put “unprecedented … military and political pressure on Pyongyang”.</p>

<p>“Naturally, as a state, which is directly named as an object of this kind of military activities, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) cannot but feel reasonably concerned for its security,” the statement said.</p>

<p>Pyongyang had said the drills, which are set to run to the end of April, are rehearsals for invading.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> has historically had close relations with North Korea, making its warning that the country may be laying itself open to military action particularly notable.</p>

<p>But one observer said Moscow’s response could be expected, given the tone of North Korea’s recent public statements.</p>

<p>“Pyongyang should be learning that the types of threats they continue to make will have consequences,” said Daniel Pinkston, a Seoul-based North Korea researcher at Troy University.</p>

<p>“The security dilemma dynamics that the behaviour and rhetoric set in motion are making <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songun">Son’gun</a> Korea less secure, not more secure,” he said. “This is the flaw in their national security strategy, and it will continue to be exposed in the future.”</p>

<p>Another North Korea watcher said the statement might be better viewed as a warning to Pyongyang of what others might do, rather than Russian actions in particular.</p>

<p>“Russia is pointing out to North Korea that its inflammatory rhetoric risks giving its opponents – primarily <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea">South Korea</a> and the US – just cause to pursue military action against it,” said regional expert Christopher Green.</p>

<p>Inter-Korean relations have worsened significantly in recent weeks, with Pyongyang showing particular sensitivity to the UN sanctions agreed last week.</p>

You've obviously never visited any country like NK. You are so obtuse that it's hard to even believe you're being honest here. Western nations are vastly and enormously superior, in every single way, to a country like NK. Your delusion is so deep, and your dishonesty so overwhelming that it's clear your a computer commander who peruses websites looking to make asinine comments. I have visited all over Russia numerous times as an American. There are many parts and aspects of Russia I love but I always deeply miss the United States. Folks who are used to unbridled freedom just have no idea the luxury they live in.

I concede that there are differences between the more horrific actions further back in the past and with regards to Iraq more recently, but my overall point is that the US still doesn't appear to have really learned their lessons on aggressive interventions into other countries. The war in Iraq was started off under false pretenses, and at least the highest up in the US administration damn well knew it. And to be frank, I'm not entirely convinced that the creation of a new ally in the region, one more sympathetic to the US, wasn't a part of the motivation for invasion.Also, the principle that removing a dictator with force will create a dangerous power-vacuum is one that we were aware of before 2003, and sure enough the invasion created far more problems than it solved.

Just a small point, but the war HASN'T nominally ended. It has been in a state of armistice for 60 years, but there has never actually been a declaration of peace, as it were. The longest cease-fire in history, perhaps, but the war never officially ended.

The DPRK represents this publication's and most of its audience's dream state. Social justice? Check. Imposed income equality? Check. Unlimited government power, criminalization of dissent and non-state-approved religion? A disarmed citzenry? Check. Censorship of subversive speech / hate speech? Check.

That's the nature of a war, people die. That is also why I said it depends on what sort of damage the South is willing to sustain. Problem is, there has been 60+ years trying to sort this out, and the new leader appears intent on escalating it even further. If he is going to attack the South no matter what, then it is better that the South attacks first before he is ready. How is the popular uprising going in the North then...'you' are taking your time aren't you?! I don't see any evidence that there is likely to be one. Just because you live in the South isn't a reason to bury your head in the sand, in fact, it is a reason to do the complete opposite. Anyway, good luck.

You'd certainly be correct if those were the circumstances; expert opinion given in the 80s was that the casualties stemming from a single nuclear warhead strike on a UK city would overwhelm the entire UK resources of the NHS - I'm sure that's still largely true today.

you're the one squealing like a little girl. President Obama gives this "threat" all it's worth - NADA. One thing I've learned is people who have actually been in a conflict or war are a little more realistic and try to evade situations that cost lives. But little girls like you are so tough talking - you'd crap your pants if you heard a gunshot.

Yeah,..he has quite the strategy alright,...yep,..he's tweaking those international relations,..bending down low,.careful now,..wouldn't want anyone to think America is anything but a milquetoast unexceptional nation,..many apologies for any and all past injustices,..Kumbiah,..what's really hurting us is Global Warm,...I mean Climate Cha...I mean CO2 overload,...Yeah,..Obama has been a real wonder, he will definitely be remembered as the most exceptionally,...incompetent, divisive, racist, progressive socialist president this nation has ever had the displeasure to have had.

The POTUS is slowly dismantling Daesh with a thousand cuts, destroying their cash and oil supplies and surgically taking out their leaders while limiting collateral damage. Those that advocates "bombing the sh*t" out of the entire region or "making the sand glow" are blusterous blowhards with a 5th grade bully's comprehension of geopolitics. Clearly they have succeeded in scaring the low info crowd with bumper sticker rhetoric.

Glad you are not commander in chief. You have not a clue how international relations work. Furthermore you are dissing Obama over that which you are ignorant. Obama seems to be leading little fat boy around by the nose until little fat boy loses his gas. It's much like the way Reagan shut down the USSR. Thankfully your "jackhammer" has a rubber bit......much like your mushy mind-what there is of it.

I am glad that Russia has sent a warning to North Korea, unstable people at the top of the regime hopeful will take a few steps back from their retoric. Continuation of their resent actions bring the concept of war more likely, even dare I say more likely, we on the whole, dont really care if the leader of North Korea all perish, but we do care about your people obviously more than your leader do.

Haha, Putin taking "a stand". Weak Obama, quaking in his boots is it? You're a brainwashed idiot if you think geopolitics is about "taking a stand". Barack is a savvy operator. Unfortunately, he's just as active in using his military might as GW was, he's just far smarter about it. Check out the ratio of Bush drone strikes to Obama. He fights small shadow wars that minimize cost, lives lost and attempting to repair our tarnished image in the international community. Simpletons like you equate geopolitics to some sort of street fight. Where we need to go out in our wifebeater and flex our muscles and yell at the asian neighbors across the street because thats what men do!! Don't you see the very transparent message in increasing the size and scope of US military maneuvering and training in SK? Or did you need it spelled out for you? I'll give the POTUS a ring for you and tell him to yell into a microphone next time so the good ole boys understand.
