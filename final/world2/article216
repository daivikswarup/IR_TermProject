Poland's changes to court system 'endanger democracy'




DateTime::::2016-02-29T12:17:14+0000



<p>Changes to Poland’s supreme court endanger the rule of law, democracy and human rights, according to a draft opinion from Europe’s leading constitutional experts. </p>

<p>The draft from the Venice Commission, legal experts who advise the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/council-of-europe">Council of Europe</a>, called on the Polish government to strike out provisions of a law reforming the country’s highest court.<br/></p>

<p>Last year Poland’s staunchly conservative Law and Justice party attempted to install five judges of its own choosing on the 15-member constitutional tribunal shortly after coming to power. This was followed by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/poland-law-curb-power-top-court-end-democracy-andrzej-duda">a hastily passed law in December overhauling court procedures</a>, making it harder to pass rulings.<br/></p>

<p>In a draft report that was leaked to Polish media, the Venice Commission said the tribunal’s effectiveness could be crippled, thereby damaging human rights as access to justice was denied. </p>

<p>“As long as the situation of constitutional crisis related to the constitutional tribunal remains unsettled and as long as the constitutional tribunal cannot carry out its work in an efficient manner, not only is the rule of law in danger, but so is democracy and human rights,” the expert body concluded.</p>

<p>Changes to the court removed “a crucial mechanism which ensures that potential conflicts with European and international norms and standards can be resolved at the national level”, it said.</p>

<p>Although the Council of Europe cannot penalise countries or force them to change laws, the stinging rebuke is certain to carry weight. “Member states as a rule don’t ignore [Council of Europe] recommendations,” a Council of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> spokesman said, while declining to comment on the leak.</p>

<p>The report will also influence the European commission, which has launched an<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/13/ec-to-investigate-polish-governments-controversial-new-laws"> inquiry into the rule of law in Poland</a>, the first time EU authorities have investigated the democratic standards of a member state.<br/></p>

<p>The Council of Europe, which is not part of the EU, will publish the expert group’s final opinion shortly after 11-12 March, following a meeting with Polish government representatives in Venice. </p>

<p>It is conducting a separate inquiry into Poland’s media law, after the Polish government rushed through legislation empowering it to appoint the heads of state TV and radio. </p>

<p>The Polish government has yet to respond to a letter from the Council of Europe secretary-general, sent in early January, expressing concern about the law’s effect on “the integrity and independence” of the media. “We hope to pursue a dialogue on that with the Polish authorities,” the spokesman said.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/poland">Poland</a> has reacted angrily to suggestions it is falling short of democratic standards. This month Warsaw hit back at three US senators who said changes to Poland’s constitutional court and media regulation could harm democratic norms, including freedom of speech and an independent judiciary.</p>

<p>Poland’s prime minister, Beata Szydło, said the senators – who included the former Republican presidential contender John McCain – had no right to be lecturing and “imposing actions concerning my fatherland”. </p>

Ok, but guess what would foreign companies do when PiS will raise the taxes? I will tell you! Move business elsewhere. And I'm sorry to say, that this will leave us abandoned and poorer than before, especially with so many social costs. This is just economy. Their plans are a little bit idyllic.

I think my quote "over 100" answers your question. Poland has the same problem most countries have - polarization of opinions among society. At some point there comes a moment that it's immposible to talk to people from "the other side". What is really frightening, PiS encourages this diversification by saying "we are the only true patriots", "there is only one good way and it's ours", "you're not with us? you're enemy" - sounds scary, when people of power say it, doesn't it?

Well... no. People protesting on the streets, around 80,000 in Warsaw just last week, were not PO members nor EP. They also weren't paid for it. They are ordinary people just disappointed and scared of the future of Poland. Trying to put these people into two boxes offered by your answer is just silly. Sorry.

The Guardian has failed to talk about March 1st - in Poland we commemorate on that day the Polish patriots who were slaughtered by traitors and foreigners in Poland in the period 1945-56. Including my next-door neighbour's family. The Guardian supports the ones who killed them.

The pianist in question lives and works in Poland… so I think he has a right to offer his opinion, especially after being so brutally attacked, more than likely by a PiS supporter…many of whom, lacking the intellectual skills to take part in respectful debate, their minds seeped in paranoia, frustration and fear, simply resort to verbal or physical abuse.

I am not Polish, and if you think they wouldn´t have motorways without EU, you are just out of reality arrogant patronizing person. Most of it went to agriculture for CAA - complete waste of money. However, subsidies in it are still much lower than in Western EU countries, especially France and Spain, however costs are the same (except for wages, which counts just for a very small fraction of all costs). This makes Polish agriculture products virtually uncompetetive on the Western EU market. However, Poland had to open its market for western production. See, nothing is for free. Other neffectivness is the fact, that Poland also pay its contribution to EU (yes, it gets more than it gives eventually), but what it gets must be spent only on things EU says. Sometimes it is useful (motorway), mostly waste of money (subsidies to private companies, to agriculture, for social inclusion (whatever it means) etc.). If Poland didn´t pay money to EU, but could use it for what it thinks is best, even though it wouldn´t get any subsidies, it wouldn´t be much more worse off.

March 1st - the day in Poland dedicated to remembering the victims of post-war Communists murderers. The murderers and torturers were never brought to justice. In fact they were handsomely rewarded with fat pensions until the end of their lives. The Guardian has chosen not to cover this story. Perhaps because they still employ one of the torturers themselves!

And you seriously think PiS is going to challenge or change that and that the merest promise of better welfare is worth sacrificing freedoms for and through changes that were not included in PiS's pre-election manifesto ? More likely, they will keep on with the conspiracy theorising, 'culture wars' and witch hunts for 'commies'

Do not confuse him with annoying things as facts. They get in the way of monomaniacal conspiracy theorising, the eternal martyr complex and the full acceptance of everything the half wits who lead PiS say and do and which has an uncanny resemblance to the national-communism of 'People's Poland'.

And the AWS in the late 1990s was backed by US money from IRI when Kaczynski was part of it. Was that an affront to democracy ? If the CDU had backed Tusk's faction of the post-Solidarity liberal conservative-centre right in the early 1990s, why would that have been worse ?

A young Chilean pianist was brutally attacked in Warsaw last Saturday night, by some ignorant thug who thought he was Muslim or Arab…the victim, Cristian Ramos, stated that such attacks are becoming more frequent on the streets of Poland. Those are the fruits of real hate speech as used by PiS in its election campaign.

Stalking is unwanted or obsessive attention by an individual or group toward another person. Stalking behaviors are related to harassment and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them.

“The world is ruled by neither justice nor morality; crime is not punished nor virtue rewarded, one is forgotten as quickly as the other. The world is ruled by power and power is obtained with money. To work is senseless, because money cannot be obtained through work, but through exploitation of others. And if we cannot exploit as much as we wish, at least let us work as little as we can. Moral duty? We believe neither in the morality of man nor in the morality of systems. [Tadeusz Borowski, 'This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen,' p. 168]”

No, not understood. Why is the foreign media obsessed with infighting of 2 clans only when one is on top, while when the other one was on top it was all fine and dandy, we've had free advertising as a super-modern and outward-looking state, whereas everyone knows that beyond the moderately decent facade our country is and WAS a mess also during other governments? Explain that to me. I don't get it, and many people in Europe also don't understand how it is possible that so many people from Poland have been emigrating while their state was portrayed as a land of milk and honey? It doesn't add up in any way other than that the mess inside Poland is the last thing that's on the mind of Guardian's writers.

Not for long - the current regime are finding ways to reduce the possibility of there ever being a fair election. It is my firm belief that the duck behind the scenes is trying to mimic the Russian structure - he grew up in it and was fond of it. Pretty sure that he will extend the period of power for the parliament and presidential positions - but in order to do this he must control the constitutional court (TK) - which he has already in many ways destabilized by ordering it to review all previous laws passed since it was formed - a delay tactic - then he will claim it's a useless court - in a sense he is making a mockery of the system and will try to create a new one.

When Poland joined the EU it agreed to comply with it's rules just like every other EU member has to do - the problems that the PiSites government in charge have, are is that they were not in power at the time of that initial agreement, the opposition were - and it's obvious or should be by now that the PiSites hate and incite hatred towards all things that the opposition have achieved - behaving in many ways like a spoilt child that didn't get credit for doing it their way. Now their way is a return to backward mindset a type of autocratic rule which they will force upon their people - students will react - but they will be too late by that time to save their freedom of speech and expression. They will be brainwashed from early youth and they will be terrorized into believing that anyone who opposes the government will be locked up and never seen again.

Odd how many Poles forget about what Polish companies are doing to avoid paying huge taxes and insurance costs - Poles are particularly clever in finding ways to avoid paying for anything - but they love highlighting/claiming that its not them but the Germans - truth is those that still blame Germany for anything and everything have yet to grow up and move forward. Stop being prejudicial to modern day Germany, the French also helped build the EU - along with other countries, to create a union to benefit individuals allowing them to freely move and live wherever they want and start a new life there.
