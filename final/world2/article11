Lech Wałęsa: I was not an agent of the Polish security services




DateTime::::2016-03-10T11:36:57+0000



<p>Lech Wałęsa, the charismatic leader of Poland’s Solidarity movement in the 1980s, has revealed details of his Soviet-era links with the country’s security services, saying he chose to “talk [and] discuss” with officials as part of his trade union activities.</p>

<p>But in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, he strongly denied recent allegations that he was a paid informant. “I was not an agent of the security services,” said Wałęsa, 72, in his home city of Gdańsk, in northern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/poland">Poland</a>. “I have not spied on anyone in my life. I have taken no money. I will prove all of this. I have hired lawyers.”</p>

<p>Wałęsa, who won the 1983 Nobel peace prize and served as Poland’s president for five years from 1990, was speaking publicly for the first time since the allegations surfaced while he was on a trip to Venezuela.</p>

<p>Last month <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/lech-walesa-denies-poland-paid-informant-allegations">investigators from the Institute of National Remembrance</a> (IPN) showed journalists documents seized from the home of the last communist interior minister, the late General Czesław Kiszczak, including a letter from 1970 signed with Wałęsa’s codename “Bolek”. In the letter, Bolek commits to providing information. The state-run institute also showed receipts for money.</p>

<p>The claims are not new. They have been revived as part of an ongoing purge by Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of the governing Law &amp; Justice party, of political rivals, the judiciary, journalists seen as hostile, and people with past ties to communism. </p>

<p>The government’s moves to cripple the highest court in Poland, the constitutional tribunal, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/polands-changes-to-court-system-risking-democracy">have been roundly condemned internationally</a>. On Friday a report by rule-of-law experts is expected to put pressure on the European Union to consider sanctions against Poland when the Venice Commission, an arm of the Council of Europe human rights group, delivers a report into the government’s controversial moves. . </p>

<p>The attack on Wałęsa has upset many Poles. Recent demonstrations against the government have turned into rallies in his defence.</p>

<p>He told the Guardian that in the 1970s he was in contact with the Bezpieka – a slang name for the secret services – as part of his trade union activities. “At the time I had two choices. One was not to talk, not to try to solve anything and therefore ignore the Bezpieka. The second path, which I chose, was to talk, discuss, convince, and lead the route to victory.</p>

<p>“If I had to repeat my life, I would not change a thing,” said Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre, a museum and conference complex adjacent to the shipyard where he co-founded the Soviet bloc’s first free trade union in 1980.</p>

<p>He claimed that his contacts with the secret services in the 1970s aimed to “spare courageous people, temper the risk-takers [in Solidarity] and create a team that would eventually destroy the [Communist] party. I wanted to find out what kind of people the Bezpieka were; why they were acting against Poland; why they wanted to take people’s freedom away.”</p>

<p>Asked who Bolek was, he said: “As far as I can tell, Bolek is a telephonic liaison codename. I learned about Bolek in the material against Wałęsa. And now I hear that Wałęsa was Bolek. So much of the [IPN] material is quite obviously fake. In the file on my recruitment, three different dates have been entered – 22, 25 and 29 – because they have yet to decide what day I was recruited.”</p>

<p>The IPN is a repository of Soviet-era secret service documents. Since 2007 it has also had prosecution powers. In the past month its investigators have carried out two high-profile raids, one on the house of Kiszczak’s widow and the other, on 29 February, on the home of the late General Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last communist leader of Poland.</p>

<p>Kaczyński and his twin brother, Lech, were active in Solidarity in the 1980s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/10/poland-president-lech-kaczynski-killed">but were sidelined </a>when Wałęsa became president of Poland. Wałęsa suggested Kaczyński was using the IPN to avenge the past. “When it comes to my case there is maliciousness … It is made up from start to finish,” he said.</p>

<p>Wałęsa is no longer active in Solidarity, which supported Law &amp; Justice’s election campaign, and he has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/23/poland-constitutional-crisis-lech-walesa-law-justice-pis">spoken out against the government</a> as “dangerous for democracy”.</p>

<p>But he said he was not ready to lead or join an opposition movement. “I warned the people against Kaczyński long ago. The people didn’t listen. They voted badly. If it gets dangerous, I will certainly take steps to protect Poland. But for now, let others be active.”</p>

Lech Wałęsa is a person of complicated personality, now he is completely alone. He should have told the truth in 2000 when he decided to give up the politics and got it out of the way. And now, when the grenade fell into the cesspool, he is powerless.

I am trying to fighure out a mentality of someone, who so easily dismisses personal experience of mine (and many other people) as lie just because it does not fit his own.  Perhaps he is an ideologically driven fanatic who can not accept that things were different in other places and can't get over the fact that people wanted the change.

They are Polish surnames. They are different to English surnames because Polish is a different language.

This is not true. My parents despised the communist system in Poland, they never belonged to the communist part, they never cooperated with the secret service, they never took money for that. So please don't tell everybody that "collaborating" was a prerequisite of survival.

Living standards in Poland have risen considerably since the collapse of communism. It's one of the few European economies that has performed well in recent years.

Bit late for all this and a patriot like Jarosław Kaczyński should be very cautious about being seen to endorse a retrospective witch hunt that could be interpreted as being due to past political differences with Walesa. The only effect will be all the repulsive little communist apologists and slime-merchants gliding out from under their rock to mow and gibber against the overall record of "Solidarity" in resisting the odious Marxist tyranny imposed on Poland.

With the benefit of hindsight every is so clear and black and white. In reality during those times there was plenty of interaction between the communists and members Solidarity movement. The alternative would have been civil war. While Walesa had his flaws and was possibly not the best president he played a vital role along with others to overthrow communism. It particularly makes me laugh when people who were only kids at the time make judgments on people's actions in difficult times.

Half Poland were paid secret service informers in the 70s & 80s. That made some practical sense then. Not anymore. Poles are adaptable. Russian colonialism, nationalist dictatorship, Hitler, communism, capitalism - they've been through it all.

If Poland was that much poorer, maybe it has something to do with Polish work ethic, like wanting to shut down their own industry, pray instead of work, etc...

Walesa was upfront to gain us freedom and all the ex countries of Eastern Europe under Russian control. I do not approve the mass praying on the streets but whatever action he and his advisers took it saved us from massive shootings by Russians. Can they please leave him be. It is disgraceful!

In Czechoslovakia we definitely had all the things that you listed. And so did Hungarians and East Germans. If Poland was that much poorer, maybe it has something to do with Polish work ethic, like wanting to shut down their own industry, pray instead of work, etc...

Seminary college was a major target for the Communists. Perhaps 1/3 of RC bishops in Poland are atheist agents, strange as that may sound. That's why they come out and say divisive nonsense from time to time. Parish priests whisper this to their friends.

He and Thatcher may well have developed a close relationship. However, it wasn't Lech Walesa who was selling her the coal. It was her good friends (by your logic) the Jaruzelski govt in Poland at the time. Chill a little, we are all wrong from time to time.

Him and Thatcher were very good friends. The miners were stuffed by Thatcher buying cheap, subsidied coal from Poland. Research that.
