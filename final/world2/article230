Why Ukraine needs Russia more than ever

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>n January Ukraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, congratulated the country on surviving its first winter without buying Russian gas. It had instead bought European gas which, as Poroshenko pointed out proudly, was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.president.gov.ua/news/reformi-v-energetici-zabezpechuyut-energetichnu-nezalezhnist-36684">30% more expensive</a>.<br/></p>

<p>This sums up the core problem facing the Ukrainian economy. It is not corruption, a serious issue about which little can be done in the short term, but the ideologically driven choice to sever all ties with <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a>, the country that has historically been its major trading partner and chief investor.</p>

<p>In little over a year, living standards in<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://112.ua/interview/ukraina-gotova-k-nepovinoveniyu-i-vzryvu-285795.html"> Ukraine have fallen by half</a>, the value of the currency has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.segodnya.ua/politics/pnews/intervyu-s-viktorom-yushchenko-692801.html">slumped by more than two-thirds</a>, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.analitik.org.ua/current-comment/economy/56b8831c021fb/">inflation has skyrocketed </a>to 43%. Yet, even as the economy has collapsed, the government has insisted on economic policies that can only be termed suicidal. </p>

<p>By tearing up contracts with Russia in 2014, Ukraine’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://vybor.ua/news/poteri_ukrainy_ot_razryva_kontraktov_s_rf_v_kosmicheskoy_i_voennyh_otraslyah_sostavyat_2_mlrd_grn.html">defence and aviation industries lost 80% </a>of their income. Once the pride of Kiev, airline manufacturer <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://ukraina.ru/news/20160127/1015433629.html">Antonov went bankprupt</a> and rocket engine producer Yuzhmash is now working just one day a week.</p>

<p>By severing banking ties with Moscow, Kiev has denied itself investment and a vital economic lifeline – the remittances sent back home by <em>zarobitchane</em>, Ukraine’s migrant workers. Up <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://russia-insider.com/en/political-economy-civil-war-how-ukraine-became-impoverished-tajikistan-only-one-year/5559">to seven million </a>Ukrainians have sought work in Russia, sending back $9bn in 2014 – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://vybor.ua/article/economika/v-ukrainu-pridut-mnogomilliardnye-investicii.html">three times the total</a> foreign direct investment Ukraine got last year.</p>

<p>Reckless government borrowing has exacerbated the problem. The government was able to write off 20% of its Eurobond debt last October, allowing it to negotiate for the next IMF loan tranche which was expected in December but still not been received. </p>

<p>But the draconian terms imposed for this small beer are often overlooked. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://vybor.ua/article/economika/narod-nishchaet-pravitelstvo-hvalitsya-uspehami.html">Ukraine will be repaying this debt until 2041</a>, with future generations giving western creditors as much as half of the country’s GDP growth, should it ever reach 4% a year.</p>

<p>There is a common thread that links the government’s irrational economic behavior – the understandable desire to spite <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>. Alas, it is the average Ukrainian citizen who pays the price.</p>

<p>There can also be no doubt that Poroshenko approves of this approach. In his first speech of 2016 he announced <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.analitik.org.ua/current-comment/int/569ce39ab63b9/">new priorities for the Ukrainian economy</a>. The government intends to end subsidies to manufacturing and industry, and instead promote investment in information technologies and agriculture. </p>

<p>It is not at all clear, however, where he will sell this produce, since by signing a free trade agreement with the EU, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> lost its preferential access to its largest market, Russia.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, EU certification allows only <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ukragroconsult.com/news/v-gosvetfitosluzhbe-rasskazali-skolko-ukrainskih-kompanii-eksportiruyut-produkty-zhivotnogo-proishozhdeniya-v-es">72 Ukrainian companies to export goods to the EU</a>. Of these, 39 licenses are for honey. While that may sound like a lot of honey, Ukraine <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://timer-odessa.net/news/ukraina_za_poltora_mesyatsa_ischerpala_godovie_kvoti_na_postavku_v_es_meda_i_kukuruzi_580.html">exported its yearly quota</a> for honey in the first six weeks of 2016. </p>

<p>Nor is it clear how Poroshenko plans to make Ukrainian agriculture globally competitive when, as his own agriculture minister points out, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://agronews.ua/node/62581">four out of five agricultural companies are bankrupt.</a> It is also unclear who will pay for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.2000.ua/blogi/avtorskie-kolonki_blogi/25-shagov-navstrechu-samolikvidacii.htm">agricultural machinery</a>, 80% of which is imported.</p>

<p>Such policies have led to a steady erosion of government popularity, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://regnum.ru/news/polit/2084761.html">70% of Ukrainians saying</a> the country is on wrong track and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://vybor.ua/article/vneshnjaja_politika/zakat-evrointegracii.html">85% say they do not trust </a>the prime minister. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/187931/ukrainians-disillusioned-leadership.aspx">Poroshenko’s popularity </a>is now lower than that of his predecessor, Viktor Yanukovich, on the eve of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/22/ukraine-president-yanukovych-flees-kiev">Maidan rebellion that ousted him</a>.</p>

<p>But while <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://vybor.ua/article/vneshnjaja_politika/zakat-evrointegracii.html">less than 2% describe the country as “stable,”</a> a new revolt does not seem imminent. So far, the regime has been able to provide explanations that deflect attention away from its own role in Ukraine’s economic demise.</p>

<p>The first is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/18/putin-confirms-annexation-crimea-ukrainian-soldier-casualty">Russia’s annexation of Crimea</a> and the rebellion in the east, which are commonly cited as reasons for the fall in GDP. While it’s true that these caused significant economic damage, it has been exacerbated by the government’s own policies which, despite insisting Russophone eastern regions are part of Ukraine, has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://zn.ua/ECONOMICS/minfin-i-minsocpolitiki-po-raznomu-traktuyut-zakonodatelstvo-o-vyplatah-pensiy-na-okkupirovannyh-territoriyah-205649_.html;%20">cut them off from economic ties </a>and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34899491">punished the population</a> for siding with Russia.</p>

<p>Another favourite argument of the current government is that Ukraine simply has no choice but to respond to Russian aggression by imposing its own sanctions<strong>.</strong> The beauty of this argument is that, while it may not make economic sense, it makes a great deal of political sense for those now in power. </p>

<p>The destruction of Ukraine’s industrial base, which is heavily concentrated in the east, shifts the balance of economic and political power to the western regions, permanently marginalising opposing political voices. The advantages are clear. Fostering a sense of perpetual crisis allows the current government to argue that it must remain in power, to see its policies through. The only uncertainty is whether such a strategy can bear fruit before the country’s economy collapses.</p>

<p>This is not a policy that the west can endorse. Regardless of political sympathies, no western government should tolerate the deliberate impoverishment of the population for political gain. The risks of Ukraine becoming a failed state, and adding millions more to Europe’s burgeoning refugee crisis, are simply too high.</p>

<p>The best way to avoid such an outcome is to recognise that Ukraine’s economic survival depends not on western bailouts but on the renewal of Russian investment there. Western policymakers should insist that economic rationality take precedence over economic nationalism, and make that a condition of assistance.</p>

<p>Until that happens, it is hard to imagine anyone investing in Ukraine’s future, including its own people. </p>

5 Billion dollars over 25 years is peanuts. The United States spends billions on ridiculous programs that over time come up to huge numbers. Most of that money was spent in the 90ties when there was a lot of thought that Russia and the former republics were interested in free market reforms. Most of the money was spent on attempting to train people how to run a modern economy not so much how to run a liberal democracy. The failure in both Russia and Ukraine was the rise of the Oligarch's who had no interest in the reform of society be it economic or social Even in Ukraine it was the Oligarch's loss of confidence in Yanukovych that ended him. The Maiden protests were going to burn themselves out. Yanukovych did not lose power because he was pro or anti this. He was so incompetent the other Oligarch's became threatened. If Obama is so savvy to engineer a coup under the FSB's nose in their back yard, Putin is most certainly doomed. This would imply the FSB was had by an incompetent. Or do you believe the naive university professor is a more accomplished spy master than a career KGB operative?

I know Russians are much better at severing relations than most other people. Your land is so big, you can always go somewhere else to get away from your enemies. This is the opposite to India, for example, which is so densely populated that people have no choice but to forgive and forget.

The extent of US involvement in Ukraine was revealed by Victoria Nuland, Assistant Secretary, in Washington’s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs. On December 13, 2013, after returning from her third trip to Kiev that fall, in an address to a US-Ukrainian conference, she stated:

The 1st serious attempt to get Ukraine on the road to NATO occurred with the Orange Revolution in 2004, a process that was masterminded and financed by US-sponsored NGOs, especially the USA’s National Endowment for Democracy. It was easy to get people riled up because of the ongoing corruption ever since Ukraine got its independence in 1991. But NED’s undeclared objective was to get their man Viktor Yushchenko elected as president. Yushchenko had long-time connections with the US and his wife was an American who had been a high ranking US State Department official.

Through its array of almost countless “freedom loving NGOs”, led by NED, the National Endowment for Democracy (a private arm of the CIA), as well as the CIA itself, the USA set out to undermine Ukraine and Georgia by means of “colour revolutions” – the Rose Revolution in Georgia and the Orange Revolution in Ukraine – with success in both in 2004.

There have been numerous Euro MP's who have visited Crimea and were given the freedom to speak to any Crimean citizens they wished to. The vast majority of Crimean citizens said that they were Overjoyed at being with Russia again after many decades of trying. The BBC went to Crimea on a fact finding mission - probably seeking to publish a report demonising Russia but they found that the vast majority of Crimean citizens were happy to be rejoined with Russia.

The TV station Krasovksy was working for, Kontr-TV, was government owned and funded. It was shut down not because Krasovsky came out as gay, but because it failed to meet its ratings target. The channel was originally conceived to compete with the opposition channel "Dozhd" (Rain) and Krasovsky was a willing participant in the anti-Dozhd and anti-opposition smear campaign. In spite of that, Kontr-TV even hosted live debates between gay and anti-gay activists, which was unheard of in Russia. By the way, if you say it's OK to be gay in Saudi Arabia, they will chop off your head, but strangely, that doesn't stop Barack Hussein Obama from showering Saudi despots with lavish praise. At least educate yourself a bit more before posting nonsense. Most people here know nothing about politics in Russia, aside from some occasional hearsay reprinted by Western media

You have left out a VERY crucial fact: the involvement of the US Govt, with the neocon jew nuland - wife of the co-founder of PNAC, responsible for the LIES of Iraqi WMDs, and the FU of Iraq over the intervening years after the ILlegal invasion - admitting to the US having spent (at least) $5 BILLION on USUkraine, a de facto colony of the USG, with the sign of the AMERICAN oil company Chevron to her left, and the also admitted 25 year AMERICAN plan for Eastern Europe, together with the EU approved (catholic) Polish plan in the Eastern Partnership, and the controller catholic biden, and his jesuit/catholic trained son on the board of the Ukrainian energy company.

I take it that you do know that the value of fresh fruit is much higher than pulped fruit squash. Europe is not like the USA as there are many regulations within the EU on how much sugar/salt than be used to bulk up fruit squashes. Then there is the processing into cans or dried products- all this takes extra investment but there are many established names on the market that have their own fruit contracts already in place, plus the fact that a newcomer ( often small farmers) chances of breaking into this market is very remote.

Western based geologists thought that the most likely place in Ukraine to find frackable gas/oil was either underneath Skavyansk or in the immediate vicinity. The USSR drilled huge numbers of boreholes in Ukraine looking for further resources of oil/ gas. They were not just looking for salt domes as they documented the cores they took. It's very unlikely givern the geology in the East Ukraine that any oil/ gas remains as it probably leaked into the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov eons ago.
