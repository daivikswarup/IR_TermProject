Crimea hands out military draft papers to newborn boys

<p>Russian authorities in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea">Crimea</a> have formally presented newborn boys with military draft notices alongside the more usual birth certificates, calling on them to report for duty in 2032. <br/></p>

<p>The Crimean government handed out the notices to newborn boys during a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.novayagazeta.ru/">solemn ceremony in the Sevastopol civil registry office</a> as part of celebrations for an annual holiday known as Defender of the Fatherland Day on 23 February.</p>

<p>Parents took an oath on behalf of their sons, with similar ceremonies held in other Sevastopol city districts. Representatives of Crimean military recruitment congratulated the parents and presented them gifts.</p>

<p>Authorities said they wanted to observe “the solemn rite of registering the births of ‘Russia’s glorious sons’”. It is unclear whether draft notices were distributed throughout Crimea or just in Simferopol.</p>

<p>The papers contained a small error, however. According to Russian law registration is required in the year a man turns 17, meaning infants born in Simferopol last week only need to enlist in 2033.</p>

<p>The holiday, also known as Men’s Day, is widely celebrated in the former Soviet Union. It was originally intended to mark the creation of the Red Army in 1918 but has become less militaristic in recent years and used as an occasion to pay tribute to male relatives and friends.</p>

Wrong? Janukovich scrapped military service, but it had to be reintroduced in 2014 after Russia tore up the Budapest memorandum.

That's true, you'll find people in every corner of the world who can't deal with "lack of respect", perceived or real, and will resort to physical violence. This is a common trait found in bullies and people with low self-esteem problem.

"How very solipsistic". Not really. I'm just aware my opinion might be more interesting for an american citizen reading these comments ... Blaming Putin would just be pointless. There's already an obvious propaganda working for that. Besides Putin could not care less of what I think while I still hope our politicians might be more attentive.

Physical violence against lack of respect. I would not say it's common nowadays, quite the contrary actually, but in some more "traditional" places I'd suggest a tourist not to be too much arrogant. Most of the world works like that. We just hide behind an ephemeral veil of education, don't we?

The papers cannot have been real papers as you need to be 17 to receive them. It is impossible to serve REAL papers on newborn infants.

It is abnormal to use infants in propaganda that promotes war and militarism: these babies were described as "future defenders of the Fatherland".



Author::::MTavernier
DateTime::::2016-03-03T15:10:37Z
These babies were given their call-up papers by Colonel Sergei Glusker, valid for 24 January 2032. Unlike other boys in Russia, who receive their draft papers in their mid-teens, these Crimean boys were conscripted as they left the womb.

No, because we are allies and I feel I have the right to complain whether the US is dragging our government into some unhinged intervention. I'm a taxpayer after all. What about buying some 90 crappy F35 instead of providing our children better school infrastructures for instance?

I've come to think in anglo-saxon culture it's much more tolerated to insult and or be heavily sarcastic than in other places. Kind of a commonly allowed verbal violence and harsh attitude you seem to deploy each other ... In my country, for instance, if you don't chose your words properly and you don't behave kindly you might still be kicked out of the place. Literally. My bad.

This is merely a celebration of Russian citizenship and has no more sinister intent than say the children in the US having to recite some Pledge of Allegiance in school. Just another anti-Russian article like the religion one exposing western MSM's frustration with the lack of hate-news after the reasonably successful ceasefire in Syria.

I don't know why you failed to grasp it the first time because it was obvious that Russian officials are the only ones authorized to issue draft notices.

Except the Crimeans wanted to return to Russia. By a f***ing landslide. They always had that clause in their constitution, seeing as Crimea was GIFTED to Ukraine after WW2 and they had included it just in case they ever felt like returning under Russia's wing. Most of the people in Crimea are and were still classifying themselves as Russian, and spoke Russian.

That's far better. I might even agree with you from time to time. But next time make it more explicit please otherwise you are easily misunderstood. You know it's full of racist and gratitous blaming comments these times any time Russia is involved. Full of "semi professional" commenters who show up any time this subject is commentable and producing tens of nasty and sarcastic comments most of the time really irrelevant. I might be mistaken but I wonder whether it's only their ego that compels these people to indulge in their writing capabilities.Most Russian are obviously inculpable for what their government does such as most american or british can't be blamed for the iraq wars I guess, even though their democracies should work much better.I can't fall in love with Putin but I don't like that country being depicted as enemies and shameful people either. That's 20th century style warmongering. Not wise from my modest point of view.Not so far ago conscription was mandatory in most of our countries and there are still celebrations involving the army or veterans... so what. Big deal. Russia is just a less modern country and this is kind of understandable knowing a little of their history and given the situation in Crimea. But that doesn't make russians "stinky" or "shameful" (as I often found on these very Guardian website pages ... ). Show some respect if you want to be respected and live in peace.

To these notices were valid, it is necessary that these boys have assured by their signature receiving the notification. So in any case, it's just a creative way to celebrate the holiday.
