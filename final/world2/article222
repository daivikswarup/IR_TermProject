Irish election: Enda Kenny plans to form government despite losing voters

<p>Battered by unexpected losses in the Irish general election, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny">Enda Kenny</a> has insisted that it is his duty to try to form and head another government.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/feb/18/irelands-general-election-the-guardian-briefing">Ireland's general election – the Guardian briefing</a> </p>

<p>With his Fine Gael party expected to lose close to 30 seats, the taoiseach said on Saturday night that he still has the responsibility “to provide the country with a stable government in the future and I will consider that very carefully over the next 36 hours”.</p>

<p>Fine Gael came into the general election with 73 seats and, with the Irish Labour party, had commanded the biggest majority in Irish political history. Kenny said he would not step down as party leader despite presiding over the huge drop in support from this historic high.<br/></p>

<p>He accepted that the government’s losses meant there was no chance of the coalition being returned to power. “The option of a majority government is gone, the option of a Fine Gael/Labour government is gone … so I need to know the results of all the parties before I decide what is the best thing to do given my duty and responsibility as taoiseach and head of government,” he said.</p>

<p>As Kenny considers his options Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael’s historic rivals from the Irish civil war onwards, was celebrating a stunning electoral comeback from its unprecedented hammering in the 2011 general election.</p>

<p>On course to win up to 46 seats, Fianna Fáil sources told the Guardian that it would not be entering any “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/ireland-election-likely-hung-parliament-talk-grand-coalition">grand coalition” with Fine Gael </a>as part of a unity government that would bury civil war politics forever. “It would be madness to hand over the mantle of opposition to Sinn Féin,” one Fianna Fáil source said.</p>

<p>Earlier <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein">Sinn Féin</a> vice-president, Mary Lou McDonald, who topped the poll in Dublin Central with more than 5,000 votes, described the prospect of a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil coalition as “the stuff of nightmares”.</p>

<p>Sinn Féin is on its way to its best ever performance in the Irish Republic and will probably come out with more than 20 seats. Gerry Adams has once again topped the poll in the border constituency of Louth and may return to the Dáil with his running mate Imelda Munster.</p>

<p>With counting across the Republic expected to go on for several days, there will be little time to spare between the formation of a new government and the set-piece events of St Patrick’s Day as well as Easter Sunday 2016, when the country remembers the centenary of the Easter Rising against British rule.<br/></p>

<p>The Irish Labour party suffered a similar fate to the Liberal Democrats in the UK last May, when the Westminster coalition’s junior partner bore the brunt of voters’ feelings of betrayal. Irish Labour had 33 seats going into the election and will be fortunate to return with 10. Its embattled leader, Joan Burton, managed to hold her seat in Dublin West, however, despite earlier predictions she would lose it. <br/></p>

<p>Burton’s predecessor and the former deputy prime minister, Eamon Gilmore, said the party had been prepared to take hard decisions during its time in office.<br/></p>

<p>Gilmore added: “I think most people try to make decisions and get elected at the same time. But there are occasions when you have to make the choice between doing the right thing and the popular thing. Our country was broke … We knew we had to take a risk.</p>

<p>“The country was facing an existential crisis at that time. It had to be fixed and it was. We could have ended up with a second bailout. We could have faced a situation like Greece.”</p>

<p>Independents and leftwing parties have performed strongly while the Green party has enjoyed a mini-resurrection. The Greens were reduced to zero seats in 2011 but have, against expectations, come back into the Dáil with two seats. <br/></p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/20/irish-elections-dail-enda-kenny-easter-1916">smaller parties and the independents may yet play roles as kingmakers</a> if the two biggest parties make overtures to them. But the only thing certain about the 32nd Dáil is that it will be highly unstable and unlikely to last more than two years. <br/></p>

The crash was a fraudulent bankruptcy not an accident, the decision to indemnify the speculators against the market was a choice by the Irish state to rob the poor, it was and is nothing more than a capital levy.

Perhaps there could be a system of PR with an added section in which the voter could tick the party or parties he or she would be prepared for their first choice to go into coalition with.It would make opinion polls even more fun.

I'd agree with that. The grand coalition is usually an unfortunate result because it leaves the electorate with a completely toothless opposition.

They offered 110% mortgages! Enough to buy your hovel and to do it up! It was all a total fantasy...the never ending property boom. Yes, critics were attacked and the countries institutions all failed us terribly, the press being as culpable as the government and banks. However, there has to be some personal responsibility in these matters. We are bombarded with marketing messages 24/7 and we have to differentiate between the bullshit and the downright deceptive, delusional and dangerous bullshit. No one seems to raise their hand and say "yeah, my bad...I went mental for a while there". It's just so much easier to blame others. Remember the whole private versus public sector debate? A very successful divide and (conquer)distract strategy by the government. I think property prices are back close to boom levels again, certainly in Dublin, Cork and Galway cities so I think people who bought there are doing OK now... It's the satellite towns servicing Dublin and more rural areas that were hit hardest.

Well yes, I would imagine so, but I setting aside how insulting the OP was in relation to Mary Lou, SF have done quite well in this election, increasing their seats. So from that point of view I am not sure what they are talking about.

I think you are being somewhat disingenuous, you don't seem to have a problem with Robert Mugabe's birthday party being on the front page, nor for that matter I imagine would you refer to Zimbabwe as "Rhodesia" as you did twice with "Southern Ireland", even though it had already been pointed out to you that that was not the state's name.

That's a fair point. However, the banks, who were very poorly regulated (and some in corrupt relations with one another and the government) blithely offered 99% mortgages with no realistic assessment of ability to pay. The Irish people didn't HAVE to avail of these deals, but with house prices escalating many profitably traded up for years and this became an expectation. Critics were attacked by leading politicians for their negativity and younger buyers had known nothing but a boom. The whole created a culture in which caution was thrown to the wind. So people made bad decisions, but perfectly in keeping with the economic polity of the day. They are now angry because their houses are worthless, their mortgages are just as huge, and rather than the banks (& their shareholders) paying for the huge fiscal gap, they are covering that debt too. As will their grandchildren most likely.

It's not a wonder solution, but the winner takes it all system is also not that great for the people who voted for the losing party. At least PR usually means that a greater share of the voters has their views represented in the coalition agreement.

But it was "mil.itant republicanism" that won agains the Britih and established the right of the SF to speak freely (and therefore be able to fight on peaceful territory) - how can having such determination be a "liability" - only to reactionaries.

If FF don't want a Grand Coalition, or SF to be the main opposition party, they presumably want Gerry Adams to be in Government instead, since there's no real alternative.

As someone with an honours degree in Commerce from UCD majoring in Finance, a number of post graduate diplomas, a masters in Law and who is currently working as a corporate lawyer in one of Ireland's top law firms, I'd be willing to bet I work longer hours and harder than you Patrick. Indeed, I'd be willing to wager my tax contributions are higher too. In fact, I'd simply assert that I understand what is going on better than you. You're one of our moronic middle class who takes his beliefs on economics from the "global consensus" without understanding it. Paddy likes to know what's going on, according to your pal Enda, it would seem you prefer not knowing what is going on. It's people like you who make these results all the more satisfying. Thank you for affording me the opportunity to savour it.

The question I put to friends of mine 10 years ago, who were about to enter the property market at its peek, was..."Can you tell me of any property boom, anywhere in the world, at any time in history, that didn't eventually go bust?" Of course they couldn't but it didn't stop them spunking their futures down the drain on a terraced house in Dolphins Barn or a one bedroom closet in Dundrum. I do feel for anyone who bought at the peak of the market but ultimately its their own fault. The warning signs and dissenting voices were there but they chose not to listen. They listened instead to the politicians, banks and the estate agents...you know, everyone that was making an absolute fortune out of the market. The myth of the property bubble (and the world financial meltdown) is that no one could foresee it...WRONG. No one in the bubble could foresee it but those of us on the outside could see past the "smoke and mirrors". We watched our friends, and family turn into mindless, deluded members of the property cult. The smoke and mirrors are now in your head mate...you have moved straight from the property bubble to the blame bubble.

.Having had nearly 80% of the electorate vote for something other than him, Enda Kenny will tell us that the people have spoken and he has listened and what Ireland now needs is a stable government led by him and his cronies.

True, historically, both FF and FG shaped most of the economic and fiscal policies of Irish free state/republic to suit the interests of business to a degree that you would normally see only in an off-shore tax haven. Certainly, one is as bad and as culpable as the other.

Damn near to a perfect result, within the bounds of what was possible. The arrogant right wing neoliberals were cock sure they would stroll back into government. Fearmongering and their Pinochet-like warnings of "Stability or chaos" in a lame attempt at re-running the recent UK GE and Tory success, proved impotent at the ballot box, which is of huge credit to the Irish people.

It's about time that this canard about Fianna Fail was disposed of. FF did NOT bankrupt the country - the banks and the financial institutions did. And Jean-Claude Trichet helped by threatening to add to the problem if Ireland didn't pay off the bank gamblers in full. Blaming Fianna Fail because they were in power when the crash happened is like blaming the pilot of an aircraft for a crash when someone else has stolen the fuel out of the tanks.Fine Gael and Labour failed to stand up to Trichet - Finance Minister Noonan described him as a "perfect gentleman" and denied he had been bullied by him only for a letter to turn up proving that Trichet had indeed acted the bully.
