Poetry and silence: Iran's Kurds tread the line between art and activism




DateTime::::2016-02-26T15:24:08+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>n a sleepy town in Iranian Kurdistan, people take off their winter coats. It is evening, and outside one can just about discern the silhouettes of the mountains that lead to the Turkish and Iraqi borders. Inside, some 60 people fill the small community centre with a clammy heat. But it is not just warmth they are after. They have come for poetry. <br/></p>

<p>For several hours, old ladies, moustached students and intellectuals share their latest compositions. With the guttural grace of Sôrani Kurdish, they evoke the smell of the homeland, its ragged mountaintops, and the wanderings of the lone peshmerga fighter. People hold their breath as friends approach their last lines. </p>

<p>Poetry is alive in Iranian Kurdistan. New statues of old literary masters arise on busy roundabouts, melodious verses echo from crackling radios and youngsters haggle over the latest slim volumes on crowded street markets. </p>

<p>“It’s a form of resistance to us,” explains one attendee. “But it has to be ambiguous, in the way poetry can be. When I write about Kurdistan, I make sure the images I use can just as well refer to a woman. That way I don’t get into trouble, I just say it’s all about love.” </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/feb/26/iran-urban-divide-elections-kurdistan-tehran">From Kurdistan to Tehran: the urban-rural divide as Iranians turn out to vote</a> </p>

<p>Others tread the line between art and activism less carefully. As the meeting progresses, concerned parents condemn the ‘brainwashing’ of their children in Farsi-only schools, an old woman reads out her poem on soldiers burning children’s toys, and a few youngsters call attention to the bravery of their ‘brothers and sisters’ fighting the Islamic State group (Isis) in Syria. Perhaps not everyone realises that a handful of <em><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/sep/08/basij-militia-and-social-control-in-iran-book-interview">basijis</a> </em>are sitting at the back. </p>

<p>In many ways, the situation of Iranian Kurds is as ambiguous as their poetry meetings. Estimates vary as to their numbers, but at up to 8 million, Iran’s Kurdish population is second in size only to the Kurds in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey">Turkey</a> and probably larger than the Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish populations combined. But while Kurdistan at large is in turmoil and stands at the centre of attention, Iran’s Kurds seem to bathe in silence.<br/></p>

<p>Underneath the surface, frustration is simmering. Hoping to improve their plight, 71% of voters in Kurdistan province – which is smaller than Iran’s mainly Kurdish areas – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.princeton.edu/irandataportal/elections/pres/2013-presidential-electio/election-data/">opted for Hassan Rouhani</a> during the 2013 presidential election, comfortably above his Iran-wide tally of 51%. On the eve of yet another election and nearly three years of disappointments later, however, the Kurds face the question not just of who to vote for but of whether they will ever be included in any type of reform.</p>

<p>Abbas Vali, professor of modern social and political theory at the department of sociology, Bogaziçi University, Istanbul, and author of several books on the Iranian Kurds, says the Kurds’ “suffering” in Iran is different to elsewhere: “We are talking about entirely different histories. In Turkey, for instance, the modernising discourse of Kemalism has long marked the Kurds as the essential opposite of ‘civilised’ Turks. But in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>, Kurds were never really seen as outsiders. Rather, they were portrayed as ‘pure’ Persians, a brave mountain people defending the homeland.”</p>

<p>For Vali, the marginalisation of Iran’s Kurds stems from quite recent political decisions and has two dimensions. The first is religious. “It’s ironic. The Islamic Republic has recently condemned Saudi Arabia for its sectarianism, but in reality it is doing very much the same thing to its own people. It has been successful in institutionalising religious discrimination against Sunnis and other religious minorities...Sunni institutions throughout Kurdistan operate under harsh conditions.”</p>

<p>Second, Iranian Kurdistan is treated as a security zone. This was most obvious during the Iran-Iraq war, when the Kurds were squeezed between Saddam’s chemical attacks and Iranian counteroffensives. But, says Vali, the logic of military rule has never disappeared. “It’s something engraved in the mindset of government officials: when they smell trouble, they first turn to the Kurds. This became very clear during the ‘green movement’ protests in 2009. Even though Kurdistan didn’t take part in the protests anywhere near as much as other regions, it still saw the largest number of executions.”<br/></p>

<p>According to a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/MDE13/088/2008/en/">2008 Amnesty International report</a>, a variety of abuses faced by Iranian Kurds rose under the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Sunnis were excluded from employment and education, the Kurdish language and clothing became targets of policing, and the numbers of Kurdish political prisoners rose. </p>

<p>One notorious case was Farzad Kamangar, a teacher whose shocking letter from prison was published by Amnesty. “When I said I was Kurdish,” Kamangar wrote, “they would flog me all over my body with a hose-like device…They flogged me to a pulp because of the Kurdish ring tone I had on my mobile phone. They would handcuff me and tie me to a chair and put pressure on my sensitive spots, and they would strip me naked, threatening to violate me sexually.” </p>

<p>After a hunger strike and several suicide attempts, Kamangar was executed on 9 May 2010. Under Ahmadinejad, notes Amnesty, the Kurds merited nothing but repression. </p>

<p>This changed in 2013 with the election of Rouhani, who promised in his campaign to “remove the stain of discrimination and inequality from the face of the religious and ethnic minorities in Iran”. In a country where these minorities make up half the population – and votes – the language of minority rights can be tactical business. Rouhani’s victory showed this could work, but has he transformed his words into realities? </p>

<p>In some respects, the answer is yes. At the University of Kurdistan in Sanandaj, the campus buildings are still clad with the faces of Islamic martyrs, but inside a group of students are debating their own identities. </p>

<p>One of them gets out his laptop and shows a promotion video he has made for a conference on Kurdish culture. Slides of famous Kurdish writers and singers interleave with quant villages and mighty mountaintops to the epic tune of what sounds like a Kurdish version of Star Wars’ Imperial March. The students are visibly excited, aware that they are among the pioneers of the newly established faculty for Kurdish language and literature. </p>

<p>“For 15 years we fought for this department”, one of them exclaims. “And now, with Rouhani as president, it is finally there.” There are 39 students on the programme, with the number expected to increase to 60 next year. </p>

<p>When asked about the contents of the course, they stress its apolitical nature. “We focus only on literature and poetry. That merits study in itself! Kurdish authors use stylistic forms that do not exist in any other language. And there is an enormous folkloric heritage. Did you know that in Iranian Kurdistan alone there are 6000 different folk songs?” </p>

<p>Mardin, a former journalist, couldn’t care less. As he chain-smokes behind his desk, his face is set with the grin of someone who has seen it all. “It’s cosmetic. Why do you think they opened this so-called Kurdish faculty? Not to have any actual discussions on things that matter, I can assure you. It’s not a coincidence there’s no history, sociology or politics taught. They just want to control what these students are doing. Literature of course can be a weapon, I’m not against that, but only if you are holding the pen yourself.”</p>

<p>According to Mardin, the Iranian Kurds’ main problem is isolation. “People think we are doing fine, simply because we have no one to turn to. There’s no free press in Iran as a whole, let alone in Kurdistan. And we don’t have the powerful international connections that other Kurds do.” </p>

<p>In this respect, he argues, the Iranian Kurds are worse off than their cousins elsewhere. “Of course, the Kurds in Turkey find themselves in a terrible situation. But at least they can turn to the media, to international organisations or to civil society. Here, we live in a dictatorship.” Having embraced Sufism after spending a year in prison, Mardin is aware how deep the effects of this go. “Dictatorships operate by isolating their citizens from the world and from each other, to the point that we simply can’t see beyond anything but our own individual survival. We have given up on grand causes.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/oct/29/iran-kurdistan-zagros-mountains-travel">Inside the Zagros Mountains, the forgotten region of ​Iranian Kurdistan</a> </p>

<p>Not everyone has. Sitting in a local teahouse, Sirwan does not stop smiling. He has spent several years in prison and is a respected figure. People walk up to him to exchange quick handshakes in tribute to his courage. When asked about his permanent smile, he smiles even more. “It used to bother the prison guards, too. They tortured me, but I would always try to keep my head up high. I used to ask them: ‘Who’s the free one here? You, who are paid a couple of tomans to pull my nails out, or me, who can think freely and smile at you despite your cruelty?’” </p>

<p>He sips from his tea, and laughs: “It drove them mad”.</p>

<p>Having suffered torture under the Rouhani administration, Sirwan is not impressed by its promises. “The largest group of political prisoners is still Kurdish. You should see the prisons, they are like universities. Journalists, professors, activists, students – nearly everyone is there for political reasons. They throw 40 men in a small room with no facilities and submit them to systematic beatings. But the worst are the isolation cells. Months of loneliness, it drives you mad.”</p>

<p>Despite such abuses, Sirwan is most worried about more subtle attempts to marginalise the Kurds. “It’s the small things that turn our life into a continuous fight. We can’t teach our language to our children, have no right to publish about our history, and must always be careful not to stand out as a Kurd. For instance, if you have an obviously Kurdish or Sunni name, you will never get into public office. This means that nearly all high officials in Kurdistan are non-Kurdish, and they simply refuse to invest in the region.” </p>

<p>Many Kurds says the effects of this are obvious in a shortage of jobs, houses and infrastructure. “It’s outrageous,” says Sirwan. “While the rest of the country is celebrating a nuclear deal and preparing itself for an economic opening, we will remain stuck in poverty.” </p>

<p>Sirwan realises these are structural problems that won’t be solved overnight. “It would be wrong to expect too much from the reformists,” he admits. “All this talk about Rouhani is counterproductive. Of course we need to welcome a new rhetoric on minority rights, but it doesn’t end there. We should look at the long term.” </p>

<p>Above all, he thinks, this requires reform from below. “There really is a lot going on beneath the surface. Young people especially are organising themselves in ways that no government will be able to contain in the long run.”</p>

<p>According to Vali, the real question is what this new generation aims for. Will they claim their rights as Kurds, or fight for the democratisation of Iran as a whole? </p>

<p>Since the nuclear deal, he argues, the answer to this question has changed. “For a long time, organisations such as the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran (KDPI) or the Marxist Komala<em> </em>[both outlawed parties] did not think it necessary to reform the Islamic Republic. After all, their aim was to get rid of it...But now that Iran is again becoming part of the international community, they realise the Islamic Republic may be here to stay.” </p>

<p>To change it, then, one has to work from within. Ethnic politics alone, Vali argues, may not be the most effective in this respect. “Kurdish democratic parties are at their strongest when they build bridges between Kurdish and non-Kurdish groups in society. This is what the successes of the Kurdish HDP in Turkey teach us.” </p>

<p>Vali argues that initiatives for similar alliances are unlikely to come from the KDPI or Komala<em>: </em>“After years of exile in Iraq, these parties have lost touch with Iranian society, especially with the younger generation...[who] are looking for a new framework through which to express themselves.”</p>

<p>Back in Kurdistan, it is precisely this search that stirs the minds of young people. Sitting on an enormous Persian carpet in a small flat with no furniture, a group of students chat and smoke deep into the night. They are well-read, idealist and political. </p>

<p>“Resistance is life!” one of them shouts, using a Kurdish political slogan. Part of it is self-mockery. After all, what options are there really? “Some of my friends are in the Pejak,” he says, referring to the Free Life of Kurdistan Party, which is linked to the Turkey-based PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) and which has been waging an armed struggle against the Iranian government since 2004. “They keep asking me to join, but I’m not into violence. It’s not my kind of thing.” </p>

<p>Asked what is, he fetches his laptop. On it, Selahattin Demirtaş, co-leader of the Kurdish HDP in Turkey, is singing a revolutionary folk song. </p>

<p>“What a man! Did you see his speech after the Ankara bombings? How he dares to stand up against the Turkish government? That’s what I call leadership.” </p>

<p>The other students huddle around the screen as they flick through endless images: of the de facto autonomous Kurdish region of ‘Rojava’ in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a>, the peaceful campaigners of the HDP in Turkey, and the solidarity marches of Kurdish organisations in European cities. They are clearly longing to break out of their isolation and into the new forms of politics emerging throughout the region. For the moment, however, these realities can only be summoned on a laptop screen.</p>

<p>That, or in poetry. In the community centre, the meeting is coming to its end, but most people seem unwilling to leave. As they hang about to enjoy the last moments of their weekly catharsis, the club’s principal suddenly pulls them back into reality: “I forgot to remind you! Please do come to next week’s meeting, but be aware that we are receiving some guests from Tehran.” </p>

<p>A resignation takes hold of the room, for people know what this means. There will be no politics, no discussion and no creativity – just silence. Far more than Friday’s elections, it will be the making or breaking of this silence that will shape the future of Iran’s Kurds. </p>

In Turkey, in the past there were some mistakes against the Kurdish people but far less than the African/black people experienced in US. Erdogan gave new taboo-breaking rights to the Kurdish citizens in conjuction with the peace process. However, PKK-connected political party HDP has always wanted more (first autonomy then independence). PKK has seen the Syrian war as an opportunity to gain more. So, its members killed two policemen at home while sleeping with the pretext of Suruc bombing, where the majority of the deads were from young leftist/communist Turkish people which had a meeting about Kobani. Interestingly, no HDP member were there. This caused the cancellation of peace process and starting the military actions against PKK's bases in Turkey and Iraq. Effective operations on PKK by Turkish security units changed PKK's policy and they have sended the terrorists in some counties in the southeastern cities and declared autonomy. So, the operations have shifted from rural areas to urban areas. BUT this problem is NOT with TURKS and KURDS but TURKISH PEOPLE AND TERRORISTS. The Kurdish people are equal citizens in Turkey and live throughout Turkey in peace. We have Kurdish friends and neighbours. PKK is inveigling young people under 18 for being terrorists and send them into dead mostly before 20. Main problem of the region is ignorance and poverty. Kurdish people in the region usually live in tribes and have too many children (around 10). So they can not give enough care for their children. The terror organizations such as PKK usually use this situation to gain new members. By terrorizing the region, PKK gives the biggest harm to the people living there. PKK always tries to prevent state projects for developing the region and attacks to public institutions. In short PKK causes socio-economic problems in the region. Unfortunately, the West always use this problem well to create chaos in Turkey. Many Turkish security and public officials have been killed but we only read the stories about the terrorists. Don't forget, one day terror can hit you too. With provocations, you are only making innocent people's lives harder.

Kurdish languages are derivatives of middle Persian language among many other Iranian local languages. Do you have any idea what that is? It is very similar in construct to other ones in greater Iranian plateau. The construct of the language is the same, words and meaning changes from region to region. Sometimes you find close language kinship from one area to another. For example some dialects of Gilaki in northern Iran is way closer to some dialects of Kurdish, even conversationally understandable. Modern Persian (or Farsi) is standardization of a derivative of middle Persian in north eastern Iran and is about 1000 years old. It has been the language franca of Iran, for that period. This is my lecture on linguistic and history to you, if you need more lectures I have to charge you.

This article is a comparative study of how Kurds live in general and in Iran in particular. It is a "must" for anyone who is interested in this ethnic group. The Turkish Kurds have benn fighting for their cause and are seen as the fifth column by Ankara. The Treaty of Sèvres was signed in 1920 between the defeated Ottoman Turks and the European victors. It would have provided for a Kurdish state, subject to the agreement of the League of Nations, and divided modern Turkey between several countries, leaving the Turks themselves with only a rump state in central Anatolia. But World War Two changed the situation on the ground. When Turkey sought to join the EU, Ankara felt snubbed, as it was told to allow the Kurds to have their broadcasting and education in Kurdish. Today's Iraq was part of the Ottoman Empire, and the Iraqi Kurds had fought for decades, until the Iraqi government and the Kurds agreed to a peace accord in 1970, which granted them autonomy in the Iraqi Kurdistan and recognised Kurdish as an official language. But in Iran, the Kurds have been widely ignored, because they are not allowed to stand out as an ethnic minority. However they came in handy after the Turkish Kurd separatist leader, Abdullah Ocalan was captured in February 1999, the Iranian authorities were said to have initially encouraged the Iranian Kurds to stage protests outside Turkish diplomatic missions in Tehran and elsewhere, to highlight the alleged role of the Israeli Mossad in abducting Ocalan in Kenya. The Turks had to evacuate their consulate in Orumiyeh, in north-west Iran, because the protests turned violent, with security forces opening fire, in an effort to prevent the Iranian Kurds from taking the opportunity to express their grievances.

Kurds are Indo-Europeans and their language is Indo-European. They are not Semitic (like the Arabs), nor Turkic. As far as I know they are Iranians as much as the Medes and the Persians were.

Iranians certainly knew handling Kurds better than Turks since they are cousins with each other.Turkey should take lesson from Iran for hanging Kurdish terrorists, and in general antiteror policy.Iranians successfully exported their Kurdish problem to Turkey by deporting Kurds for 500 years, (therefore Turkey became one of the biggest Kurdish populated country) Turks naively allowed persecuted sunni Kurds from Iranian Kurdistan therefore spread Kurdish problem from Southeast Anatolia to Northeast and inner Anatolia, and then Kurds thanks with terror.

Kurds are Iranian people. 40% of Kurds in Iran are Sunni, 60% Shia. The percentage was the other way before Saddam ethnically cleansed 3 million Shia Kurds to Iran from Iraq. Were it not for Ottoman empire taking part of Iran upon their foundation some 500 years ago, Kurds would have stayed part of Iran, and like other Iranians converted to Shia. The "Kurdish" issue in Iran has always been more about Sunnis, it gets intermixed, and exaggerate by the westerners. There are no discrimination in Iran with respect to Kurdish names, as they are same as Iranian names. Kurdish languages are a derivative of middle Persian (Farsi) so are many other local languages in Iran. As a matter of fact Kurdish is very close to many of them, with various degree of understandability between them all. Modern Persian (Farsi) is standardization of one descendent of the middle Persian from northeastern Iran. It has been lingua franca, of greater Iran for a millennia. It doesn't indicate an ethnicity. It has also been language of literacy, commerce, governments,( even under Ottoman Empire). Standardization of Kurdish (Sorani) into a language is less than 100 years old starting in Iraq. An Iranian Kurd, just like any other Iranian, like a Mazendrani, may as well use Fars as language franca.

I must have said something that caused you to take time to write all these responses and in one go. This usually happens when I am right. I don't know what your background is to have such a superficial knowledge but not deep enough to say actually what is that is in your mind. I guess you must have read a book. But, for a guy who calls Khuzestan (cradle of Iranian civilization), Arabistan (actually a Persian name which included part of oil producing region of today's Saudi Arabia as well) you have some agenda, and it is not just about Kurds. Now, about some of your points, as for Azeri-ness of Khamenei. The most conservative Mullahs in Iran come from Azerbaijan, and that is historically true. In Azerbaijan in religious circles they love him. As for Persian ethnicity in Iran, It doesn't exist. No Iranian from any region calls a guy from Isfahan, or Mashhad, Persian (or Parsi/Farsi). It just doesn't jive. Fars is a province in Iran, even people from that province don't call themselves Persians (or Parsi). You have to go to India to find one of those.

Why is it that whenever a reputable paper like the Guardian decides to explore the legitimate grievances of Kurds in Iran, head-in-the-sand Iranian nationalists suddenly emerge from obscurity to grace us with the light of their wisdom and learnedness?

The Saudis announced publicly they will destabilize Iran based on ethnicities of Iran. Apparently the Turks are on board with it now. So is the author of this nonsense.

But while Kurdistan at large is in turmoil and stands at the centre of attention, Iran’s Kurds seem to bathe in silence. Underneath the surface, frustration is simmering.

You are totally right despite this corrupt government the oldest state in the world can not be so easily undermined. But it is deliberate and directed.

"On the eve of yet another election, frustration simmers below the surface..." ..Does it somebody dreams about another revolution?
