Waiting for Trump: watching US elections in Tehran




DateTime::::2016-03-07T12:34:09+0000



<p>As American hardliners scramble to see who can bash Iran harder, Iranians worry the power struggle for control of the United States government could undermine their nuclear deal with world powers, under which the toughest international sanctions have been lifted in return for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> restricting its nuclear energy programme.</p>

<p>The Iranian government remains committed to implementing the deal signed last July, according to Seyed Mohammad Marandi, an associate professor of world and international studies at the University of Tehran.</p>

<p>“The parliament supported it,” said Marandi. “The Supreme National Security Council supported it. The leader supports it. The new parliament will definitely support it.”<br/> </p>

<p>But Marandi and many others worry that the US may renege on the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or otherwise seek to antagonise Iran. He cites the decision by the US Congress and Obama administration to require anyone who has visited Iran (or Iraq, Syria and Sudan) to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/dec/10/iranian-americans-scapegoats-for-terrorist-acts-by-us-congress-hr158">apply for a visa</a> to enter the US - including Iranian dual nationals living in Europe who may have been visiting family. Similar regulations don’t apply to people who have visited Saudi Arabia or other US allies.</p>

<p>Marandi says the new procedures violate the spirit if not the letter of the JCPOA. “It is discriminatory,” he said. “The irony is that the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the United States have been carried out by people from places like Saudi Arabia. But the restrictions are against Iranians.”</p>

<p>Iranian officials also worry about who may come to power in the US. Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz">Ted Cruz</a> have both vowed to cancel the nuclear agreement. Cruz said he would “rip [it] to shreds” on his “very first day in office”.</p>

<p>When in January the Obama administration secured the release of four Americans held in Iran in return for the release of seven Iranians imprisoned in the US, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, the Republican frontrunner, denounced a “bad deal” that set a “bad precedent”.</p>

<p>“The US elections will definitely have a big impact,” said Hamid Dehghani, Middle East director of Iran’s foreign ministry. But he notes that to re-impose sanctions lifted under the JCPOA, the US would need the support of Europeans, Russians and Chinese: “The US doesn’t have the power to stand against the whole world.” </p>

<p>Mohammad Javad Zarif, the foreign minister, during an appearance in London prior to the elections, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/events/special/16%201Q%20Iran%20QA.pdf">noted</a> that American presidential candidates say one thing on the campaign trail but do another once in office. “I’m sure the next US president will not be able to tear up the agreement, because if we implement that agreement, it’s so good for everybody that nobody will see it in their interest” to tear it up.</p>

<p>Opponents in Iran of the nuclear agreement fared badly in elections on 26 February for both parliament and the Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that selects the supreme leader. But they are far from silenced.<br/></p>

<p>Ahmad Nasirinasab, a 54-year-old small businessman interviewed at Friday prayers in Tehran, continues to oppose the nuclear agreement. “I think we have been cheated,” he said. “We stopped our nuclear activities, but sanctions are still in place.” He was referring to continuing unilateral sanctions imposed by the US on Iran for human rights violations and testing ballistic missiles. </p>

<p>Neither does continued implementation of the JCPOA mean cooperation with the US on regional issues such as Syria. If anything, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, intelligence services and supreme leader have offered even stronger support for President <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad">Bashar al-Assad</a> in recent months.</p>

<p>Opinion in Iran seems to have moved more in support of Iran’s participation in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a> since last September, when the Russian military launched air strikes and sent ground troops to battle rebels, allowing the Syrian army to regain control of some areas.</p>

<p>Moscow’s intervention “has led to the feeling that we are not alone,” said Mohammad Pirali, managing editor of the conservative newspaper Siasat-e Rooz. “There are other powerful countries that have the same interest as us.”</p>

<p>Iran has fewer than 2000 Revolutionary Guards stationed in Syria, according to Marandi. But it finances thousands more fighters from the Lebanese Hezbollah, and Shia militias from Iraq and Afghanistan. Hundreds have died in battle, causing some Iranians to doubt the war effort.</p>

<p>“These concerns are still there,” said Pirali, “perhaps even stronger. But people have accepted the justification that if we don’t continue what we’re doing in Syria, we may have to fight at our own borders.”<br/> </p>

<p>A recent opinion <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.publicpolicy.umd.edu/newsroom/press-releases/iranians-strongly-support-rouhani-and-his-growing-international-engagement">poll</a> by the University of Maryland indicated 63% of Iranians support their government sending troops to Syria.</p>

<p>Pirali concedes, however, that the war is unlikely to end soon. If Iranian casualties mount, would public opinion shift against Iran’s role? “Yes, it’s quite probable,” he said. “Iran is not interested in that at all. We’ll try to finish as soon as possible.”<br/></p>

<p>That may not be so easy. Dehghani, the foreign ministry official, admits Assad has lost control of 60% of Syria’s territory. “Syria has been unofficially divided by rebel groups,” he said. “The situation is fluid.” </p>

Hezbollah are Shiites. They have a political wing which has been democratically elected to the Lebanese Parliament, as well as a military wing, which pushed the IDF out of Lebanon, the last time Israel invaded the country.

Kat, that is not true. Iran has supported numerous terrorists groups in the Arab Muslim world.Is Hezbollah Sunni Salafists and Wahabists?Is the PLO Sunni Salafists and Wahabists?Iran has been a hardline opponent to Israel and has expressed the ideal of annihilation/eradication of the Israeli State.

Mark I neglected to mention that the US doesn't believe the Government of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the 9/11 attack and immediately jumped onboard in support of the US.Perhaps this is a naive failure in intelligence collection and unmerited faith in the US/Saudi Allegiance, but the 9/11 attack wouldn't serve Saudi Arabia's best interests.

Mark, US relations with Arab Muslims is sketchy at best. In the last 50 years, the US has supported Israel's right to exist against Arab opposition that at times has strained the peace in the region.The US has tried to provide a marginal compromise to appease aggrieved States and encouraged restraint on both sides. Syria and Iran have been the most vocal, and supported terrorist groups like Hezbollah and the PLO, who over decades have carried out horrific terrorist attacks on both Israel and US assets in the region.The US has developed relationships with a number of Arab States including Jordan and Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq and Pakistan. Saudi Arabia hosts a US base and the US provides security in return.However, as I Stated these relationships have been delicate and caused some regional problems.Iran has been especially problematic in threatening Israel and pursuing development of their nuclear weapons program. With the exception of Pakistan, the UN has been clear it doesn't want nuclear weapons in the Middle East given their propensity to engage in terror attacks upon one another and on international targets.The West depends on Mid East oil and needs allies in the region to meet demand, thus the strange arrangement with Saudi Arabia. Iran is less then cooperative and has a long standing blood feud with Saudi Arabia, and the US is, for lack of a better word, is duty bound to act in Saudi Arabia's best interests.Saddam complicated things when he invaded Kuwait, attacked Iran and threatened Saudi Arabia.

The Miullas would love to see a republican in power rather than a Democrat. Remember how they made a deal with Reagan's team about the hostages and how they provided cash for the dope dealers of the contras for weaponry.Trump is all about doing business and has said many times that he opposes interventionism.It is Rubio,Cruz and Clinton they should worry about who,s election campaigns are being funded by the Neocon Zionists .There is absolutely no reason for the US,with Trump as President, to go after the Mullas since the empire received the best support during the Iraq and Afganistan wars from none other than the Persian mullacracy and such cooperation will certainly continue.

Trump was actually a registered Democrat when Hillary was running in the 2008 primaries. He supported her ekection campaign, and has supported the Clinton Foundation. Before and after 2008 -2010, he' been a registered Republican. On and off for 14 years.

It was Saddam Hussein who attacked and invaded Iran in 1980. He was supported by the US. It was NOT Iran 'that went to war with Iraq'. It was the last thing they needed at that point, just after the 1979 revolution.

The way some Americans go on, and on about the 1979 hostage crisis, you'd think the Iranians had killed some of the hostages. They didn't harm a hair on their heads. The only Americans that were killed, were during the US rescue attempt, when a US helikopter collied with a US plane, on the ground in Iran.

The Tehran bureau has a one eyed Approach where they only see the US and Iran. The agreement included many other countries and there is no evidence that they would follow the US on this. Iran has great opportunities to develop trade links across Asia where development is taking place.

The Mullahs through years of American and then international sanctions have lead Iran up to this point whereby they they have a very well educated population a military so strong that America and Israel are given pause for thought on any military action and an economy that is about to literally explode and is causing a near stampede from western nations wanting to enter business deals with them.

There is a long line of other nations who suffered the same fate. While the US continues to spend such a vast sum on the military industrial complex it needs to both justify its existence and deplete its stock pile of hardware to ensure new orders and continuance. So expect more demonisations of foreign leaders and more killing. The US has definitely become a Malthusuain check.

So, the Iranian regime has finally realised that they are stuck between a rock and a hard place.Quite frankly, that is exactly the consequence of what they have been doing to “their people” for decades.However, despite all that the members of regime are more eager to remove restrictions on their “duel passports”, so they could maintain their freedom of movement without needing to obtain visa, travelling to Europe and America, transferring assets and taking care of their properties and investments and paying “their loyal employees” abroad.Yep, who is calling who hypocrite!
