Edward Snowden, Pussy Riot and Ai Weiwei protest cyber censorship




DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:00:01+0000



<p>Prominent activists ranging from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden">Edward Snowden</a> to Pussy Riot plan on Friday to spread online protests against growing government restrictions on citizens’ expression, marking an annual world day against cyber censorship.<br/></p>

<p>In one message, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden">Snowden</a>, who has been in self-imposed exile in Russia since 2013 after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance">revealing</a> via the Guardian that the US government ran secret and illegal domestic and international surveillance programmes, will tell the public: “Even if you’re not doing anything wrong, you’re being watched and recorded.”</p>

<p>The Chinese artist <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei">Ai Weiwei</a> will also take part. One of his messages will read: “Without freedom of speech there is no modern world, just a barbaric one.”</p>

<p>Ai has long <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2015/sep/08/ai-weiwei-beijing-prison-freedom-of-speech">suffered</a> from various forms of oppression and censorship by China’s government.</p>

<p>Other messages will be published from citizens of North Korea. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/amnesty-international">Amnesty International</a> says North Korea subjects its people to the highest levels of censorship in the world, with the vast majority of citizens denied any access to the internet.</p>

<p>The online messages are part of activities to mark <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://en.rsf.org/world-day-against-cyber-censorship-12-03-2010,36566">World Day Against Cyber Censorship</a>, an annual online event started in 2008 by Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International.</p>

<p>This year, Amnesty has teamed up with the controversial online advertisement-blocking company AdBlock to bring activists’ voices to the public.</p>

<p>On Friday, when users of AdBlock begin browsing online they will be presented with an announcement asking if they would like to see messages from Amnesty International where ads would normally appear, if they were not blocked.</p>

<p>According to a statement from Amnesty International, if users click through, they will see the notes written by the activists as well as content from ordinary people “whom governments have tried to silence”. </p>

<p>“Authorities don’t just use handcuffs and arrests but also media attacks,” the message from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot">Pussy Riot</a> will read.</p>

<p>Pussy Riot, an activist female punk collective that has had frequent high-profile run-ins with Russian authorities, released its latest <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/russia-pussy-riot-latest-punk-protest-prison-selective-weapon">protest song</a> last month.</p>

<p>Many governments around the world are “avidly” seeking to control “ever greater” aspects of their citizens’ online communication, Amnesty warned on Friday, while some seek laws empowering their authorities to carry out intrusive mass surveillance while censoring what people see online.</p>

<p>“Others are trying to acquire technologies that allow them to spy on people, hack their devices or censor free expression online,” the Amnesty statement said.</p>

<p>In 2015, Amnesty recorded people being arrested in more than 16 countries for saying or doing online what would in most countries be regarded as normal freedom of expression.</p>

<p>“Some states are engaged in Orwellian levels of surveillance, particularly targeting the lives and work of the people who defend our human rights – lawyers, journalists and peaceful activists,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International secretary general. </p>

<p>“This continuing development of new methods of repression in reaction to increased connectivity is a major threat to our freedom of expression.”</p>

<p>Gabriel Cubbage, chief executive of AdBlock, said the company would show Amnesty’s online banners in place of ads to its 40 million users for one day only.</p>

<p>The rise of advert blocking software has prompted great anxiety in the online news media, which relies on ad revenue, especially when content is free.</p>

<p>The controversy over ad blocking does not seem to have deterred the likes of Snowden and Pussy Riot from participating in AdBlock’s event with Amnesty.</p>

Without Snowden the World wouldn't know about The American barbarism of institutionalised Regeime change that they forced on non compliant countries nor would the existence of the internment camp at Guantanamo bay which used experimental tortures on the inmates. The more knowledge Snowden releases about American crimes against humanity the better.

not "a pop group", not a "dictator", not "because they were critical to him"...

Agreed, seems rather hypocritical of him to see Russia as a role model for free speech.

I heard Pussy Riots have been called to Hollywood to print their hands in the Walk of Fame.due to lack of space, they'll remove Aretha Franklin to make room for them.

exactly my thought. Pussy riots name today only appears on the Guardian. The rest of the world hardly remembers about them.

Snowden is traitor who should tried and punished for violating his oath. And hiding like a rat in Russia hardly gives him any credibility on free speech issues

Unless the conspiracy theory that Pussy Riot were acting on behalf of Putin is true. It was the time of democratic protests in Russia and presidential election's eve. Putin used their act to steer discussion from who and how Russians should elect someone as their president to how one should behave inside the church.

Snowden and Pussy Riot = peaches and cream. He's attacking a covertly sinister regime, while they are attacking an overtly sinister one...But I pity Snowden, it must be slowly dawning on him that the consequences of his honesty have pushed him into a camp even more dubious than the one he betrayed. Like Tony Benn, he's ended up as a marginalised voice of conscience in the wilderness. It's ordinary westerners who should really be thanking him - but instead they just see him paraded like a captured RAF pilot on Iraqi TV. He just accentuates the absurd West vs Russia divide, which should have ended with the cold war, and in itself is an indictment on both sides.

Whatever one's feelings about these particular messengers, freedom of speech is the point from which all genuine progress starts.

Snowden should realize that critiques of the Kremlin and Putin will be silenced.

Well a pop group put in prison by Russia's defacto dictator simply because they were critical of him, does tend to pique people's interest..blame Putin.

What about another article on Wei- perhaps focusing on his brave battles against the vicious and totalitarian Lego Group? Or maybe something about the tremendous popular interest in his ground-breaking and beautiful art?

Nice to have different perspectives, eh? I understand Pussy Riot and Wei, because both have been victimised by oppressive governments and their dictatorial and paranoid policies. However, Snowden is just a gutless and hypocritical runaway cowering under Putin's skirt.

Only the paranoid ex-KGB agents ruling Russia think all NGOs are controlled by the CIA.

I'm sure Edward Snowden was flattered to share a platform with Pussy Riot. When my great grandchildren are taught history at future school they'll open the history file on their school holo-kindles and read about the great Pussy Riot and how they shaped the world around them through forgettable music and neon balaclavas. Edward Snowden will get his own chapter of course, but reading it will be homework so only the swots will bother.

All what is aimed at saving the right to freedom of expression has my support. What makes it difficult to blindly adhere though, is that some of the NGOs mentioned here, and probably others, are sometimes backed and financed by other forces which has very different end goals and do lack transparence. The proliferation of the so called NGOs make things more complex.

I understand Snowden and Wei, but Pussy Riot? What do they contribute? To denigrate other peoples believe.They are only looking for their own career in the WEST. You could even hail the Femen. How silly is that? Were are our values?Is one to insult other people. I looks like that.
