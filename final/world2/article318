Russian hostility 'partly caused by west', claims former US defence head




DateTime::::2016-03-09T18:37:14+0000



<p>The current level of hostility in US-Russian relations was caused in part by Washington’s contemptuous treatment of Moscow’s security concerns in the aftermath of the cold war, a former US defence secretary has said.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/22/any-analysis-of-russia-has-to-consider-effect-of-nato-expansion">Any analysis of Russia has to consider the effect of Nato expansion | Letters from James Rodgers and Kate Hudson</a> </p>

<p>William Perry, who was defence secretary in Bill Clinton’s administration from 1994 to 1997, emphasised that in the past five years it has been Vladimir Putin’s military interventions in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere that have driven the downward spiral in east-west relations. </p>

<p>But Perry added that during his term in office, cooperation between the two countries’ militaries had improved rapidly just a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union and that these gains were initially squandered more as a result of US than Russian actions.</p>

<p>“In the last few years, most of the blame can be pointed at the actions that Putin has taken. But in the early years I have to say that the United States deserves much of the blame,” Perry said, speaking at a Guardian Live event in London.</p>

<p>“Our first action that really set us off in a bad direction was when Nato started to expand, bringing in eastern European nations, some of them bordering Russia. At that time we were working closely with <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> and they were beginning to get used to the idea that Nato could be a friend rather than an enemy ... but they were very uncomfortable about having Nato right up on their border and they made a strong appeal for us not to go ahead with that.”</p>

<p>In his memoir, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=25448">My Journey at the Nuclear Brink</a>, Perry writes that he argued for a slower expansion of Nato so as not to alienate Russia during the initial period of post-Soviet courtship and cooperation. Richard Holbrooke, the US diplomat, led the opposing argument at the time, and was ultimately supported by the vice-president, Al Gore, who argued “we could manage the problems this would create with Russia”.</p>

<p>Perry said the decision reflected a contemptuous attitude among US officials towards the troubled former superpower.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t that we listened to their argument and said he don’t agree with that argument,” he said. “Basically the people I was arguing with when I tried to put the Russian point ... the response that I got was really: ‘Who cares what they think? They’re a third-rate power.’ And of course that point of view got across to the Russians as well. That was when we started sliding down that path.”</p>

<p>Perry considered resigning over the issue “but I concluded that my resignation would be misinterpreted as opposition to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato">Nato</a> membership that I greatly favoured – just not right away”.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>He sees the second major misstep by Washington DC as the Bush administration’s decision to deploy a ballistic missile defence system in eastern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> in the face of determined opposition from Moscow. Perry said: “We rationalised [the system] as being to defend against an Iranian nuclear missile – they don’t have any but that’s another issue. But the Russians said ‘Wait a bit, this weakens our deterrence.’ The issue again wasn’t discussed on the basis of its merits – it was just ‘who cares about what Russia thinks.’ We dismissed it again.”</p>

<p>The Obama administration has since modified the missile defence system in eastern Europe, replacing long-range with medium-range interceptor missiles but that has not mollified Russian objections. </p>

<p>Perry said he was opposed to such systems on technical grounds. “I think they’re a waste of money. I don’t think they work,” he said. “In fact, when I talked to the Russians I tried to convince them not to worry, they don’t work anyway but they didn’t buy that.”</p>

<p>The third factor that Perry pointed to in the poisoning of US-Russian relations was Washington DC’s support for pro-democracy demonstrators in the “colour revolutions” in former Soviet republics including Georgia and Ukraine. Perry agreed with the ethical reasons for backing such revolutions but noted their severely damaging effect on east-west ties.</p>

<p>“After he came to office, Putin came to believe that the United States had an active and robust programme to overthrow his regime,” the former defence secretary said.</p>

<p>“And from that point on a switch went on in Putin’s mind that said: I’m no longer going to work with the west ... I don’t know the facts behind Putin’s belief that we actually had a programme to foment revolution in Russia but what counts is he believed it.”</p>

<p>Perry described the current tensions between Russia and Nato as having “the potential of becoming very dangerous,” and argued for a radical reduction in nuclear arsenals and in particular the removal of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Over 1,000 ICBMs in the US and Russia remain on hair-trigger alert, on a policy of “launch-on-warning”, meaning US and Russian presidents would have less than half an hour to decide whether to fire them in the event of radar and satellite data showing an incoming missile attack from the other side.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

Thank you for the reply. Indeed, the russian people and the government are two things and it's true that the information given is a nightmare. it is biased, no doubt about it. Not outright lies but clearly formated. I do watch some debate on RT, not to feed my own narrative but to criticize and yes, sometimes it's awful. I had hopes that they wouldn't dare be as low as FOX but they are. RT is not critical about Russia and it's a shame for them. I don't know what they are thinking. What's to fear of a fair critic? The opportunity to do better? Well, it appears that it is very difficult for everyone to do just that.

I absolutely agree with your point on the wests bumbling behaviour, the crimes it too has committed ( especially in Iraq ). Even in operations that I supported, such as stopping Gaddafi, the Taliban ( U.N backed ) because of our total failings at supporting these Nations restoration and preventing them from collapsing. Knee jerk reactions with no long term strategy..

I read your point and I'm fine with it. The only problem I see (and it's a major one) is that the intentions of the West are not always "pure" and it may use some unfair strategies, covertly. I think that what I'm saying is not far fetched or irrationnal. We give Russia every reason to discredit us everytime we hijacked the legitimate organisations fighting for the good. Indeed, Russia is using that argument against us and the organisations too often (that is the game they play) but we shot ourselves in the foot by not being that honest and clear, it's a stain on us and it killed our credibility. It is a moral fight and we must lead, not use ruse. We play their game now everytime we try to manipulate for our own good the events and we must be smarter than that, even if that means that we need to recognize our own mistakes. I agree that now they are going too far but we pay the price of not being transparent. Russia is not the leader, they follow and act after us (in some level of course) so we can influence it all. Someone need to make the first move and try for good to come to the table clean. I'd like everyone to tone down the rethoric and being a bit more positive, work on the strenghts and positive points instead on pushing hard on what is not ok. People react badly when blamed, even rightly. And it's tough if the other one doesn't want to listen too. A difficult situation.

To have the open, honest relationship with Russia, you need to feel Russia is more than a one man or party system of corruption. Which it is. Immune from prosecution... To give credence to absolute truth of the utter failings the west has had in it's own stupid relationship with the middle east, to gain support from the west ( like Vladimir Putin did once with his getting Assad to give up on Chemical weapons ( although ( to me ) it was a blatant political move and had nothing to do with Assad ( most likely ) using them. The latter (if Assad did use them or not ) depending on if you believe that there is actually independent media in the west. That actually does do real investigative journalism, that international N.G.O's such as amnesty international really do report the crimes that every nation or government on has committed, which I do..

Well I disagree on many things you said but it's okay. I pretend that my vision of things is a bit more complex than that and I'm not intellectually satisfied with what I've read. You try to avoid anything that may give the Russians any credit, at all, always. You walk a fine line. You start with clear rationalization to end up in a somewhat gross overlooking statement. I personnally don't need that and I'm not impressed. I fail to see the point, I'm not a naive Putinbot nor an american empire basher, I won't be moved at all by any bullying or intellectual shortcuts. It is foolish to put one's head in the sand about the Russians bad behavior they can show but it's another thing to refuse to acknowledge their fair judgement about some situations in the world and their right to fight for their own. Change in Russia will come when we have kind relationships, show them openness and cooperation. And yes, show some backbone sometimes too. To spit on them is a poor way to build a relationship.

Good article. The longer this goes on the better Russia looks. No wonder the West is cozying up to it now. The US is secretly very thankful the Russians stepped in in Syria and that Assad still has a big enough army to clean up the IS mess and the "freedom and democracy" islamist rebel nutters in the country.

Join, I can respect those who believe that US officials often demonize adversaries that represent opposition to their best interest at the expense of the greater good. That is American political alternative to the totalitarian militaristic approach by some regimesThat said, not every boogeyman lies in the imagination of a clear and present danger, they are a clear and present danger.Now some would agree that Americans are far to trusting in their Government, however, trust is the foundation of a representative form of government. We elect a person to represent us.Unfortunately, the status quo dictates the premise that if you want something done right, do it yourself. The system of self governance is impractical and it is what it is. So we rely on the system we got.However, boogeymen potentially bringing nuclear weapons to the steps of the US, is a real concern, of intent or not, no matter how innocuous the Rusian-Latin American relationship is, it's not welcome on America's doorstep. Only the US can determine that since it poses a threat to them alone.

Ask Azov. Russia only supplies weapons and training for locals, which is what Nato has done on the other side. Unfortunately, Nato chose to support openly nazi gangs. And that is not propaganda, that's real. Sure you can find nazies anywhere in the world. But do you conscientiously train them to fight Eastern Ukrainians? These same Eastern Ukrainians are hating Putin for not entering and turning it to another Crimea. Accept that reality, man. 9000 Ukrainians is not the problem of Kremlin. It's Kiev's problem, because they are responsible for the security of these people. If Kiev blames Kremlin, but cannot do anything about it, not even with US/Nato's help, that's is still their problem.

Of course America has an active program to overthrow Putin and the existing Russian state. That is a given, and Putin long ago recognised it.The real issue that Washington never considers is this; in terms of Russian politics Putin is "middle of the road" even a "moderate" in some quarters. If Putin is forced out then there are potentially far more dangerous politicians able to fill the gap with no guarantee that a western puppet will win out. Look at Iraq, Libya, and Syria - then think about that sort of mess on a Russia wide scale with nuclear weapons thrown in - still want to overthrow Putin?

Joinup, stick to the subject. Highjacking is a crime. Russian/Latin American alliances are a threat to Western Democracies. Russian influence isn't what it once was, but giving them due diligence is prudent.At the time of the Reagan Address, the cold war was at its height and though Russia has Nukes on Europe's borders, Americans be damn if they put them on ours.

Vitor, NATO is a coalition. "An attack against one is an attack on all". The charter binds all NATO members to commit to the defense of any member who is attacked.So, would the US come to defend Latvia? Of course. Would Latvia come to the defense of the US?The US commitment depends on the charter commitment. You pose your statement on the burden of the US commitment to NATO. Why? What about the rest of NATO?In WWII, Europe gave Hitler a free pass in Austria and Czechoslovakia. It was only when Hitler invaded Poland did the UK and France declared war on Germany.Why wait until Poland? By then it was to late for Eurotwats to stop him. That's the point of NATO. So Eurotwats stand as one. So the question really is, will all other NATO Eurotwats come to the aid of Latvia, or simply hide under America's wing shitting their pacifistic diapers?

Interesting to hear the view of Andrey Zubov (Russian, historian and political scientist, sacked) that such a referendum is inevitable, but should include settlers since 1945. 'Without giving Crimea back and agreeing to a referendum with an unpredictable result, Russia has no future in Europe. It will never accept Russia in its current state as the aggressor.'
