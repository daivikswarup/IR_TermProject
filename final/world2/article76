Colombian activist murders create unease amid Farc peace talks




DateTime::::2016-03-09T22:04:17+0000



<p>As Colombia moves closer to ending half a century of war with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/farc">Farc</a> rebels, a string of murders across the country has offered a grim reminder of the persistent dangers faced by leftwing activists.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>William Castillo, a member of the leftwing grassroots movement Marcha Patriótica, was gunned down Monday in the north-eastern town of Bagre in Antioquia, the latest in a spate of killings that has left three other community leaders dead in the past 10 days in different parts of the country.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>A day earlier, Klaus Zapata, a member of the Communist Youth group, was killed while playing football in the Bogotá suburb of Soacha.</p>

<p>Marisela Tombe, a peasant leader in Cuaca province, was gunned down 28 February, while Willar Alexander Oime, the governor of an indigenous reserve also in Cauca, was killed in the city of Popayan last week.</p>

<p>Reacting to the killings, the rebels’ senior commander Rodrigo Londoño, better known as Timochenko, said on Twitter: “This is the wrong path if we want reconcilliation with a view toward peace.” </p>

<p>The Organization of American States’ mission to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia">Colombia</a> also condemned the killings, saying that they showed “the fragility and the defenceless state of many social leaders in the country”.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>The killings “are an attack not only on the lives of the leaders but on the movements, causes and the … rights of people who organise to make legitimate demands”, the OAS mission said in a statement.<br/></p>

<p>Negotiators from the Colombian government and Farc (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) are currently <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/farc-peace-talks-colombia-nears-historic-deal-after-agreement-on-justice-and-reparations">hammering out the final details of a peace accord</a> to end more than 50 years of conflict.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, President Juan Manuel Santos gave the first public indication that two sides may not reach an agreement before the self-imposed deadline of 23 March, which the two sides agreed last year. “I will not sign a bad deal to meet a deadline,” Santos said, adding that if necessary a new deadline would be set.</p>

<p>The two sides have reached agreement on several key issues, but have yet to agree on a method for disarming the guerrillas. </p>

<p>One of the Farc’s most pressing concerns is their security once they lay down their arms and transition to a political movement.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>As part of an attempted peace process in the 1980s, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/farc">Farc</a> created a small leftwing party called the Patriotic Union (UP). More than 3,000 members of the party, including two presidential candidates, were murdered during the 1980s and 1990s by rightwing paramilitaries linked to the armed forces, as peace talks fell apart. Many of those who were not killed went into hiding, exile or changed political affiliation.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>There is no indication that the recent murders were related, but community organizations around the country have reported an uptick in death threats and violence against their members and leaders.<br/></p>

<p>Somos Defensores, an organization that tracks threats to rights defenders, said that groups known as <em>bacrim</em>, or criminal bands – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/12/colombia-violence-torture-gangs-buenaventura">which are mostly dedicated to drug trafficking but also aim for social control in many regions of the country</a> – “are and will continue to be the main aggressor against human rights defenders in the transition and post-conflict stages”.<br/></p>

<p>The main groups are known as the Urabeños and Gaitanista Self-Defence Forces of Colombia, successors to the rightwing United Self Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a paramilitary umbrella group which disbanded between 2003 and 2006. Many of the demobilised militias recycled themselves into the groups which the government calls <em tabindex="-1">bacrim</em>. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Somos Defensores reported that in 2015, 63 activists were killed, up from 55 the year before. Of those killed, 33% had reported being threatened, the group said in a report released last week.<br/></p>

<p>For the fifth year running, indigenous rights activists made up the largest group of murder victims with 12.<br/></p>

<p>The rise contrasts sharply with overall homicide rates in Colombia which have dropped dramatically since the Farc declared a unilateral ceasefire last year, leading to what the Conflict Analysis Resource Centre thinktank has called the most peaceful period in Colombia in decades.<br/></p>

When the far left is dead they will move on to the Liberals. As they have tried to do in the past.

Off by a factor of ten on your underestimation of the numbers of members and overestimation by a factor of 100 on their budget. But that's ok. You aren't expected to say something "intended to be factual."

If Santos is serious about a peace agreement, then he better get on the stick and bring those responsible for these assassinations to account. There is no doubt that the government knows who they are because the paramilitary groups were/are in league with the government of Uribe if not Santos as well. The ones known as Los Agilas Negras were commissioned by the government to assassinate leftist students and politicians during Uribe's term. It is very doubtful that Santos doesn't still have connections with them.

This must be about the fiftieth time it's been reported they are having peace talk again.

Complete drivel from some Furibista... Someone who never bothered to listen to Carlos Castaño's confessions, and knows nothing about the so-called bacrim. The ignorance and hatred apparent in this post shows the problems inherent in any talk of peace...

"Even though the traffickers are the paramilitaries, working for the government..."

You obviously didn't even read the article "Canadian colonial" before spewing Washington's propaganda.

The FARC number about 6-8 thousand. With a billion dollar annual budget I guess the guerrillas can all retire comfortably. Unless some comrades are more equal than the others.

All propped up with American money which is officially for fighting drug trafficking. Even though the traffickers are the paramilitaries, working for the government.

Farc need to retain their weapons. When, and only when, it has been proven that concentrating solely on politics is safe, then they can consider disarming. Until then they should hold onto everything they have.

It's the same in Colombia as everywhere, the crimes of left-wing are considered more serious than the crimes of right-wing, without exception. Colombia is extremely right-wing country where the right-wing president has to defend himself against the accusations from uribistas (the supporters of the former president) who keep screaming that "Santos is a communist because he lets the FARC give orders from Havana while they are resting in five star hotels and at the beaches of Havana". Álvaro Uribe (the most popular president of Colombia), his inner circle and his supporters are real threat for the peace process. Those criminals do everything to water down the process, they have contacts with the murderous death squads and they keep complaining about "persecution" and "witch-hunt" when their friends or family members are arrested and use even that as an excuse to protest against Santos. As long as uribistas have that much power the country won't develop.

One single death is one too many. Colombians let the 23 M be a reality and not a panacea!
