Somali cattle herder describes US airstrike on al-Shabaab training camp




DateTime::::2016-03-08T22:51:53+0000



<p>A local cattle herder has given the first eyewitness account of the US airstrike on an Islamist militant training camp in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/somalia">Somalia</a> that killed scores of fighters.</p>

<p>Pentagon officials claimed that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/07/us-airstrike-al-shabaab-camp-somalia-drone">more than 150 members of the al-Shabaab militant group were killed</a> in the surprise raid by planes and unmanned MQ-9 Reaper drones near Raso over the weekend. The al-Qaida linked group confirmed the airstrike but rejected the death toll as exaggerated.</p>

<p>Bashir Dhure, a herder living nearby, said the camp had been set up in a new and secret location in an attempt to avoid Somali and western intelligence, but was targeted on Saturday night. </p>

<p>“There were big explosions,” he told the Guardian. “All nearby places were caught on fire and no one knew what was happening. In the morning I could see the smoke coming from the bombarded training facility.</p>

<p>“It was like a burnt house. Everything turned burnt. I saw three vehicles burnt down. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/02/al-shabaab-from-al-qaida-rejects-to-a-fighting-force-of-thousands">Al-Shabaab</a> fighters were collecting dead bodies. They were put on trucks and took out of the village. We do not know where they were buried,” he said in a telephone interview.</p>

<p>Following the airstrike, angry al-Shabaab fighters started searching for what they termed spies collaborating with Americans, Dhure continued. They detained about a dozen people, mostly young camel herders living in two nearby villages, Eel Dibi and Raso, about 125 miles north of the capital, Mogadishu.</p>

<p>“I was lucky as I fled from the area before they started the search operation, because I knew that there would be a harsh backlash by al-Shabaab after they were bombed by the Americans.”</p>

<p>The Raso training facility hosted about 200 to 300 newly recruited fighters, he added. “At least half of these fighters were killed.”</p>

<p>Abdiasis Mohamed Durow, district commissioner in Buloburte, put the death toll even higher. “I have confirmed that this was a heavy and deadly bombardment,” he said. “This time al-Shabaab lost about 200 fighters, among them five top commanders who were at the training camp to witness the closing of the training of the newly recruited militants.”</p>

<p>He named two of the commanders as Yusuf Ali Ugaas, an influential preacher, recruiter and regional head, and Mohamed Mire, a leading member of the group’s finance wing. “We have confirmed that these two figures, Yusuf Ali Ugaas and Mohamed Mire, went to attend the closing of the training and they were killed,” Durow said.</p>

<p>Durow said the Somali government welcomed the killing of the militants because “they were planning to attack key installations in Somalia. They were planning to wage deadly attacks on Mogadishu and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/al-shabaab-somalia-african-union">Kismayo</a> where the US government has set up a drone base.”</p>

<p>The US continues to pour military power, money and training into the Horn of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a> nation, seen as a crucial front in the war on terror. Ali Abdurahman, a senior Somali intelligence officer in Hiiraan region, said: “On our side we have helped the US in gathering the information before the airstrike. This is very important in such operation because we knew that the militants were in their latest stage of attacking key places in Somalia.”</p>

<p>But al-Shabaab disputed the death toll. Abdiaziz abu Mus’ab, a military spokesman for the group, said: “There was an airstrike by the Americans against the mujahideen in Somalia. We strongly reject the number of deaths claimed by the Americans. They usually exaggerate when they do something against us.</p>

<p>“There are a few of our fighters who were martyred but never the number they claimed.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> officials say they had been monitoring the camp for several weeks before the strike and had gathered intelligence, including about an imminent threat to US forces and African Union peacekeepers.</p>

<p>The commander ultimately responsible for the airstrike, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.africom.mil/about-the-command/leadership/commander">General David Rodriguez</a> of the US Africa Command, indicated to a Senate panel in Washington on Tuesday that the Raso training camp was one of several that al-Shabaab maintains in Somalia.</p>

<p>“The camps are transitory, so they pop up and they move,” Rodriguez told the Senate armed services committee.</p>

<p>The Pentagon on Tuesday continued to say little about the strike but nevertheless expressed confidence that it killed “more than 150 terrorist fighters” and no others, according to spokeswoman Michelle Baldanza. </p>

<p>Yet Baldanza said US defence officials “continue to assess the results of the operation”, making early conclusions preliminary. Baldanza said there was no certain date as yet for the completion of any post-strike assessment but thus far “we have no reports of civilian casualties from these strikes”. </p>

<p>She continued: “We have significant mitigation measures in place within the targeting process and during the conduct of operations to reduce the potential risks of collateral damage and civilian casualties.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/al-shabaab">Al-Shabaab</a>, which seeks to impose its strict version of Islamic law, controlled Mogadishu until 2011, when African Union forces drove it out. But in the past two weeks al-Shabaab fighters have launched mortar attacks near the presidential palace, blown up a car bomb near a busy park in the capital, and set off twin blasts in a north-western town. Dozens of people have been killed.</p>

<p>Analysts warned that al-Shabaab has proved resilient in the past and, despite the unusually high death toll at the Raso camp, is likely to recover. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/j-peter-pham">J Peter Pham</a>, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center in Washington, told the Associated Press: “That al-Shabaab had that many recruits in training at just one location … is a worrying indicator of the group’s continued relevance and its power to attract.</p>

<p>“The fact that al-Shabaab feels emboldened enough to gather so many together in one place, these are hardly signs of a group on the run.”</p>

<p>Robert Besseling, an analyst with EXX Africa, added: “While the killing of some 150 al-Shabaab fighters, if confirmed, will be a blow to the group, it is unlikely to have fatally struck its fighting capability within Somalia.</p>

<p>“Further US airstrikes alone are also unlikely to thwart al-Shabaab’s offensive around Mogadishu and other areas where the group has expanded its operations such as northwards into Galmudug and Puntland.”<br/></p>

You do appear to love constructing straw men and then demolishing them. It may make you feel good, but as nobody but you have constructed these straw men I feel no need to respond as they were not my arguments. It is interesting to note that the religion that you so clearly believe to be evil was n fact running a civilisation that left Dark Ages Christian Europe looking exactly what it was: an uncivilised rabble. You continue to attribute to Islam per se attributes that it simply does not possess, largely it would seem as a way of distinguishing it from the purity of motives of the West, despite the West's factually far more bloody record over the last century or two.

No one is attempting to justify murder. It is an attempt to get to the bottom of your twisted understanding of democracy. Where you claim that it is people's free choice yet in reality they choose nothing and are not responsible for anything.Using imotive buzz words straight from a Fox New script doesn't work, I am not America, hence I don't have the ability to swallow b.s.You have yet to cite a single source for your alleged extensive knowledge on the subject of "Islamisim", whatever that means.There was an Islamic state a hundred years ago which had been in existence for 13 hundred years. So there are plenty of sources you can look at, if you real want to educate yourself. However I am sure you would rather hold on to your hatered, contempt and sense of supirioroty. After all without that what do you believe in. Nothing, which is rather sad.You don't love democracy. What you love is conformity and capitulation. Anyone who is not like you must be evil and you will tolerate only those who capitulate to your demands.You talk of Islamists yet you know nothing about the subject apart from what the gutter press tells you.You say you are a socialist yet you support a Machiavellian Zionist like Blair.You claim to love freedom yet you do not tolerate any alternative view.Take a good look at yourself maybe a review is in order.

We do have the end to any alternative opinions. Anyone with an alternative opinion is branded a terrorist or a sympathizer. Form what I am reading in your comments you are definitely not a socialist. As for this mythical world domination ideology that you believe Islam to be, well I suggest you read a book about the governing system of Islam or economy in Islam rather getting your education from Fox New.It is impossible to discuss anything with the brainwashed ignorant so as you support America and think they have a right to take whatever they want I will have to say you are right. After all might is always right with neocons like you.

David Bickenson is 100% correct. Religion divides - Protestants,Catholics, Sunni, Shia just a couple of recent examples from history - which is littered with religious groups killing one another in the most unpleasent manner imaginable.You do not need a God or God to tell you right from wrong - ipso facto above.

So the American military left Iraq means they are completely hands off yes. that is laughable.When 800 ISIS took Mosul and the American appointed prime minster order 30 thousand strong army to leave three billion dollar arsenal and run. That was just coincidence yes.When the Mahdi Army stopped fighting as there leaders just happened to get seats in parliament that was just a coincidence yes.As for the FOX NEW rhetoric you spout out about people shouting Allahu Akber well when adulterates fornicate and shout OH GOD does that mean they believe in the ten commandments. Be real people invoke God in different times such as fear, ecstasy, or just to justify their deeds it has nothing to do with religion.

You make an very good and interesting point about agency, albeit exposing a tone of superiority and bigotry.of course people in the third world have agency in fact if you look at the way people are governed you will find that the white man on the street has no agency or at least his agency is held in contempt by his rulers.The difference between the west and the rest of the world is that the west is militarily superior and has used that superiority to advance its interests.Internally the rulers hold the people's agency in such contempt that they allow them to whine, march and shout knowing fully that they will change nothing.As opposed to the Middle East where the western appointed and backed despots know that if the people voice their political opinion it will not just go away, so they oppress opinions with violence as opinions there do mean action.A million people marched against the war in Iraq they were ignored, people riot almost every time the G8 meet yet no change.But when a million Tunisians march the government falls. That is the difference. Hence weapons are sold to Saudi Arabia purely for the purpose of pointing those weapons at the people.Al Saud stay in power, most Saudi intellects are in jail being tortured with British made cattle prods and a barrel of oil is $30 what is not to like. Then to add insult to injury a liter of petrol is £1 and no one even blinks an eye.  So much for " only white men have agency" correction only 1% of white men have agency. The rest are sheep. Of course what I say will go over your head, because in your mind I am a Muslim therefore I must be sub human. I am a Muslim and I am disillusioned with all establishment and organized Islam I am tired of my religion being hi jacked to serve political purposes and I am even more tired of people who get their education from FOX NEWS. This world has been turned to shit because of greed and the worst thing about it people are dying just to inflate bank accounts, no one is really enjoying the spoils. At least old colonialism built nations now it is just a digit on a computer screen. Millions of people die and no one prospers.

If you are going to deny well documented and published statements then discussion is futile. If you want to find out about Bush's consultation with God do some research. You will find that he did say God told him to invade Iraq. In fact if you check out American media chatter at the time it was publisised to the American people As 'Doing God's work'.As for the classical Zionist tactic of blaming the victim, well that is old.No Muslims killed Muslims in Iraq. A proxy war was conducted for the spoils of war. It had nothing to do with religion.

Pointing out facts does not equate to sympathizing.Yes the media machine of the majority of the countries that have a Muslim majority population and western appointed governments do declare these groups vile.As for this army of conquest that you speak of. Just think about what you are writing.Conquest of what?Do these people operate outside there own countries or countries that they believe effect them?America has 600 military based outside of America, that is conquest by any definition of the word.Facts are facts no matter how you want to twist them.When you destabilise a country, prevent the people from making political choices and impose governments from outside.This will lead to widespread criminality, forced recruitment and all kinds of violence.Are you really going to say that a child who is recruited at gun point is vile and responsible for his actions?Or a youth who sees no other way of survival than to take the Al Shabab wages after even the fish in the sea is contaminated by western companies dumping toxic waste off the horn of Africa is evil.Yes there are some twisted people who use a perverted interpretation of religion as a recruitment tool, there are some idiots and criminals who follow them. But the vast majority have motives that are far removed from ideology.It is far more complicated than your cosy idea of good and evil.
