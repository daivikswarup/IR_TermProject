More nuclear tests, urges North Korean leader Kim Jong-un




DateTime::::2016-03-11T00:59:08+0000



<p>Kim Jong-un ordered <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea">North Korea</a> to conduct more nuclear tests as he watched a ballistic missile launch, according to the regime’s press agency.</p>

<p>The report is thought to refer to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/north-korea-fires-two-short-range-ballistic-missiles-into-sea">launch of two short-range missiles</a> by North Korea on Thursday that flew 300 miles (500km) and then splashed into the sea.</p>

<p>“Dear comrade Kim Jong Un said work ... must be strengthened to improve nuclear attack capability and issued combat tasks to continue nuclear explosion tests to assess the power of newly developed nuclear warheads and tests to improve nuclear attack capability,” the Korean Central News Agency said.</p>

<p>Tensions rose sharply on the Korean peninsula after the North in January conducted its fourth nuclear test and fired a long-range rocket in February, leading to the UN security council adopting a new sanctions resolution.<br/></p>

<p> Conducting more nuclear tests would be in clear violation of UN sanctions which also ban ballistic missile tests, although Pyongyang has rejected them. North Korea has a large stockpile of short-range missiles and is developing long-range and intercontinental missiles.</p>

<p> The North Korean leader was quoted in state media on Wednesday as saying that his country had <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/kim-jong-un-claims-north-korea-has-miniaturised-nuclear-warhead">miniaturised nuclear warheads</a> to mount on ballistic missiles. South Korea said it did not believe North Korea had successfully miniaturised a nuclear warhead or deployed a functioning intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>

<p> Pyongyang has conducted four nuclear tests in the past decade and claimed to have successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in January but most experts expressed doubt, saying the blast was too small.</p>

<p> North Korea has issued nearly daily reports this week of Kim’s instructions to fight South Korea and the United States as those two allies began large-scale military drills.</p>

<p> North Korea called the annual drills “nuclear war moves” and threatened to respond with an all-out offensive. Kim ordered his country to be ready to use nuclear weapons in the face of what he described as growing threats from enemies.</p>

Yeah, even though I'm not a huge fan of US foreign policy, if it wasn't for the Yanks, South Koreans would be worshipping their dear leader while wearing Stalinist gray clothing, funny haircuts, and likely starving instead of playing Starcraft and enjoying one of the most dynamic economies in the world.

Eternal damnations to the traitors of Choson, the puppet fascist clique currently posing as the so called government of southern Korea, the puppet forces are actually taking part in military exercises simulating an invasion of the people's republic. These traitors are allying with the evil imperialists in opposing their own homeland. Never in the whole 5000 year history of Korea has such traitors existed and they will surely be wiped out from history in due course. Let's never forget that the fascist clique traces their lineage to the Korean collaborators who colluded with the Japanese imperialists in oppressing Korea. No wonder that these fascists became such willing slaves to the US when their formers masters were defeated. These dogs must always be followers of the imperialists.

The imperialists really thought that sanctions would make the DPRK change their policies? Haha how is it going imperialists? Puny sanctions only make the resolve of the DPRK greater and greater. The iron fortress of Juche and the red flag of Songun will forever fly over the glorious nation of Choson with an history of 5000 years!!! All hail the revolutionary path of Juche and all hail the lineage of Baekdu! Death to imperialism! Freedom to all oppressed nations! May all the nations rise against the oppression of imperialism not just in Asia but in Africa and Latin America as well!

Brave as a lion, poor but brave. Imagine the European countries, unable to even have the stomach to ask the US not to spy on them anymore and unable to grant the likes of Snowden asylum due to the fear of the US. But here we have a small, poor country in Asia with the stomach for the fight and prepared to go against the might of the US in every way they can. The DPRK has proved that the US really is a paper tiger. As soon as a small country gains deterrence the US is unable to do anything except sanction them which does nothing to stop the DPRK from gaining deterrence anyway. The US empire is a paper tiger and every country which wants to achieve full independence just have to gain deterrence. The paper tiger will only attack the likes of Libya which did not have the deterrence to stop the paper tiger from attacking.

Not surprising given the West spends billions on the upgrading of its own nuclear capabilities annually, yet the articles (propaganda) constantly only refer to Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions. Herein lies our greatest problem not only in our response to North Korea but also in dealing with groups like IS. You can't practise hypocrisy continually in the hope that your opponents will buy into the legal fictions. All that does is perpetuate the problems. The West wants its nuclear superiority and is unwilling to allow others to join the Club. The West wants to use state sponsored terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Syria but at the same time condemns groups like IS for practising brutality. You can't have it both ways. It might win over the ignoramuses at home but you can't blame or stop other nations from seeking a level playing field. Adam Bonner

Maybe if North Korea didn't continually threaten its neighbour ( bomb, assassinate, shell, torpedo, and kidnap South Koreans ) then the Americans and the South Koreans wouldn't feel the need to prepare for another invasion by the North ?
