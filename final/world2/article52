<p>Kosovo’s government is buying a body scanner to try to stop opposition legislators smuggling teargas canisters into parliament and releasing them as they have done in every session for the past six months.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/jan/15/war-crimes-court-hague-kosovo-liberation-army">New EU-backed court to try Kosovo war crimes, Dutch government says</a> </p>

<p> In their latest protest against a 2015 EU-brokered deal with Serbia, opposition members of parliament on Thursday released two canisters, threw a glass of water at the prime minister, Isa Mustafa, and aimed red lasers at the interior minister’s face.</p>

<p> With security measures so far having failed to stop the protests, the government plans to buy a new body scanner, of the type used at international airports to detect explosives.</p>

<p> Opposition members said it was “top secret” how they smuggled the canisters into parliament.</p>

<p> However, one police officer checking deputies at the building, speaking on condition of anonymity, said be believed they hid the canisters on their body, under their clothes.</p>

<p> He said the existing scanners did not necessarily detect the canisters – some of which easily fit in a pocket – because they were covered in plastic and rubber.</p>

<p> Police only say publicly they are investigating how the canisters are being taken into parliament.</p>

<p> The government said the new scanner would cost around €270,000 (£212,000/US$300,000). Parliament has already had new ventilators installed on the roof to clear the gas.</p>

<p> The opposition has been protesting for months against the EU-brokered deal to give <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/11/kosovo-deal-to-empower-serbs-is-put-on-hold-by-constitutional-court">more power to a Serb minority</a>.</p>

<p> The agreement, which has yet to take effect following a critical judicial review by Kosovo’s highest court, has set off the worst political crisis in the country, whose population is 90% ethnic Albanian, since independence in 2008.</p>

<p> The opposition, which has been demanding the resignation of the government over the agreement, is call its supporters to protest on 26 March.</p>

Kosovo is a gangster state - what else do you expect?

Don't you worry that scanner is bought by your taxpayer money, the US is giving some $30 million and the EU $70 million every year for that show.

After the disasters of Afghanistan, Iraq and then Libya, liberal interventionists were left clutching at ever more brittle straws in order to justify their military adventurism. Of these, the relative "success" of the Kosovo intervention was always held up as some kind of counter example. However now we are seeing that even that turned out to have been a mistake, with Kosovo in effect being a failed state (albeit an EU accession candidate - go figure).

Excellent analysis, you forgot only one thing: multi-billion Trepca mine with vast deposits of rare metals crucial for mobile phone industry. It belongs to Serbian companies yet Kosovo >government< tried to sell it and guess who were the two first names on the list of the potential buyers? Secretary of State Madeleine Allbright, the chief architect of aggression against Serbia, and general Wesley Clarke, head of the bombing campaign which killed 1000 people in Serbia and filled that country with depleted uranium which already increased cancer rate in Serbia 30%.

Kosovo is a tiny landlocked country with about 1.5 million inhabitants, mostly Albanian, but also around 100,000 remaining Serbs. In 1999 Nato went on a vicious bombing campaign of Serbia, killing 1,000 civilians, to force Kosovo separation and independence. At that time Western media lied overtime claiming that Kosovo had 2 million Albanians, that Serbs were oppressing them, the usual Nato-US demonization campaign. Nobody ever corrected the lies.

Sound like really great people. Germany is so lucky that many have chosen to live there.

And it took them only a dozen of such incident to decide on a scanner. They can take another measure and distribute gas masks to all the MPs to be carried during the Parliament meetings. From the video, some of them already bring the masks to work.

See what MPs do in the Ukrainian Rada, and Kosovo won’t surprise you any more. US/NATO/EU suffered yet another glorious success.

Scanners are useless in a state that just elected “president” a person with a nickname “Snake”. FYI, Kosovo is an often forgotten “success story” that is not listed along with Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc: about a third of the population has already run away from this NATO-created “heaven”. Congratulations are in order, methinks.

And Serbia still wanted that? Kosovo becoming an indepedent nation was probably the best thing has ever happened to them. Wanting Kosovo is like wanting to stay with an inflamed appendix...never a good idea!

PMQ's with gas masks would be a significant improvement.

I must admit that simply going by the photo, they seem like a gang of school kids unhappy with teacher.

Maybe giving this band of mafia thugs and jacked up car theives their own country to run wasn't such a swell idea after all.

Adult human beings, letting off tear gas in parliament, throwing water at the PM and pointing red lasers..........
