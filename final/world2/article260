Four former apartheid-era guards on trial over 1983 student murder

<p>Four former members of apartheid-era security forces are due to appear in court in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica">South Africa</a> charged with the 1983 murder of a young woman who was a courier for the then-banned African National Congress (ANC).</p>

<p>The trial has come following years of pressure from relatives of Nokuthula Simelane, a 23-year-old university student who disappeared after being abducted and tortured by specialist police under the apartheid regime. Her body has never been found.</p>

<p>The prosecution is the first of its kind for nearly a decade and comes against a background of heightened racial tensions in the country, and unease among many younger South Africans about how older generations have dealt with the traumatic history.</p>

<p>Ongoing poverty and inequality have sparked angry student protests over the past year, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/south-african-north-west-university-set-ablaze-in-student-protest">one university campus shut indefinitely after being torched</a> by demonstrators.</p>

<p>Lawyers say authorities in South <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a> were reluctant to bring the prosecution against those accused of murdering Simelane out of fear that members of the ANC, the main anti-apartheid movement that became South Africa’s ruling party, might also find themselves in the dock.</p>

<p>“Thirty-three years have already passed so it’s in everyone’s interests that [the prosecution] goes ahead ... But we will see what happens,” said Angela Mudukuti, international criminal justice lawyer at the Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC), which brought a case to force authorities to bring Silemane’s alleged killer to trial.</p>

<p>The last major prosecution for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/18/southafrica.chrismcgreal">apartheid-era crimes was that of Adriaan Vlok</a>, a former minister who was given a 10-year prison suspended sentence for attempted murder after striking a plea bargain in 2007. </p>

<p>After apartheid ended in 1994, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/24/truth-justice-reconciliation-civil-war-conflict">South Africa set up a truth and reconciliation commission</a> (TRC) to investigate past atrocities and grant amnesty to some accused perpetrators of politically motivated crimes. Supporters said the process was essential to allow South Africans to move on after decades of violence.</p>

<p>However amnesty was frequently denied for incomplete disclosure, and many crimes described to the TRC were forwarded to state authorities for investigation and prosecution. Few were actively investigated subsequently.</p>

<p>Luvuyo Mfaku, a prosecution spokesman, said earlier this month that three of the four suspects in Simelane’s death had applied for amnesty for her kidnapping, but not for her murder.</p>

<p>The fourth suspect will be charged with both kidnapping and murder, he said.</p>

<p>Simelane was an “underground operative” for <em>uMkhonto weSizwe </em>(“Spear of the Nation”), the armed wing of the ANC, and tasked with carrying messages between Swaziland and South Africa. </p>

<p>In 1983 she was first illegally held for a week at a police barracks in Johannesburg by officers from the intelligence unit of the Soweto Special Branch, where she was beaten, slapped and suffocated. She was then moved to a remote farm where she was tortured for more than a month, according to earlier testimony from the accused.</p>

<p>More than 20 years later, the trial of those accused of murdering her, in a court in Pretoria, is being closely watched.</p>

<p>The legacy of the TRC remains controversial. Some South Africans believe more former white officials should have been prosecuted for apartheid-era crimes. The most high-profile figure to be convicted was Eugene de Kock, head of an apartheid covert unit responsible for multiple killings. He was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/south-africa-eugene-de-kock-released-prime-evil">granted parole last year</a>.</p>

<p>Retired archbishop <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/desmond-tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>, who was the chairman of the truth and reconciliation commission, recently defended the panel’s work, pointing out that it was the state that later failed “to hold to account those who didn’t receive amnesty”.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.tutu.org.za/on-the-decision-by-the-ndpp-to-prosecute-suspects-implicated-in-the-kidnapping-torture-murder-of-nokuthula-simelane">Tutu welcomed the decision to bring charges</a> for Simelane’s murder, telling reporters he hoped it marked a turning point for the prosecuting authority, which he said has only pursued “less than a handful” of more than 300 apartheid-era cases his commission recommended for legal action in 2002.</p>

<p>The commission heard and finalised Simelane’s case in 2001, and handed it over to prosecutors the following year.<br/></p>

<p>“What has taken them so long?” Tutu asked. “Why did the authorities turn their backs on the family of Nokuthula, and so many other families, for so many years? Why did the pleas of her family fall on deaf ears for decades?”</p>

<p>In an affidavit filed in the case brought to force authorities to prosecute Simelane’s alleged killers, Vusi Pikoli, a former national director of public prosecutions, claimed his attempts to prosecute those who did not apply for, or did not get, amnesty were blocked by senior figures within the ANC.</p>

<p>Tutu accused the ANC government of taking “extraordinary steps to obstruct the course of justice”.</p>

<p>Chris Vandome, a researcher at London’s Chatham House, said the prosecution could “open up a particularly nasty can of worms”.</p>

<p>“There are some within South Africa who view the TRC as neither getting at the full truth nor bringing full reconciliation, which is why cases like this one put people’s backs up. There is an argument that a deep-rooted healing process still needs to happen,” Vandome said.</p>

<p>In their testimony to the commission 16 years ago, three of the four defendants in the new trial admitted abducting Simelane and subjecting her to repeated severe beatings.</p>

<p>But they insisted they had not killed her and had released her after convincing the young activist to work for them as an informant. They suggested that her former comrades in the ANC might have murdered her themselves, suspecting treachery.</p>

<p>Lawyers who have pressed for the prosecution and family members have rejected the claims.</p>

<p>Mudukuti, the SALC lawyer, said “any number of cases may not have come before the TRC” and should be brought to the attention of prosecutors.</p>

<p>The TRC also left crucial questions about apartheid-era atrocities largely unanswered, such as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/06/southafrica.topstories3">what did the country’s political leaders know</a> about the assassinations, bombings and other crimes.</p>

<p> “I want answers before they die, before they go to their graves with their horrible secrets. I go to bed and dream … of Nokuthula calling me for help … if only someone can say something, just tell me where she’s buried. These men must tell me so I can die peacefully.”</p>

Both sides were violent, but one side was fighting for their human rights... You are allowed to fight for your life when under attack.

You can't say that or it will be removed. You are only allowed to point out the barbarity of the white regime, which while abhorrent certainly did not exist in a vacuum. You aren't allowed to mention the murdered farmers either.

Sorry Fynbos, but there's no way anyone's going to accept the ANC pushing prosecutions on the other side and ignoring its own misdeeds. We've seen twenty years of cronyism and lies - if they start using TRC cases for political gain it'll amount to a complete betrayal of the commitment to reconciliation.

Wow, just wow - you do not know what was happening in South Africa in the late 80s and early 90s when the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party when to war. This was black-on-black killing of the most vicious and nasty kind. It had nothing to do with "freedom" and everything to do with power and dividing the spoils of a post-aparthied South Africa. There was almost a civil war in the late 80s and early 90s. Please read up on this period of time before commenting further.

"...they had lowered them self to same level as those they fought against..." Really, Matt? People like Former Chief Justice Ismail Mahomed, and martyrs Dawood Seedat, Ahmad Timol had lowered themselves to the same level as Adriaan Vlok and Eugene de Kock?

Ah come on, let's not equate all violence as equal during the Struggle! I had a family member whose SADF job was to train Inkatha members in military tactics - not simple black on black violence here. Too many apartheid crimes went unpunished, and the credibility of the entire post-1994 political order depends on addressing these issues. I have no love at all for Zuma and those ANC who support him, but my memory is not so short. I hope the bereaved family finds some closure and peace through this process.

The deaths caused by the ANC are legitimate, according to international statutes. Further, the ANC did not massacre demonstrating white civilians in their hundreds. But occupying and enslaving the indigenous population, using the power of the state, is crime against humanity.

This angers me a lot because by deliberately ignoring history we fail to learn the real lessons and the genuine fault-lines in a society. Just because violence happened in a way which is not politically palatable does not mean that the problems have disappeared or the memories erased.

People have selective memories - no-one wants to listen when I talk about my school friends staying with us for two because their parents (prominent ANC activisrs)feared for their safety at the height of the ANC/Inkatha violence.

South Africa is nothing like Zimbabwe, as is demonstrated by the level of remittances sent home by Zimbabweans working in SA. However, if the ANC starts to dig (selectively) into the past to justify its failures that could change.

There was a lot of intercommunal fighting and bloodshed between the ANC and IFP. This was killing of the most brutal kind: burning people alive, machetes etc



Author::::faust3

They were killing each other - the ANC and Inkatha Freedom Party were engaged in a brutal near-civil war. Have you ever heard of necklacing? It was an ANC special where a burning tire was put around a victim and set on fire. Those killings weren't committed against Aparthied white South Africans but against blacks who did not agree with the ANC.

That does not excuse paranoid witch hunts among your own population. There is no moral duty to make members of your own community disappear or to have them burned alive just to convince your target audience that your fight is making a difference. Have you ever read "The Crucible" by any chance?

Without the vote, violence against the state is not only justified, it's a moral duty. Otherwise you'd have to find an equivalence between violence perpetrated by the French Resistance & the Gestapo.

They only had the TRC rather than actual trials as they knew they did not have the moral authority to sit in judgement as they had lowered them self to same level as those they fought against. They feared going the same way as Zimbabwe.

It was an ugly time but there were atrocities committed by whites and blacks. One of the problems I find is that people forget just how violent all parties involved were. How can you have a Truth and Reconciliation Commisstion without exploring in-depth the deaths caused by ANC and Inkatha Freedom Party?
