Images from a colonial childhood in Iran

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he film begins inside a box of Kodak Ektachrome slides. The box has my name written on it. Inside, the snow-capped peaks of the Zagros mountains rise up behind a big, glass-fronted house in north Tehran. Looking at this image I remember a pair of pale yellow flip-flops bobbing up and down on the surface of the kidney-shaped swimming pool. My father had jumped in to fish Azar out of the pool because she’d fallen in at the deep end, fully dressed, and couldn’t swim.</p>

<p>Or so the story went. Azar was the nanny who’d looked after me, and was married to Mohammad, the head servant. I don’t think I actually witnessed Azar’s rescue, and on reflection, I am not sure that I ever saw the yellow flip-flops floating on the water, either. This may be just one of those stories told within a family that gain solidity with each retelling, and whose imagery lives on in memory long after all of the protagonists and witnesses are gone.</p>

<p>I find no images of Tehran itself in the box, nor of any urban life beyond this cool, suburban idyl. But by now I am curious about the troubling story behind these records of a colonial encounter which I find myself bound up in. </p>

<p>A year later I’m in the BP archive at Warwick University, looking for, and failing to find, images of oil workers in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>. Despite the profusion of materials, the repertoire of imagery is limited, with the same themes reccurring in different albums, at different points in time.</p>

<p>How does one read between the lines of a photograph? What might an image betray? </p>

<p>The first remains I unearth consist of a special form of representation that reduced the world to a series of geometric patterns. Both aerial and panoramic photographs measure, plot and reconstruct whole territories in such a way that human beings disappear altogether, while vast mountains and desertscapes reveal their hidden sub-structure, a stratified history of several millennia.<br/></p>

<p>In these images, pipelines, giant containers and other industrial infrastructure stand out like monumental effigies designed for the visual gratification of some airborne deity, or presumably, those figures sat around some boardroom at the centre of power, in London. </p>

<p>I know that these are only representations, illusions made from traces of silver on paper. But as I continue to search, my suspicions are confirmed that the imperial beings that rule over the globe are able to do so because in fashioning these paper doubles of the world, they conjure the power to reshape the original. The archive did not simply register, it produced the world it described, measured and named. </p>

<p>Suddenly, figures inside a tiny snapshot reach out and grab me. From within an archive seemingly devoid of images of physical labour, these are lively images. They are from a personal album of a British engineer in the late 1930s. Figures are strung like a row of beads along a long, taught rope - they are hoisting a gigantic tank into position. </p>

<p>In another picture, the same workers present themselves to camera. They address me with an immediacy that cuts across time and means that I cannot forget them. They will not allow me to turn the page. When I magnify a third image, this one from Abadan, southern Iran, at around the same period, I am taken aback as each of the vivid faces of a group of workers stares back. Each one appears haunted, and now I have seen them, so I am too.</p>

<p>From the 1940s on, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was subject to open expressions of discontent, strikes and critisism from international labour organisations. The photographs now are staged, and we witness the shaping of an image and a narrative in which the actors appear unconvinced by their own performance. In retospect, it’s a wonder that the tales of happy children playing on British-built estates, primitive amazement at processed tinned food and other western technologies, can have persuaded anyone of their veracity.</p>

<p>The ‘Persia in Perspective’ series from around 1950 reproduces the twin-image of the primitive and the modern through a cycle of photographs prefaced with an introduction ‘For the Common Good’. I read the captions. Caption 21: ‘Since biblical times wooden ploughs have scratched the surface of the desert.’ Caption 20: ‘These young boys stare in amazement at the wonders of a modern age, as they watch a British combine harvester at work.’ And caption 18: ‘A large variety of clean imported food is available in these modern stores’. <br/> </p>

<p>At the end of my search in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/bp">BP</a> archive, I return to my family photographs, which are mainly taken up with visits to ancient ruins and villages. My mother is seated on a horse-drawn harvester. She is looking at women washing pots at a dried-up spring. She watches women spinning and weaving. In the 1970s my mother will buy an identical wool-spinning device from a shop in London, and she will build herself a small loom, from a kit.<br/></p>

<p>I had initially been disapointed by the lack of photographs showing the working and social life of BP staff. But as I look again, I reflect on the appeal of nostalgia, that longing to capture an image of the past, an ancient ruin, a primitive technology. Nostaglia seduces because it is one half of the double bind of modernity and of those who consider themselves modern, we who cannot resist the urge to measure how far forward and how irreversably we have advanced along the single-gauge track of progress. Afterall, everyone loves a ruin, and everyone prefers the ancient past to the recent past, don’t they?</p>

Look at that. A time when women were not shrouded in veils....and yet still practising muslims.Once islam had diversity of interpretation. Now all we get is Saudi influenced fundamentalistm.When i lived in Egypt in 1980's there was diversity of dress for women. Now you rarely see an unveiled woman representing Islam. The West needs to be aware of this if it is to retain its own values about women etc.

I stopped reading after the first paragraph. How can you have any faith in the author's "memories" and hence her "analysis" after she opens with a glaring demonstration of her ignorance about Tehran?? FYI: The capital city sits on the slopes of the Alborz mountains,. The Zagros Mountains are far to the south and west, nowhere near Tehran.

Iran was never colonized by England or any other country. It welcomed modernization...if that is what we should call it as many nations around the world have done. As the West was helping to modernize Iran with their oil fields and infrastructure, the ongoing Cold War dictated events which led to the ouster of Shah Reza and Prime Minister Mosaddegh. The West didn't want to lose Iran to communist (Soviet) support like they would Egypt. Shah Pahlavi created a unique and prosperous Iran which was unfortunately hijacked by the dark forces of Islam. Whatever Shah Pahlavi was, the current Iranian political and power structure is far worse.

That things didn't get better does not mean that people were wrong in opposing Shah. It just means that they were wrong in trusting religious lunatics to take over the revolution after victory.

It was merely a one sided contract for theft of Iranian oil. Any thug with a gun can do that even today. The bandits were finally kicked out by Mossadegh.

This is the most childish bullshit I have ever read about the atrocities and crimes the BP, and of course by the order of its masters and owner, the British Imperialism, committed against Iran and its people. Well, he comes from an elite sectors who were the poppets of the British. Take a close look at his mother. She has no respect or genuine feeling toward those retched people who were dying of hunger and disease, from thousand of years all the way through the reign of the despicable Shah. I am opposed to the rule of Mullahs. I don't know how those farmers are surviving. I was born in 1941 and did my military service in the west near Iraq's border. I witnessed the extreme poverty of those who lived in the area. I don't think the guy who wrote this stupid article has ever witnessed their horrible lives.

Colonial? Sounds like British are still really upset about failing at every attempt to add Iran to their long list of occupied territories. They stole oil from Iran and committed many other atrocities in Iran for sure, but they could never "colonies" Iran. Maybe Ms. Miranda Pennell was told otherwise to make her and her family feel superior. Sorry to burst your bubble, but "sun never sets on British territories" blah blah never applied to Iran.

No, Alex didnt have ill dealings towards ancient Persia. That's why he burned and plundered every city along his path, including the capitol Persopolis.Admittedly Persia or Iran effects its invaders and colonialists. Alexander like you said took a Persian "wife" amongst his many hundred others and apparently died adopting the ancient Persian Zoroastrian religion. Changiz Khan who swept across Asia and half of Europe adopted islam and the Persian language when he invaded Iran...

colonisation is not the same as invasions. Alexandre the great was such a fan of Iran that he married an Iranian wife I beleive. Being from Macedonia rather than Greece he did not have ill feelings towards Persia and was interested in Ruling it not changing it.also thye greatest period in history of Isfahan was during Abbas Shah, after the mongols had been defeated.

Uzbeks are descendants of Mongol tribes who COLONIZED north east ancient Persia, Samarqand and Bukhara were originally two Persian cities, as was Herat which now lies in AFghanistan. Iranian or Persian history is a history of Invasions and colonizations.Similar to the history of Britain. First were Celts, colonized by Romans, colonized by Anglos and Saxons, then came the Vikings and Normans. ANd the Language in the British isles changed similarly to Farsi due to the different colonizations....now will you accuse me of supporting Celts against against Romans, hahaha

amin joon,Iran has a long history of colonization, first by Greeks (Alexander the...) which only lasted 80 years. Then we had the Arabs with the deepest affect on our culture and language. And then came the Mongols who destroyed our ancient cities of Samaqand and Bukhara. And we had Afghan invasion who destroyed most of our ancient capitol Esfahan.We are probably the most invaded and colonized country on earth
