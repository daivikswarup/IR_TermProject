Bryan Adams' guitar defaced by Egyptian customs

<p>A run-in with customs at Cairo airport has left rock singer <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/bryan-adams">Bryan Adams</a> fuming, after a border agent scrawled a number on his guitar.<br/></p>

<p>The Grammy award-winning musician, who was in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt">Egypt</a> for a concert at the Giza pyramids, posted a picture of the vintage Martin acoustic guitar on his Instagram account.</p>

<p>A number and an illegible word in Arabic had been written in green ink on the mahogany instrument’s side.</p>

<p>“Airport customs graffiti on my 1957 Martin D-18 from Egypt. Back to the luthier bryanadamsgetup,” Adams wrote on Instagram, referring to his latest album, Get Up. </p>

<p>Adams said his problems with customs had begun on his arrival at the airport. “We almost didn’t get the equipment into the country, and when we did it was all marked like this,” he wrote in a Facebook message on Friday. “There were absolutely no apologies.”</p>

<p>A customs official said instruments were marked with serial numbers, although usually with stickers. Regarding the ink, he suggested: “Maybe it wasn’t us?”</p>

<p>It is not the first time someone has written numbers on one of Adams’ guitars. In 2015, he tweeted that Air Canada had scrawled a serial number in black ink.</p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">Could someone from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/AirCanada">@AirCanada</a> contact me about the pen damage done to my guitar?

<p>Egyptians mocked the incident on social media: “Doesn’t Adams know that we glued together Tutankhamun with super glue? It’s normal that we write something on a 60-year-old guitar,” one wrote, referring to a b<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/09/egypt-restore-tutankhamun-beard-mask-botched-repair-epoxy">otched repair of the priceless Tutankhamun funerary mask</a> in a Cairo museum.</p>

<p>Adams said despite the incident he would return to Egypt to perform. “Rest assured, apart from this incident, I love Egypt and look forward to returning again one day,” he said. “But without the green paint markers please.”</p>

It's given the guitar provenance.

Actually it's very tasteful. It's Adams who is tasteless.

You could put this little squiggle on my Les Paul Standard which is a pretty expensive guitar and I wouldn't be bothered really. I'd just paint over it if I could even be bothered to do that. Some men just love their objects though. It's weird.

Ha - no worries. I thought that might have been a typo, so forgive the pedantry. The Washburn is a guitar, although it was actually built by the Regal factory in Chicago for Washburn and distributed through a store called Tonk Brothers. I forget the model number now, but they're pretty rare and definitely worth buying if you stumble across one. I bought it because I couldn't afford the 10K+ for a 30's Bacon & Day (also built by the regal factory), but it's got some serious mojo and is probably the nicest guitar I've owned.

No doubt Adams is one of those who believe that vandals who deface walls with graffiti are 'artists.' Now he has some great 'art' on his instrument. He should be proud and happy.Or maybe it's just bad karma from participating in more consumerist nonsense like a concert at the pyramids. He defaces the pyramids and their environment with noise; his guitar gets a visual label. Seems eminently fair.

Well, as a guitar player I'd also be upset. That's a Martin guitar and a vintage one at that. Shows a lack of respect for a musician who's flown halfway around the world to perform.

Wow! I've been out of the loop. Suddenly Bryan Adams looks like Tommy Lee Jones' little brother! Shame about the guitar, but it can be easily fixed, especially by a rich bloke with the cash to pay for the best restoration. I wonder what he did to annoy the dude with the pen.

Are you suggesting Bryan Adams was involved?

Not a vintage Martin - that's more Kurt Russell's style

Though they've probably helped the human rights cause in this case -- Bryan Adams will hopefully be out of action while the thing is repaired.

I thought he favoured Taylor guitars? They should dye the wood to match his hair.



Author::::Jflexman

I don't see the problem. It's not written on the wood, it's coated, and should be relatively simple to remove with the right stuff.

The famous Camargue Gipsy flamenco guitarist, Manitas de Plata - father of a couple of the Gipsy Kings - had TWO of his guitars painted on. The difference is the graffiti artists were Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. They increased the value of the guitars by several million quid, unlike poor Bryan Adams' guitar

Boo hoo. It's only a guitar. People are sick of the sound of these bloody things anyway.

Yes I actually meant rosewood, not maple( I would say that!). Maple is more common in cellos and basses, as a back of made rosewood at that size- well, let's just say that you wouldn't want to put it near airport security. Is that a Washburn banjo or guitar you mean? I do like my string instruments too (currently have gold tone and Gibson banjos )but marriagekidmortgagecarloans means they are clinging on right now....

You do understand that I'm talking about the guitar and not the player, right? Since Adams certainly has pros who work on his guitars, I was just surprised since a Martin saddle is generally not cut as high as that because of the strain it can put on the front of the bridge as the strings pull on it.

Although this whole bizarre thread has arisen from a combination of my company's firewall and laziness on my part, I do like a guitar chat... I'm not being a dick here, but I've gotta say that rosewood is actually a more common material for the back and sides of Martin guitars (Brazilian rosewood being the creme de menthe, as you can't legally harvest it any more and they have to use old stock), but some WW2 era Martins were made completely of mahogany. (My uncle had a 1947 mahogany 0m-18 or some such thing, which was the nuts.) I think they still make them, but I prefer the spruce/rosewood combo personally. I had a spruce/maple Gibson once though, which was awesome until penury forced me to sell it. I'm currently playing a 1934 washburn, and if someone scribbled on that with a pen I'd be more than a little pissed off, so I can empathise with Mr Adams here.

I have a fifteen year old Cort (sort of a PRS copy) that I got off Ebay for £8. Glued the headstock back together with Araldite (it's all I had), put a set of Tonerider vintage voiced humbuckers in it and it turns out to be the best sounding and playing guitar I own.

It's Egypt's military dictatorship, oppression and human rights abuses he should really be fuming about.
