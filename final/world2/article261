From Kurdistan to Tehran: the urban-rural divide as Iranians turn out to vote




DateTime::::2016-02-26T05:00:13+0000



<p>As excitement mounts leading to Friday’s parliamentary elections, a palpable difference in priorities is emerging, as it often does, between voters in Iran’s urban areas and its provinces. Unlike in Tehran, voters and campaign activists in the suburbs and rural areas are engaged in discussions that diverge sharply from their fellow countrymen in the capital. </p>

<p>While provincial voters are primarily concerned with practical issues related to rural development and ethnic and kinship affiliations, urbanites are often drawn into the kind of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/iran-elections-struggle-theocracy-democracy-tehranbureau">political and ideological discourse</a> that makes national headlines – a never-ending battle of reformists, principlists, moderates, and everything in between.</p>

<p>Farshad, a campaign organizer for a Kurdish candidate in Kermanshah province, has studied in Tehran and experienced the urban-rural contrast firsthand. </p>

<p>“People here are not subject to the forces of national politics,” says Farshad of the political environment in the Kermanshah district his candidate is hoping to seize. “Elections in big cities, especially in Tehran, are subject to the political situation – how open or closed the political environment is.” He adds: “Instead of our demands being political, the demands here are more local.” </p>

<p>Voters are concerned with economic development, Farshad says of Kermanshah’s electorate. “Instead of looking for a representative who ascribes to a certain political discourse, they’re more interested in someone who’s going to bring about welfare, development, and better services.” </p>

<p>For Mona, who lives in Tehran but is originally from Kermanshah, demands are more tangible in her home province. She says it’s important Kermanshah’s winning candidate should support the right to teach in her mother tongue, Kurdish, as opposed to Iran’s national language, Persian. “It really matters to me who represents [my] region because we have some specific unique issues,” she says, noting she plans to depart Tehran, and its reformist-principlist cacophony, and cast her ballot back home.</p>

<p>In one sense, demands in Kermanshah have changed since the 1979 revolution, when citizens supported lawmakers promising to expand access to basic necessities like water, gas and electricity, says Farshad. Today, in a marked shift, pleas for expanded internet access have joined the ranks of those basic needs, Farshad claims.</p>

<p>“Internet, though it wasn’t a serious need at first, is today part and parcel of Iranians’ lives,” he adds. “Even in remote villages and towns, people are using the internet frequently...Both the literate and the illiterate, they’re all users of social networks.” </p>

<p>In that respect, the Kermanshah electorate shares the same interests as its Tehran counterpart. Throughout the country, much of the pre-election discussion is taking place on Telegram, Iran’s most popular messaging app. Back in Tehran, where factional political rivalries continue to rage, the reformists have leveraged Telegram to conduct their campaigns to make up for their<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/69922fb4-da13-11e5-a72f-1e7744c66818.html%23axzz41Cr3YOXm"> lack of access</a> to funds and broadcast media outlets, which are controlled by Iran’s conservatives. </p>

<p><strong>A view from Tehran</strong></p>

<p>Reformists usually draw the largest crowds among the capital’s urban dwellers, discussing jobs, women’s issues and social liberalization. Occasionally, if the political weather permits, candidates make veiled references to the continued house arrest of Green Movement leaders to rile supporters. But after Iran’s major vetting body, the Guardian Council, disqualified most major reformist candidates in the run-up to Friday’s election, reformists have centered on whipping up excitement to maximize voter turnout. In turn, they hope to exert as much influence as possible on the Iranian parliament’s political makeup for the next four years.</p>

<p>With the focus on getting the vote out, the leader of the movement, former reformist president Mohammad Khatami, released a video message urging Iranians to vote for the reformists’ main candidate lists – or what little remains of them. That message was bolstered by pro-reform intellectual Sadegh Zibakalam, a popular figure among young Iranians.</p>

<p>“Let’s vote so [candidates] don’t enter the parliament with only 300,000 votes,” Zibakalam urged in a video posted to Aparat, the Iranian YouTube equivalent, referring to 2012, when many pro-reform voters boycotted the election to protest the mass disqualification of their candidates. The low turnout enabled MPs to get into parliament with as little as 300,000 votes, when Tehran had roughly six million eligible voters.</p>

<p>“Turnout will be higher than the last parliamentary election,” predicts Mehdi, a reformist activist in Tehran. “After 2012 and the subsequent election of [Iranian President Hassan] Rouhani, the people who previously boycotted saw the impact of turning out.” Mehdi says he’s noticing a significant shift in his immediate social circles, claiming that 70-80% more of his friends will be voting in this election compared to four years ago. “Only one or two are against voting,” he says.</p>

<p>But Mehdi added that the disillusioning political developments of the past decade would likely prevent voters from participating in the same euphoric droves as in the 2000 election of the Islamic Republic’s sixth parliament, the only time reformists weren’t disqualified en masse by the Guardian Council. </p>

<p>Political parties in the western sense do not exist in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>. Instead, voters choose between lists of various “movements,” or “political suggestions,” says Mehdi, prioritizing the factions that feature recognizable candidates. Now, many voters feel the Guardian Council’s vetting mechanisms have limited their choices to candidates that, while officially running as reformists, may in fact be conservatives with only token reformist tendencies.</p>

<p>Since most known reformist figures have been eliminated from the race, pro-reform voters have been relegated to “second and third-tier reformists” who have been re-qualified by the Guardian Council, Mehdi says. In some cases, they include political wildcards like incumbent candidate <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/profiles-iran-parliamentary-candidates-tehranbureau">Ali Motahari</a>, who opposes the reformists’ social agenda but whose conservative roots have allowed him to be more outspoken than any other government official on key issues, like the release of Iran’s opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi.</p>

Not really, because you're still insulting Iranians. You are saying they "moderate" their beliefs, as if they recognize that Wahabism is "true piety" but just don't want to go that far because they believe Islam is outdated. You are just projecting your belief that Wahabi is "full Islam" on them. If Wahabi isn't "full Islam", then Shia are not "moderate" in comparison, but fully Muslim.

Kermanshah is a city of almost a million people. It is not rural. I hope the internet connection for everyone becomes faster all over Iran, if that is a complaint in villages around Kermanshah. Iran can't still import high end fast routers and switches from the west. Hopefully, they start buying Huawei and speed up the Internet.

Don't forget about PUK in Iraq. They are the people who helped PYD in Kobani with arms provided by Iran. As a matter of fact there are Iranian Kurd members of Sepah in Rojava helping PYD protect it from Erdoganite Turks and their allies ISIS. The KDP Barzani cult is in the pocket of Erdogan. They let Izadi Kurds perish at the hands of ISIS. It was PUK/PYD/PKK that freed mount Sinjar from ISIS, even though Barzani made the speech. Izadis can't stand him. It is the time for Kurds to know where they belong, Convince Iran to support their independence and have an open border with Iran for trade and commerce. Iranian Kurds are at home.

So, after what I wrote, what you've taken from this is that I'm some sort of external saboteur? You've pretty much ignored the part where I said it wasn't about being Iranian or Persian or not, but about citizens in a country being treated equally and not killed and repressed when they do not subscribe to the majority-conceived notion of a state identity (in this case Persian).

You are right. Khamenei himself is Azeri! So if there was any discrimination then the "Supreme Leader" wouldn't be Azeri. I am half Azeri myself and my family would consider any talk of separation as 100% treason. It is not bordering on treason it is very high treason.

No offence but I think it is unfair to call these people moderates. Just because they're non-violent doesn't mean they're 'moderating' their belief, or that the violent ones are truly pious to the max.

In Iran there are a lot of Turkish speakers but most of them are not Turks. The majority of Turkish speakers are non Turks who were forced to speak Turkish by Turk conquerers in the past. They all speat Persian and mostly identify themselves as Iranian. I know this from personal experience not some guess.

A good number of Iranian leadership are just as secular in their personal lives. They are not atheists but rather "non radical" or "moderate". I once met a guy who said in deference to religion said he never drank alcohol on major religious occasions!

Nobody in Iran cares if British are convinced they have democracy. Nobody cares what British believe. Iranians do want to trade with UK and EU. Iranians do want to have amicable relations but they don't need your approval. It is only your ego that makes you think your personal opinion matters to an Iranian.

It hurts to see another nation doing well doesn't it? You just have to stamp your feet and demand civil war and hate. Sorry Iranians are not taking the bait. You and people like you poured your poison in Libya; Iraq and Syria : we watched and we learned and we reject you.

You are right. There are some in the West who pretend to know so much about Iran. Yet their true goal is to divide the people and create grievences. They hold a contempt for other civilizations from Russia to Iran. They never admit that Iranians put their nationality above ethnicity or race. They want one thing and that is to inflame racial hate so they can create more civil wars.

Why is it that whenever a reputable paper like the Guardian decides to explore the legitimate grievances of Kurds in Iran, head-in-the-sand Iranian nationalists suddenly emerge from obscurity to grace us with the light of their wisdom and learnedness?

I thought, hey, this is a first for Tehran Bureau, actually admitting a split between country and Tehran! But in the end, the article was only about the Iranian Kurds, not about all the others outside Tehran. And only presents the country in the vision of ethnic minorities. There are Iranians in the country too.

Kurdish is of north western indo-european languages, Iranian is a national identity the language is Farsi Persian like that of Afghanistan is also a part of the indo european family, and parthian, afghan is a national identity there are Turkic, Pashtun and other ethnicities that make up the afghan nation. However, Kurdish isn't the same as farsi as the Farsi in Afghanistan isn't the same as the one in Iran. Kurdish is a group of langauges which has 4 main dialects ZaZa, kurmanji, sorani and gorani, due to the backstabbing by Jew Kemal and Reza shah ataturk want to be the Kurds were left stateless you can't blame them for who they are what they have done or will do in the future. Yes the Middle East has been an inside job and it looks like a balkanization process but however most of you will believe the Kurds are united , but they aren't pyd pkk yea they are , KRG Iraqi Kurds are dictated by the demand of Israel as it was the Kurdish Jews who had became a israeli politicians and influenced the autonomous region of what is called Iraqi Kurdistan, in respect israil gets oil from Iraqi Kurdistan through turkey pipeline turkey says OK to Iraqi Kurdistan since turkey is a zionsit state ever since its creation and can't say no to Israel, so you will see that the KRG turkey Israel us relation, but get this you will see us pyd proxy relation, pyd is basically pkk, is says pkk is terrorist but pyd isn't and say we support it so what's going there, what was the game changer Russia, so Russia is actually the one supporting pyd and pkk, Russia pkk pyd Iran shia groups are sides against the zionsit west and co us uk Australia turkey NATO ,

Stalin's political police would beat prisoners, at times so hard their yes popped out of their head. Once prisoners signed a confession they were shot and killed. What happens in Evian prison? How progressive is Iran compared to the region? History shows religious leaders enjoy killing, while elected leaders are more humane.

I know it's a silly policy like the rest of the policies of the last century which have not made the place safer the world safer or helped any groups. Short sighted policy makers who have little other than superficial knowledge of the history and culture of the region. Much like Blair and Bush's wars have not made us or he region any safer and all the genocides are on them.
