<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> will feature a woman on a forthcoming banknote and the country is seeking nominations from the public on who should receive the honor, the government said on Tuesday.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/18/noteworthy-woman-to-feature-on-10-bill-us-treasury-announces">Move over, Hamilton: woman to appear on $10 bill, Treasury announces</a> </p>

<p> Although the Queen of England is featured predominantly on Canada’s currency, the new note will showcase a Canadian – either by birth or naturalization – who has shown leadership or achievement in the service of the country.</p>

<p> Announcing the move, the finance minister, Bill Morneau, noted that, with the exception of the queen, women have “largely been unrepresented” on Canada’s banknotes.</p>

<p> Celine Dion need not apply because candidates also must have been deceased for at least 25 years.</p>

<p>Nominations submitted to the Bank of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> will be reviewed by an independent advisory council made up of academics and other experts that will draw up a shortlist to be submitted to the finance minister. The new note will be issued in 2018.</p>

<p> Following the announcement, which coincided with International Women’s Day, the Bank of Canada tweeted that the first name submitted was Canadian suffragist Nellie McClung, who died in 1951.</p>

<p>The Bank of Canada did not specify which banknote would feature the woman.</p>

<p> The move follows in the footsteps of the US, which last year announced it would <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/10/woman-10-bill-treasury-department">feature the face of a woman on a redesigned $10 bill</a> to be unveiled in 2020. <br/></p>

I think Trudeau fils has been called brain fart from time to time, but he continues to surprise us. Best thing he did was punching the daylights out of that wifebeater Conservative senator.

She's the Queen of England in the sense that she's the Queen of London and of Staines and of Tring, but none of those is her title. You might as well say the bank manager is the manager of the bank toilets.

Good for Canada. Most Canadians don't even recognise these old fa_rts that date from distant history. The only Father of Confederation still recognised is Joey Smallwood of Newfoundland who enjoyed a reputation somewhat akin to Trump - except Smallwood was sophisticated.

Though not Canadian born, for her care for first world war Canadian soldiers, nurse Edith Cavell. And to conform to the twenty five years deceased stipulation of the Bank of Canada, to be replaced twenty four years from now by Flora MacDonald.

Given the stipulation the candidate must be deceased at least twenty five years, on an intellectual level, Maggie Trudeau would be a perfect choice. However, as of today, it would seem her torso is still drawing breath.

There's no such person. As fishplate said, there's been no queen of England for over 300 years.
