Marshall Islands begins legal action aimed at global nuclear disarmament

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/marshall-islands">Marshall Islands</a> has begun an extraordinary legal challenge against the world’s nuclear powers, aiming to reinvigorate momentum towards global nuclear disarmament.</p>

<p>The tiny south Pacific state will argue before the International Court of Justice in The Hague that the health and lives of its citizens have been destroyed by the dozens of nuclear tests conducted along its territory between 1946 and 1958.</p>

<p>“I can just go down the list of my wife’s family, you don’t even have to go that far and almost every Marshall Islander out here can do this: my wife’s mother died of cancer of the uterus; my wife’s uncle died of thyroid cancer,” Jack Niedenthal, trust liaison for the People of Bikini Atoll, said.</p>

<p>Another Marshall Islands representative, Tony de Brum, told the court he watched one of the US nuclear tests in his home country as a 9-year-old boy while fishing with his grandfather.</p>

<p>“The entire sky turned blood red,” he told judges. He said some of his country’s islands were “vaporized” by the tests.<br/></p>

<p>The Marshall Islands initially filed cases against all nine known or suspected nuclear weapons states – the US, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea.<br/></p>

<p>But only the cases against the UK, India, and Pakistan have reached the current preliminary stage of proceedings before the court, because the other six nations have refused to participate.</p>

<p>The Marshall Islands argues nuclear weapons states have failed to carry out good-faith negotiations towards nuclear disarmament, as required under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, signed in 1968 and in force since 1970.<br/></p>

<p>While the UK is a party to the NPT, India and Pakistan are not, but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/159/18294.pdf">the Marshall Islands argues</a> the principle of disarmament is sufficiently well-established in international law to be considered customary law.</p>

<p>There is no expectation the Marshall Islands challenge will force the three powers to disarm, but the archipelago’s campaign highlights a growing avenue for small countries, previously thought powerless, to raise problems and issues through global tribunals.<br/></p>

<p>The court has previously ruled on the obligation of nuclear weapons states to move towards disarmament. In a 1996 advisory opinion, the judges stated unanimously that there existed an “obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control”.<br/></p>

<p>Hearings of the Marshall Islands challenge began in The Hague on Monday, the same day North Korea warned of an indiscriminate “pre-emptive nuclear strike of justice” on Washington and Seoul, in reaction to the commencement of US-South Korean military drills.<br/></p>

<p>The disarmament debate is current in Australia too.<br/></p>

<p>The Australian <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.defence.gov.au/WhitePaper/Docs/2016-Defence-White-Paper.pdf">defence white paper</a>, released last month, has reaffirmed Australia’s commitment to a policy of “extended nuclear deterrence”, essentially, that the American nuclear arsenal provides an umbrella of effective protection for its allies, deterring attack from other nations.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/iran-ballistic-missile-test-us-un-response">Iran's latest reported ballistic missile firing tests prior US warnings</a> </p>

<p>“Australia’s security is underpinned by the Anzus Treaty, United States extended deterrence and access to advanced United States technology and information. Only the nuclear and conventional military capabilities of the United States can offer effective deterrence against the possibility of nuclear threats against Australia,” the paper says.</p>

<p>But an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/03/10/Open_Letter_on_Nuclear_Weapons_-_Defence_Minister.pdf">open letter from 50 international law academics</a> sent to defence minister Marise Payne this week has called for Australia to reconsider its support for nuclear weapons and their deterrent capabilities.</p>

<p>“We write to encourage the Australian government to review its support for extended nuclear deterrence in light of the growing international movement to prohibit nuclear weapons on humanitarian grounds,” the letter says.</p>

<p>The authors cite a growing global momentum behind a “humanitarian pledge” from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons – proposed in 2014, and now with the support of 126 nations – that calls for an international treaty banning nuclear weapons, and a worldwide effort to “stigmatise, prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons in light of their unacceptable humanitarian consequences”.</p>

<p>The pledge has attracted the support of Pope Francis, who said the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/tag/pope-francis/">“immoral”</a> weapons should be “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/12/09/pope_francis_urges_world_towards_nuclear_disarmament/1114066">banned once and for all</a>”, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/the-world-summit-of-nobel-peace-laureates/rome-2014/">nine Nobel peace laureates</a> who signed a declaration urging “all states to commence negotiations on a treaty to ban nuclear weapons at the earliest possible time”.<br/></p>

<p>The authors of the letter to Payne, from 23 Australian universities, write it is “deeply regrettable” that Australia is not among the 126 nations supporting the pledge.</p>

<p>“We believe that Australia should cease its reliance on weapons whose use would almost certainly violate international law, given the uncontrollability of their blast, heat and radiological effects.”<br/></p>

I can imagine they're really concerned in Islamabad and Delhi. At least in the UK there is an anti-nuclear lobby who might bother with a protest or two. In the subcontinent there is no such thing.

Does Russia, China, India, Pakistan, or N. Korea recognize the ICC?

Not to nit-pick but the Marshall Islands are in the North Pacific about 10 degrees (and more) north of the equator. I lived there and cared for the people who were still suffering from the nuclear testing. Very high incidences of obesity, diabetes and heart disease, many with scars from ear to ear from having thyroids removed due to radiation poisoning and no thyroid replacement medications. Tragic!

Nuclear weapons aside, can you blame them? They need funding to build massive seawalls in order to contain rising sea levels due to climate change not of their own making, and the release of radiation into the seas.

Rxxx is correct about the US stance on the ICJ. Just to note, the Marshall Islands also has a lawsuit pending in US Federal Court about this issue.

Cameron should be withdrawing British government support for this International Court of Justice as they have no right to dictate British government policy. Only a idiot would give up nuclear weapons for a promise from the likes of Putin and Kim jong un to behave. Remeber the last time we got a note from a dictator promising to behave we had world war 2. The last country to give up its nuclear weapons for a note promising that they would behave themselves and respect that country's territorial integrity now has Russia occupying part of it.

It may end up being a largely symbolic action, but the issue of nuclear disarmament needs to be kept alive. One day...

some may say this is gesture politics, but should nothing be said or attempted?

Good luck a journey of many miles starts with a single step. However it is too late cancer rates will soon be 1 in 1. The plankton is being boiled to death the Pacific is dying and all carbon based life is being attacked. As Einstein said 'we will we in 60 years time' and we are.

Except the US tried that and the Marshall Islands are going forward with this anyway. This has been brewing for a couple of years and the US has not bribed them off. It is at trial and a ruling will be delivered.

They did; but then they were losing the Nicaragua case, threw their toys out of the pram and have refused to participate every since.However, the US (and the other UNSC permanent members) always have a judge on the Court. The current US judge is Joan Donoghue and she is relatively progressive.

Does the US even recognise the International Court of Justice? Would they go along with anything that threatens their hegemony?

Good on them, fully support. Governments should be talking peace not more arms. Learn to trust each other for a change and stop these companies who make money making war machines.

Bravo to the Marshall Islands for taking on the nuclear-armed nations. I hope they succeed. And I hope that Marise Payne will heed the call from international lawyers to reject any role for nuclear weapons in Australia's defence. It is time to moved beyond a nuclear-weapon-based security paradigm.

No nuclear weapons and no nuclear power stations in Australia.
