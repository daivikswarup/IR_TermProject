North Korea steps up army recruitment ahead of US military exercise

<p>North Korea has stepped up army recruitment and called on former soldiers to re-enlist to bolster its ground forces ahead of the traditional <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/12168110/Largest-ever-US-South-Korea-military-drill-planned-as-a-warning-to-Pyongyang.html">joint military exercise</a> between South Korea and the US, according to sources inside the country</p>

<p>Washington and Seoul are scheduled to begin their biggest ever military manoeuvres across the border on 7 March, involving 15,000 US troops – double the number of previous years. </p>

<p>A source from South Pyongan province said a petition opposing the joint South Korean-US exercises has been circulating across the country, with mass meetings organised in the provinces and the capital. </p>

<p>The claims came as DPRK leader <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/kim-jong-un">Kim Jong-un</a> said his country should be ready to use nuclear weapons “at any time” because of growing threat from its enemies. The statement appeared to be a response to new sanctions imposed by the UN security council after North Korea’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/north-korean-nuclear-test-suspected-as-artificial-earthquake-detected">recent nuclear test</a> and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/07/north-korea-launches-long-range-rocket-it-claims-is-carrying-a-satellite">rocket launch</a>.</p>

<p>The North Korean source, who cannot be named for security reasons, said the regime had encouraged all youth from secondary school up to university level to sign up, and had proposed that all those under 40 who have been discharged get back in uniform.</p>

<p>A similar call was recently issued by the National Defence Commission, with the provincial military mobilisation units interviewing workers who meet the requirements for re-enlistment. Those selected for service have now been placed on stand-by. </p>

<p>“Only those who have a missing person – or are an inmate at a kyohwaso [re-education camps, which also function as prisons] – among their family members are exempted,” the source said. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Ahead of next week’s the military exercises, Kim told state TV that the regime’s enemies were threatening North Korea’s survival. “At an extreme time when the Americans ... are urging war and disaster on other countries and people, the only way to defend our sovereignty and right to live is to bolster our nuclear capability,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying.</p>

<p>The source in South Pyongan said the provincial commissions had been gathering local residents and spreading the message that modern warfare is artillery warfare, and that “every citizen who is a gunner is expected to do their share in fighting the war for reunification”.</p>

<p>But ordinary North Koreans have not all welcomed the mobilisations, the source said. “A lot of people say how unfair it is that ‘rhetoric bombs’, favoured by the authorities in response to the ROK-US joint exercises, only effectively harass the domestic population.” </p>

<p>North Korea’s central news agency has reported that recruitment in response to the call had already reached 1.5 million, but a source in Ryanggang Province said that this did not represent the full reality. </p>

<p>“The nation is swept away by the fervour to join the military. But those who do not respond will be seen as having ideological problems, so who wouldn’t join?” the source said. </p>

<p>“The youth of this country has long said that they would much rather study technology or enter university than join the military, so why [else] would there be this sudden change of heart?”</p>

North Korea then as a sovereign state should compensate South Korea for the sinking of its ship in its own waters .Or pay for the damages its shelling has caused.Maybe the DPRK would like to pay back the money from all the insurance scams they have run which ends up being paid by people in the west in higher insurance cost .Reasonable and North Korea dont belong in the same sentence and if you think they are hard done by your a fool or just being contrary.

In the event of an attack on the South I can guarantee that the NKPA will rapidly lose cohesion as it starts looting and pillaging .The NKPA will rapidly lose control of units as their command structure doesnt allow for lower ranked officers and NCOs to show initiative or deviate from their orders .It will be like a horde of locusts .

... his country should be ready to use nuclear weapons “at any time” Isn't that what all countries with nuclear weapons say? North Koreans are probably scared of the American exercises across the border. Usually "exercises" near hostile countries are a prelude to all out war.

Damn we need Cruz in power badly. Someone has to stand up to the damn commies and obama or the compulsive liar Trump sure as hell aint gonna stand up for us. We need a guy who can grow a pair of balls and fight for our rights. Cruz is the one true conservative who can stand up to Kim fat un and put him down in his place.

15,000 US infantry on his border what is he supposed to think? 99% of people are pointing fingers at NK but take a minute to be in their position. Enemies of your State amassing 15k troops on your border and carrying out war games. No wonder he is saber rattling, making a lot of noise is often the best way to stop an attack.

The conundrum of North Korea is that if they are ignored, they clamor for attention (Hey! Yo! Don't forget about us! Pleeeeaaase!) Kind of like the cat when it is hungry at feeding time- it will do just about anything to get your attention, including naughty things. And yet, when one does pay them attention, that causes similar levels of trouble.  Perhaps the most institutionally moronic nation left, incapable of change, as any significant change completely affects the totalitarian structure that allows it to continue existing as such in the first place.

The early 50's method of a huge infantry wave assault was only sometimes effective, if the opponent wasn't expecting it.Now, a huge massed infantry is a target hard to miss with fine reconnaissance & bombardment.

The Western governments and the US are putting the world in danger in this equation? I suppose North Korea has no accountability in this? What would you propose that the world do with North Korea? Ignore it more so than it has already? Ignore the attack on it's territory that has already accounted for innocent deaths in South Korea?

It’s a good sign to see China vote to put sanctions on NK. However, China is probably doing it for their own pragmatic reasons, maybe to calm tensions after their recent militarization of the South East China Sea.

This 'resentment' is voiced by paid North Korean front organisations and individuals. Just like they have stooge groups and parties all over the world (e.g. Asspuk in the UK), albeit in much smaller numbers than in South Korea.

North Korea does not have that capability. Its armed forces are a little larger than that of the South, but as well equipped, especially with regard to air forces.
