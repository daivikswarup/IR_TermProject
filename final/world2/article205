Japanese court orders closure of two nuclear reactors




DateTime::::2016-03-09T09:14:58+0000



<p>A Japanese court has ordered the closure of two nuclear reactors previously declared safe under strict post-Fukushima safety rules. </p>

<p>The order, made just days before the fifth anniversary of the atomic disaster, would bring the number of operating reactors in Japan down to two. Dozens were shut in the wake of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima">Fukushima</a>, the worst nuclear accident in a generation.</p>

<p>The ruling by the Otsu district court – the first to force the shutdown of reactors switched on under stricter safety rules adopted after the 2011 disaster – is a blow to plans by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to bring back nuclear power. </p>

<p>The reactors to be closed are Kansai Electric’s No 3 and No 4 reactors at the Takahama nuclear plant, about 215 miles (350km) west of Tokyo. </p>

<p>The No 4 reactor was taken offline last month due to an unexpected technical glitch days after it restarted, while the No 3 reactor is currently operating. </p>

<p>Kansai Electric said it would respect the “extremely regrettable” decision and shut down operations, but would appeal. </p>

<p>“This court order is not something the company can accept,” it said in a statement. Television footage showed plaintiffs and local residents cheering and holding banners after the ruling.</p>

<p>“I’m so happy and praise the court’s courage,” said one person celebrating outside the courthouse. </p>

<p>The bid to restart Japan’s nuclear reactors has become entangled in a web of lawsuits amid fears about another Fukushima-style accident. </p>

<p>In December, another court sided with Kansai Electric by lifting a temporary injunction blocking the restart of the two reactors covered by Wednesday’s ruling. </p>

<p>The latest case was filed by residents in neighbouring Shiga prefecture, who argued that the reactors posed a risk to Lake Biwa, a key water source for the region. </p>

<p>An accident similar to Fukushima would contaminate the lake, they argued. </p>

<p>Two reactors in the southern prefecture of Kagoshima, operated by Kyushu Electric Power, restarted in August and October last year, ending the two-year hiatus in nuclear power generation.<br/></p>

<p>A pair of reactors were briefly switched on again after the accident but were then closed down again. </p>

<p>Anti-nuclear sentiment still runs high in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a> and there was widespread opposition to restarts.</p>

<p>Abe and utility companies have been pushing to get reactors back in operation, as the disaster forced Japan to turn to pricey fossil fuels to plug an energy gap left by the shutdown of dozens of nuclear reactors. </p>

<p>Abe has argued that resuming nuclear power is key to Japan’s energy policy, but memories of Fukushima are still fresh for many. </p>

<p>Japan’s entire stable of reactors was closed in the aftermath of the disaster, when a huge undersea earthquake sent a tsunami smashing into the coast, swamping the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and sparking reactor meltdowns. </p>

<p>Official investigations have heaped blame on the plant operator Tokyo Electric Power – three of its former executives are now facing a criminal trial – and the disaster has been labelled a man-made accident. </p>

<p>In response, Japan set up an independent atomic watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, replacing the previous arrangement where the industry ministry both oversaw the regulator and promoted nuclear power. </p>

Yes, look at this green coal mine in Germany:http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/wind-turbines-operate-beyond-an-open-pit-lignite-mine-also-news-photo/487268698

Read a book. You only get contamination plumes from meltdowns if there’s a loss of containment.

There is a difference between the stated goals of something and the actual results. One of the result in Germany has been the commitment to get rid of a low carbon energy generation with a great track record in favour of the most dirty power generation we can build, plus some unreliable generation that doesn't do much to improve how clean that power generation is, but is great for funnelling extra cash to the owners and a good tool to deflect criticism by saying "we have wind turbines, it's green"

Abe Govt of Japan repeat self-praise that "Japan's nuclear Safety standard is best in the world".but its actual state is far inferior to other countries' safety standard.

Yes, that sound's much better. You need some good marketing speak to persuade people to pay over the odds for electricity, which is just as dirty as it was a decade ago.

Energiewende (German for Energy transition) is the transition by Germany to an energy portfolio dominated by renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development. The final goal is the abolition of coal and other non-renewable energy sources.[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition_in_Germany

Get a map. The reactors are on the coast, but a contamination plume from a meltdown accident would reach Lake Biwa.

Well, if a Tsunami can reach in to Bavaria, then I doubt Ukraine is immune.

Well Zaporizhia will have to shut as its only 110 miles inland... the rest should be ok

But good news gas producers. The Japanese "Energiewende"* was to a large extent responsible for the super high gas prices we had to pay from 2012-2015, until partly rescued by US frackers.

ER the G4 closure was nothing to do with the court decision, that was as you even quote a month ago and a result of a technical glitch... maybe you could read the article too!

As nuclear power supplies about half of Ukraine's electricity shutting them down does not appear to be an option.

Why would they be declared to close by now... even the oldest was only brought online in 1981 and although they are coming up to the time they need their planned modernization to give them another 30 years life they are still fully good to go.

So the court ordered the closure of the plant solely on the fear that a repeat of Fukushima might contaminate the lake?

And yet America telling their puppet Kiev govt in Ukraine that the old nuclear plants in Ukraine are OK to keep functioning despite they were, pre Kiev takeover by USA, declared to close now.
