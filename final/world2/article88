Venezuela opposition begins campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a>’s opposition alliance has launched a campaign to oust President <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro">Nicolás Maduro</a>, vowing to hold protest rallies and push for both a recall referendum and constitutional amendment to end his presidency.</p>

<p> “Change is coming and no one can stop it,” the head of the Democratic Unity coalition, Jesús Torrealba, told a news conference.</p>

<p> Hungry for power after 17 years of socialist rule begun by the late Hugo Chávez, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/08/venezuelas-chavistas-and-newly-elected-opposition-head-for-deadlock">Venezuela’s opposition</a> capitalized on public ire over the crisis-hit economy to win control of the National Assembly legislature in December.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/18/venezuela-president-raises-fuel-price-by-1300-and-devalues-bolivar-to-tackle-crisis">Venezuela president raises fuel price by 6,000% and devalues bolivar to tackle crisis</a> </p>

<p> Now it is counting on a multi-pronged attack against Chavez’s successor to bring him down halfway through his six-year term in the South American Opec member nation.</p>

<p> Reading a communique from the coalition, Torrealba said its more than two dozen parties had decided unanimously to activate “all the mechanisms for change” in Venezuela’s constitution in search of a “national unity government”.</p>

<p> Despite the show of unity, however, the coalition is notoriously fractious, with a moderate wing led by two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles and a more radical side headed by jailed protest leader Leopoldo López.</p>

<p> Removing Maduro will be difficult because the government can count on friendly electoral and judicial institutions to help it frustrate opposition plans with delaying or blocking tactics.</p>

<p> Government figures have condemned the opposition’s plans as a US-backed attempt to bring about a coup d’état in the nation of 29 million people with the world’s largest oil reserves.</p>

<p> “They want to organize street rallies to generate violence and bring about a coup, supported by US imperialism,” the Socialist party’s powerful No 2 and former National Assembly head, Diosdado Cabello, said this week.</p>

<p> The opposition promised to begin street rallies from Saturday in Caracas.</p>

<p> Activists will, however, be wary of repeating the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/12/amid-violence-against-protesters-venezuela-to-face-us-sanctions">experience of 2014</a> when anti-Maduro protests turned violent, leading to the death of 43 people on both sides, hundreds of injuries, thousands of arrests, and widespread damage to the economy.</p>

<p> That push, led by opposition hardliners, did not win significant support from Venezuela’s poor majority and arguably strengthened Maduro by enabling him to show a strong hand.</p>

<p> Two years on, however, public fury is high and small protests are breaking out daily over food and medicine shortages, power and water cuts, and transport price rises.</p>

<p> Masked youths faced off with police on Monday evening in the volatile western city of San Cristobal, which saw the first and most violent of the 2014 clashes.</p>

<p> Capriles is backing a recall referendum, as allowed under Venezuela’s constitution halfway through a presidential term, and has already begun campaigning for it across the country.</p>

<p> Under the constitutional terms for the plebiscite, the opposition would need to collect 3.9m signatures in three days, ratified by the national electoral board, to trigger a referendum three months later. The number who vote against Maduro would need to be more than the 7.5 million who backed him in the 2013 presidential election.</p>

<p> If authorities delay such a vote into 2017, then Maduro’s vice-president would be allowed to complete his term, thus thwarting the opposition’s desire to take power.</p>

<p> The other mechanism sought by the opposition coalition is a constitutional amendment to cut Maduro’s term. That could be requested either by the National Assembly or 2.9 million voters, clearing the way for a referendum.</p>

<p> But Venezuela’s supreme court, which has backed the government against the opposition-controlled congress in a slew of recent controversial rulings, may shoot down any attempt to reduce the current presidential term as unconstitutional. <br/></p>

The Venezuelan government under both Chavez and Maduro implemented policies based solely on ideology rather than real life consequences. From currency controls which limited investment; price controls which resulted producers not producing due to losses if they did and smuggling; massive money printing which drove inflation to 720%; putting incompetent politicians in important institutions; not investing in increasing oil production which decreased between 2000 and 2013. As another commenter stated their economic performance resembles Mugabe more and more.

No, no names ,just rumors…..the 18 farms the ex-presidents family own? The ex president of the national assemblies share in a tuna monopoly & The a very large shopping Mall in Caracas,etcetcetc, which is all fine and dandy but somewhat odd if you consider what should be their normal income and what they owned prior to being leading figures in the government. The ex head of the state oil company and the treasurer of the same company under international scrutiny, the 1st lady's nephews on trail in New York for supposedly trying to smuggle 800 kg. of cocaine on a plane piloted by a member of the " casa militar", A General sought by the DEA, the briefcase scandal of a Mr. Antonini taking $800.000. in cash to Argentina for an illegal campaign contribution to Mrs. Krischner in a jet owned by the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, the state jails run by armed inmates…The whole state of affairs really has nothing to do with what ones political point of view is, it is a question of morals. ….. it's a long list and if by chance you happen to live there you are well aware of the situation with the Boliboys and all their obvious wealth acquired rather suddenly. Venezuela with it's abundant natural resources such as OIL, ALUMINUM,GOLD,URANIUM,DIAMONDS,BAUXITE,CACAO,and many other valuable commodities has no need of being in the very precarious financial situation it is in. having honest good management. You state that the country is not broke than why does the current president continually borrow or try to borrow from the chinese and other nations? Why is their a critical food shortage and a medical crises? Why have so many industries had to close down, why has the agricultural infrastructure suffered to such a degree that normal food staples such as milk,rice,sugar,coffee,butter, and many other products are almost impossible to locate? In what prior government were huge cues formed to try and acquire these food staples? Are these positive references for a political system which has been managing (?) the economy with total control for the past 17 + years? You assume that for being aware of what I have mentioned that one is from some political movement opposed to the current government …WRONG, just your average person living a day to day existence aware of the chaotic shamble that the once 6th most wealthy nation on planet earth is in. Your political inclinations are your choice and I assume you have reasons to defend them. This is a moral issue.

WRONG,not aliened with any political group or gang, just your average Joe walking around and seeing the state of affairs: food shortages and giant cues as never before in the attempt to acquire items such as milk,rice,sugar,coffee,butter,eggs not to forget other exotica like soap and toilet paper and forget tires or a battery AND to add to the glories of the governments success record it has become VERY difficult to find medicine in what was once in the "past" the 6th wealthiest nation on planet earth and with no international debts…..wha happen man???? The government(?) has had almost total power of decisions for 17+ years ( thats also part of the past), and if the economy is so buoyant what is the head of state doing traveling around the globe ( with 100 + guests) borrowing (more) money from the chinese and any other nation courageous or wild enough to keep lending? As far as credibility goes take a look at the Boliboys and other accomplices….it's just so obvious. As far as names are concerned the list is long and maybe the DEA or interpol or the Hague could zero in on that better than I can…the streets talk. I really don't give any importance to what might be you political inclination although it seems a bit obvious/ any advantages maybe?? Again my point of view is not political, it's moral.

Even though you will not have an answer, I'll still ask you how "monopoly capitalism" applies to Venezuela? You are kdding right? It applies to the entire world and domiates everything through currency markets, banks multinationals etc etc etc etc etc - and in the case of Venezuela with the additional influence of the CIA. Venezuela is hardly out of the world orbit - in fact the US considers it to be part of the back yard.

You don't like Cuba - kind of places you on the spectrum - total reactionary and part of the problem. It is all of capitalism that is collapsing (see bank rate in the negative zone almost anywhere you look - profit can no longer be made) and Polar or whatever your want to go on about is part of it - the entire world is going down and all capitalists like you with it.

Maduro happens to be somewhat of an idiot. This meant the sheer amount of people voting against the PSUV was a surprise. They had a plan to cheat by stuffing ballots in key contested districts. The plan was blocked using radio interference to block their communications. Because the communications devices the regime was trying to use were illegal, they couldn't do much about it, the ballot stuffing failed.

The 6 billion to be paid to the Chinese this year is cash not oil. But even if it was to be paid in oil, it would still reduce the income of the government by the said amount. It is immaterial how it is to be paid it is 6 billion that will be unavailable to the government. As for the budget the government stated the amount in dollars if it makes you any happier it is 1.5 trillion bolivars. But that does not change the fact that it is money they don't have.
