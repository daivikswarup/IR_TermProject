<p><strong>Yuuki, 26</strong></p>

<p>At 2.46pm on 11 March 2011:<strong> Student, Tokyo</strong></p>

<p>I was in Tokyo when the earthquake struck, midway through an information session that continued despite windows starting to shake and everyone hearing huge noises. People told us how safe the building was, but when we left , those from other floors had already escaped much earlier and were wearing helmets. <br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/10/the-faces-of-japans-tsunami-disaster-survivors-five-years-on">After Fukushima: faces from Japan's tsunami tragedy, five years on</a> </p>

<p>What was to come was the loneliest night of my life.</p>

<p>I remember seeing two office workers tackle eachother to get a taxi (probably because they were late for a meeting or something) as I walked to Tokyo station and there were many trying to buy as much as they could to stay overnight at their offices.<br/></p>

<p>At the time, I didn’t know the tsunami had already taken many lives. I saw a big explosion on a TV at the station, and it was the first time I realized that this was serious.</p>

<p>Twitter was the only way I could get more information, and I went to a hotel in Shinbashi which had become a shelter for the night. There were many people in the lobby already, sitting down on the floor and drinking hot tea. I found a spot and talked with people around me, looking on a map to make sure we knew where we were and whether any of us were able to walk home. <br/></p>

<p>After that, some people said one metro line had started up again, so I left the hotel to go to my university around 10pm – there were still many small earthquakes happening. At first, when I arrived, there were many students around so I felt relieved, but even here in Tokyo there were big cracks on the walls and I heard how some buildings were still dangerous. I was talking to friends on Twitter and one of them living near told me to come stay at her place, kindly. We watched TV news together and were shocked to see footage of the tsunami for the first time. We cried and couldn’t sleep at all. <br/></p>

<p>I still clearly remember when the sun rose and it felt safer somehow. <br/></p>

<p>Now: <strong>Film sales agent, Tokyo</strong></p>

<p>Two years later, I joined a government initiative called the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://sv2.jice.org/kizuna/e/what/about/">Kizuna project</a>, which sent 60 young people to the US for six months to pass on their experiences. We had many discussions, passing stories between us : some members had lost their houses because of tsunami, and a boy said some pigs had died in front of his house. </p>

<p>We organized events hoping to raise people’s awareness and to try to improve knowledge of how people can improve their safety in disasters. <br/></p>

<p> I got an internship at a Japanese film festival in Los Angeles, selecting films, and we showed a film about March 11th called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2012/03/09/films/film-reviews/ridley-scott-wants-your-home-movies-for-crowd-sourced-311-tribute-doc/#.Vt8FA854X9J">Japan in a Day</a>, which had a strong message but quite a hopeful tone. Some members of the audience were crying and even the projectionist said he liked the film a lot: I thought my time in the US would have been worth it even just for organizing this screening.</p>

<p><strong>Jon Wilks</strong></p>

<p>Then:<strong> Editor, TimeOut Tokyo</strong></p>

<p> When the earthquake that triggered the tsunami struck, I dived under the desk and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.digcontent.com/previous-publications/tohoku-earthquake-live-blog-shaking-building/">started live-blogging the experience</a>. <br/></p>

<p>My distinct memory of the earthquake itself was that it terrified my Japanese colleagues. They experience earthquakes all the time, but you could see how different this one was by the looks on their faces. All of their childhood earthquake training went out of the window. They just turned and ran outside. <br/></p>

<p>I also remember the first aftershock, within half an hour of the initial quake. I heard it coming: the earth audibly groaned and my Mac started sliding off the desk. We had what seemed like hundreds of aftershocks in the following weeks. I remember sleeping in the living room with the whole family. My kids slept between my wife and I so that we could lie over them the second a tremor hit, protecting them from anything that might collapse. <br/></p>

<p>We turned the online publication of the magazine away from entertainment (naturally) and for a month kept people up to date on how to help, which trains were working and how to deal with the craziness in the period afterwards.</p>

<p>Now:<strong> Content Strategist, Hampshire, UK</strong></p>

<p>My family and I moved from Tokyo to London when rumours began to surface that a child in a neighbouring school to my son’s was found to have traces of radiation in his urine. It didn’t seem worth taking the risk. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Yohei Koyama</strong></p>

<p>Then:<strong> Home in Shimogo-machi, Fukushima</strong><br/></p>

<p>I experienced the earthquake in my hometown of Shimogo-machi, Fukushima Prefecture. The quake alone was severe enough to make me feel panicked despite being quite used to earthquakes , but for me more traumatic was the nuclear accident. When I saw the explosion at the first reactor building , broadcast almost live in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima">Fukushima</a> on local TV, I remembered Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <br/></p>

<p> Because of the number of strong aftershocks that continued to occur for many months, things became traumatic. I experienced a strange sense of motion – as if always experiencing an earthquake when there isn’t one: it is called <em>jishin-yoi</em> (earthquake sickness) .</p>

<p>When I saw people fleeing the country on television, I felt alone and isolated. There was a severe petrol shortage in the aftermath and I couldn’t go anywhere. When my friends abroad insisted I should flee Fukushima, I was annoyed – how could I just flee, leaving my friends and family behind?</p>

<p>Now:<strong> <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff92184.php">PhD student</a>, London</strong></p>

<p>So much has happened and so much has changed in Fukushima since 2011. Now television stations and newspapers report ‘today’s background radiation level’ of each municipality every day, and a number of radiological monitors show radiation levels in real time. <br/></p>

<p>Food produced in Fukushima is screened for radiation contamination and sold with a sign stating it has been “screened”. Also, people do talk about radiation – in fact some of them even make jokes. When invisible radiation is visualised and verbalised, it becomes a part of everyday life as well as a continual reminder of the presence of the nuclear crisis. I think many local residents still find themselves stuck in the midst of this, as if the time in Fukushima has been at a standstill since March 2011. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Ginny Takemori</strong></p>

<p>Then: <strong>Freelance literary translator, Tsukuba, Ibaraki</strong></p>

<p>I was working in my third-floor apartment in Tsukuba, a town 60km north-east of Tokyo. I spent the five minutes of intense shaking holding onto my computer monitor, unable to let go as my desk was pushing out from the wall into my stomach, and listening to things crashing to the floor in my kitchen. As soon as the shaking subsided enough to stand, I ran out of the apartment to find a lot of my neighbours already outside. I ran back upstairs to get my phone to find out details of the quake. We all assumed it was Tokyo, and were shocked to find out it was up north. <br/></p>

<p>Together we watched the building shaking and swaying in the subsequent aftershocks. One neighbour turned on her car radio, and we heard something about a tsunami – it said seven metres, and I remember looking up at the apartment, thinking: ‘about <em>that</em> height!’ My husband came back from work to check on me, and together we drove back to the university to help evacuate students, before driving through pitch black roads to my parents-in-law’s place to check on them. <br/></p>

<p>It was only then that I thought to check my email and saw panicked messages from all over the world. That was the first real inkling I had that it was a major disaster. We walked into the house about 9pm, and were totally shocked to see the images of the tsunami on TV. For the next week I accompanied my husband into the university to help out with translation material in the emergency room We were showering as soon as we returned home because of the radiation scare.<br/></p>

<p>My husband is a physicist and my father-in-law, now long retired, was an anti-seismic specialist in nuclear plant construction, so they were trying to get as much information on the situation in Fukushima as they could. I found it impossible to focus on my work when reality was far stranger than fiction, with strong aftershocks and the ongoing nuclear situation.</p>

<p>We first went up to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jan/27/ishinomaki-new-communities-tsunami-loss-japan">Ishinomaki, Miyagi prefecture</a>, at the end of June to volunteer, digging mud out of ditches. <br/></p>

<p>I remember the devastation was shocking. Cars, trucks, boats and even railway carriages were scattered everywhere, some jammed between or even inside houses. The stench was overpowering: silt flung up from the ocean floor, mixed with rotting fish and worse. The air was thick with swarms of black flies. Yet people were living here – fresh laundry hung on the balconies of damaged houses.</p>

<p>That year we like many made multiple trips, sometimes filling our car with fresh vegetables to distribute to people when we heard they hadn’t had anything fresh to eat since the disaster. We got to know many survivors , and have been recording their stories. We still go up as often as we can, and we keep in touch with many people there. I feel privileged to have come to know so many interesting brave people in Ishinomaki and Oshika Peninsula who I would never normally have had the opportunity to get to know.</p>

<p>Now:<strong> Freelance literary translator, still in Tsukuba</strong> </p>

<p>Normally I stop whatever I’m doing at 2.46pm on 11 March to light a candle and spend some time quietly remembering. This year I will be at an event in Tokyo, so the candle will be image on my phone, but I will still take a minute or so to reflect.</p>

<p><strong>Cody B</strong></p>

<p>Then: <strong>Yokosuka naval base</strong><br/></p>

<p>I was in Yokosuka when the earthquake first began, working a day shift watch at the naval base. When the shaking first began, we thought it would shortly end, but after about a minute we realized the intensity had increased. Everyone evacuated the building and went outside. I laid on a hillside for nearly five minutes as the ground shook, and I could see the buildings in town swaying violently. I was shocked that nothing collapsed in that time – Japanese infrastructure is very impressive. <br/></p>

<p>Once the quake stopped we tried to leave the base to see if there was anyone in town we could help, but they closed the facility – no one on or off except returning military.</p>

<p>We were ordered to our respective ships shortly after. As I approached ‘Destroyer Row’ on Yokosuka, I could tell the water levels were dropping in the harbor. All the mooring lines connecting the ships to shore were under intense stress. <br/></p>

<p>The tsunami warning came very quickly, and while nothing hit the greater Tokyo area, we knew that disaster had struck. Within two hours we were preparing to depart Yokosuka and immediately began a transit north in order to provide humanitarian relief. I can still remember the things and people that were littered on the surface of the water. While smoking a cigarette one evening, our ship passed by an entire home, completely intact, floating in the middle of open ocean. </p>

<p>Now: <strong>Cleveland, USA</strong></p>

<p>I no longer serve but get an annual screening due to the radiation emitted from Fukishima through the Veterans Association, but no illness has been noted as of yet. I pray for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a> every day and I pray for the people we could not save.</p>

<p><strong>Basil, 29</strong></p>

<p>Then:<strong> Master’s student in Aramachi, Sendai</strong></p>

<p>My friends and I rushed to the doorway separating the bedroom and kitchen in my apartment and held on to each other until the earthquake subsided. It felt like an eternity passed before the shaking stopped.</p>

<p>By then the bowl of noodles I had made for lunch had been tossed to the ground in a fit of panic and the kitchen and living room transformed into a complete mess – with bookshelves face down on the floor and plates, cutlery and rubbish scattered around. The worst was over – so we thought.</p>

<p>Stepping outside brought us face to face with holes in streets that had swallowed cars, fissures and cracks running up and down what once seemed like the most solid and earthquake-resilient structures. <br/></p>

<p>The first idea that came to mind was to find a park, but to get to the nearest one meant going through crowded suburban areas surrounded by tall buildings. Instead we went to the banks of the Hirose river, a place I knew well. A few minutes after we arrived a large aftershock occurred – and dozens more were to follow.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/five-years-after-japans-tsunami-orphan-victims-lament-their-lost-parents">Five years after Japan's tsunami, orphan victims lament their lost parents</a> </p>

<p>Little did we know that by this time approximately 500 lives had been lost in my ward, Wakabayashi-ku. I was told later a raised highway had acted as an artificial levy, stopping the tsunami from making its way up to Aramachi and my apartment via the Hirose river, where we had initially sought safety. <br/></p>

<p>We wandered the streets for the next hour or so, before meeting my Japanese roommate back at my apartment. </p>

<p>The day seemed inert, as many of the shopkeepers and neighbours, many of whom were good friends of mine, littered the streets in silent congregation. Communications were down, but, recalling signs I had passed many times on my way to university, I decided to approach the nearest elementary school – a designated evacuation site via a packed convenience store where we managed to get hold of a large bag of rice crackers and a bottle of whiskey. There was already some panic about food shortages.</p>

<p>By the time night fell there were 3-400 people on the gym floor: we were told not to flush toilets as there was no running water, and volunteers organised themselves as we learned about a nearby Chinese restaurant that was dispensing plastic containers of rice for those willing to line up for some hot food – a rarity that did not go unappreciated. </p>

<p>I stayed in Sendai for about a week, then managed to leave for Niigata, and from there flew to Osaka and Naha, Okinawa, to stay with an old friend. In Okinawa I raised money for the victims by busking, donating to a special Japanese Red Cross fund.<em><br/></em></p>

<p>Now:<strong> Doctoral candidate and academic, Melbourne.</strong></p>

<p>The natural disaster and nuclear meltdown made me a more resilient and sympathetic human being. Instead of worrying solely about the well-being of friends and family, I began to pay more attention to various types of suffering that arise in extreme and trying circumstances.</p>

<p>I left Japan only a year or so after the earthquake and tsunami. </p>

<p><strong>Mutsumi Matsugu</strong></p>

<p>Then: <strong>With family in Tokyo </strong><br/></p>

<p>I was in my 14th floor apartment with my dad and dog in Tokyo. We went downstairs and evacuated to the grounds of a school in front of my home. We felt many earthquakes and aftershocks there, and I couldn’t call or email my family or co-workers to check on their safety for the next few hours.</p>

<p>Now:<strong> Children’s education business franchisee, California</strong></p>

<p>Like many small businesses we struggled after the earthquake, so I work in California now, and I worry about my family in Tokyo. I am afraid Tokyo will have an earthquake again in the near future, but it still has many tall buildings and is redeveloping for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.</p>

<p>I wonder why the Japanese government does not say much about the radiation around Fukushima anymore. I think radiation will affect our country deeply. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Sam Keene</strong></p>

<p>Then:<strong> Teacher, Tokyo <br/></strong></p>

<p>The quake hit as we were preparing to dismiss the children at the British School where I worked in Tokyo. I taught nursery classes, so the children were only three. We had performed numerous drills throughout the year but still they amazed us with their fast response: the children went straight under the tables calmly and silently while my assistant and I stood in the doorframe.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/japan-fifth-anniversary-tsunami-nuclear-disaster">Japan marks fifth anniversary of tsunami and nuclear disaster</a> </p>

<p>The initial shake felt as though it would never stop. My assistant hugged me as we rocked and we sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to keep the children calm. Many of the parents were on the way and stuck in traffic, and gradually arrived to collect their children amid numerous aftershocks. We began getting accounts of what was unveiling further north: friends with families in the area became more and more anxious.</p>

<p>The last child in our school left at around 9.30pm – in our secondary school it was well after midnight. We walked home through the aftershocks. It was surreal walking along streets normally packed with traffic but now packed with people, shoulder to shoulder, picking their way home. <br/></p>

<p>In the following days we grew more and more scared. Eventually we decided to evacuate to Singapore. We arrived at the airport at 4.00am. There were thousands of people waiting to try to get on flights. We were lucky. We were ‘<em>gaijin</em>’ (foreigners) and thus had the freedom to leave. There was a large aftershock while we awaited our flight and we all just held hands. A lifelong nervous flyer, I have never been so grateful to leave terra firma. <br/></p>

<p>Life went back to normal in Tokyo. Our school reopened and we were called back to work. I had a very difficult time following my experience and could not settle back into my life in Japan. I eventually left to return to England at the end of the school year. <br/></p>

<p>Now:<strong> Department head, Milan</strong></p>

<p>I would still be living in Tokyo if it weren’t for the quake. I loved that city and have never felt so at home. I often think of my friends who lost whole extended families. </p>

<p>My partner and I will have a Japanese meal on the 11th as has become our tradition. I will contact the parents of the children in my class, many of whom I am still in contact with and send them my thoughts and hugs. <br/></p>

<p><strong>Michael King</strong></p>

<p>Then:<strong> Teacher on the JET program in Fukui</strong></p>

<p>The whole teachers’ room at the elementary school where I worked just stopped as we saw what was happening on live TV, and I then spent the afternoon figuring out how I could fundraise to take a truck up there.</p>

<p>I was based in Fukui, near Kyoto, working on the government’s JET program and running a volunteer group visiting kids in residential care, and my connections led me to Sendai about two weeks later. I drove up with a 2.5 tonne truck of supplies – and shortly after, moved there. My charity work became my full time job, focussing on raising money for child welfare institutions. <br/></p>

<p>The immediate aftermath was the most challenging for me, working with kids who had lost parents, and those in emergency shelters.</p>

<p>In a way being an outsider meant people could tell me things they were at times less comfortable sharing with others in the shelter. The most humbling encounter was with a 15-year-old who told me how lucky she was her mother and brother were able to be properly cremated, whereas so many other people had to buried to be disinterred at a later date. It was staggering how she could find a positive to hold on to.</p>

<p>Now: <strong>DPhil candidate, University of Oxford</strong></p>

<p>I have changed path and now study foster care in Japan, advising the ministry and politicians on current reforms to the child welfare act, and have been invited to meet and speak with the emperor and empress of Japan.</p>

<p>I plan to mark the 11th with some time to myself down by the sea. I have a lot of photos of the events so will probably look through these again.</p>

I'm co-cordinator of the Learner Development Special Interest Group of the Japan Association for Language Teaching and an Assistant Professor of English. My group worked with a small group of English students across Japan to translate reflections written one year after 3.11 by junior high school students who survived the disaster. Amazingly, although their school was only a few meters from the sea everyone managed to evacuate in time, although most lost their houses and some lost family members. Their reflections often recount the gratitude and bonds that helped them overcome tragedy. We produced a web page to share some of the reflections, which can be found at http://lookingback311.wix.com/start

As was my custom I had NHK (Japan's BBC equivalent - only less corrupt) running in the background as I worked late into the evening (east coast, US). The earthquake detection and alerting system in Japan is so efficient that the warning flashed upon the screen before the first tremor was felt, with the Tsunami alert following. I watched, in horror, live images from the coastline, Tokyo downtown, and eventually the Fukushima plant. No sleep, but tears, and a desire to be there and do something to help filled my heart.

Try thousands of years! Japan will never recover from this disaster in a very short time they will have to abandon the country!!! Three nuclear cores are still cooking and the fuel pools that HAVEN'T been cleaned up could wipe the planet in one fell swoop!! Check with Fairwind and Arnie Gundersen!!! Ongoing nightmare that is probably the death knell for mankind! Oh and don't forget WIPP in new mexico still spewing !!!

You might want to consider how scary it was for foreigners who found themselves stuck wherever they were when the quake started with absolutely no information to help them. As soon as the disaster happened there was no announcements in foreign languages where I was, it was all in Japanese which was useless and the lack of information was certainly disconcerting to say the least.

TixhiiDon, what you may fail to realize is those in Yokosuka were almost immediately boarded aboard ships which then sailed through the easterly winds from Fukushima, en route to provide aid/assistance to the areas around Sendai.

Tokyo didn't really get much damage. My biggest hardship was a 4 hour walk home, but it was heartwarming to see folks cooperating. Apartment buildings with notices inviting those in need to use their toilets, etc. My wife brought 3 complete strangers home from shopping & we fed them and lent a bicycle to one - which was duly returned the next day with a box of cookies as a thank you. Nobody fighting for a taxi on my route- anyway traffic was totally gridlocked & walking was faster.

Other coutries' broadcasts often say how dangerous the Nuclear Plant is. Truly the plant polluted the Fukushima area and harsh environment still continue.but, I think it's a little bit overreaction to the fear of the plant's accident. That caused people there to save electricity though.

Fortunately, of course, but there's very much an element among foreigners who were in Japan on that day of over-dramatizing - you can see it clearly in some of the posts on this thread - as if they were rather pleased with themselves at having lived through a disaster, while in fact being hundreds of kilometers away from the real tragedy. They seem to be enjoying themselves, dining out on their anecdotes, rather too much for my liking.

Only last week, Naoto Kan, the then-prime minister, admitted that the Head of Nuclear Safety was entirely unqualified for the role. He was an economist rather than a physicist. Lots of ridiculous decisions were made, by the looks of things, starting with the idea to build a nuclear power station on the shore - as you say.

I was just boarding a train in a subway station when it started. The doors closed and everyone was fairly calm until it started getting worse. When the locals look nervous you know something is wrong. After what seemed an age the doors opened and people streamed off of train and towards the exit. No one ran - but we did all walk at a brisk pace.

My heart goes out to the Japanese people .....however i have often wondered since the quake how it is that the people in charge of nuclear stations there decided that the sea shore would be a good location for a nuclear facility, ...this in a country that invented the word 'tsunami'?

There are lots of stories in English from people who lived in Tohoku over at Asahi Shinbun http://ajw.asahi.com/category/0311disaster/

Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, most expats live in Tokyo or further south. Expect more stories to be told when the southern fault line (the nankai trough) goes off. That whole coast is so built up the damage will be terrible to see

I was more devastated by the nuclear accident than the quake and tsunami, I am afraid I had to say, and my immediate thought was how my parents might have felt when they realized the defeat at the end of WWII. (What I learned later was feeling like this was not uncommon among people of my generation, baby boomers.) I knew our system was flawed but not this flawed; I thought it was at least better than the Soviet Union which brought about the Chernobyl. Betrayed I found myself cursing Japan, all those people saying "This is a natural disaster beyond our imagination, so no one's responsible. Now fortified (within our restrained imagination), we can bring back the nuclear plants."

I absolutely agree, and I came below the line to write exactly the same thing. I was in Tokyo and, scary though it was, not even a cup smashed. Former American squaddies talking about getting radiation checks every year because they were in Yokosuka - even further away from Tohoku than Tokyo - are cheapening the truly tragic experiences of those hit by the tsunami.

It will take longer than that. There are still many square kilometres outside the plant where radiation exceeds 100mSv per year.

They will be cleaning up Fukishima for another 30-40 years according to the scientists and engineers involved. So much for safe, cheap energy.

My train was pulling in at the station before my stop, BANG. It was if someone had given us an almighty kick up the backside, the train slammed to a halt and rocked violently. The emergency breaking system certainly worked. Only yet half way a long the platform the conductor didn't want to open the doors, but we quickly persuaded him, once we were able to stand, to open those doors that were at safe to exit from. Still rocking, and difficult to walk I grabbed a steel strut that was one of many that held the roof up. It was rotating in a circle, it was an odd sensation, that which you view every day as solid, immovable, strong, moving as if made of rubber. On the phone already, I was speaking to my partner, who was under their desk at work, I could hear the smashes and bangs and wallops of things falling around them. First question, calm, almost normal: Where are the children? On the kindergarten bus by now? "Yes," came the answer. It was the longest wait to 3:15 ever, but arrive the bus did. That evening, with the power gone the silence and dark were a bizarre phenomena to observe in a city so usually blazing with neon. The toppled bicycle wheels gently spinning in the wind sounded like a storm. Then, well... The real fun began. Which way was the wind blowing? Time to get out. And so we left, taking one last look at a home we loved, believing that may well be the last we'd see of it.

I was in Yokohama preparing to pick the kids up from school at 3pm when it hit. Many people dont know but there was a foreshock 2 days before, that Wednesday, at almost exactly the same time. This made me think the Friday earthquake was similar, until about a minute in. It was like the washing machine switched to spin cycle at about 1 minute in. That really scared me since that was the time the Wed. quake actually finished. This one, instead, upped in intensity by multiple factors. The building went from swaying side to side to jumping up and down.

Yes. To me the great surprise was stepping out from our building afterwards into a beautiful spring afternoon and seeing someone clutching a freshly-bought starbucks. I couldn't believe that life could look so normal.

Compared to other articles about focusing on Tsunami or the Nuclear Plant, this arctile reminds me of what acctually happened there in east part of Japan.

Thanks greenapple: we're trying to reach and tell the stories of as many as possible. Our reporter was in Tohoku meeting people for this story, also published today: After Fukushima: faces from Japan's tsunami tragedy, five years on

Good article but would be nice to see how if affected peoples' lives who weren't in such privileged positions (educationally/career wise). I don't mean that as a slur. This must have been an unbearable situation for all but it would be interesting to read about those who lost everything. How did they cope and where are they now?

Each person had different experience in that day and it is interesting to know about it, but please share more stories of the people from Tohoku area where actually hit by Tsunami. Their stories are more powerful and terrifying. I was also in Tokyo when the earthquake hit but just experiencing strong earthquake in Tokyo is nothing comparing their earthquake and tsunami experience. This is just what I felt right after I knew about the tsunami.
