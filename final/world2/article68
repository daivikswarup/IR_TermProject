<p>The barred Peruvian presidential candidate Julio Guzmán has vowed to fight his disqualification by the country’s electoral tribunal alleging corruption and influence-peddling by the Peruvian authorities.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.jne.gob.pe/">National Jury of Elections</a> rejected an appeal by Guzmán’s political party <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://todosporelperu.pe/">Todos Por el Perú</a> on Wednesday, and excluded the 45-year-old economist from the race because of a technical error in the registration of his candidacy.<br/></p>

<p>Guzmán has said he would “appeal, appeal, appeal” the controversial decision which has sparked uncertainty just a month before the election on 10 April.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Guardian, Guzmán accused the electoral body of inconsistency, “changing its mind in a matter of days”. It had initially forgiven the technical error but then opted to bar him when he surged in the polls to second place and was seen as the only candidate capable of defeating frontrunner Keiko Fujimori in a run-off vote on 5 June. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Fujimori, who polls indicate has around one-third of the vote, is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/08/comandante-first-lady-peru-election">the daughter of former president Alberto Fujimori</a>, who was jailed in 2009 for human rights abuses and corruption during his decade in power from 1990 to 2000.<br/></p>

<p>Guzmán, a former vice-minister and Inter-American Development Bank economist, said recent information uncovered by journalistic investigations revealed three other political parties had “committed exactly the same errors” but were not excluded.<br/></p>

<p>“That asymmetry, that disproportion in applying the law is outrageous and it shows something really wrong is happening,” he said. He said his party would present a fresh legal appeal with the authorities.<br/></p>

<p>Guzmán suggested that vested interests, including organised crime, were attempting to influence the democratic interest. </p>

<p>“There are billions of dollars involved in this electoral process,” he said. “We shouldn’t be naive.”</p>

<p>Guzmán, who has a PhD in public policy from Georgetown University in Washington DC, presents himself as a political outsider with the professional background to combat corruption and put <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/peru">Peru</a> in order. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>A virtual unknown several months ago, Guzmán has surged in the polls on a tide of disaffection with better known politicians.<br/></p>

<p>In a presidential race dominated by familiar faces, his lack of political experience is an advantage over his rivals, he said.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>“These are the same guys as 30 years ago and their experience has not served to resolve most of the problems in Peru. Corruption is everywhere. The quality of education in Peru is one of the lowest in the world. The health system doesn’t work,” he said.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>The 11th of 12 children born in Lima to parents who migrated from the poor Andes mountains, Guzmán worked from the age of 15 and paid his way through his university education. <br/></p>

<p>“My story is about fighting, fighting, fighting all the time; being persistent in spite of a society which is not fair with you,” he said.</p>

<p> “So I think it’s not only my message but my personal story which connects with people because most Peruvians are struggling with the same issues.”</p>

Peru has a democratic dictatorship with Fisal/Justice and Election bodies controlled by the APRA party ie. ex-president Alan Garcia. There has been a witch hunt from the start of the preseidential race, eliminating any of the candidates that are high in the polls using the bought main stream press. No doubt that Keiko will now be on the receiving end and Alan Garcia will end up being president once again. The fantasy is that it looks like the country has voted, but the reality is that the system is corrupted in favour of one candiate.
