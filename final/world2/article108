Tycoon Vijay Mallya denies fleeing India over billion-dollar debt




DateTime::::2016-03-11T02:54:23+0000



<p>Indian liquor baron Vijay Mallya, who <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/indian-drinks-mogul-vijay-mallya-leaves-country-owing-1bn">left the country</a> as he faced pressure from banks to repay more than US$1bn (£700m) owed by his collapsed airline, has denied charges he was an absconder and said he respected the law of the land.</p>

<p>“I did not flee from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a> and neither am I an absconder“, Mallya said in a series of tweets posted on Friday.</p>

<p> Mallya also said that as a member of parliament he would fully comply with the law.</p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">I am an international businessman. I travel to and from India frequently. I did not flee from India and neither am I an absconder. Rubbish.</p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">As an Indian MP I fully respect and will comply with the law of the land. Our judicial system is sound and respected. But no trial by media.</p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">Once a media witch hunt starts it escalates into a raging fire where truth and facts are burnt to ashes.</p>

<p> The Kingfisher baron left India last week, a lawyer for the lenders told the country’s top court on Thursday.</p>

<p>India’s finance minister has vowed to recover more than $1bn from the heavily indebted Mallya, as a political row erupted over his surprise departure.</p>

<p>Arun Jaitley told parliament that Mallya’s grounded <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/kingfisher-airlines">Kingfisher Airlines</a> owed a group of mostly state-run banks some 90 billion rupees ($1.34bn) in unpaid loans.</p>

<p>“The banks are taking all steps to recover every penny lent to him and they will recover it,” Jaitley said to jeers from opposition MPs.</p>

<p>“Before his passport could be seized, he had left the country,” the minister added.</p>

<p>The banks had asked the supreme court on Wednesday to prevent the 60-year-old quitting the country, but the attorney general said Mallya had already left on 2 March.</p>

<p>Mallya, who is thought to be in London, was given a $40m partial severance payment after stepping down last month as chairman of United Spirits, the Indian arm of Britain’s Diageo, following allegations of financial lapses.</p>

<p>The opposition Congress party demanded to know how Mallya was allowed to fly out when so many banks had taken legal action to try to claw back the debt.</p>

<p>“Why was Vijay Mallya not arrested?” Congress lawmaker Ghulam Nabi Azad asked in parliament.</p>

<p>The row risks embarrassing the Indian government and comes as state-run banks face growing pressure to step up recovery of a mountain of bad loans, which make them less able to lend to the corporate sector.</p>

<p>Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan has ordered the banks to clean up their balance sheets by next March in efforts to boost the country’s economic growth.</p>

<p>Jaitley sought to blame the opposition, saying a string of banks granted the loans during the previous Congress-led government’s time in power.</p>

<p>Mallya was known as the “King of Good Times” before the 2012 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/22/bad-times-vijay-mallya-kingfisher-airlines">collapse of his airline</a>, which left thousands of workers unemployed and millions of dollars in unpaid bills.</p>

<p>As his liquor business flourished during the early 2000s, he diversified into other areas and in 2005 launched Kingfisher Airlines, named after his company’s best-known beer.</p>

<p>Once nicknamed “India’s Richard Branson”, he also acquired a stake in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/force-india">Force India F1 team</a>. His fortune reached a peak of $1.6bn in 2007, according to Forbes.</p>

<p>But he was unable to stop Kingfisher from haemorrhaging cash and the airline was grounded in 2012 having never made a profit.</p>

Sorry, that should read: correctly equate things deemed "cool" to "fashion", but that doesn't make them "not naff" to some and "cool" to others.

I never said many Indians or others don't copy some of the "naff" fashion coming out of London (or India) :) Many of them incorrectly equate things artificially deemed "cool" to "fashion". Just that others may also find it so, like you do Mallya's earring. But there is a lot of great fashion coming out of London and Milan etc. (but also liberally influenced by many other cultures, like all pollinations).

As to why the Indian government was lending money to airlines I have no idea. Airlines are a terrible business, burning the money in a stove would be better value for the Indian taxpayer.

… "as long as you bring all your loot here" while saying at every opportunity that there's no country in the world that understands business better than Britain. That'll get you straight onto the Queen's award list (though it helps to spare a few pennies for whatever party is in power).

He spent £73 million buying then knocking together 2 properties on Cornwall Terrace, London then many millions more having them refurbished maybe that's why the airline never made a profit

Mallya has form on these dicey loans from very early in his career, probably from a sense of entitlement in having inherited so much.

Its not about shares. They are public sector banks which loan farmers money for farming equipment, seeds, etc. Right now Mallya's case included they are staring at massive NPAs given to douchebags like this - obviously banks are also equally to blame for this scam. When that happens the first thing they will do is tighten their requirements for the poorest while bleeding themselves dry for criminals like Mallya.

Hamilton is a young global sports superstar. Mallya is an old fat businessman who pissed away his fathers legacy. Bit of a difference.

Doubt the impoverished people of India own shares in the banks that lent him money.
