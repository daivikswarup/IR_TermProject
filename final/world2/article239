The Syrian refugee restaurateurs spicing up Armenian cuisine




DateTime::::2016-03-07T08:00:58+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>t his lahmajoon bistro in the centre of Yerevan, 28-year-old Gaidzak Jabakhtchurian is adding a layer of spiced meat paste to a dough base. Four years ago, Jabakhtchurian and his family left their two bakeries in Aleppo, home to many of Syria’s ethnic Armenians, and moved here to escape the fighting.</p>

<p>The Jabakhtchurians are among thousands of Syrian refugees in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/armenia">Armenia</a>, bringing with them new flavours and cooking styles to a country more accustomed to milder cuisine.</p>

<p>Lahmajoon (thin crust pizza with ground beef or lamb), spicy muhammara (hot pepper dip), fattoush (a green salad topped with pieces of pita bread), falafel and other Middle Eastern dishes are becoming increasingly popular, although they are often adapted to suit local tastes. </p>

<p> “We made our most famous lahmajoon less spicy,” said Jabakhtchurian. “We use our eight types of spices … but in Armenia we are quite mild.”</p>

<p>One lahmajoon, big on the beef, is named after the capital, Yerevan. Another, made with onions and lots of parsley, after the northern city of Gyumri. The bistro’s menu also features a yogurt soup based on one served by Jabakhtchurian’s grandmother at the start and end of winter.</p>

<p> “That brings back very warm memories to me,” he said.</p>

<p>Although lahmajoon is not new to Armenia, locals note a clear difference to the Aleppo variety.</p>

<p>“It was not until I ate a Syrian-Armenian lahmajoon that I first understood what that dish was supposed to be,” says Yerevan resident Gayane Bilbulian. “It is a really crazy mix of flavours.”</p>

<p>The UN’s Yerevan-based refugees coordinator, Anahit Hayrapetian, said the number of Middle Eastern restaurants in Armenia had increased significantly since the war started in 2011. Where once there was a only handful of establishments serving Middle Eastern food, now there are more than 50 in the capital. </p>

<p>“Syrian-Armenians [have been] encouraged by the fact that locals warmly welcomed the tastes and the smells [of their cuisine],” said Hayrapetian.</p>

<p>Kiosks across the city have also started offering Middle Eastern specialities, with some butchers now also selling halal meat prepared according to Islamic law.<br/></p>

<p>Chef Manushak Kirizian, a native of Aleppo, initially imported the spices necessary to season her traditional dishes from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a>. But as the war dragged on, she was forced to turn to Lebanon.</p>

<p>The chef then decided to set up her own restaurant in Yerevan’s downtown – something she says that, as a woman, she would never have been allowed to do in Aleppo. </p>

<p>Kirizian is now the head of a family-owned restaurant, called Liban. “It is a very unusual thing for our community, but we also are trying to overcome the difficulties and move forward step by step,” she said. </p>

<p>With multicoloured hookahs (smoking pipes) in the windows and Arabic music playing in the lobby, Liban – named after Lebanon – serves dishes such as kebab with cherry sauce, fusing the family’s traditional Syrian recipes with local ingredients.<br/> <br/>For Kirizian, the restaurant allows her family to maintain a link with its past yet equips them all for the future. “We lost everything, and now we are trying to bring our life back on its feet from nothing,” she said. “Today, Armenia is our home and we feel safe here.”</p>

<p><strong>For the dough</strong><br/> <br/>Two cups of warm water<br/> <br/>One tablespoon of dry instant active yeast<br/> <br/>Half a tablespoon of sugar<br/> <br/>Two tablespoons of olive oil<br/> <br/>Four cups of wheat flour<br/> <br/><strong>For the topping</strong><br/> <br/>600-700g of ground beef (preferably halal)<br/> <br/>Can of diced tomatoes with juice<br/> <br/>1 large onion, chopped<br/> <br/>5 garlic cloves, minced<br/> <br/>1 full tablespoon of tomato paste<br/> <br/>1 tablespoon of olive oil<br/> <br/>1 teaspoon of paprika<br/> <br/>Half a teaspoon of black pepper<br/> <br/>Salt, according to taste<br/> <br/>Parsley, according to taste<br/> <br/>Chilli, cumin and baharat, according to taste (optional)<br/> <br/>Mint, according to taste (optional)<br/> <br/><strong>Directions</strong><br/> <br/>Preheat the oven to 230C. (Or to 200C for a slightly softer crust.)<br/> <br/>Combine yeast and warm water and let stand for several minutes until frothy. Add to the flour, oil and sugar and combine to form a dough. It should have an elastic consistency. Moisten the dough with extra olive oil and cover. Let the dough rise for 40 minutes to one hour until it has doubled in size.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Combine all ingredients in a food processor and pulse briefly until a paste has formed. Alternatively, add the beef to the remaining ingredients in a bowl and combine by hand.<br/> <br/>Punch the dough down, and separate into about 20 fist-sized portions. Keep under a damp cloth.<br/> <br/>Roll out one lump of dough into a small, thin circle. <br/> <br/>Apply a thin layer of the topping to the edges of the dough. Place on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 10-15 minutes.<br/> <br/>Serve folded over or face-up, topped with juice from a slice of lemon.<br/> <br/>(Makes 20)</p>

Kosher salt is a very different thing, it refers to a sort of flaked salt and is a phrase used primarily in the US even though it's not 'kosher'.Halal is something very specific with meat having been slaughtered a particular way.

I understand your confusion. The author of this article has not clarified a simple fact. These Armenians refugees were not citizens of Armenia, or its predecessor Soviet Armenia. Armenians living in Syria are the remnants of Anatolian Armenians who were deported by the Ottoman Turkish authorities during the genocide in 1915.

I've worked in various catering businesses, and a restaurant. We used diamond crystal kosher salt. Had nothing to do with kosher, but rather the quality of the salt. If I was to write a recipe I would include 'preferably kosher salt' as a way to prevent someone from using some random super course or super fine mystery salt that adds an undesired flavor, or effect to the dish.

Considering it says preferably you are welcome to use whatever type of beef you like. You are not likely to find kosher or halal meat in Armenia (at least not intentionally, it's possible Armenian butchers were already producing meat that could be labeled halal). It's sort of like 'gluten free'. If your product was already gluten free you might opt to use that as a marketing ploy. I buy Hebrew national hot dogs because they use good good cuts of meat and the hot dog itself tastes great, but could care less that they are kosher.

I doubt it is halal, if you noticed, all the names of the refugees from Syria are Armenian, so likely to be Christian. I doubt anyone can tell the difference in taste between slaughtering methods. The main difference will be what the animal ate.

Traditional halal meat is killed by hand and must be blessed by the slaughterer. Islam has strict laws on the proper method of slaughtering an animal. One, called dhabihah, requires a swift, deep incision with a sharp knife on the neck that cuts the jugular vein.

once upon a time around 10th century AC an Armenian monk wrote on a cow hive somewhere in mountains that because the sun sets in the West then these Westerners will be always walking in the darkness, at first I didn't understood what in the hell he is talking about, but now after reading some of these comments I am back in the holy domain again

Syria's loss is Armenia's gain, especially the muhammara. I hhave always been impressed by Armenians. In Syria they were great contributors to cultural and economic life. After the war in Syria, the country will not just be economically impoverished but culturally impoverished as well because it will have lost so many intelligent and productive citizens. An interesting, positive and useful article.

Interesting that an Armenian that goes to Syria and then returns to Armenia is referred to as a Syrian Refugee. How many hours, days or months does a traveler have to stay in Syria to be referred to as a Syrian?

"transporting Western Armenian food culture to Eastern Armenia." ... well stated, that is precisely what this is, Western Armenian food is spiced differently than Eastern Armenian food . . . although what is left of historic Armenia is the equivalent of New England to the rest of the continental US, the diaspora is large and has well-preserved the Western Armenian dishes that are very similar to Anatolian Turkish dishes, since we lived on the same peninsula for about 800 years

I personally find your comment trite and rather with a whiff of offence. I have only (only) been subject to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. I remained unscathed, though a number of Kuwaitis lost their lives. Leaving personal issues aside, I have encountered Syrians in Egypt and in Turkey in the last two years, working in the hospitality industry and doing a good job. Foremost they are rebuilding their lives and doing something constructive. The fact that people, be they Ugandan Asians or whoever is not leaching the taxpayer and working to rebuild a future, I believe should be something to be congratulated and celebrated, rather than sneered at. There are precious few uplifting stories coming from the region in the last five years.

I think no typo... just that the end result of the method of slaughter contains less blood, so if one grows up getting used to a particular taste, that becomes 'normal.' Nothing to do with how anyone prays or where one confesses. Since the 1916 Armenian diaspora, clearly large numbers have settled in surrounding countries and subsequent generations have spread further in the Gulf having acquired Arabic amongst other languages. Consequently, many have also become acquainted with local dishes as well. Since 1991 many Armenians have retired back to Yerevan and elsewhere in the modern Armenia, but food is culture and so there is a two-way process that is ongoing. Not just Armenia/Arab world, but all over the globe.

I would hazard a guess that as these Armenians came from Syria, they got used to the way meat was prepared there and became accustomed to a lower blood meat.I am intrigued as to why you find the term so offensive; it means 'spiritually clean' and when I read (predominantly American) cooks specifying 'kosher' salt, I do not reach for my gun. I would in the spirit of friendship, suggest taking a world view as it might help the blood pressure.Pip pip!

It is a subcontinent thing this obsession with Halal.

Baharat is a home-made spice mix. Black pepper and whatever the household/regional flavour is. I dare say that could have been explained in parentheses.

Halal and non Halal never used to be an issue for most Syrian and Iraqi Muslims. Both Baghdad and Damascus used to have huge, modern abbatoirs with standard Western slaughter procedures including stunning. In fact you would not have seen the term 'halal' in front of eateries in Iraq or Syria the way you do in London and Birmingham

why is it preferable?



Author::::GenBanks
DateTime::::2016-03-07T13:40:48Z
Actually, I was wrong. It looks like the Halal recommendation comes directly from Salbi Chilingarian, the woman mentioned in the article who set up a shop.

I agree, most of the Syrian refugees in Armenia are Armenian Apostolic Christians. In fact the previous head of the Armenian church, Karekin I, came from Kessab in Syria. So it's puzzling to make a point of specifying halal.

Halal red meat has a different taste. Maybe that's what they mean? I doubt that Armenian Christians age meat in the Western way, so they may go the low-blood route like halal and kosher.

Appreciate halal was probably the only option in Syria but no idea why non-Muslims would select this when there is another option. Must be a typo.

Author::::farabundovive

So, you specify halal beef, but don't tell us what spices are in your baharat? Are we just supposed to guess?



Author::::Paulpeace

Can you please clarify why halal meat is preferable? I am not by any means some kind of UKIP or EDL Islamophobe type but this 'preferably halal' is totally and utterly bloody irrelevant and gratuitous unless there is some kind of underlying agenda here. Please remove it as I do actually find it offensive.

The Armenians are wonderful cooks. My wifes is a devoted cook too and she knows an Armenian lady who they share recepies with. And the lady, being a school principle cooks much better than an average chef, of course when she has time for it.
