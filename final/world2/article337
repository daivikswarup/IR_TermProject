<p>A man in southern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> faces a potential jail sentence after he was charged with insulting the feelings of religious believers over an internet exchange in which he wrote that “there is no God”.<br/></p>

<p>Viktor Krasnov, 38, who appeared in court Wednesday, is being prosecuted under a controversial 2013 law that was introduced after punk art group <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/06/russian-punks-pussy-riot-putin-protest">Pussy Riots was jailed</a> for a performance in Moscow’s main cathedral, his lawyer Andrei Sabinin told AFP. </p>

<p>The charges – which carry a maximum one-year jail sentence – centre on an internet exchange that Krasnov was involved in in 2014 on a humorous local website in his hometown of Stavropol. </p>

<p>“If I say that the collection of Jewish fairytales entitled the Bible is complete bullshit, that is that. At least for me,” Krasnov wrote, adding later “there is no God!”</p>

<p>One of the young people involved in the dispute with Krasnov then lodged a complaint against him accusing him of “offending the sentiments of Orthodox believers”.</p>

<p>Krasnov, whose case began last month, spent one month in a psychiatric ward last year undergoing psychiatric examinations before he was finally deemed to be sane. </p>

<p>Krasnov’s lawyer insisted to AFP that his client was “simply an atheist” and that he had taken aim at both “Halloween and Yiddish holidays” in the same exchange.</p>

The usa would love to jail julian assange for his actions of bring truth to light about US actions yet this news states that "Russian atheist FACES year in jail for denying existence of God during webchat". Its becoming more apparent the truth in the US been on of the biggest consumers of cocaine in the world and using propaganda as a weapon.

The big joke is the us economy thus the reson the us is becoming more warmongering by the day. Russia is trying to have a policy that is independent from the US. That is unacceptable to the US, which believes that all nations must exclusively serve the interests of the transnational Western corporate elite, even at the expense of their own public.

Thanks for the link. I'm not a scientist so am not in a position to challenge studies cited, but I'd just say this: the article itself is from a site promoting an anti-homosexual viewpoint. However, if gays genuinely suffer these health consequences then the answer should not be to tell them to deny their sexuality, but to react as we would if any other group had health issues: find medical ways of helping them to overcome the problems. It's not the same as, say, advising smokers to stop as they may get lung cancer because although one can be influenced in one's sexual choices there's plenty evidence that people just know they are homosexual from quite a young age.

You are interested in talking about the "sin" of homosexuals, but "not interested" in the crime of sexual abuse of children. You demand others show "hard facts" while you are content to say "the Bible tells us". I'm sure gays have troubles like most humans. I will likely regret asking, but what is the source of all your data about gays?

I see you (a) ignore my point of the essential association between imprisonment for belief and imprisonment for 'criticism', and (b) take Pussy Riot reference about freedom-of-speech as a straw man religious argument. Nice work.

The Soviets lost a large number of their leaders (they died) prior to them electing Gorbachev.If so many of their leaders had not died (thereby forcing the Soviets to elect a younger man), history may well have played out differently.

Milne is correct. NATO's expansion to the Russian border, along with Western support for the overthrow of the democratically elected President of Ukraine, despite the agreement to hold early elections that very same year, is what caused Putin to lash out.

It wasn't my example. Do things that are designed need a designer? Of course they do. Can designers produce things that run against the laws of physics, for example perpetual motion machines, of course not. You seem to be producing even more reasons why the argument from design is a poor one.

We bomb hospitals in Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan, the Israelis bomb hospitals in the Gaza strip. I tend to take the side of the bombers, because we all know how "free-fire" zones can be abused. Chechnya is Russia's Louisiana. Why shouldn't Russia be there?

Man I'm sorry to be rude but I can't believe I have to say this again: what you find plausible has no scientific value, and you've got nothing else. I would hope an SE could lucidly demonstrate the scientific reasoning behind his position, but your only reason is that you find the alternative implausible. Not scientific, and rather disappointing, but utterly typical.

Here you are mistaken. He can be sentenced not the denial of the existence of God, but for insulting people who believe in the existence of God and the people who celebrate religious holidays. This is a different concept.

What you say might have some merit if there was any chance of a fair trial, where all these issues were discussed – like the Lady Chatterley trial in London in the early sixties for example. Such trials serve a useful function. In the latter trial, the prosecution fell apart under its own absurdity. I suspect that the same thing would happen to this prosecution if there was a fair trial.

One could even say that "Yeshua ben Yusuf, from Nazareth" did not exist, as Nazareth did not exist at the time. Yeshua - if He existed at all - would have been a Nazarene, which was an offspring of the Essene sect or cult.

PS: I forgot to say, if there's free speech in Russia and you're really concerned about sexual issues, try writing an article over there like the stuff seen in the UK recently suggesting a certain top Russian politician has an unnatural interest in children and see how far you get!

The very fact that you assume because of my refusal to see gay acts as "sin" I'm a homosexual myself is ridiculous. Don't you think it's possible for a heterosexual man to see nothing wrong with gay sex? Nobody needs to "get over" being gay. You say the world is less cruel than it was before the new testament but I see little evidence of that. I get that you are trying to express love and compassion from your position of faith, but you can't see how people who don't share your faith and views about "sin" feel this is very superior and smug as they don't need or want you to feel sorry for them in any way, shape or form. I imagine they feel it's folks like you who are mistaken.

I'm really sorry. It was a wrong comparison. I didn't realize I could insult somebody. I just wanted to say that I strongly believe that there's always a chance to get over homosexuality sooner or later. If and only if it's done of one's own will. It's no use forcing anybody because it will only harm them. Sometimes it will take two or three years as one former gay told in an interview. Sometimes it will take all the life and need true heroism. This is very difficult. But it's real.

Seamus "so far left that he is really right" Milne said only last year that “The crisis in Ukraine is a product of the disastrous Versailles-style break-up of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s,” Milne told his readers on March 5. “The US and its allies have since relentlessly expanded NATO up to Russia's borders… it is hardly surprising that Russia has acted to stop the more strategically sensitive and neuralgic Ukraine falling decisively into the western camp " Milne also said this last year : “Putin’s absorption of Crimea and support for the rebellion in eastern Ukraine is clearly defensive,” Milne is an apologist for Putin ..and Putin's expansionist policies .In Milne's mind the USSR and now Putin's Russia were/are completely justified in taking whatever anti democratic expansionist measures they wish to ..as these measures are merely a bulwark against the real bully .If Milne were a socialist or indeed a democrat then he would never have acted as a modern apologist in chief for the monstrous Josef Stalin ,he would be shouting out his opposition to Putin for funding the far right Fronte Nationale ,he would be backing the right of the Ukrainians to self determination ,The problem is that Milne judges everything from an outdated , pro Soviet geo-political perspective ,despite what the world knows about the horrors of the gulag . Milne justifies such horrors by pointing out that the cost was worth it : "for all its brutalities and failures, communism in the Soviet Union, eastern Europe and elsewhere delivered rapid industrialisation, mass education, job security and huge advances in social and gender equality,” ".Milne has no conception of human rights and liberties because ultimately he is a Stalinist and not a socialist ..that is why ultimately despite his criticisms of Putin he acts as Putin's apologist .Why don't you read some Orwell ? ..it might sharpen you up a bit .that plays down the number of deaths .He is basically unconcerned with the rights of the little people ..

You are clearly not informed on the meaning of "nothing" and "explosion". Before you criticize or make fun of a scientific theory, you should make an effort to understand it. It comes across much more believable if you can demonstrate a grasp of the concept.

While we are about it how are you on "punishing" a rapist by getting him to marry his victim (and by extension forcing her to marry him)? Deuteronomy 22:28-29If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered, he shall pay her father fifty shekels[a] of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives. (Deuteronomy 22:28-29)The world has changed very much for the better after the New Testament appeared. It had been very cruel before.

There is a song called October. It was written in 1981 i.e. whilst the Soviet Union seemed for all intents and purposes as though it was going to be around for a very long time.It is an exprssion of faith - that God would outlast the Soviets communist regime.Here are the lyrics:-
