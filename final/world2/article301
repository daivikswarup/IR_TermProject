Pussy Riot release new protest song: 'prison is a weapon'




DateTime::::2016-02-03T11:32:27+0000



<p>It has been a torrid few months for Russia’s embattled general prosecutor Yuri Chaika. In December he was the subject of a video made by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/alexei-navalny-yuri-chaika">accused his family of mafia ties and gross corruption</a>.</p>

<p>Now he is on the receiving end of biting satire doled out by the feminist punk collective <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot">Pussy Riot</a>.</p>

<p>The band’s latest pop video, released on Wednesday, is a black pastiche of Russia’s criminal justice system, featuring torture, hooded prisoners in nooses and a framed official portrait of the president, Vladimir Putin. </p>

<p>Pussy Riot’s Nadya Tolokonnikova plays the role of Chaika, backed up by dancers in blue prosecutors’ uniforms. A golden loaf of bread and a Lenin memorial also feature.</p>

<p>Navalny’s original video, which attracted more than five million views, alleged that Chaika’s sons Artem and Igor had built up a massive business empire using thier father’s network of regional prosecutors to crush rival companies. </p>

<p>It further claimed that his sons’ business associates have links with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/13/alexei-navalny-yuri-chaika">notorious Tsapok gang</a>, and that the Chaikas own a home in Switzerland and a luxury hotel in Greece, among other properties.Selective weapon’</p>

<p>The latest song from Pussy Riot pokes fun at Chaika’s patriotism with the lines “I love Russia/I’m a patriot/But I could live in Switzerland as well”.</p>

<p>The lyrics go on to suggest that the Kremlin uses criminal prosecutions as a selective weapon – prosecuting their enemies and dropping charges for their “homies”. </p>

<p>Tolokonnikova said the video was a response to the way the government considers <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> an instrument to get rich. “[The state] doesn’t care about the standard of living of Russian citizens. Nor about education, the environment or about the development of science or industry,” she said.</p>

<p>Instead, the elite raid the country and then go abroad to spend their loot, she added. </p>

<p>The video was shot in three different locations across Moscow: a kitsch fort above the city’s Ismailovsky market; an abandoned and unheated Soviet-era palace of culture; and a disused jail.</p>

<p>Tolokonnikova said it was easy to get hold of the uniforms, adding that Putin had been right when he said you could buy them at any corner shop. “The only problem was the size,” she said. “They were six sizes too big for us. Apparently, prosecutors like to eat.” </p>

<p>Tolokonnikova and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/23/freed-pussy-riot-amnesty-prison-putin-humiliation">Masha Alyokhina spent 21 months</a> in jail following an anti-Putin punk protest inside Moscow’s Christ the Saviour cathedral in 2012. </p>

<p>Alyokhina doesn’t appear in the latest video because the pair no longer work together creatively as Pussy Riot, Tolokonnikova said. They continue to collaborate on a website, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/post-soviet-states-new-east-network-guardian-welcome">MediaZona</a>, which highlights the legal system and conditions inside Russia’s prison.</p>

<p>The English language version of Navalny’s video came out last month and was screened on Tuesday before a group of British MPs.</p>

<p>Chaika has denied the allegations against him in the video, calling them a “hatchet job” and an attempt by an outside power to smear him. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>As for Chaika the song, Pussy Riot say that “any resemblance to actual events or persons isn’t accidental, but deliberate”.</p>

I agree with most of your comment and you make some great points! I do fear that Putin is keen on reducing unity in the EU and his funding for extreme right-wing and extreme left-wing parties in Europe is dangerous. I also worry that his influence in places such as Hungary, Poland Ukraine and Georgia is bad for democracy there.

Unfortunately almost all of our leaders began to take care of themselves,believe me it does not depend on the length of their reign. Unfortunately, this is common practice in Russia, power is a nice bonus: I can - everything, but I do not have to do something. I do not know, maybe we need 15-20 years, which would break the system, including foster a vibrant civil society.

I totally agree that strength in a leader is essential but good leaders should be able to listen to their people, to value their people and to serve their people. Too often leaders, if left in power for too long start to serve themselves.

Yes, yes, of course, Yuri Chaika, Putin ordinary dog. As they all.But unfortunately in the last 500 years of Russian history (wars, turmoil, revolutions), only two options either the president (most authoritarian leader or dictator) controls a pack or a pack controls the president (Yeltsin). When in our country that people have a choice? In 1991? Who then chose the collapse of the Soviet Union and all trade and economic ties - people or more drunken politicians usurped power in the union republics? Millions of people just issued a new passport of citizens of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus and ... everything.To hell with Putin, then who?name only?P / SThank you, I am pleased that at least a dozen Guardian readers will not believe me, "the Kremlin troll". Although some of my comments are not politically correct and pro-Russian - this is normal, all the same I'm Russian.Perhaps our frustration engenders austerity :) :(The documentary, Paul Moreira "Ukraine. Revolution Masks." Featured French: Canal +Ukrainian Embassy has made good advertising to protest the show movie ... I do not know whether there is an English translation, but it is entertaining ..

The opposition in Russia - Are you kidding? Who!?It is a miserable bunch of clowns, outsiders, caught stealing and the former officials and politicians - has no real power, consolidation, objectives and strategies.These people just work out your money, do not care who pays: the Kremlin, oligarchs or Western foundations.

Legitimate is an opinion. Most Russians feel the same about their armed forces. Every single action and alleged action of the Russian armed forces in the last 20 years has at least one or more NATO equivalent action. Get used to it.

A United Nations panel has decided that Julian Assange’s three-and-a-half years in the Ecuadorian embassy amount to “arbitrary detention”, leading his lawyers to call for the Swedish extradition request to be dropped immediately.

You seem to be a bit off-topic. I shall assist: The concept of a "principal" is the discussion. It's absence in Russia is also the topic. A higher moral, ethical and creative tolerance is also in the narrative. Yet you focus on the trivial (individual talent)... how shallow-minded.

Actually Pussy Riot have a lot in common with Manning, Snowden, and Assange. I would think that they actually like eachother these people. Pussy Riot are also friends of Slavoj Zicek.

I am all about tolerance and respect for another persons views and their religious persuasion.

I'm sorry, but your friends are losers then. Soviet times suck. My farther was fired from university (he was economy professor) for anti-soviet propaganda just because he asked student if he thinks that USA economic system is better and why if he thinks so. All old smart people think that Soviet times were sh1tty (only lazyheads and alcoholics think Soviet time was great). All normal young people don't think anything about Soviet times, because they were not born, or were 1-5 years old.

The Russians HAVE been defeated by force of arms. Putin and his ex-Spetsnaz mafia clique have grabbed power from a nascent democracy, their favoured weapons being those that make no noise in the darkness.
