‘Through a religious prism’: Iran's clergy view upcoming elections with wariness




DateTime::::2016-02-24T12:47:02+0000



<p>Around 60 people, mostly men, are gathered in the local mosque in an old central neighbourhood of Mashhad, the shrine city in eastern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>. In between midday and afternoon prayers, the men fiddle with their prayer beads, sitting on a floor covered with long, factory-made, green carpets with “prayer rug” patterns. <br/></p>

<p>A middle-aged man asks the imam about the election due on Friday for the clerical body whose one real task is to choose Iran’s supreme leader should a vacancy arise. “The Assembly of Experts must consist of the most righteous statesmen and religious figures,” says the imam, who is in his early 30s. “I’m not going to suggest names, as the Qom seminary hasn’t given us a preferred list of candidates, but remember to vote for someone whose thoughts and ideas are closer to the ones of the supreme leader, someone who will continue his path.”</p>

<p>The Guardian Council – which has qualified only 160 candidates, including a handful of reformists, out of 800 hopefuls – has narrowed the field. When it comes to the Assembly of Experts, the conservative clerical establishment is in no mood to concede an inch to reformists or moderates, or even to have too contentious an election. </p>

<p>Some provinces have no competition. Out of 88 members in the next assembly, nine (10.2%) are already selected as the number of candidates equals the number of seats in the provinces of Western Azerbaijan, Ardebil, Bushehr, northern Khorasan, Semnan and Hormozgan.</p>

<p>And in some others, there are few options. In two provinces, Eastern Azerbaijan and Khuzestan, 13 candidates are competing for a total of 11 seats, and in seven others - Gilan, Khorasan-e Razavi, Kerman, Fars, Sistan-Balouchestan, Ghazvin and Lorestan - 39 candidates are competing for 24 seats.</p>

<p>In such times, voting is not so much a positive choice as a chance to say no, according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://religiousstudies.duke.edu/people?gurl=&amp;uil=12286&amp;subpage=profile">Mohsen Kadivar</a>, who trained at the seminary in Qom and is now research professor of Islamic studies at Duke University, North Carolina. “This election is more about putting the supreme leader in his place,” says Kadivar. “In my opinion, more than 80% of Iranians cannot find their preferred candidates among those qualified. So their only remaining option is to vote against the leadership’s favourite figures.”</p>

<p>He compares the current situation in Iran with 1975 when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi abolished the multi-party system and replaced it with only one party, Rastakhiz. But such methods don’t work in the long run, he said: “In 1979, just a few years after the establishment of the Rastakhiz party, the Shah was toppled.”</p>

<p>In Tehran, reformists and supporters of President Hassan Rouhani are circulating a list topped with photos of Rouhani, himself an Experts’ Assembly candidate, and former president Mohammad Khatami backing 16 candidates for the Experts Assembly election and 30 for parliament. This follows <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://isna.ir/fa/news/94120100680/%25d9%2581%25d8%25b1%25d8%25a7%25d8%25ae%25d9%2588%25d8%25a7%25d9%2586-%25d9%2587%25d8%25a7%25d8%25b4%25d9%2585%25db%258c-%25d8%25b1%25d9%2581%25d8%25b3%25d9%2586%25d8%25ac%25d8%25a7%25d9%2586%25db%258c-%25d8%25a8%25d8%25b1%25d8%25a7%25db%258c-%25d8%25ad%25d8%25b6%25d9%2588%25d8%25b1-%25d9%2585%25d8%25b1%25d8%25af%25d9%2585-%25d8%25af%25d8%25b1"> a statement</a> published on 20 February in which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/27/iran-ali-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-comeback-assembly-experts-election">Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani</a>, the former president and another candidate for the assembly, asking people to take an “opportunity” to prevent society drifting towards “political and religious extremism”.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/27/iran-ali-akbar-hashemi-rafsanjani-comeback-assembly-experts-election">Can a former kingmaker make a comeback in Iran?</a> </p>

<p>Hossein, a retired manager of a state office in Mashhad, is proud of hardly ever missing Friday prayers at the shrine of Imam Reza. He says that all candidates in the province – Khorasan-e Razavi – stand by the side of the supreme leader.</p>

<p>But that does not stop him making a choice. While Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, Mashhad’s Friday prayer leader is, he says, an “extreme hardliner”, others like Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi and Mohammad Hadi Abdekhodaei have more moderate perspectives. “So I am probably going to vote only for these two,” he explains.</p>

<p>Even with a narrow field, the country’s clerical establishment is not at ease. A Shia scholar with extensive ties to Qom, who asks to remain anonymous, says the establishment is wary of the reformists trying to “sneak back” into influential positions. According to him, conservative clerics are worried that reformists and moderate allies will use the success of the nuclear deal and the easing of sanctions to re-launch “the reformist programme or ...[a] slightly less conservative reading of how Iranian society should be run”.</p>

<p>But instead of expressing this openly, he says, these clerics are using “mutterings and murmurings” to spread their views: “That’s how they do politics. They won’t stand up and say, ‘Don’t let this guy come back in’. They will just disgruntle loudly during a class or Friday sermon when emotions are high… suddenly drop a line to say ‘Look, these reformists are still trying to undermine the credentials of the Islamic Revolution’.”</p>

<p>A general warning has come from the top. On 18 February, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei asked people to resist attempts by “the enemy” to influence the elections. Friday prayer leaders around the county echoed his words, warning against “the enemy’s infiltration”. Ayatollah <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13941130000365">Ahmad Khatami</a>, substitute Friday prayer leader in Tehran and a member of the Experts’ Assembly, said the west was trying to plant insiders both in the assembly and in Iran’s parliament. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/mar/13/iran-supreme-mohammad-yazdi-leader-in-waiting">Iran's ayatollahs spring a surprise</a> </p>

<p>Kadivar says these warnings reveal how nervous the leadership is. “Currently they are so fragile that they are even scared of Hashemi Rafsanjani and Rouhani. The Islamic Republic is like a train. In each station it disembarks some of its political figures. Previously it got rid of the reformists and now it’s Hashemi Rafsanjani and the moderates’ turn.” </p>

<p>The careful attention being paid – both in Iran and internationally – to the election for the Experts Assembly comes from the likelihood that it may in its next eight-year term choose a successor to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei">Khamenei</a>, who is 76 and in 2014 underwent prostate surgery. But whatever the backbiting surrounding Friday’s election, this is just the start of a process of succession that could take years.</p>

<p>Kadivar stresses this isn’t a job for just anyone. “The next leader can’t be an unknown figure and must be in a high political position within the hierarchy of the Islamic Republic,” he said. Kadivar believes the main decision-makers will be the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and Khamenei, who will be able to shape his own succession and might even express a preference. </p>

<p>A principle-ist and former high-ranking official close to Iran’s supreme leader disagrees. “The Assembly of Experts is the most important organisation in Iran after the leadership and it’s not correct to say the IRGC has [undue] influence over it,” he told Tehran Bureau. “The best reason [evidence] for this is the presence of Rafsanjani in the election.” The former president is disliked by many IRGC commanders and was barred from the 2013 presidential election.</p>

<p>The Shia scholar cited earlier says that those who stress the influence of the Revolutionary Guards believe they will be able to impose “a frail, weak candidate, someone they can control,” citing <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/mar/13/iran-supreme-mohammad-yazdi-leader-in-waiting">Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi</a>, the current chair of the Experts’ Assembly. </p>

<p>But the scholar prefers to stress the role that will be played in selecting the leader by the clergy loyal to the Islamic Revolution and its ideals. “They see the world through a religious prism, a conservative theological prism. Many long for someone [as leader] who reminds them of Ayatollah Khomeini. The whole paradigm of the guardianship of the jurist [the system concentrating constitutional powers in the leader] is built on the belief that he has to be a jurist and a mystic philosopher. Khomeini combined both - he was a grand ayatollah [a pre-eminent jurist] and a mystic.”</p>

<p>This, says the scholar, undermines the chances of some often cited as potential leaders: “[Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi] Mesbah-Yazdi is neither a mystic nor a pre-eminent jurist. Nor is Yazdi or Shahroudi.”</p>

<p>He believes the chances of Shahroudi, 67, who was regarded by many as a front-runner until he failed to put his name forward last year as chair of the Experts Assembly, have receded. “He’s too Iraqi for them, even though he’s a former head of the judiciary. He speaks Arabic with a heavy Persian accent, and I hear when he speaks Persian he has a bit of an Arabic accent.”</p>

<p>The scholar believes Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli, although 82, fits the criteria of “someone who is a mystic and a jurist” as well as being “a strong politician with a proven track record”. Plus he’s a pragmatist: “He’s flexible, he controls large shares of companies, the bonyads [religious foundations] – this could sit well with the Revolutionary Guards.”</p>

<p>A further factor is the Shia religious establishment in neighbouring Iraq, centred on the city of Najaf. Its relations with Qom have frayed, partly because Najaf, and especially Ayatollah Ali Sistani, resisted what they saw as an attempt by Iran to “parachute” Shahroudi into <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</a>.</p>

<p>But Sistani is himself 85 and the relationship between Iran’s leader and Shia internationally has been changed by developments in Syria and Iraq, and growing tensions with a Sunni Arab establishment led by Saudi Arabia. The bombing this week by the Islamic State on <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/06/syria-iran-axis-nadia-von-maltzahn-cultural-diplomacy">Sayida Zeinab</a>, Syria’s leading Shia shrine, may add to a growing sense of pan-Shiism. </p>

<p> “The perception that Sunni elders are coming together against the Shias, while Turkey has formed an alliance with Saudi and Jordan, suggests everyone is out to get the Shias,” says the scholar. “So they [the clerics in Najaf] are happy to form some kind of temporary alliance with the Iranians. At the end of the day, they’re co-religionists.”</p>

There are discussions among the mafia elite and establishment cronies whom has enriched themselves and their cronies and families beyond their dream. It is a choice between one group of mafiaso versus another. One family versus another. If you sincerely believe there is truthful elections / open debate / right to stand for election / form parties to challenge any single policy, etc etc.. think again.... This is a pony show by a family of mafiasos... criminality is in their genes and goes to the core of the establishment. Don't be fooled by the mullahs and their on etrick shows. The average Iranian living in Iran is aware but unable to exert any change. Civil servants are pressurised to show their employment cards and details and turn up at window dressed polling stations... then the regime dicates mass turn out and legitimises itself. You have just one natural right in Iran... to stay silent.

Interesting article . My understanding from this that in Iran there are discussions and debates albeit informal and not televised but nevertheless open about the direction of 'Islamic ' republic. These may not be 'appropriate ' by international western standards but open discussions they are. There are restricted choices but choices there are ! For those who oppose the current regime in Iran, where is your best benchmark period before ! Shah reign is discredited . 1954 is spoiled by CIA inspired coup . I feel since 1979 there is a different system of government and process . This is a start for something that hopefully lead to true democracy and freedom of choice for the country . The concept of foreign enemies of Iran is not fanciful. Because Iran has expertise in nuclear technology, thee perience in Iraq is instructive. Western powers and their allies fear of this. It is not enough to prevent raw materials and equipment to reach Iran, the brains with knowledge has to be bought or liquidated or 'put' in lead boxes.

The lack of shame and decline in quality is pernicious and permeates all layers. Last month they changed the title of a published article so it wouldn't say the Persian Gulf but the Gulf, they printed a picture of the Iranian foreign minister with the Iraqi flag.

Allow me to be the 998th person (of 53 so far) to point out that the lead-in reads: 'weariness'. Poor tired clerics. In this case it does change the meaning decisively. Is it within the bounds of Community Standards to suggest that this is what you get when you outsource subediting to a smartphone app? But the problem actually runs deeper, as also seen in the insufferable unspecified 'We' so dear to all Quality newspapers: the presumption that the Right Thinking reader will know who 'We' are supposed to be (and by extension e.g. what those Iranians must be thinking) without the help of pesky things like literal sense. The type of Right Thinking Wo/Man implied by 'We' varies slightly between media 'outlets' (think: drainage system), but not so far as all that. Much the same hybrid of nationality, asset-ownership and upholstered Ethics here as in the BBC/Times/Telegraph style of Crackpot Realism.

There are plenty of Iranians who would like some kind of reform of a society that is tightly controlled by a repressive government. They will grasp at any straws offered by the regime such as the chance to elect an alleged moderate to the presidency like Rouhani even though they know the office has little power. They’ll also hope that some moderates will somehow make it into the parliament. But they also know that the Islamists maintain a monopoly on political power. Moreover, they are also painfully aware that the ayatollahs and their violent henchmen will meet any real challenges to it — as opposed to the fake ones on display in the election — with the same brutality they meted out to protesters in the streets of Iran in 2009.

I think it is better to let us find our way toward democracy. West countries did worst things in past and they never did any thing for iranian people. We were close to reaching a democratic country when Mosadeq was in power. But US crupt it. Then US and Uk did the same thing by supporting Shah and supporting Saddam Hossein and.... When i look back to my country history it is obvious for me your goverments always make problems for people in my country. As a graduate person it is hard for me to watch my country steps back in past 8 years but definitely it's to us find the way and sanctions like other moves of west governments make things worse.
