Obamas to host Trudeaus at White House as 'special relationship' develops




DateTime::::2016-03-09T16:44:36+0000



<p>Barack Obama will welcome his Canadian counterpart <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> to Washington on Thursday for an official state visit likely to stoke comparisons between two leaders who came to power as fresh, charismatic liberal darlings with star power.</p>

<p>The president and prime minister will hold talks on issues including energy and climate change, security, and trade.<br/></p>

<p>A glimpse of them together at the White House may provide fleeting solace to those in North America fearful of the rise of Donald Trump and fellow climate change naysayers.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/shortcuts/2016/mar/09/flags-troops-and-banquets-how-to-throw-a-state-visit">Flags, troops and banquets: how to throw a state visit</a> </p>

<p>“I think there is a developing special relationship between this president and the prime minister,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/08/record-press-call-upcoming-visit-canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau">said Mark Feierstein</a>, the White House National Security Council’s senior director for the western hemisphere. “Both young leaders with similar visions. Both have a progressive vision of governing. Both are very much committed to the appropriate use of multilateral tools. Both are committed to diversity. </p>

<p>“And I think there is a coincidence very much in terms of the agendas that both administrations have. And I think we’re seeing that reflected, for example, on the issues of climate change and refugees and other issues. So this will be a good opportunity for the president and prime minister to expand that relationship and build on that.”</p>

<p>Like the Obamas, Trudeau and his equally telegenic wife, Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau, have captured the public imagination and earned comparisons with the Kennedys. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/justin-trudeau-visits-washington-220387">“Justin Fever hits Washington,”</a> said a headline this week on the Politico website, nodding to the 44-year-old’s pop-star looks.</p>

<p>After years in which Canadians were fascinated by Obama, the tables have finally been turned, observed Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, which borders Canada. “Obviously they both came in on platforms of change and they came in at a time when the countries wanted to see something different and a new approach,” she said at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.politico.com/events/2016/03/a-new-agenda-canada-and-the-us-in-the-world-219209">a Politico event in Washington</a> on Tuesday.</p>

<p>“But there is one thing that’s different beside the fact the president notes that his hair is a little greyer now. President Obama came in at a time of crisis: we were in the worst economic freefall since the depression. Trudeau is coming in at a time where at least the economy is stable, giving him this moment where he can do some of the things Obama wishes he had done at the beginning.”</p>

<p>Yet not so long ago, Trudeau, a former teacher, was better known for his famous father Pierre, also prime minister, and beating Conservative senator Patrick Brazeau in a charity boxing match in 2012. He also posed topless for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=trudeau+tattoos&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=QOqC0wuMkdlZbM%253A%253BaxLy3pmXkiOTeM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fcontemplativestate.wordpress.com%25252Ftag%25252Fhaida%25252F&amp;source=iu&amp;pf=m&amp;fir=QOqC0wuMkdlZbM%253A%252CaxLy3pmXkiOTeM%252C_&amp;usg=__XGsV3rmAYSQvNlW-Athiy1LPHY8%3D&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjupvWT27HLAhVIXh4KHZIxASUQyjcILw&amp;ei=8xjfVq7hLci8eZLjhKgC#imgrc=QOqC0wuMkdlZbM%3A">photos</a> showing off his trim figure and upper-arm tattoo.</p>

<p>He entered politics with a bang and last year his Liberal party defeated Canada’s long-ruling Conservatives by promising a new era of “sunny ways”. He swiftly gave <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/11/04/female-cabinet-justin-trudeau_n_8471908.html">half the seats</a> in his cabinet to women “because it’s 2015” and named a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/harjit-sajjan-badass-canada-defence-minister-1.3304931">defense minister</a> who is a leading member of Canada’s Sikh community.</p>

<p>Trudeau also kept some of his more contentious promises, including welcoming 25,000 Syrian refugees when other nations were closing their borders. Senate Republicans have raised concerns that refugees reaching Canada could cross the “porous border” and put Americans at risk, even holding <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/us-senate-committee-questions-candadian-border-threat">a committee hearing on Capitol Hill</a> about the issue.</p>

<p>Alan Bersin, assistant secretary for international affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, told the Politico event: “Entry-exit, pre-clearance, enhanced information sharing – I think all of those we should expect will be the subject of announcements during the course of the visit.”</p>

<p>Although the countries share innumerable family and cultural ties, this will be the first Canadian state visit to the US for 19 years. When Trudeau’s outspoken mother, Margaret, attended a White House state dinner in 1977, she <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1977/03/20/page/123/article/margaret-trudeau">ruffled fashion critics</a> by wearing a dress that ended above the knee.</p>

<p>Relations between Obama and Trudeau’s predecessor, Stephen Harper of the Conservatives, were strained over Washington’s unwillingness to support the Keystone XL pipeline. But Obama and Trudeau, who have met once before and spoken twice by phone, are expected to<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/08/barack-obama-and-justin-trudeau-to-join-forces-on-climate-change"> announce common climate measures</a> including a 45% cut in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry and protections for the Arctic.</p>

<p>Canada is America’s biggest trade partner, with almost 400,000 people and $2bn worth of goods and services crossing the border every day. About 75% of Canada’s total exports go to the US, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> is the top export destination for 33 US states.<br/></p>

<p>The leaders are likely to discuss two longstanding trade disputes over softwood lumber and meat labelling. A deal governing Canadian softwood lumber exports expired last year, and the two nations are talking about a new arrangement, Feierstein said. “We’re open to exploring all options with Canada at this point.”</p>

<p>Another possible bone of contention has been Trudeau’s decision to pull his country’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/trudeau-pulls-jets-but-adds-troops-to-canada-s-is-mission">fighter jets</a> out of the US-led coalition’s bombing campaign against Isis earlier this year.<br/></p>

<p>Some American liberals might also keep a close on eye on Trudeau out of naked self-interest: Trump’s march towards the Republican nomination has coincided with a a sharp rise in Google searches for how to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://mashable.com/2016/03/02/how-can-i-move-to-canada-donald-trump/#pF5fh0VRZsqF">move to Canada</a>.</p>

Agreed. But don't underestimate the son. He was supposed to flub in the debates and keep his party in third place forever, remember? Both the Cons and the NDP acted as if the election was only between them. Trudeau stayed positive in spite of the hate and divisiveness from the other two leaders - he refused to get down in the gutter with them. For someone the naysayers claimed was "just not ready" he didn't do too badly!

Harper was lambasted in 2003 for wanting Canada to join in Dubya Bush's illegal war against Iraq. He was lambasted in later years for giving the cold shoulder to the American ambassador, refusing to meet with him because Obama wouldn't cave in to Harper's "I won't take no for an answer." So voters said No to Harper in October and he's been hiding in his closet ever since. Harper was the worst PM in Canadian history and made Canada a laughingstock on the world stage. Trudeau has changed all that negativity like a breath of fresh air.

A former Canadian PM, Conservative Brian Mulroney - you may remember him? - warned Harper the day Justin Trudeau became leader of the Liberal Party "Justin Trudeau is an intelligent young man and a smart politician, you underestimate him at your peril. " Harper just sneered. Trudeau was smart enough to take his party from a dismal third place to a majority government. No other Canadian leader has ever done that before, not even his father. A poll taken just a few weeks ago showed that Trudeau is even more popular today than he was on election day and would win an even larger majority if an election were held. So keep sneering - you know how negativity worked so well for the Cons last time!

Yes, it is a state visit. The invitation was made by the head of state, the President, of the host country. The dinner is also a state dinner, hosted by the same head of state. The guest of honour does not have to be a head of state. The host can invite whoever he wants to his state dinners.

As a Canadian I can say this...The guy is dumb as a brick. He's the least qualified Prime Minister in Canadian history. Before becoming a Member of Parliament...he was a school drama teacher for only a few months. He says the dumbest things. Justin only got elected because his daddy was a famous PM (Richard Nixon called him an a$$hole after the first meeting) and good hair. Personally, I'd rather have someone far more capable and be completely be ignored by Lefty garbage rags like the Guardian.

A somewhat flawed report. Trudeau is not Obama's counterpart. Obama is the President and Head of State of the US. Trudeau is neither the President NOR the head of state of Canada - the privilege of Head of State belongs to HM Queen Elizabeth II of Canada. Second. Canada was never in an economic mess like the US and many other western countries. Minor things perhaps but wrong nevertheless.
