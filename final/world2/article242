Hi, my name is Evita and I'm a racist




DateTime::::2016-03-04T08:00:28+0000



<p>I watched a film on TV with my grandchildren last night. I can’t remember the name, or much of the plot, but I remember it was about a man who had a drinking problem and he went to a meeting.</p>

<p>You could see how much courage it took him to go up onto the stage in front of everyone and say: “Hi, my name is John and I am an alcoholic.” And all the alcoholics in the audience answered: “Hi John.”</p>

<p>Well, I decided that maybe I should start this conversation by saying: “Hi, my name is Evita and I’m a racist.” Now you can all say: “Hi Evita!”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/south-african-north-west-university-set-ablaze-in-student-protest">South African university set ablaze in student protest</a> </p>

<p>Let me quote the French philosopher Voltaire: “Racism is the hostile attitude or behaviour to members of other races based on a belief in the innate superiority of one’s own race. It is not restricted to whites only.” </p>

<p>The only way for an alcoholic to confront the disease of alcoholism is to admit it: I drink therefore I will not drink. Then surely one way for a racist to confront that disease is to be honest: I am a racist therefore I will not be a racist.</p>

<p>I will not judge people because of the colour of their skin, or how they dress, or what they eat. I will not be a racist in the city traffic when the township taxi cuts in front of me. I will not be a racist when politics passes me by. I will not believe in the innate superiority of my race. </p>

<p>I was born in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica">South Africa</a> in 1935 into a racist family. I went to a racist school and a racist church. My God was a racist and so was his Son. I married into a racist family. I became the wife of a racist member of a racist parliament who served in the racist cabinet of a racist prime minister and praised by a racist press.</p>

<p>My children were brought up as racists. In fact, till my 59th year and the country’s first democratic election, if I hadn’t been a racist I would have been locked up in jail as a communist or a terrorist.</p>

<p>An enemy of the state. A traitor. And it is only because a man came out of darkness on 11 February 1990 and gave me light that I realised that it was no longer politically correct to be a racist in South Africa. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela">Nelson Mandela</a> allowed me to stop being scared of who I was, and to celebrate who I am – an African who is not black.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">My God was racist and so was his Son. I married into a racist family… My children were brought up as racists</p>

<p>There are so many urgent areas of our survival that need to be touched upon in this conversation. Education, poverty, violence, crime, security, corruption, xenophobia, the past, the present and the future. So why do I start with this issue? </p>

<p>Racism is not new. It’s not unexpected. It’s not profound. But if we here in 2016 do not allow ourselves to get beyond it with understanding and honesty, we will once again be imprisoned by that accusation and every other issue will fade by comparison. The first step in the right direction towards our planned non-racial, non-sexist society is to admit that the majority of South Africans are racists one way or another, <em>finish en klaar</em>.</p>

<p>South <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a> has nearly completed its 21st year of democracy and considering where we come from, we are doing remarkably well. Everyone’s fingerprints are on that silver chalice of freedom. Everybody has the right to be seen and to be heard. And so democracy will never be perfect and so it isn’t. It is confused. It is corrupt. It is crippled. It is unfair. It is infuriating. But it is the best thing we have.</p>

<p>Either we accept that and make it better, or we shrug our shoulders and allow our hiccup of hope to slide into the mists of historical memory. In a healthy democracy the people must lead and then the government will follow. But free expression also attracts those new obstacles littering the internet highway.</p>

<p>Today, social media forces us down high roads of political correctness and along low paths of innuendo and insult. On Monday, #FeesMustFall. (If only they would, but in reality they won’t.) On Tuesday, #RhodesMustFall. (Alas, the only roads that do are the ones falling prey to potholes and disrepair.) What will a hashtag trend today? #XenophobiaMustFall?</p>

<p>And tomorrow? Economic inequality must fall! (It’s happening; we’ll all soon be equally bankrupt.) And yes, racism should have fallen 22 years ago; and yet today it just keeps trending and being tweeted and retweeted. </p>

<p>I was very nervous when I joined the African National Congress. Why would they welcome me? Everyone knows who I am and where I come from: Evita Bezuidenhout, former apartheid government icon, ambassador to the homeland of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_African_countries">Bapetikosweti</a> and racist supporter of former president PW Botha. “<em>Sanibona</em>,” I said, “I want to join the ANC.” “Do you have cash?” they asked. I said yes. “Okay, you’re in.”</p>

<p>I know people still say: seeing Evita Bezuidenhout in the ANC is like seeing Angela Merkel as a Greek bank manager. I have been in the party headquaters Luthuli House for over a year and I am still shocked when I realise with how much prejudice I arrived there. Yes, the familiar accusation that all members of the ANC are corrupt, are criminals, are stealing state funds.</p>

<p>We will always find six corrupt cadres to fill the front pages of the newspapers every morning, but there are hundreds of thousands of members of the ANC who are not corrupt. They are working hard to keep the fragile balance of our democracy so that hopefully we will be able to vote freely and fairly when the next election comes around.</p>

<p>But we as the ANC must admit that many of today’s problems are not the legacy of apartheid. The drought, textbooks not in schools, the HIV epidemic, Zuma’s tax-payer funded home Nkandla, problems at the electricity public utility Eskom, the telecommunication provider Telkom, and the national post office. The fall of the currency. </p>

<p>One thing that definitely is the legacy of apartheid and responsible for a lot of our troubles is seeing and counting people in terms of their race. Black vs white. Coloured vs black, Zulu vs Xhosa, rural vs urban, revolutionary vs counter-revolutionary.</p>

<p>Blah vs blah.</p>

<p>I am sick of being white. I am tired of listening to white outrage and complaint. Enough white noise. When will we realise that white South Africans in our rainbow nation have been given the greatest liberation of all its people. We are now totally irrelevant.</p>

<p>No one cares a damn about us. So we can do everything to make this country a better place. We don’t need permission to go to the local school and help the learners with their homework. We don’t have to submit tenders to share our optimism and hopes. It can just be done by doing it. We are what we do.</p>

<p>As news breaks from Europe, I realise that history is repeating itself. I have been approached off the record by persons who wish to remain nameless for obvious reasons. They are from France, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom and Germany. And all they say is: “Comrade Bezuidenhout, we are having a little problem in Europe with uninvited guests. Maybe you can help? Surely you remember the way it was done so successfully?”</p>

<p>Yes, during apartheid we called it influx control. We had pass laws, mixed marriage acts, locations, groups areas acts, a population registration act made sure who belonged where. Easy to rub out “coloured, black, Indian, Chinese” and replace them with “Muslim”.</p>

<p>Who would have thought that apartheid was 25 years ahead of the world? But I must be careful how well I advise the Europeans. With whites making up a mere 6% of the South Africa population, the possibility of us clustered at the Croatian border with a few pathetic possessions clutched in shopping bags is not so far-fetched. </p>

<p>So are we white South Africans prepared to take the back seat? Believe me, as a member of the ANC from a protected minority, I have found the back seat very comfortable. As long as the driver isn’t drunk, or carrying a forged licence. We whites can never and we whites will never again lead, but we can lead by example. Things will not go back to what they were. What you see is what we’ve got. This is it. Let’s make the best of what wehave got.</p>

<p>“Hi! My name is Evita – and I am a South African.”</p>

<p><em>This is an edited version of a speech given to the Cape Town Press Club</em></p>

<p><em>Evita Bezuidenhout is a fictitious Afrikaner character created by Pieter-Dirk Uys in the 1980s, using satire to overcome apartheid censorship and criticise the state. The character was imagined as the wife of an apartheid cabinet minister, she became the South African ambassador in the fictitious black homeland republic of Bapetikosweti. She <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjUhwYr48vE">interviewed Nelson Mandela on national television</a> in 1994, addressed parliament in 1999 and is now a member of the ruling ANC. She has her own political party, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.epp.org.za">Evita’s People’s Party</a>, which focuses on voter education. Pieter-Dirk Uys regards her as his premier clown in the struggle against fear, racism and political correctness and says: ‘Just because she doesn’t exist doesn’t mean she’s not real’</em><br/></p>

This seems like travelling from one extreme to another: I don't think it's particularly commendable to be consumed by self loathing and hatred for one's own race and culture, whatever's its sins. Russians don't seem to be at all bothered - in general - by the multiple atrocities committed in the name of the USSR; Germans on the other hand, whilst rightly shocked and appalled by the concentration camps and the holocaust, seem to have forgotten the atrocities committed against their own people: the ethnic cleansing of Germans in Eastern Europe - 2 million died - the deliberate targeting of their civilian population by the terror bombing of the RAF and the USAAF (and it was the British who pulled the trigger first here) and the war crimes committed en masse by Soviet soldiers in eastern Germany. No Nuremberg for the victors eh?

Sorry, what are you saying? I responded to the OP's irrational, fear mongering comment, that happened to be incredibly patronizing. The white population as a percentage of the total population is falling for a number of reasons notably the much higher black rate first then emigration. Still they live longer lives than any other group in South Africa, make more money and live in better conditions than many people in the first world. Just because someone questions the fundamentals of the economy or tries to redress this so everyone can have a fairer share of the cake suddenly every white person will flee overseas only to come back to a Somalia after someone (read blacks has ruined the country).Should you feel guilty that some people think like this, of course not but if as you say there is a group of people who should have collective guilt why do so many white saffas feel blacks are going to get them sooner or later, why would they feel that unless there is something to feel guilty about?

Hi Evita, i'd like to think I am not racist but there is probably a bit lurking in me somewhere, sometimes I have a thought that is entirely against what I believe. This is a wonderfully insightful, intelligent article. I am glad I stumbled into it. This is so important. We do not get to chose where we are born, the colour of our skin, we have so much more in common but remain intent to focus on our differences. It is so much easier to hate than to examine 'what's this all about?' Keep up the good work.

The problem with human evolution is that the "races" that the Europeans developed in the early Modern Era don't actually line up to the molecular evidence. In general terms, there are two large groupings of humans; sub-Saharan Africans and everyone else. But you can cut that cake in so many ways, but at what point do rather insignificant differences in haplotypes between Inuit and Basque cease to have any great meaning?

Its not about claiming territory. Its about looking after ones own affairs and taking responsibility for the services (cultural, educational, religious etc) provided to and for respective groups, indivudually, something that can only result in further and direct accountability. Forcing people of different cultures, languages and ethnicities together have given us the Balkans. My partner is from one of the countries broken by artificial identity, and in Africa, the reality is that identity has and always will be far more important than it is for Europeans, who consider themselves enlightened. South Africa does not need to "evolve". It needs to split. Perhaps not geographically, but definitely politically. Confessionalism is the only way to go. We can choose our own paths. Foisting a false notion of unity and common identity is something that foreign powers chose for us, we did not choose it ourselves and as such have no need to abide by it.

This persistent notion of 'ethnic self-determination' cannot be realized without territory. South Africa's ethnic plurality is such a deeply interwoven mesh in time and space that no single ethnic community has ever been able to, nor would be able to, make a claim to territory that others don't have a rightful claim to. As a South African, whatever you conceive yourself to be ethnically, you cannot escape the temporal, spatial, and material reality which gives the lie to any simplistic 'we/them' dichotomy: We live amongst them who live amongst us who live amongst them. Fact. To pretend otherwise has already proved beyond any question not merely wrongheaded; it led to one of the most notorious and catastrophically inhumane episodes in modern history.Instead of 'ethnic self-determination', South Africa needs to evolve along the lines of 'Ethnic other-accommodation'.

I never claimed any moral superiority, nor did I use the words "non-racist". I left my country because of the modern horrors. The horrors of female friends and family being raped, your Grandparents being murdered on the farm and the constant immovable fear that your life is in mortal danger. Perhaps Apartheid had horrors, perhaps not. I don't really care. I didn't perpertrate any, nor did my family, nor anyone I know. I won't accept your notions of transferable guilt or "privilege". I know and knew my own horrific realities and I hold views on how to improve the lot for all of us, not just my own people, because I care deeply for Africa. You are free to self-flagellate and accept your and everybody else's culture, history and dignity being vilified and denigrated on the back of a failed, internationalist dogma, but I won't stand for it, and as you know, neither will most of my peers. I travel home often enough to know this to be true.

Legally protecting minorities is quite different to independence or autonomous self determination. A court would see them differently. The United Nations when all said and done is primarily about territories.

According to article 235 of the South African constitution, it permits, embraces and protects ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious self-determination. This same self-determination, which you label as ludicrous, was deemed so important that it is set out in article 1 of the United Nations charter - the very existance of nations is segregation, despite leftist hatred of real ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity. Furthermore, its predecessor, the League of Nations, included the self same concept in its covenant, in Article 22. These precepts were used, in international law, to establish Namibia, in its current context, as well as for the reunification of Germany, amongst many other important world events. UNPO, the organisation representing the unrepresented, is widely made up of African nations without their own political power, of which the Afrikaner is but one. Just because you happen to find self-determination an anachronism, does not invalidate it, nor does it conflate it with the political system that was Apartheid. I may not know everything, as you seem to, but I certainly know my way around a legal text. I conclude, the only way we will ever improve in Africa is if we embrace "good neighbourlyness" separately. I can no more write the rules for a Tshwana or a Venda, than they can for me or for each other.

Pray tell then, what is your solution? Firstly, let me rebut your insult, I am too young to have known Apartheid and old enough to know that it was unfair. I am also intimately aquainted with our continent and peoples. Our most peaceful neighbour is the only one who has managed to get things half right - Botswana. It is also, incidentally, the only country in Africa that is primarily ethnically homogenous. Your DA solutions and propositions don't work in South Africa, because the ideology is imported and cannot be forced to fit the native populations. Ethnic self-determination is not Apartheid and deliberately conflating the two is foolish and dishonest. South Africa is a colonial creation. If we had the opportunity to administer the country as confederation of equals, all serving their own needs and looking after their own administration, what could be bad about that? After all, its worked incredibly well for the Swiss. And before you go and be nasty again, for the Swiss, its a system, not an imported ideology like neo-liberalism.

As a white South Africa living in Europe, I find it disingenuous for the few white South Africans on the left, both Anglos and Afrikaners, to insist that we are part of Africa but somehow not part of its problems or shortcomings. Instead, we are a pastiche of neo-liberal, self-flagellating thought, straight out of Europe or America. Allow me to weigh in with some fact - we are not Europeans nor Americans. We do not think the same way, nor do we or should we subscribe to the same defeatest and masochistic laws and mores that they subject themselves to. We are African, yes. And with that comes all the tribalism and macho-superiority that is the blight of the continent. We cannot escape it by spouting platitudes and using imported reasoning. South Africans, white, black, coloured and indian are tribalists, not racists. And we are this way by virtue of our cultures, histories and circumstances. The only way to solve our problems is for ethnic self determination of each group within sub-saharan Africa. Not just the Afrikaners, Anglo-Africans, Xhosas or Zulus in South Africa, but also the other groups forced together through colonialism - the Matabele and the Shona in Zimbabwe for example. Only once we have achieved this, will we have peace. This is an African problem that requires African solutions, not limp social democratic European inanity.

Sorry Dirk, I missed your point here. Are you simply trying to remind us of your writing skills or was this all to make some sort of comparison regarding the treatment of migrants? If so SA has nothing good to teach anyone. If the comparison is with Apartheid you might find yourself supporting those who fear a foreign culture and value system being imposed on the Europeans "natives" by an immigrant minority.If the comparison is the mistreatment of illegal foreign migrants thankfully Europeans don't "necklace" migrants, at least not yet. Please don't get them started.
