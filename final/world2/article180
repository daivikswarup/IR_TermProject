Head of Isis chemical weapons program captured by US in Iraq last month

<p>US special forces captured a top chemical weapons engineer working for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/isis">Islamic State</a> during a raid last month in northern Iraq, officials said on Wednesday, dealing a blow to the militants’ pursuit of what Pentagon officials call “weapons of mass destruction”.<br/></p>

<p>Sleiman Daoud al-Afari was snatched close to a month ago in the town of Badoosh, north-west of the Isis stronghold of Mosul. A senior Iraqi official said he was an industrial engineer in former dictator Saddam Hussein’s military and had been a member of Isis throughout all its earlier incarnations.</p>

<p>Isis is believed to have used mustard gas at least twice against Kurdish forces in northern <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</a>, and once against anti-Assad rebels in northern Syria. The latter attack killed a four-year-old girl in the village of Merae, near the Turkish border. It was launched as Isis tried to move towards the Syrian border town of Azaz. At least six other residents of the village were hospitalized in Turkey after the attack, several with giant weeping blisters across their body.</p>

<p>It was also reported on Wednesday that more than 40 people suffered partial choking and skin irritation in northern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq">Iraq</a> on Tuesday when Isis fired mortar shells and Katyusha rockets filled with “poisonous substances” into their village.</p>

<p>Afari is reportedly in his 50s. Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi author and academic, said: “He is the technical expert on the chemical weapons project, but Taha Rahim al-Dulaimi is the ideological driver of this. He is an important figure within the organization.”</p>

<p>The prospect of Isis gaining large scale chemical weapons would raise the stakes significantly in Iraq, where a chemical attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja by Saddam’s forces in 1988 left thousands of people dead. The extremist group is believed to have set up a special unit for chemical weapons research, made up of Iraqi scientists from the Saddam-era weapons programme along with foreign experts.</p>

<p>Jeff Davis, a spokesman for the Pentagon, declined to confirm that an individual had been captured but noted: “We’ve said before that they have used chemical weapons in both Iraq and Syria: sulphur mustard specifically. Anyone who’s making and using weapons of mass destruction, particularly a terrorist group such as Isis, would be well advised to know that we don’t intend to let them keep doing that.”</p>

<p>Iraqi and US officials claimed Afari’s capture as the first known major success of a new strategy to deploy a commando unit to Iraq <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/01/us-military-expeditionary-force-isis-iraq-syria">dedicated to capturing and killing Isis leaders in clandestine operations</a>. Little is known about it, but defense secretary Ash Carter told a Senate hearing in December: “This is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things.”</p>

<p>The operation that captured Afari in late February did not result in casualties, according to a US official. Afari is held in a temporary US detention facility in Iraq ahead of an unscheduled transfer to Iraqi authorities.</p>

<p>The US-led coalition began targeting Isis’s chemical weapons infrastructure with airstrikes and special operations raids over the past two months, Iraqi intelligence officials and a western security official in Baghdad told the Associated Press. Airstrikes are targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids targeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the intelligence officials said.</p>

<p>Khaled al-Obaidi, the Iraqi defence minister, insisted that Isis, which seized swathes of territory in northern and western Iraq in 2014, lacks “chemical capabilities”. He told reporters at a base outside Tikrit that attacks carried out by the group are only intended to “hurt the morale of our fighters”, since they have not yet caused any casualties.</p>

<p>But reports on Wednesday said a village in northern Iraq had become the latest target of a chemical attack. None of the 40 casualties died but five of them remain in hospital, health officials in Taza, a mainly Shia Turkmen village 12 miles south of Kirkuk, told Reuters.</p>

<p>Kirkuk province governor Najmuddin Kareem was quoted as saying: “There were poisonous substances in these shells. We don’t know what.”</p>

<p>Using an alternative name for Isis, he added: “Daesh wants to scare off the population. They want to show they have chemical weapons just like the previous regime.”</p>

<p>A total of 24 shells and rockets were fired into Taza from the nearby Bashir area, added Wasta Rasul, a commander of the Kurdish peshmerga forces in the region.</p>

<p>Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said: “At this point, there has been some evidence and some discussion and even some reports about potential use of chemical weapons by Isil. We’re reviewing those reports.</p>

<p>“Obviously the use of chemical weapons by anybody is an atrocity and one that the international community will not stand for. However, if those reports are correct, it would not be an outlier in terms of the tactics that we know that Isil uses. We know that Isil is an extremist organisation that seeks to achieve their aims by terrorising innocent people.”</p>

<p>The US has been leading a coalition waging airstrikes against Isis in Iraq and Syria for more than a year. The campaign is working to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces that have slowly retaken significant parts of territory the militants had seized.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday, General Joseph Votel, the current commander of US Special Operations Command and tapped to lead US Central Command, told a Senate panel that he has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/us-isis-syria-strategy-central-command-nomination-joseph-votel">concerns about progress against Isis in Syria</a>. Throughout his confirmation hearing, Votel indicated he would take a more aggressive approach to the Middle East and South Asia than his cautious predecessor, General Lloyd Austin.</p>

<p>Votel said he would conduct a strategy review on Syria, to see if the US had “the coherence that is required, that we have the resources we need … and that we have the authorities,” suggesting an increase of troops or equipment could be a feature of his almost certain tenure at Central Command.<br/></p>

<p>Votel indicated that ousting Isis from the Iraqi city of Mosul and its Syrian capitol of Raqqa “will take additional resources.” Carter, the US defense secretary, has set the recapture of both cities as a critical goal for the war in 2016, a mission met with much scepticism surrounding its feasibility.</p>

Your whole point rests on whether the only way to know the whole truth is to get it from this one person. And that is absurd on its face! There are NUMEROUS ways to know the truth, and two huge ones are:1) the fact that no evidence of an active WMD program was ever found (no recent factories, no recent bomb-making equipment, and no actual recent weapons - the only stuff that was found was old, from the 80s): and2) the fact that WMD were never used against invading troops in the Iraq war. What dictator, in possession of a working WMD program, would fail to use them against invaders when his country is being taken away from him?

Your whole point rests on whether we already know the whole truth. For this to be true, you have to be CERTAIN that this chemical expert has already been interviewed etc.. You admit you are not sure of that. Therefore, it follows that you are not sure about all the facts. So every thing I said in my previous comment still stands (i.e. that ouch is still hurting!!)

It is quite obvious that the West is in no hurry to dispose of the jihadi terrorist threat in Syria and Iraq.Informed persons know this flagrant aggression by NATO countries, Arab despots, Turk megalomaniacs and Israeli doom-mongers was planned between Vichy Frenchmen and fascist Englishmen at Lancaster House in 2006, even before Martin Indyk, Zionist, compiled the war plan known as ‘Which Paths to Persia?’ at the Brookings Institution around 2007-8.In March 2011, Barack Obama obligingly launched the aggression, composed of rooftop snipers and murderers, execution squads targeting unarmed police, and faux-protesters, in Deraa and Homs.The serious death squads issued from CIA-MI6 camps in Jordan and Turkey. The camp at Iskanderun, just down the road from the NATO air base at Incirlik, is still operating. It is prepping mercenary terrorists, Syrian traitors and degenerate jihadists from all over the Islamist umma, to infiltrate into Syria, kill, steal, rape, starve, exile, destroy and create chaos, to cause the destruction of a nation-state which is a member of the UN, democratic, multi-faith and multi-cultural. As early as late 2011, English SAS were captured in Homs together with commandos from Qatar.Over 200,000 Syrian men, women and children have been slaughtered by the degenerates carrying their satellite phones, with which they can ring up their MI6 handler in Iskanderun, and find out where the Syrian Arab Army is, so they can evade justice and predate on unprotected Syrian civilians. This gives the imperialist minions at the Guardian a thrill as they tap out lies about barrel bombs, and blame Syria’s own heroic protectors for the massacres perpetrated by their proxy cannibals.The Guardio takes such distortions in their stride, recalling Beaverbrook and Maxwell, those lions of Judeo-Britannic causes. They pine for the old days when the globe was pink, and wish to work out on anyone who could conceivably be characterised as a lesser race. Syria’s ancient history and culture means nothing to these English barbarians.They smell oil, a pipeline anyway, paid for by Qatari oil money. Arms sales and military careers flourish as they protect drug empires, gangster oligarchies and oil-monarchies. Morals don’t matter.The tender sensibilities of the trendy lefty English must therefore be salved with a massive dose of pure Pommy bullshit. That’s where the Guardio comes in, doing what it knows best.The noble and brave Syrian people have comprehensively rejected the vile takfiris marshalled by Perfide Albion, and are killing them all. While they have paid a heavy price, this war has cost England its soul.http://levantreport.com/2015/05/19/2012-defense-intelligence-agency-document-west-will-facilitate-rise-of-islamic-state-in-order-to-isolate-the-syrian-regime/

Its irrelevant because this is 2016 and by now we ALREADY KNOW precisely what Saddam's weapons programme and capability was - it was basically nonexistent at the time we invaded, we know that now. It was evident from the fact Saddam never used them against us, it was evident from the fact we never found any evidence of an active programme (just an old, defunct one that long predated the 2003 invasion) AND it was evident from interviewing people like him after the war, (and perhaps including him, who knows?) who DID have first hand knowledge.

Andre, Qadaffi was a terrorist responsible for numerous terrorist attacks against the US since Ronald Reagan. He had ties to Deash and in 2009, in a speech at the UN, he denounced the UN, and in 2011, began a an armed military campaign in Libya against unarmed civilian protestors, sparking a civil war.
