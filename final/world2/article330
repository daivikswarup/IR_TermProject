Russia ‘stoking refugee unrest in Germany to topple Angela Merkel’




DateTime::::2016-03-05T21:02:38+0000



<p>Russia is trying to topple Angela Merkel by waging an information war designed to stir up anger in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany">Germany</a> over refugees, Nato’s most senior expert on strategic communications has claimed.</p>

<p>The attempt to provoke the removal of the German leader, who has been a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/02/obama-merkel-warn-russia-economic-sanctions-ukraine">strong supporter of sanctions</a> against Vladimir Putin’s regime, is said to have been identified by Nato analysts.</p>

<p>Jānis Sārts, director of Nato’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, based in Riga, Latvia, told the <em>Observer</em> that Russia had a track record of funding extremist forces in Europe, and that he believed there was now evidence of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> agitating in Germany against Merkel.</p>

<p>Insisting that he could talk only as an expert, and not as a spokesman for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nato">Nato</a>, Sārts said: “[Russia] is establishing a network that can be controlled. You can use it as they have tried to do in Germany, combined with the legitimate issue of refugees, to undercut political processes in a very serious way. Angela Merkel has been a very adamant supporter of continued sanctions against Russia. If it was just punishment, that would be OK – but it is testing whether they can build on pre-existing problems and create a momentum where there is political change in Germany.</p>

<p>“I think they test whether they can – in such a big country, with not so many vulnerabilities in normal times – actually create a circumstance through their influence where there is a change of top leadership. They are using Russian speakers, social media, trying to build on the existing faultlines. Use the far right narrative and exploit that.”</p>

<p>Sārts, who has access to intelligence briefings, added: “In general terms, you can trace Russian funding to the extreme forces in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>. Either left or right – as long as they are extreme, they are good to come into the Russian picture as of possible use in their tactics.”</p>

<p>More than 1 million refugees – many from war-torn Syria – have arrived in Germany over the past year, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/refugee-crisis-pushes-support-for-germanys-angela-merkel-to-four-year-low">many attracted by Merkel’s claim that she would not put a limit on the number who could settle in the country</a>.</p>

<p>The movement of people has fed the rise of the rightwing populist party Alternative für Deutschland, with a recent poll suggesting 81% of German citizens believe Merkel has lost control of the situation. Voter sentiment will be tested for the first time since the crisis on 13 March, when elections are held in three of Germany’s 16 regions – Sachsen-Anhalt, Rheinland-Pfalz and Baden-Württemberg.</p>

<p>Sārts, who before his Nato appointment last year was the most senior civil servant in Latvia’s ministry of defence, said that the impact of Russia’s attempt to stir up unrest in Germany was being diminished because the problem had been discovered, but he warned that other countries were turning a blind eye to Putin’s propaganda war.</p>

<p>He said: “We saw it in Germany. The best misinformation tool is when your opponent doesn’t notice. That is when it is most effective. I would submit that there are a number of countries who have not yet noticed, or have chosen not to notice.”</p>

This is all just part of the new world order agenda, divide and conquer. The Rothschild and Bilderberg groups final stages of agenda21 are playing out before our very eyes. They are deliberately crashing the American economy which affects every one of us due to the petrodollar, all oil and gold are bought and sold with the US dollar, when it happens Obama will declare martial law and foreign UN forces will move in to start the depopulation process.... Mass executions on an unimaginable global scale to reduce the world population to below half a billion people, and they are not even hiding the fact that this is going to happen.....the Georgia guide stones.

I have little doubt that Putin would like to see Merkel go. Russia may even support actions that would further that aim. No surprise there. But, ultimately, Merkel will stand or fall based on her own actions. Russia realistically has very little leverage over Germany.

And I should take what you say as fact? Seeing as how you are judging these "nobodies", yet I should go on the word of you and the 5 people you know? Just read these comments section, on any article. The standard line is always about how evil and terrible the US is, and how Putin is such a smart leader, and blah blah blah.

Putin is bombing civilians in Syria to ensure that the refugee crisis continues. This is entirely logical and justifiable in Putin's mind. This is why he is the most dangerous man in Europe since Hitler.

Seriously? Surely, Angela Merkel has been the architect of her own downfall, what with the unealthy obsession towards Every Closer Union, being prepared to sacrifice the stability of the EU at the Grand Altar of the Euro, and her merkelin attitude. We dont need to indulge any accusations against Putin...Merkel is her own worst enemy, and the sooner she retires the better.

Putin has made more sense for a while now. Given what the USA has had its hands in in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt I am no longer able to support it. In the past I did not question this very much as policy was pursued on a "nationalist" basis. Now it is quite obvious the globalists are in control and they have absolutely no conscience whatsoever. cough cough George Soros cough cough

On Richard Flanagan's moving piece about the plight of refugees in the Lebanon, most of them said they ran from Da'esh and their homes being destroyed by the Assad/Russian campaign of bombing against the areas they hold. None said they wouldn't like to return when the bombing stops. None said that they hated their life under Assad, contrary to the EU and Guardian propaganda, which keeps telling us the Russians are not bombing Da'esh.

So what? Its ok for the US and Nato and the EU to destabilize the middle east, but Russia is supposed to keep hands off???? I think if Russia is doing just as they say it is, then good for them, Germany has a habit of shutting down any thinking that is opposed to the the government and its mainstream media shills. Its over for Germany anyways, in 10 years no one will recognize it, and you can bet that NATO will be out of that country too, and not because its no longer needed. It will forced out by the New Germany.

It's no wonder that the west were ok with Russia only during the 1990s when Russia was weak and collapsing, now when Putin has built up a strong army again the west could no longer accept Russia and thus sanctions was used to try to weaken Russia again but no matters the economic problems Russia will always have the backbone and will to resist, the sanctions will not stop Russia from continuing to expand and be a strong military power.

Outrageous statement by NATO considering Putin doesn't have to lift a finger to discredit Merkel.. she's done it all to herself... sitting in Germany, beckoning to migrants with come-one-come-all and knowing full well that they will.. meanwhile expecting other countries in the EU to do the screening for Germany. She dumps a busload of migrants on a village of less than 1000 with the occupants of the bus the people there with middle fingers, the New Years Eve attacks in Cologne, and now she wants to quash any resistance by banning the NPD. It's not that long ago that she was called the bully and boss of the EU.. and above her?

Obviously the Ukrainian government couldn't organise polling in areas occupied by the Russians or under the control of separatists. Pro-russian parties did stand in the 2014 election - the Ukraine Socialist Party for example. What parties do you think were banned?

Rubbish. they dont need Putin to cause instability. Its the situation itself that will cause insatbility.The numbers of refugees and their attitudes to women etc will cause the instability. Merkel has only herself to blame.Once again, awful substandard writing by Guardian bias. This paper is not what it used to be.

The stats I provided are actually from the UNHCR (or the refugee agency as you put it). They were last updated in January 2016. These combined with the Eurostat asylum applications are the most accurate picture we can get as to the make up of refugees. I don't know if you didn't read them, or instead think that the wall street journal in September 2015 had more accurate information - but I assure you, that the picture of the crisis you painted in your post, is not what the evidence is suggesting. Not all are fleeing war - many are fleeing oppression. But look at the countries you yourself listed, and ask yourself if any of those are suffering from war or oppressive governments? Your stats on Gender make-up are incorrect (possibly outdated - I can't remember if they differed in Sept 15). I have also given you a reason why the majority are men. You have not addressed these points.
