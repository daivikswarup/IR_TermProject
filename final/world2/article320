Ukrainian pilot on hunger strike attacks 'farce' of Russian trial




DateTime::::2016-03-09T09:16:13+0000



<p><br/>Every defendant in Russian trials gets a “last word” – a final statement to the court before the judge retires to consider the verdict. </p>

<p>Ukrainian military pilot Nadiya Savchenko accompanied her statement on Wednesday by jumping on to the bench and giving the judge the middle finger, before singing the Ukrainian national anthem.</p>

<p>The hearing came five days after Savchenko began a hunger strike that she has pledged to continue unless she is returned to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>. <br/></p>

<p></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> proceeded with the trial of Nadiya Savchenko despite widespread international condemnation. Last week prosecutors demanded a sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Savchenko wrote out <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/ukrainian-pilot-nadiya-shavchenko">her statement</a> in advance, which was posted on Facebook before the hearing in the southern Rostov region. On Wednesday she delivered her speech to the court via an interpreter.</p>

<p>“It is an absurd situation when those who abduct people, subject them to torture then act as if they have a right to judge them,” she said. “How can one talk about a fair trial? In Russia, there are no trials or investigations; only a farce played out by Kremlin puppets. And I find it superfluous to waste time in my life participating in it.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/ukrainian-pilot-nadiya-shavchenko">'I will return home, dead or alive,' says Ukrainian pilot on trial in Russia</a> </p>

<p>Savchenko has declared a number of hunger strikes during her nearly two years in Russian captivity, but after last week’s hearing she declared she would go on full hunger strike, refusing both food and fluids, until she was returned to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>

<p>“My life will be draining away and Russia will return me to Ukraine in any case – it will return me, dead or alive,” she wrote in the statement. </p>

<p>Russia has agreed that a team of Ukrainian doctors can examine Savchenko in jail. Health complications arising from a full hunger strike are often life-threatening after a week. </p>

<p>Her lawyer Nikolai Polozov said after Wednesday’s hearing that she was already suffering from tachycardia and fever, and if Russia did not at least announce that Savchenko could return to Ukraine after the verdict, the consequences could be dire.</p>

<p>Prosecutors claim Savchenko directed an artillery strike that resulted in the deaths of two Russian television journalists in June 2014. Savchenko, a military pilot, was serving on the ground with a volunteer battalion during the conflict in east Ukraine. The prosecutors say Savchenko was detained in Russia after crossing the border disguised as a refugee. </p>

<p>However, Savchenko has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/ukrainian-pilot-nadia-savchenko-russian-court">said</a> she was captured by pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine and then handed over to Russian troops, who took her across the border. Her defence team says there is clear evidence to show she was already in captivity at the time of the artillery strike she is accused of directing.</p>

<p>At the weekend Savchenko’s mother, Maria, issued an emotional <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wchZj5NfB-U">video appeal</a> to world leaders to put pressure on Russia to free her daughter. “I’m so nervous, I forgot what it’s like to sleep,” she said. “I pray, help us. Save her from that jail. Put all your efforts towards it,” she said.</p>

<p>On Monday, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, called on Russia to release Savchenko, saying her detention showed a “disregard for international standards, as well as for Russia’s commitments under the Minsk agreements”.</p>

<p>In a withering response to Kerry posted on Facebook on Tuesday evening, the foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said his statement was so misinformed that she suspected it was fake. Savchenko’s case was not covered by the Minsk agreements, she wrote. She also upbraided the US for holding a number of Russians such as the arms dealer Viktor Bout and pointed out the continuing detention without trial of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay.</p>

<p>Savchenko has become a national hero in much of Ukraine, where she was made an MP in elections last year and appointed to the parliamentary assembly of the Council of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>, but the international outcry has so far had little effect on Russian authorities. A group of Ukrainian MPs attempting to travel to the court for Wednesday’s hearing was detained for questioning at a Moscow airport and they missed their connecting flight to Rostov.</p>

<p>Another of Savchenko’s lawyers, Mark Feygin, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/20/russia-ukraine-pilot-savchenko">wrote</a> in the Guardian last year that the goal of the trial was to “use her as a propaganda tool against the new government in Kiev”. He said he believed the trial was politicised and would result in a guilty verdict, but he hoped Savchenko would be exchanged soon afterwards, possibly for Russian soldiers captured in east Ukraine. </p>

<p>After Savchenko’s statement on Wednesday, the judge retired to consider the verdict and sentencing, which are due on 21 March.<br/></p>

<p>Savchenko is the highest-profile Ukrainian prisoner being held in a Russian jail on charges that many activists say are politicised. Last August the Crimean film-maker Oleg Sentsov was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/19/ukrainian-filmmaker-oleg-sentsov-russian-court-suffer-or-die-for-his-beliefs">put on trial</a> in Rostov and found guilty of plotting terrorist acts in response to the Russian seizure of Crimea. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and is currently believed to be in Siberia. </p>

<p>Also in jail is 73-year-old Yury Soloshenko, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rferl.org/content/ukrainian-gets-six-year-prison-term-russia-spying-soloshenko/27307123.html">sentenced</a> to six years for espionage in a closed trial. <br/></p>

The laws in the US may not be all they should be, but the US certainly has rule of law and an independent judiciary.

The explanation is that she was a member of a fascist paramilitary group trapped inside pro-Russian rebel territory, where she was in danger of capture and execution.The claim is she intended to sneak through Russia and make her way back to the West.

Mark Feigin, Nadia Savchenko’s lawyer: by GPS data and mobil phone data Savchenko was seized two hours before the death of that journalists. Do you want to know more about russian justice?

Trying to rewrite history? The ato started when strelkov took over police stations and weapons in sloviansk . Are you saying he and his soldiers are east Ukrainian? It was an obvious attack from a neighboring country to send these terrorists to destabilize Ukraine for not wanting to have a Kremlin style kleptocrat as a leader anymore.

Surely they could have come up with a better reason for her to be on Russian soil. I mean, why on earth would an officer in the Ukrainian military try entering Russia as a refugee?

I think you'll find that a large percentage of commenters on this website were disgusted with the US "extraordinary rendition" policy, as well as with our own government's collusion.

If you check a map, you'll see that there is also a Donetsk in Russia close to the Ukrainian border.

That was my though too, but there is town called Donetsk in the Rostov oblast of Russia. It's about 200km East of Donetsk, Ukraine.

Russia has no right to intervene in the internal affairs of Ukraine, which is why Putin has been sneaking troops across the Russo-Ukrainian border with the identifying national insignia removed from their uniforms.

And one million have left the ukraine to live in Russia as refugees. Whether you like it or not russia has become a super power again and ukraine is nothing, in debt to the IMF and the US for ever. The EU stated last week that it would take 20 or more years to become part of europe. Your traitors and fascists run the govt, ukraine is in the middle ages again and the people suffer for what?

Don't you think that if you want to stand up and be counted for some cause, it would only be smart to choose a cause that could be widely recognised as honourable, principled and deserving of respect? To portray as a heroine, and to pin your flag to someone who seems clearly to be little more than neo-nazi scum seems, to me, to be just dumb, and it shouldn't surprise you therefore if you end up being judged by the company you have chosen to keep.

Not of Russia's doing but it's bombing civilians but Ukraine is of Russia's doing so blaming Ukrainians for fighting Russians doesn't make any sense.

"Debatable the government is legit, certainly waging war on Ukrianin people who don't recognise the government, it took power after a coup, is criminal."1. The KIev government is recognized as legitimate by every country in the world.2. The Syrian government has done exactly the same thing on a much greater scale, massacring hundreds of thousands of its own people, yet according to the Kremlin is still legitimate.
