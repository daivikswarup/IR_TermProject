Irish election results show Fine Gael misread public mood




DateTime::::2016-02-28T17:02:11+0000



<p>Now that the votes have been counted, the only thing left is to try to interpret what the Irish voters have said. </p>

<p>One of the benefits of a proportional representation system is that it allows Irish voters to deliver multiple messages, and they have certainly done that. The clearest message has been sent to Enda Kenny’s Fine Gael party, whose campaign slogan “Keep the Recovery Going” had no resonance with the more than 60% of people who say they have not experienced its benefits.</p>

<p>For them, the recovery is something happening in parts of Dublin. It is no coincidence that these are the areas where the swing against Fine Gael was weakest.</p>

<p>Fine Gael misread the mood of the people. Its promise to scrap the universal social charge (USC), a graduated tax on all income over €13,000, was the biggest single election giveaway ever – and seen as a misstep when hospital waiting lists and vital social services are being cut.</p>

<p>The public has learned the lessons of the economic crash and favours improving social services and having a rainy day fund over the lure of more money to spend.</p>

<p>While Fine Gael’s campaign – which closely mirrored the 2015 Tory campaign in the UK, even repeating the awful “long-term economic plan” line – missed the public mood, Fianna Fáil managed to catch it.</p>

<p>The party’s campaign was built on the twin slogans of a fairer recovery and an “Ireland for All”. While Kenny was seen only at carefully choreographed, voter-free events, the Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, was out and about engaging with voters.</p>

<p>Martin was also the hands-down winner of the three televised party leaders’ debates. As a result, Fianna Fáil – deemed an irrelevance only a year ago – came within 1.2 points of Fine Gael in the public vote, having lagged 19 points behind in the 2011 election.</p>

<p>Not even the most optimistic of Fianna Fáil supporters would have publicly predicted this result last year. The party’s growing support seems to have escaped most observers’ attention, perhaps because Martin and his team set about working calmly on the ground.</p>

<p>This approach contrasted with that of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sinn-fein">Sinn Féin</a>, which once again failed to convert the capitulation of the vote for one of its rivals into an equal gain for itself.</p>

<p>This was the case in 2011 when Sinn Féin gained nine of the 51 seats lost by Fianna Fáil, and it appears to be the case again this time, as the party looks like picking up eight or nine of the 30 or more seats lost by Labour.</p>

<p>Its 13.8% support was nowhere near the 18-19% suggested in the polls only a few weeks ago, and the reluctance of more people to join its “Rising”, as Sinn Féin labelled its campaign, is a blow in this the centenary year of 1916. Despite Sinn Féin’s shouting, this time it is not the story.</p>

Someone who claims to be a resident of Northern Ireland is unaware of armed gangs such as the UVF and UDA, Ulster Resistance or the LVF? Has never heard of the Shankill Butchers, Billy Wright, Johnny Adair?I call bullshit.

The Orange people aren't an armed gang; their zealotry tends more toward religion and Crown. Some 'Loyalists' are, as you say, pretty nasty, but nothing like as malignant as the Provos and their fellow travellers. I've served as a soldier in Northern Ireland and now live here, and have seen at first hand the brutal nature of both their street gangsters and the 'leadership'. None of them are people to be trusted with anything other than a prison blanket.

" only to settle in 1998 for what had been on offer in 1974."Hardline Unionists and Loyalist paramilitaries brought down the Sunningdale agreement and the principle of consent was not on the table in '74.Up until 1998 British policy was that '"it had become a matter of first-class strategic importance...that the North should continue to form part of His Majesty's dominions". The Report into the Ireland Act 1949 stated that it indeed seemed "unlikely that Great Britain would ever be able to agree to Northern Ireland secession even if the people of Northern Ireland desired it."

They are a political party in precisely the same way that NSDAP was; as the WPK and Hamas is. They are not an appropriate organisation in any sort of democracy. Ask any of them which 'Army' is their national defence force, and consider how transparently they are funded.

SF PR? Good God no - I intensely dislike the Provos, who cost Ireland dear and held the country back for decades only to settle in 1998 for what had been on offer in 1974. But assuming that they are somehow uniquely malevolent and unique to Ireland is utterly myopic and stupid - plenty of other countries have suffered from political movements just as bad or worse.

They still have their balaclavas, though, and a lot of other means of enforcing their opinion, don't they? Are you so naïve as to think that an extreme revolutionary socialist gang such as this want anything other than power (not 'office')? The attitude displayed toward the courts, the press, the rape victims, the murder victims is not that which a normal party would or could display in any other country. That this takes place in a Western democracy is bad enough, but that the leadership remains out of prison is shameful.

It's very possible that FF will draw in the Independent vote by out Healy-Raeing the Healy-Rae's etc. over the next few elections. FG will probably subside to SF levels.Soc Dems will probably outlast their founding personalities, not so sure about AAA-PBP.Only gene-pool Independents seem capable of tearing FF&FG down.

SF have built themselves a solid niche. To break through the wall they will have to have a split which jettisons the cruddier IRA elements, and a rebranding like Dev did with Fianna Fáil. They'll then have to copperfasten the split with a metaphorical hanging of a former comrade (unlike Dev's literal hanging).Until they're ready for that, they'll remain an irrelevant side-show.

I think SF made the biggest miscalculation electorally. They are trying to be 'respectable', but they should have been more radical - they allowed a ragtag of bunch of ex-student Trots and eccentrics to take too much of the 'anyone but that lot' left wing vote which seems to be around 30% or so of the electorate now.

Yes, its a bizarre article, it's just FF propaganda, the Observer is just too lazy to know what its published here. FF had a moderately good election, but are still a pale shadow of their formers selves. Although listening to some of their new TD's on the radio it doesn't sound like they realise it. The real news here is that the combined traditional centre-right had less than 50% of the vote for the first time and only slightly above it if you count the now pointless Renua.

What makes you think they're crying? They increased their vote, have their largest ever phalanx of TDs and will either be in Government or else be the main voice of Opposition. Either way, they will be quite pleased with the result - not as good as they might have hoped for, but they will look at where they started from in 1997 and very likely the fluid on the balaclavas will be fizzy wine, not tears.

Fianna Fail are the party of cheerful, physically powerful men who tend to have weather-beaten complexions and drink too much, especially on children's allowance day. Fine Gael is the party mainly supported by the long-suffering wives of such men and the wives' parents, who could never see why She settled for Him. The Anti Austerity Alliance is supported by disgruntled adolescents who are no good at sports. Sinn Fein is supported by even angrier teenagers who are very good at sports. The Social Democrats represent the sports teachers. Labour is, as the name suggests, composed largely of prosperous middle-class people who play golf. Renua is the only political party in Europe which recruits uniquely from serving Catholic clergy who inherited land from unmarried relatives. The Green Party is a paramilitary movement of fanatical Irish Nationalists who practice armed drills in the mountains and live on soda bread and ox-blood sausages.

Representing coming "within 1.2 points of Fine Gael in the public vote" as a victory for Fianna Fail is not something any FF leader from Dev to Reynolds would have found comprehensible. It's really a terrible blow for the Irish political Establishment, which has seen its share of the vote slump massively since 2007. And the fizzling out of Renua, compared to the reasonable performance of AAA, Social Democrats and Greens, suggests that the Irish electorate are steadily moving left. If SF were able to purge themselves of the Adams-era leadership, they would very likely have done even better than they did - ironically, since they are basically the new Fianna Fail.

Hadn't realised the extent of the FG tax-cutting proposals. It's heartening to see that many Irish voters apparently rejected those, rather than pocketing the cash and hoping the cuts to public services affected someone else.
