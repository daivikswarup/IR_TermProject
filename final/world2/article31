Former Putin press minister died of blow to head in Washington hotel

<p>The mystery surrounding the death of Vladimir Putin’s former press minister in a Washington hotel deepened on Thursday when an autopsy revealed blunt force injuries to his head.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/vladimir-putin-ally-found-dead-in-washington-hotel">Police investigate after Putin ally Mikhail Lesin found dead in Washington hotel</a> </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/07/vladimir-putin-ally-found-dead-in-washington-hotel">Mikhail Lesin’s body was found</a> in November in a room at the Dupont Circle Hotel, in an upmarket neighbourhood that contains foreign embassies and policy thinktanks. Russia’s RT television quoted family members at the time as saying he had died of a heart attack after long-term illnesses.</p>

<p>But on Thursday the DC medical examiner’s office said Lesin, 59, had blunt force injuries to the head, neck, torso, arms and legs. The manner of death remained “undetermined”, the office’s statement said, and the incident is still under police investigation.</p>

<p>After news of the medical examiner’s report broke, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry, wrote on Facebook that the Russian embassy in Washington had asked several times to be informed about the inquiry into the circumstances of Lesin’s death but had been told nothing.<br/></p>

<p>“We are waiting for Washington to give us the relevant information and official data about the investigation,” Zakharova wrote. </p>

<p>“If the information published today in the media is true, the Russian authorities will send their American counterparts a request for international legal assistance.”</p>

<p>Yury Melnik, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Washington, echoed Zakharova when he said in a statement: “In the past several months the Russian embassy … repeatedly requested through diplomatic channels information regarding the progress of investigation of the death of the Russian citizen. No substantial information has been provided.”</p>

<p>Lesin was a powerful figure on the Russian political scene but lived most of his life in the shadows. While anyone in the political or media world knew him or at least knew his reputation, he was not a household name and rarely spoke publicly.</p>

<p>“Everything gets stranger and stranger,” Alexei Venediktov, the editor in chief of Ekho Moskvy radio wrote on Twitter about the news that Lesin had died of a blow to the head. The liberal radio station had been part of the Gazprom Media empire which Lesin controlled, and the pair had a public bust up over editorial policy in 2014.</p>

<p>The mysterious circumstances of his death have led to a range of conspiracy theories, some more plausible than others. Some Russian bloggers have suggested Lesin could be in a witness protection programme having agreed to pass information to the Americans about the Russian elite, with his death being faked to throw <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> off the scent. Others noted that he was known to be a heavy smoker and drinker and suggested the death could have come about as a result of a fight or some other personal incident.</p>

<p>Known as a tough and ambitious political operator, Lesin broke the stranglehold of the oligarchs on Russian media and ushered in the era in which the Kremlin controlled all major television stations. In 2013, he became the head of Gazprom Media, one of Russia’s largest media holdings.<br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/17/worlddispatch.russia">He was press minister between 1999 and 2004</a>, and is credited with the idea of setting up <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.rt.com/">Russia Today</a>, the English-language Kremlin-funded channel which has grown over the past decade to become a major international station.</p>

<p>He quit Gazprom Media unexpectedly in 2015, and for some time rumours of illness swirled. After his death, Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of Russia Today, wrote that Lesin lost 30kg (66lb) after breaking his spine in 2012, and was known as a heavy smoker and drinker.</p>

<p>“It’s been a long time since I was scared by the word propaganda,” Lesin said in 2007, according to Russia Today’s website. “We need to promote Russia internationally. Otherwise, we’d just look like roaring bears on the prowl.”</p>

<p>Last year the Mississippi senator Roger Wicker called for Lesin to be investigated on suspicion of money laundering and corruption. He allegedly amassed millions of dollars in assets in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> and the US while working for the Russian government, including $28m in Los Angeles real estate.</p>

<p>Wicker wrote: “That a Russian public servant could have amassed the considerable funds required to acquire and maintain these assets in Europe and the United States raises serious questions.”</p>

<p>Lesin left a wife and two children, including a daughter who is a bureau chief with Russia Today.</p>

But killing the founder of RT doesn't stop RT from broadcasting, so your idea is lacking in substance.

Putin embarrass himself, he really doesn't need help from the West to do that. And his regime repeatedly commits crimes against Humanity, just peruse the Guardian pages to learn about things like Russia's Air force bombing Syrian hospitals for example. Or widespread doping and cheating by Russian athletes.

It is not surprising they are releasing very little information. I'm sure the Feds are involved to a degree helping with the investigation, it is far too big of a case that it would just be left with the D.C. police. It's interesting the idea of a faked death. I mean after all what is the best way to be safe from Putin, have him think you are dead but it is definitely in the realms of conspiracy and needs to be taken with skepticism. To me the fact they are telling of the injuries shows that they are treating it as a murder. Anyone who knows anything about forensic pathology knows that injuries on the extremities with a blunt force fatal head trauma indicates a fight and a murder.

Putin and Russians are two different things, no matter how RT tries to make you believe that Vovka is Russia, just like Goebbels instructed the German during nazi times that people that Hitler and Germany where one and the same.But yeah, Putin continuously discredits Russia with his actions, and by accepting his presence in power they (and yourself, because you are a Russian) act as accomplices and passively promote this criminal regime.Cheers!

Free media is essencial for democracy, but you seem to be unaware that there is debate in Russia - TV, radio, papers, the Internet of course, all are involved. Corruption, Ukraine, sanctions, government, healthcare, other issues. You seem to think it all boils down to 'Putin cronies', but I can't care less about Timchenko, Echos are preoccupied with this sort of thing, not me. I'm more concerned about educational standards, or local healthcare facilities to which Rottenberg has nothing to do. Skvortsova and Livanov do, more likely. But I can't care less about Yashin's grievances. And I can hear what you post in Russian on Echo or even on RTR, so?

Nice try. But you seem to forget that anyone that has been murderer deserves justice, even if he was a member of despicable Putin's corrupt parasitic oligarchs, and Putin himself a sorry excuse for a human still deserves to have a trial before we condemn him for his crimes..and not because he is ugly or ignorant or believes in some kind of corrupt church.And you got it wrong, people in the West have sympathy for justice, and not for the obnoxious Putin's stooge tha got "neutralized", something that the zombified captive audience inside Mordor can't understand, mainly because RT's relentless propagandist attack on truth. Isn't that somewhat ironic?Cheers!

We can all speculate about events whose details are hidden from us. What's offensive, though, is when idle speculation is presented as assertions of truth.

"TV activities" means that at the time when USSR had been betrayed by the Soviet top brass he played one of the key parts: he was responsible exactly for TV, the tool that enabled Eltsyn and his gang to effectively manipulate local public. I'm a citizen of USSR and from my point of view this is a good reason for the above suggestions.

I think Donald Trump is an utter idiot, no fan of Clinton either, no fan of Cameron, no fan of Corbyn... BUT you are missing my point... It's for the journalists to debate, it's for civil society to debate... If one of them is corrupt and are there to serve us, then the media has every right to attack them...

So answer the question. What would happen. I know Ukrainians want their land back. I would too, but one must also use logic. Would the Crimeans be law abaiding Ukrainian citizens? Or would it cause Ukraine more problems than it is worth?

First, I'm not Russian. Second I didn't disagree. I asked a logical question. I am reading about the war of northern aggression (american civil war) and a period called the reconstruction. What the union had to do in order to bring the south back into the fold. So, I ask again. What would happen.

I agree with Russia. War should be the last choice. But,when you go to war, you bring the sword. None of this pansy RoE crap. Screw Geneva, win. That is the objective. If we went to war with Germany this way in WW2, we would have lost.

There are plenty of Russian politicians with economic game plans Vladimir.. Even some of Putin's old cronies, such as Kudrin and many others... The problem is, is that the game is fixed and centred around Putin and a small group of his friends. So it doesn't matter if someone has a great idea, it's if that idea is in the interests of the ruling regime... To have people like you want, who you can support, they need air time. They need a free T.V, where they can get their message to the masses. They need democratic laws and an independent rule of law to have any chance of anything...

If Russia really wanted to, they could pulverize Ukraine. Isn't that why Ukraine wants in NATO? Having fighting spirit is great. But, don't underestimate your opponent. Especially when they are more powerful than you are. Putin doesn't advance more because he knows that sanctions will bring him to his knees, and possibly make him lose power. Trust me, it has nothing to do with Ukraines military.

Well, he is correct. Given how the people feel, what would happen if Crimea was returned? Would they be law abiding Ukrainian citizens? Would Ukraine have its own Chechnya? Would the Ukrainians force an exodus on the Crimeans? How normal would things be? Once the worms out it is difficult to get them back in the can.

It takes something more to become a real political figure, not just crying about corruption as everyone does it in Russia. I say show me a viable political and economic plan, that's what I mean. No rioting, no stupid revolutions, something boringly effective. Until then - sorry, but a can agree on him being nationalistic.
