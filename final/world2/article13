<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland">Ireland</a> has entered new constitutional territory after its parliament failed to elect a prime minister and government following last month’s inconclusive general election.</p>

<p>The Dáil, the Irish parliament, sat on Thursday to try to elect a taoiseach and agree on the formation of a fresh coalition – but incumbent <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/enda-kenny">Enda Kenny</a> fell far short of the votes needed to become prime minister and form an administration.</p>

<p>The outgoing Fine Gael-Labour coalition government, which imposed austerity measures in Ireland during the economic crisis, was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/ireland-general-election-voters-go-polls-as-hung-parliament-predicted">punished by voters in the election</a>, losing its majority despite a now fast-growing economy and falling unemployment rate. </p>

<p>On Thursday, as Kenny failed to amass the 79 votes needed to be reappointed taoiseach, new figures revealed that Ireland’s growth rate for 2016 would be close to 8% – the highest in the European Union. </p>

<p>The figures were not so good for Kenny, who managed to scrape up only 57 votes from his party, Fine Gael, and Labour. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/irish-election-enda-kenny-plans-to-form-government-despite-losing-voters">Fine Gael lost 26 seats</a> in the 26 February election and now has 50. </p>

<p>Negotiations to break the deadlock and form a government are now likely to continue at least until Easter.</p>

<p>Kenny <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/fianna-fail-ceasefire-will-allow-kenny-to-continue-as-taoiseach">will remain as caretaker taoiseach</a> for St Patrick’s Day on 17 March, and is expected to take the salute during commemorations at the end of the month for the centenary of the Easter Rising against British rule.</p>

<p>Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, the two main parties in Irish politics, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/fianna-fail-rules-out-fine-gael-coalition-irish-election">are still ruling out creating a historic “grand coalition”</a>. The Sinn Féin MP Pearse Doherty challenged them both on Thursday to “end the charade” and form a government together, but Fianna Fáil sources are adamant the party will not walk into a coalition that would leave Sinn Féin as the main opposition force in Ireland. </p>

<p>The FF leader, Micheál Martin, said: “We didn’t get a mandate to go into government with Fine Gael and we certainly didn’t get a mandate to put Fine Gael back into government.”</p>

<p>FF sources have said they want a “political ceasefire” that would allow Fine Gael to cobble together a minority administration propped up by independent Dáil deputies.</p>

<p>One of the many non-party independents recently elected, Danny Healy-Rae from Kerry, said the Dáil was “like a wedding but the bride and groom haven’t shown up”. </p>

Have to agree with Stechginster, I'd take Kenny over Cameron anyday. Cameron is all show with little if any substance.

Stephen Donnelly sounded good and I'm not a right wing voter, but if I had to choose, I'd prefer Enda Kenny to Cameron any day of the week.

The people of Kerry should hang their heads in shame and I genuinely mean that. Those two buffoons have absolutely no interest in what is good for Ireland, only what is good to keep them in power.And I add my own county Tipperary to the hall of shame for electing Lowry. How people can vote for seriously dodgy, brown ebvelope, self interested, tax dodging politicans like the Healey Rae's, Lowry, Wallace, etc is beyond me.

No, it has happened before in 89 with the Fianna Fail/PD coalition and also in 69? I think so not brand new territory but pretty rare.

They are. You just aren't familiar with the Irish language. Irish orthography is far more consistent than English, regional variations notwithstanding.

Ireland is a far wealthier country than France and more expensive, especially house prices which is the main cost any person has. Your average Irish person has a disposable income most French come no where near.

The Normans were total bandits invited over to sort out who was going to rule Leinster. Finding themselves basically unopposed they decided to stay. Cromwell only finished what they started. As for being Brits, They had only been in Britain for a few decades, having arisen in Normandy, being descended from Vikings. Brian Boru defeated the Danes only to postpone the seemingly inevitable. There were no leaders capable of uniting the Irish against the Normans, and that's why they easily established themselves. They took advantage of petty squabbles and dealt ruthlessly with the opposition.

It's hilarious. All the FF'ers walking around like they won the election. Their second worst ever electoral result (second only to 2011) sees them too small to lead any coalition as the dominant party, their only option being a coalition of equals at best with FG, to be tainted by FG's undoubted right wing neoliberal ideology. FF gained their seats by shifting slightly Left. They are terrified of the potential rise of SF, post Adams. There is significant crossover between the FF vote and the SF vote in some working class areas, and FF could lose out if pulled right by FG. It's unlikely they would be able to properly counter that Left flank by sufficiently co-opting a selection of policies of the Left. Water charges alone will be a difficult one as FG stand to lose huge political capital on it. FF could face fracturing at grassroots level if they go into government with the old enemy too. Minority government led by either FF or FG is a non runner and would be far too unstable, potentially damaging both big parties when it inevitably collapses. Forcing a re-run of the election due to their inability to get over a one hundred year old rivalry nobody else gives a shit about will hurt them at the polls. FF seem to be ignoring the fact their vote comprised a cohort of voters who had walked away from them in 2011. That's not a solid base, it could prove vulnerable under any number of circumstances. FF think they have won, but it could turn out to be a poisoned chalice. Either way it should be entertaining watching them squirm over the next few weeks.

I couldn't agree more. I think SF have reached a plateau though as long as Adams is running the show.

The only caveat I would add is beware of SF - they are far more likely to end up delivering Fianna Fail 2.0 rather than the 1916 Republic, dar liomsa...
