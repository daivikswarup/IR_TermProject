Mafia planned to kill Mario Cuomo during Italy trip as New York governor

<p>Mario Cuomo, the former governor of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a>, was targeted for assassination by the Sicilian mafia during a trip to Italy in 1992, according to an imprisoned Cosa Nostra hitman.</p>

<p>Maurizio Avola, 54 – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://time.com/4062017/sicilian-mafia-hitman/">who is currently serving a life sentence for his part in 43 murders and 40 armed robberies</a> – told the Guardian that mobster bosses planned an ambush involving about a dozen gunmen armed with assault rifles and explosives.</p>

<p>The attack was only called off when the scale of Cuomo’s security detail became apparent, he said.</p>

<p>Avola said that after the assassinations of prominent anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992, Cosa Nostra bosses decided to escalate their war against the Italian state and its allies. </p>

<p>“The aim was to target politicians or members of institutions in order to send out a clear message,” he said, in an interview via messages carried by his lawyer. </p>

<p>When Cuomo’s visit to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</a> was announced, Avola’s godfather, Aldo Ercolano, told him that the New York governor would be an “excellent target”. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Targeting a prominent American would also send a warning to the law enforcement agencies who had allowed several prominent mafia turncoats to start new lives in the US under assumed identities, Avola said. </p>

<p>“Cuomo was a symbol of America which during those years hosted collaborators who wanted out of Cosa Nostra and then got their bosses arrested. His death would have sent a strong signal to New York. It would have made them understand what happens to those who stand in the Mafia’s way,” he said. </p>

<p>Cuomo arrived in Rome on 19 November 1992 for a week of meetings. Soon after his arrival, a journalist from Corriere della Sera asked whether having an Italian surname was damaging for an American politician.</p>

<p>Cuomo replied: “Of course, any Italian American politician risks being associated with the mafia, not least because the media continuously plays on this image.” </p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to Avola a much more immediate risk was taking shape in the city of Messina, where a mafia hit squad was planning a daylight attack on Cuomo in the main square. </p>

<p>Around a dozen gunmen armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and explosives were to carry out the ambush, while accomplices were ready to block potential escape routes, said Avola.<br/></p>

<p>But just a few days before Cuomo was due in Messina, Ercolano called off the attack. </p>

<p>“The American politician arrived with extremely tight surveillance, lots of bodyguards and a bulletproof car. It made the execution impossible,” Avola said. “Reluctantly, Aldo Ercolano ordered the men of honour to withdraw.’’</p>

<p>Born in Catania in 1962, Avola is believed to have killed about 80 people, including journalists, lawyers, politicians and mobsters, before becoming a <em tabindex="-1">pentito</em>, or informer. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Known as “Occhi di Ghiaccio” or Ice Eyes because of his cold-blooded blue gaze, he was recruited as a hitman by the Santapaola family, one of the most feared and powerful in the Sicilian criminal underworld. </p>

<p>He was arrested on a tip-off in 1993, the day after killing a former friend and fellow mafioso. Avola concluded that he had been betrayed by his boss, and a year later, he decided to cooperate with police, revealing details that led to the opening of new investigations and the arrest of more than 100 men of honour. </p>

<p>He is currently serving a life sentence for his murders and 40 armed robberies in a special prison for mafia informers in northern Italy – but will be freed in 2019 because of his cooperation with authorities. For security reasons, the Guardian is not naming the prison where he is being held.</p>

<p>A senior source at Palermo magistrate’s court confirmed that an investigation into Avola’s allegations of a plot to kill Cuomo was still open, but said that details of the case were confidential.</p>

<p>Avola’s lawyer, Ugo Colonna, said that his client’s allegations may help shed some light on the history of that period of Cosa Nostra.<br/></p>

<p>“Understanding why the mafia wanted to eliminate the governor of New York, in 1992, could also help us to understand the violence of the bosses who, in those years, were waging a real war against the state,” he said. </p>

<p>Ignazio De Francisci, a Palermo prosecutor who worked alongside Falcone and Borsellino, said that in the early 1990s, mafia bosses had already spread their actions beyond Sicily. </p>

<p>“At the time, Cosa Nostra felt invincible, capable of doing anything,” he said. “The USA was closely collaborating with Italy in the fight against the mafia. If Cosa Nostra pulled back from the brink, just a few days before the scheduled date of assassination, it’s because it knew it would have been impossible to pull it off and they certainly couldn’t afford to leave a job half-finished.” <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Cuomo died from heart failure on 1 January 2015. His son, Andrew Cuomo, is the current governor of New York. A spokesman for the Cuomo family did not respond to a request for comment on Avola’s allegations.</p>

Yeah, let's take the word of a murderer and criminal.

Take a look at this guy! He has the rugged good looks of a leading man. Americans are so captured by superficial beauty. Take a look at any celebrity magazine. It's headline news when one of these A-listers turns out to be authentically human. So Mafia guys are easy to glamorize.

Yeah. Only the U.S. presidents are criminals. The rest of the world are led by truly peace-loving people. If only the entire world were led by the Putins, Kim Jong-uns and the Ali Khameneis out there. How much nice the world would be!

Just because someone is loyal to a life of murder, corruption, extortion, bullying and endless other blights on society-it does not make them in my mind a person I should respect.There are zero criminal investigations or cases filed against the elected leaders you name . Your welcome to your opinion but I think it says more about you than is does about this article.

When one serial killer exists, it's horrific and terrifying. When many exist in a group, all of a sudden it's gritty and tough but fair.

I agree a lot of them are scumbags but some of them were men of honor. Look at Sonny Black. He totally knew he was going to be killed for introducing FBI agent Joe Pistone AKA Donnie Brasco to mob bosses. Did he rat out? Did he betray the mafia? Nope, he went and took his death like a man. How you can't respect a stone cold gangster like that is beyond me. What about Lefty? Did he turn into a rat? Nope, he took his finally sentence like a man. Finally you look at criminals like the Clintons, the Obamas, the Bushes who killed thousands and made millions suffer. They are the real criminals my friend and that's why the mafia was created cuz of very corrupt evil politicians.

It's a shame these murderers have been glamorized in so many American movies.

"Men of honor" my ass. Bunch of psychopaths. If it wasn't for the romanticization of the Godfather movies and good feelings towards most things Italian in general, more people would regard these people as the thugs they are.

This form of 'honour' exists in all criminal tribes - they honour one another, never 'grass' and don't give a fuck the rest of humanity. Men of dishonour more like.

The main interest of the Mafia has always been economic: power is required so that lawmakers and law enforcers are unable to interfere effectively with their "affairs". From time time one of them will want to obtain social recognition of his status, and that often leads them to get too much limelight for their own good. Their inability to accept women into their inner circles is also a weakness, as they thus waste the potential skill and cunning of wives, sisters and mothers alike.

"Uomini d'onore" is the expression they use to decribe themselves, and it is indeed out of place when used by police or journalists. The Mafia regard themselves as a cut above the rest of humanity because they have what they regard as a code of honour...

Good thing it didn't come off or the US would have bombed the bejezus out of Sicily.
