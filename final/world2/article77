Canada to feature woman on bank note: seven top candidates




DateTime::::2016-03-09T20:47:37+0000



<p>Canada’s national bank announced this week that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/canada-women-bank-notes-currency">a new Canadian banknote will feature a woman</a> other than Queen Elizabeth, and appealed to the public for suggestions. </p>

<p>Finance minister Bill Morneau said that despite the queen’s place on the $20 bill, women have “largely been unrepresented” on Canadian currency. <br/></p>

<p>To be eligible to appear on the new bill, the woman must be Canadian, either by birth or naturalization, and she must have died at least 25 years ago. An independent advisory council will use the entries submitted by the public to compose a shortlist for the finance minister. The final bill will be released in 2018.</p>

<p>The Guardian has compiled a list of seven potential nominations – but who do you think would make a good candidate?</p>

<p>Trout helped lead the way for Canadian women in medicine. Trout and fellow student Emily Stowe were allowed to attend lectures at the Toronto School of Medicine, only on the condition that they “make no fuss, whatever happened”. As the only women in classes filled with men, Trout and Stowe were jeered at and witnessed “obscene sketches”.</p>

<p>Trout left the country to get her degree, attending the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania and graduating in 1875. When she returned to Canada, she passed the Ontario registration exam later that year and became the first woman licensed to practice medicine in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a>.</p>

<p>She practiced medicine at Toronto’s Therapeutic and Electrical Institute until 1882. She then worked to help open a medical college for women in Canada and ensure women could sit on the college’s board of governors. In October 1883, the Women’s Medical College at Kingston opened.</p>

<p>McClung is best remembered for her role in helping get women the vote. In 1914, she staged a mock satirical parliament in which she and other members of the Political Equality League discussed the dangers of allowing men the right to vote. The play aided in changing public opinion, and in 1916, Manitoba became the first province to grant women the right to vote.<br/></p>

<p>Along with activists Henrietta Edwards, Louise McKinney, Emily Murphy and Irene Parlby, she was also a member of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Famous_Five_(Canada)">Famous Five</a>, who petitioned the supreme court to establish that women were qualified to sit in the Senate. While their case was initially denied, the decision was overturned the next year. McClung continued to fight for reform on various fronts, including medical and dental care for schoolchildren, European immigrants’ acceptance into Canada during the second world war, property rights for women and divorce law equality.</p>

<p>Macphail was the first woman to be elected to the Canadian House of Commons and one of the first two women elected to the legislative assembly of Ontario. She fought for old-age pensions, prison reform and farmers’ cooperatives. Macphail also founded the Elizabeth Fry Society of Canada, a group that works “with and for women and girls in the justice system, particularly those who are, or may be, criminalized”.</p>

<p>She was the first Canadian woman sent as a delegate to the League of Nations in Geneva, where she served on the World Disarmament Committee. In 1951, just a few years before her death, Macphail worked to mandate equal pay for equal work for Ontario women.</p>

<p>The Canadian author is well known for her Anne of Green Gables series of novels, which gained an international following and were translated into about 20 languages. The first of these books was published in 1908, with many following in the series about an orphaned redhead from Prince Edward Island. According to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/montgomery-lucy-maud/">Canadian Encyclopedia</a>, Montgomery published a total of 22 novels and books of short stories during her life, as well as a book of poetry, an autobiography, and numerous stories and articles in magazines.</p>

<p>After refusing to leave a whites-only area in a movie theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, Desmond was convicted of a minor tax violation used to enforce segregation. She was arrested and charged with breaking the law in 1946. She decided to fight the charges, which helped raise awareness about the reality of Canadian segregation and spark the civil rights movement in Canada. Despite losing the case, Desmond was granted a posthumous pardon – the first to be granted in Canada – decades after her death.</p>

<p>Desmond has been dubbed Canada’s Rosa Parks by many, including the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/02/01/viola-desmond-was-canadas-rosa-parks.html">Toronto Star</a> and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100826141235/http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2907492">National Post</a>. Parks’ refusal to give up her bus seat to a white passenger occurred nine years after Desmond was charged.</p>

<p>Secord is remembered for her efforts to warn British forces of an American attack, during the war of 1812, which pitted the United States against the British empire. While living in occupied territory with her husband James Secord – who had been seriously wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights – Secord overheard information about the looming US attack on the loyalists. She trekked 19 miles to inform Lt James FitzGibbon of their plans. Her warning was invaluable to the troops, and in an 1827 letter, FitzGibbon <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.historicacanada.ca/content/heritage-minutes/laura-secord">wrote</a>: “I have ever since held myself personally indebted to her for her conduct upon that occasion.”</p>

<p>While her role in the war was not highly publicized initially, she was awarded £100 for her service by Edward, Prince of Wales, during his visit to Canada in 1860. Since then, the story has become the subject of books, plays, and poetry. There are monuments, schools and a museum in her name, and a memorial stamp and coin dedicated to her. Even the Canadian institution Laura Secord Chocolates took her name.</p>

<p>Dubbed a “Canadian icon” by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/emily-carr/">Canadian Encyclopedia</a>, Carr was an artist and writer whose work is now shown around the world. She was “one of the pre-eminent, and perhaps most original, Canadian painters of the first half of the twentieth century”, according to the Canadian Encyclopedia, as well as “one of the only major female artists in either North America or Europe of that period”. Carr was heavily influenced by the indigenous peoples of the Pacific north-west Coast and she worked to portray the west coast through her art. A university for art and design located on Granville Island in Vancouver, British Columbia, is named after Carr.</p>

It was wildly wrong, though. The fact that many people thought it was good at the time arguably makes it worse, not better; residential schools are a perfect example.

Ah - I see...At the time - was not eugenics looked upon as a tool for public good and improvement? Much like the well-meaning ignorance of the residential schools system envisaged for little aboriginals of the empire? I mean, it was a fucked-up notion for sure, but the intent as I understand it was to save the poor little people from the savagery of their own culture. Well-meaning, but wildly wrong.I've never found it helpful to judge other places - like the past, or other countries, in terms of our blinkered western moral standards. They did it back then, and I would accuse you of doing the same style of thing now. Knee-jerk p.c. is bad news.

Sure, and Sir John A. was a drunk, he and Mackenzie King are on bills since they were significant PMs. I'd be happy to have no politicians at all on our money, frankly. I think the Swiss have the right idea here: artists, writers, historians...

I have no problem with putting Terry Fox and Banting on our currency, but saving lives has never been the only criterion for selecting men, why would it be for women? How many men already on our currency saved as many lives as Banting?



Author::::borealrousse

I can't believe that so many seem to be assuming that there should be only one. We have many men on our currency, why would we have only one woman? It's so obvious, it's ridiculous.

Frederick Banting arguably saved more human lives than anyone in history. I myself nearly died of type 1 diabetes when I was 7. What woman on that list can match that. Please tell me since your so damned smart. Misogynist? Just a knee jerk reaction from a feminist using a big word. I might was well ask why you hate little kids dying from diabetic ketoacidosis. Grow the hell up.

Women that can match them? Merit? Mysogynist. Let's see. Women weren't admitted to university until post Brock in 1880. Got the vote about 100 years ago. You've got a few hundred years start on us, so give us a break, no? At least not a kick in the teeth.

When they get around to celebrating male Canadians, one name stands high - Elijah Harper, OM (1949 March 03 – 2013 May 17) the Canadian politician and Chief of his Red Sucker Lake community. He was the key player in the rejection of the Meech Lake Accord, an attempt at Canadian constitutional reform.

Pure tokenism. I'm not saying men are better than women but the contribution to the nation and humanity of those men and others like General Brock , Tommy Douglas , or even Tom Thompson dwarf any woman on the list. Perhaps someday there will be women that can match them. However honours like that should be made on merit, not what sex you happen to be born with. By the way Margaret Lawrence if you have to pick a woman should be the choice.

Of course people like Terry Fox and Sir Frederick Banting deserve the honour but it's long overdue that a woman should honoured.

There plenty of Canadian men like Terry Fox and Sir Frederick Banting who have not been put on bank notes either. Are you saying that the discoverer of insulin doesn't merit this honor? Or your putting a woman on just because it's the politically correct thing to do. A disgrace? Get over it.

How could mere artists like Emily Carr be on a list of great women? There are so many women in our history who worked against massive odds to gain rights for 50% of our population. I don't see how wielding a paintbrush or writing a few novels makes one a Great Canadian. I vote for those women who toiled to bring Canada into becoming a civil society.
