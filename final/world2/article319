Russia looks to buy five dolphins with perfect teeth and killer instinct

<p>Russia’s defence ministry is looking to buy five dolphins, the government has revealed, as the country strives to revive its Soviet-era use of sea mammals for military tasks.<br/></p>

<p>The military has opened the bidding on a 1.75m ruble (£17,000) contract to deliver dolphins to the military in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol by 1 August, according to a document uploaded on Wednesday to the government’s procurement website. </p>

<p>According to public contract documentation, it is seeking two female and three male dolphins between three and five years old with perfect teeth and no physical impairments.</p>

<p>An unnamed source told the RIA Novosti state news agency in March 2014 that new training programmes were being designed to make the dolphins serve Russia’s military interests.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/dolphins">Dolphins</a> were used by the Soviet Union and United States at the height of the cold war, having been trained to detect submarines, underwater mines and spot suspicious objects or individuals near harbours and ships.</p>

<p>Retired Colonel Viktor Baranets, who observed military dolphin training in the Soviet and post-Soviet eras, said that the sea mammals were part of the broader cold war arms race between the USSR and the United States. </p>

<p>“Americans looked into this first,” Baranets said. “But when Soviet intelligence found out the tasks the US dolphins were completing in the 1960s, the defence ministry at the time decided to address this issue.”</p>

<p>Baranets added that combat dolphins in the Soviet era were trained to plant explosive devices on enemy vessels and knew how to detect abandoned torpedoes and sunken ships in the Black Sea. </p>

<p>Crimea, which Russia annexed from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> in March 2014 amid international indignation, has housed this training facility since 1965.</p>

<p>The training centre was severely neglected after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Baranets said, and its dolphins were reportedly sold to Iran.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian navy re-established the centre in 2012, but Russia’s land grab two years later saw <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2014/jul/06/ukraine-combat-dolphins-russia-give-back">Crimea’s combat dolphins fall under Moscow’s control</a>. </p>

<p>The defence ministry could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. </p>

<p>The US navy also uses sea mammals to carry out military tasks, with sea lions deployed to Bahrain in 2003 to support Operation Enduring Freedom after the 9/11 attacks.</p>

In the Cold War they were trained to do more than find people. Not sure if it was ever proved or mainstreamed, but they did test attaching compressed air bolt guns to dolphins so that when they touched a diver he would be 'shot' using the device.

Mordor is a dark place where a sadistic shirtless king (or tsar) rules over his zombified subjects, along with his trolls and minions and wages war against his neighbors just because he wants to conquer the World with his militaristic might. His armies of special forces (orcs) are well trained in deception (maskirovka) and are sometimes disguised as little green creatures. A gloomy and depressing place indeed, where you can´t find good cheese these days.Cheers!

You have no idea. Male dolphins sometimes kidnap and rape female dolphins. It's especially common if the female is from another pod. Hows that for dark side.

Yep, and in the rush of selling of the country, they even sold the military dolphins. I'm sure with the rest of military equipment from that base. But it is all Russia's fault, they were told.

Please get your facts straight. The Iranian Reza Shah assassinated  the sheikhs of Arbistan with the help of the Brits and joined Arabistan to Iran and renamed the Arabian Gulf the Persian Gulf with the help of his Western friends. Sunnis are now forced to live between the Russian dolphins and Persians sharks with the help of hostile west.

arabian gulf is a misnomer. From a scientific and historical point of view, it has been called the Persian Gulf since Alexander the Great.

True, but we paid them and fed the dolphins better, so they told us where they were as soon as they planted them. Dolphins like us better than they like the Russians.

We can sell them more cars, because how else are we going to get those amazing dash board camera car crash videos on you tube? Have you seen those crashes? Wow. I'm pretty certain the dolphins can drive better. Does kamikaze translate into Russian?

This is disgusting--it's shameful that Russia is still capturing orcas, belugas, and dolphins from the wild to sell into captivity.

They typically use bottlenose dolphins--orcas would be much, much more difficult to maintain for such purposes, as they are fairly HUGE :)
