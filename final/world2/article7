Zero-hour contracts banned in New Zealand




DateTime::::2016-03-11T04:10:35+0000



<p>Zero-hour contracts have been outlawed in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a> after parliament unanimously passed a bill to ban the controversial practice.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/zero-hour-contract-is-not-flexiblity-but-exploitation-and-its-rising">A zero-hours contract is not 'flexibility' but exploitation – and it's rising</a> </p>

<p>Political parties across the board supported the ban, which is being hailed as a major victory for minimum wage workers, particularly in the fast-food industry.</p>

<p>Mike Treen, leader of the Unite union, who led the charge, said the move was being closely followed by fast-food workers worldwide, many of whom banded behind the New Zealand workers campaign last year. </p>

<p>“It was like we had God sitting on our shoulder helping us out – it just went wild,” said Treen.</p>

<p>“This is an incredible victory and I am still shocked by it to be honest – the fact that the ban was unanimously supported in parliament is pretty unbelievable.”</p>

<p>Treen estimates there are “hundreds of thousands of workers” employed on zero-hour contracts in New Zealand, which means employers do not have to guarantee minimum hours of work per week, and often expect employees to be available 24/7.</p>

<p>The contracts have also caused controversy in the UK where the country’s biggest sports retailer, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/31/sports-direct-pledges-10m-towards-staff-pay-rise">Sports Direct</a>, has 15,000 employees on zero-hour deals. </p>

<p>In New Zealand they are typically used by fast-food chains, as well as by cinema groups, security firms and cleaning companies, said Treen.</p>

<p>The bill, which will take effect on 1 April, stipulates that employers must guarantee a minimum number of hours work each week, and workers can refuse extra hours without repercussions.</p>

<p>“The passing of this Bill delivers on the government’s commitment to improve New Zealand’s employment law framework to encourage fair and productive workplaces without imposing unnecessary compliance costs on employers in general,” said Michael Woodhouse, the workplace relations and safety minister.</p>

<p>“The bill eliminates zero-hour contracts by getting rid of unfair employment practices where employers do not commit any hours of work, but expect employees to be available when required without compensation.”</p>

<p>Hannah Shelton-Agar, 23, is employed on a zero-hour contract at Hoyts cinema in Auckland.</p>

<p>She usually works between 10-25 hours a week, and said she is “ecstatic” about the ban.</p>

<p>“This is going to change people’s lives. It is such a relief for so many people to know they will no longer risk having zero dollars at the end of the week. It also means workers feel more included in the workplace, and valued for their contribution.”</p>

<p>The move to ban zero-hour contracts gained huge momentum around New Zealand last year when it was picked up by TV3’s Campbell Live current affairs show, which has since been axed.</p>

<p>Campaigners said the exposure and interest of Campbell Live galvanised opposition to zero-hour contracts nationwide.</p>

<p>“Campbell was a pivotal, campaigning force for us,” said Treen. “I said in the negotiations, you might beat the union but you can’t beat the union and <em>Campbell Live</em>.”</p>

Those saying it will cost jobs don't have a clue. It is the employers that keep claiming it enables workers to have a more flexible lifestyle. Most employees, even part time employees such as students would love to have specific hours per week that they can work. I don't see how it can help any employee to be constantly waiting for a call to come into work.

Yes! - Absolutely right. What's more the Tories won't be smart enough to compromise like the NZ conservatives. Their attempts to defend the deeply unpopular zero-hours contracts would become a millstone around their necks.

If all you can come up with is ignorant and unlikely hypothetical "what ifs" then you are loosing the argument. If a minimum weekly number of hours hasn't been specified under NZs new legislative changes, there is no need. Some contracts might, for example required someone to work 3 hours, at a specified time, once a month. It will depend on job requirements.

If I had a penny for every person on this thread who (willfully or otherwise) confuses ZHC's with part-time or casual arrangements, I'd be rich enough never to need to work again - especially not on a ZHC.

Year ago New Zealand went down the path of American economic polices, because of stupid NZ MP's that were brainwashed that the American system was somehow good. It was a complete disaster and has taken years to undo the damage from these failed American crony capitalism economics.

The NZ conservatives are smarter by comparison. They remembered how the campaign against the now defunct 'Work Choices' legislation led to the fall of the Howard Government in Australia. They probably saw parallels between that and the NZ campaign against zero-hours and thought: 'no, weer not going to litt that heppen' and sacrificed the zero-hours for strategic reasons.

You're getting carried away, a few stabilised hours a week is called 'part time'. If people choose to work part time that's different, it's when people want to work full time and are told they must be available to work any number of hours between 2 and 60 a week that that it's unfair. Parasitic agencies, like zero hours contracts, are the scourge of the modern UK employment market.

Because what we need is more laws, right? I disagree, people should get to choose for themselves. I don't like Amazon's approach to paying tax and haven't bought anything from them for about 2 years now if not longer. If public feeling against them was that strong they would have had to either shut up shop or change their tax affairs.

They fit quite easily within the confines of English and Scottish contract law. A typical zero hours clause states that the employer is under no obligation to offer shifts and the worker is under no obligation to accept them - the consideration in such an arrangement is pay, exchanged for the time the worker spends working.

If you're going to post on ZHCs, shouldn't you inform yourself about what a ZHC is and is not? What you, and all the other posters defending ZHC's are describing is not in fact a ZHC but a casual/part-time work arrangement. Not the same thing. At all.

If a business wants a work force it should be prepared to treat them decently. It's good to see the work force join together as a unit and demand change. That's the purpose of a union.

It looks good on the balance sheet and the type of firms using low wage ZHCs couldn't care less about their workers they are just ticking boxes e. g. the appalling way care workers are treated and the poor service the are forced to provide is the bare minimum that can be got away with.

I don't disagree with you Greyranga. I simply made a distinction between casual work as you've defined it in your first paragraph, and casual work which you've defined in your second paragraph - which is effectively zero hours contracts.

Because more available cheap labour allows companies to abuse people. Companies in New Zealand also used it to save money at the expense of others but then the New Zealanders stood up for themselves. We don't do that. We accept every lump of shit thrown in our faces by the Conservatives.

I'm surprised zero-hour contracts are valid in UK law, as they appear to lack 'consideration'. The employee suffers a detriment because they have to make themselves available to work, but they are not certain of getting anything in return.

Under Universal Credit, your benefits will be sanctioned if you refuse a zero-hours contract. So it's not really up to the workers anymore.



Author::::casperjones
DateTime::::2016-03-11T13:48:21Z
Do they also have the same "self-employed" loop hole that we have here? E.g. you work for an agency but are told to declare yourself self-employed. Which is probably worse than a zero hours contract?

This is great news, but not likely to happen here. But zero hours contracts only exist because we allow them to. If all UK workers just refused to sign up to them things would soon change, but we are all too busy competing with and under-cutting each other for this to happen. Collective action and solidarity seem to have disappeared.

That's a possibility but ' a bird in hand is worth two in the bush' . Guaranteed paid work even of lesser hours will put food on the table whereas zero contracts don't offer the guarantee.
