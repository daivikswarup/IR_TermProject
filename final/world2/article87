Berta Cáceres murder: Honduras blocks sole witness from leaving country




DateTime::::2016-03-08T23:19:21+0000



<p>Officials in Honduras have refused to allow the only witness to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/honduras-berta-caceres-murder-enivronment-activist-human-rights">murder of environmental activist Berta Cáceres</a> to leave the country and return to his native Mexico.</p>

<p>Gustavo Castro Soto, coordinator of Friends of the Earth Mexico and director of the NGO <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.otrosmundoschiapas.org/">Otros Mundos</a>, was shot twice during the attack on Cáceres on Thursday morning, and only survived by playing dead. </p>

<p>Officials are treating him as a protected witness, according to the Associated Press, but activists say that the Honduran attorney general’s office has issued a 30-day immigration alert against him, preventing him from leaving the country. </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.otrosmundoschiapas.org/index.php/component/content/article/36-otros-temas/36-derechos/2261-urgent-we-reject-order-that-gustavo-castro-stay-30-days-longer-in-honduras">In a statement on Tuesday</a>, Otros Mundos and Friends of the Earth Mexico said the order was “unjust and unnecessary” as Castro has “provided sufficient information to prosecutors to clarify the facts of the case [and] has not been informed what procedures remain outstanding”.</p>

<p>“Gustavo Castro is not being treated as a victim of an assassination attempt, instead his life is being put at risk, along with his right to free movement.” The statement said that when Castro attempted to catch a flight out of the country on Sunday, he was stopped at the immigration desk of the Tegucigalpa airport and refused permission to proceed to his gate.</p>

<p>President Juan Orlando Hernández has said the investigation into the attack was proceeding with US assistance. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/honduras">Honduras</a> prosecutor’s office did not respond to an interview request.</p>

<p>Cáceres, who won the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize, was murdered by unknown assailants on 3 March in the western Honduras town of La Esperanza, where she led a movement to stop a dam being built without consulting the indigenous Lenca population.</p>

<p>Authorities say she was shot four times, though they initially attributed the attack to a robbery – an explanation rejected by Cáceres’s friends and family, who say she endured death threats from landowners, police and the army.</p>

<p>Cáceres’s nephew, Silvio Carrillo, said that Soto was not allowed to sleep or change out of his bloodied clothes after the attack. “The treatment [Castro] received for three days was tantamount to abuse,” he said.</p>

<p>In an open letter published by Honduran newspapers, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.laprensa.hn/honduras/937438-410/mexicano-dice-que-escenario-del-crimen-de-berta-c%C3%A1ceres-fue-modificado">Castro alleged the crime scene was altered</a>, while he was only offered medical attention three days after the attack.<br/></p>

<p>“I did not hear cars arriving or leaving when the murder was committed; the crime scene was modified and altered,” Castro wrote. “They sent the majority of the people from Copinh” – the organisation Cáceres founded in 1993 – “to give statements and not the suspects.”</p>

<p>Castro added that investigators asked him to review pictures to identify possible suspects, “But I regret that all the videos and photographs were from Copinh marches.”</p>

Hillary Clintstone had a very big hand in making this happen, as did the US government. Considering all of the other "Interferences" in South American states by the filth of the CIA over the last 50 years it wouldnt surprise me to hear this was another Destabilisation move by big US Business......in fact I will stick my neck out and pointy a very big finger at Uncle Sam right nowJ'accuse!

This brave woman is, tg getting publicity, so many more of the murdered are not. It's shocking and terrifying. Honduras has been the home of extrajudical killings for a long long time, the death squads of the 80s were notorious. The form of aid given has always been outrageous in its open support of brutal Gvt in Honduras.

After Leonardo Dicaprio talk about taking care of this planet, somebody decide to murdered a Honduras human right and environment Berta Caceres. Is a shame for the country and the security that she has. I think without a redistribution of well, this wold will continue to be a big valley a tears. I wish I could ask Bill Gate, Mark Zuckerberg and all billionaires from Forbes.com to give some billions to poor countries to finish with the poverty of the world. Remember God and His sacrifice through His Son Jesus. Remember dead also.

She was Secretary of State at the time. Foreign policy was her portfolio. Apparently providing political cover for the overthrow of an elected government is what she means every time she invokes her vast diplomatic experience.

I can't understand why blacks are voting for her when her husband put more of them in prison then anyone else in history, as far as I can tell.

Yes and was under Obama's leadership. Why are you laying this all at Clinton's feet? Bernie's supporters will go to any lengths...

If Clinton becomes president she'll already have a criminal record (alleged of course) as long your arm. A first I think , usually the criminal activity begins after inauguration.

And this is the country where Ms. Clinton blocked any attempt to roll back the military coup. Now look what has happened with the police and the army engaging in enough murders to make Honduras the murder capital of the world.

But it is NOT being reported. For one day only the usual sites covered it, the very next day I could not a single article in any of the US press, not even on liberal sites like Truthdig.

This is the illegitimate government that was installed by a military Coup which was immediately supported by the US, but virtually no other government. Indeed, the mounting evidence is that the US government were an integral part of organising the coup. It is hardly surprising that this illegitimate government is seeking the advice of the US about how to deal with the embarrassment of the death of this courageous woman as it was almost certainly organised by the CIA along with the current governments death squads.

Accountability on the respective governments to make sure he is "protected".

This murder and the lack of women's rights in Honduras brought to you courtesy of "feminist" presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

The climate of violence in Honduras sharpened inthe aftermath of the 2009 coup. Can you guess which US presidential candidate gave a pass to the golpistas?
