Five lessons from Iran's 2016 elections




DateTime::::2016-02-28T15:41:59+0000



<p>Last July’s agreement with world powers brought a realignment in Iranian politics. The central divide in the election was between supporters and opponents of the deal.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p>The ‘principle-ist’ Ali Larijani as parliamentary speaker was an effective ally of President Hassan Rouhani. Larijani headed off critics of the deal in a level of co-operation between parliament and government not seen during the presidency of Ahmadinejad and the latter years of Khatami. During the election, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/profiles-iran-parliamentary-candidates-tehranbureau">public support </a>offered to Larijani as candidate in Qom by General Qassem Soleimani, chief of the Revolutionary Guards overseas Qods brigade, reflected broad backing in the political elite behind the nuclear agreement.</p>

<p>This agreement was not consigned to history when signed. Implementation is to last over the next nine years – both in limiting Iran’s nuclear programme and in removing <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations">United Nations</a>, European Union and most United States sanctions. This suggests the agreement will continue to shape Iranian politics, even if less strongly over time.</p>

<p>Iran is a large country – bigger than Iraq, Turkey and Syria combined – and every Iranian election throws up a complex mix of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/feb/26/iran-urban-divide-elections-kurdistan-tehran">regional</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/iran-kurdistan-rouhani-tehranbureau">tribal</a> and local factors. Voters have many reasons for voting as they do. The single biggest issue in most elections in most countries is the economy - but this is a catch-all that can lump together jobs, prices, housing and urgent <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/23/iran-election-environment-green-tehranbureau">environmental issues</a> like water management.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/25/iran-elections-struggle-theocracy-democracy-tehranbureau">generalisations</a> of ‘left’ versus ‘right’ of the 1980s, and ‘reformists’ versus ‘conservatives’ of the 1990s – however well they applied at the time – no longer work. Observers who portrayed the elections as between ‘reformists’ and ‘hardliners’ have tied themselves in knots – as shown in reports that ‘reformists’ and ‘moderates’ had <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/jan/19/iran-guardian-council-blocks-reformists-february-parliamentary-poll">all been disqualified</a> followed by reports they had won the election.</p>

<p>With the defeat of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/mar/13/iran-supreme-mohammad-yazdi-leader-in-waiting">Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi</a> in the Experts Assembly election, the assembly will need a new chairman. The assembly will remain an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/feb/22/iran-secret-leadership-no-overseers-assembly-experts-tehranbureau">opaque body</a>, but whoever fills the post (as well as the conduct of his election) will be the next clue as to how the succession to Khamenei will proceed.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p>The defeat in Tehran not just of Yazdi but also of Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi represents a serious blow to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2016/feb/24/iran-elections-view-from-qom-clerical-establishment-tehranbureau">senior clerics most alarmed by Rouhani</a> and the prospect of better relations with the west. But the views of less vocal Assembly members elected round the country may be less clear-cut than those trumpeted on the noisy hustings in Tehran. Further surprises lie ahead.<br/></p>

<p>Iran’s president has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/apr/24/former-nuclear-negotiator-iran-cold">proved himself</a> an astute, hard-headed operator. He not only carried the bulk of the political class behind the nuclear agreement, he has again won electoral endorsement for his pragmatic conservatism. His politics are based on efforts to improve relations with other countries, including the United States; reform of the economy to boost the private sector and attract foreign investment; and some easing of press controls and morality policing.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p>Rouhani’s instincts and temperament do not favour exciting opinion leaders – especially the urban middle-classes and students – behind a programme of change. He is well aware that the Khatami era and the street protests after the disputed 2009 election opened up bitter divisions within the political class: his approach is based rather on incremental change and building agreement. </p>

<p>Economic reform to encourage sustainable growth – increasing employment and improving living standards – will challenge vested interests, including those that have benefited from the closed economy encouraged by sanctions and an ideology of ‘resistance’. Rouhani will prefer reassurance to confrontation and will pick battles carefully.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p>Internationally, the region looks dangerous, and these are troubled times with unprecedented tensions between Sunnis and Shia. This creates a tricky balance of keeping Iran ‘strong’ while also improving relations with both the US – even as a presidential election draws nearer – and an increasingly assertive <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia">Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>

<p>Politically, Rouhani will need to maintain public support with an eye to being re-elected as president next year. Anecdotal reports of a lower turn-out in poorer parts of Tehran may reflect most strongly a wider sense among Iranians they are not benefiting from the easing of sanctions. In terms of the political class, Rouhani will need to reassure conservatives that cautious change continues to be in the interests of the Islamic Republic, while also offering reformists some concessions over political prisoners and censorship. </p>

occupied Iran welcomed them, fed them, tried to adopt the littlest ones "so they could live in homes with love" instead of becoming "pioneers." That is not the behavior of a frightened people, stuck in a Jew hating land. Between 10-15,000 european refugees made their way to Iran; many stayed after the war, I know because I met some in the 1970s.

I don't know whether you remember this one or not. Last month almost all of the media announced that a huge explosion measuring 3 or 4 Richter had been detected near a N. Korea's nuclear test site followed by reports casting doubts on N. Korean claim that it had conducted a Hydrogen bomb test there. It's appears it's not just the news on the Middle East that is affected ....

You seriously had high hopes that Reformers would win in Mashad? An you are from Mashad? There is a better chance to see Reformers win in Qom than in Mashad. Alamolhoda in Mashad topped the list. If he was a candidate in Tehran, or even Shiraz or Tabriz, he would have come last on the second page.

Most of the international media seem to be suffering from the same form of mass amnesia in that they have conveniently forgotten the fact that the elections were rigged months ago when the Guardian Council, whose members are handpicked by top mullah Ali Khamenei, kicked off virtually all candidates from ballots with even a hint of moderation or lack of ideological purity.

Have you been a Jew living in Iran, ever? No? I have. Also in a Jew who lived innthe US, Israel, Australia, Germany ans around Central Europe after 1989.Just for the information of anyone who cares, in all those places there were dangerous and/or bad places and days to be a Jew and still are.Yet during WWII, when the rest of the world happily refused to accept Jewish refugees or incarcerated them as "enemy aliens" (as did australia) it was occupied Iran who accepted Jewish refugees of all countries, including the famous "Yaldeh-eh Tehran," 1500 Ashkenazi orphans collected by the Mossad Aliyah Bet to take into Palestine. Collected and held together in muslim British India, the children were not safe and were declared PNG by the Brits; occupied Iran welcomed them, fed them, tried to adopt the littlest ones "so they could live in homes with love" instead of becoming "pioneers." That is not the behavior of a frightened people, stuck in a Jew hating land. Between 10-15,000 european refugees made their way to Iran; many stayed after the war, I know because I met some in the 1970s. Before the Revolution, the Shah controlled access to information by foreignersand media; after the Revolution, this practice continued, enhanced after Nov1979 by US politicians who couldnt compete fast enough to wolf against Iran, not knowing that the entire hostage crisis was the Ayatollah Khomeini's revenge against Jimmy Carter, as well as an exercise by the ultra religious to hijack the revollution. But that is another matter for Another day. Historic anti-Semitism in Iran? Yes, especially in the shia shrine city of Mashad, where the entire Jewish community was forced to convert one night in the 1840s. But the historic ritual uncleanliness you cited above, was also practiced against xtians and zoroastrians during that time, when Persia felt it was under colonial pressure by the Brits, and that sort of behavior stopped after the Constitutional Revolution of 1906.

An easy mistake to make, but eveything was ok until the Islamic take over, that was nothing more to do with the US, than just Islamic jeaslousy and the 'threat' of closer ties with the west. They exerted tyranny over Iran to impose its Islamic State status. Thats where all this present trouble stems from, and where it will remain until, like I said, Islam gets its nose out of politics.

I am an Iranian woman living in Mashhad, a north- eastern big city in Iran. We just had parliament elections, and in many cities and towns of Iran, reformists and moderates won but here in Mashhad, they didn’t. I helped the sympathetic activist groups of reformists during the pre-elections period and we had high hopes of winning but now, I feel an unbearable lightness on my heart… we, I mean reformists and moderates, lost the elections in Mashhad in spite of our high hopes and good-hearted efforts… I can't stop weeping over our unfulfilled anticipations of reform…

You hate it when people criticize your country, and you want us to sympathize with your people who are killing innocent Syrian people in the name of saving their dictator. Below, you've criticized Turkey which has been the most successful economy in the region. Turkey has the right to defend herself against the PKK terrorists. They suffered from the ISIS terrorist attacks but I've yet to hear of a single ISIS attack within Iran or around Shiite shrines in Iraq! Could you list me a few?? If these "Takfiris" hate the Shiites so much, why would they attack Sunni lands rather than the source of all Shiite evils: Iran?? Iran is the source of all evil in the region. Do I feel sorry for their poor and underprivileged? Of course I do. However, I will continue to criticize Iran until she pulls her evil mercenaries out of Syria and Iraq, and stop manipulating ISIS and putting the blame on Sunnis who have nothing to do with these evil criminals. Once this is done, I guarantee you that everything will go back to normalcy, Shiites will come visiting their cherished shrines as usual, and Syrian kids will start going back to schools instead of being recruited by anyone who feeds them! This is the only lesson for every Iranian and Iranian supporter to take home.

One thing the article fails to mention is the crucial leadership of Khatami in the whole process. The "Hope' list and their unified approach specially in Tehran. Rouhani, criticizing the Guardian council and bursting its bubble pre-election and focusing attention on the unfairness of the process was a good move but it all came back to the leadership from behind of Khatami on this regard.

We can also see that democracy can work. Not a "true" democracy yet...one still has to be approved to get on the ballot , but they have real elections , the losers accept their loss , the people don't cry foul and take to the street.
