China to build vast, controversial 'port city' in Sri Lanka




DateTime::::2016-03-11T00:42:53+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/srilanka">Sri Lanka</a> has granted permission for China to build a vast “port city” in the island’s capital, despite concerns the ambitious project could be an environmental disaster.<br/></p>

<p>President Maithripala Sirisena had suspended the contentious $1.4bn plan to build on reclaimed land next to Colombo’s main harbour shortly after taking power in January last year.</p>

<p>But the port city, initiated by Chinese president Xi Jinping in September 2014 and expected to include housing, a marina and a Formula One racetrack, was again given the green light on Thursday.</p>

<p>“The cabinet committee on economic management has recommended allowing resumption of the project subject to limitations and conditions stipulated in the EIA (environmental impact assessment),” the government said in a statement.</p>

<p>It did not say what the conditions were, but official sources told AFP that Chinese investors were given permission to resume work on the project without any major modifications.</p>

<p>Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said reclaiming land next to the harbour could trigger erosion along the island’s western coastline and threaten its vital tourist industry.</p>

<p>The project, funded by Chinese state-owned company <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> Communications Construction, represents the biggest single foreign investment ever received by Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>It will add 233 hectares (575 acres) of new real estate in the congested capital.</p>

<p>Sirisena’s government had ordered a review of all big-ticket construction projects signed by his predecessor Mahinda Rajapakse, who is under investigation over allegations of corruption during his decade in power.</p>

<p>Rajapakse relied heavily on China to rebuild the country’s infrastructure after the end of the island’s decades-long ethnic war in May 2009.</p>

<p>China, the largest single lender to Sri Lanka, secured contracts to build roads, railways and ports under the Rajapakse regime.</p>

<p>However, the present administration has accused the previous government of agreeing to unfavourable terms for the Chinese loans.</p>

<p>Sirisena’s government is seeking an International Monetary Fund bail out of an unspecified amount of money to bolster the island’s foreign reserves.</p>

<p>Beijing has been accused of seeking to develop facilities around the Indian Ocean in a “string of pearls” strategy to counter the rise of rival India and secure its own economic interests. </p>

I did check the development facts, I've been working in India every year for the last ten years, and in China too, and there is now no comparison. India has been left behind in China's dust. Thems are the facts on the ground. It really doesn't matter that India's GDP growth is the highest in the world (if in fact it is!) as that doesn't really translate to much on the ground for the average Indian. In China, on the other hand, they have a gleaming new high-speed rail network using the latest technology, all built within the space 11 years, and have now equalled all the world combined in Km of rail network. India has zero Kms of high-speed rail network.

Chinese mega-crap architecture ruining a beautiful island.I bet they will import labour with dedicated noodle-chefs, to build it, then the Chinese military intelligence services, and finally Chinese Navy will move in.Then the Indian armed forces which already waste a third of India's money will rub their hands with glee and do similar environmentally and ecologically disastrous bases on South Indian coasts, pocketing money as they go about it.

Yeah, try shouting 'Jihad' in Madison Square or in London or in Paris. Let's see how religiously tolerant people are. 'Cause the 'students' were supporting terrorists. As per the beef lynch, that's the work of some religious fanatics, who, by the way every country has. I'm in no way supporting those idiots, but just saying it's a lot better than China. Please check your facts about the development facts, 'cause India has the highest GDP growth in the world now, ahead of China. The economy may be a snail, but unlike China where massive cities are built, and since became Ghost towns, India has a constructive development. I have many friends and colleagues who are from North East, who are respected. The politicians have to work in earnest to develop those states, but it is very hard with the geography of the area and more so 'cause of the corrupt politicians, which I hope will change in the future.

I wouldn't underestimate the money that budget travellers bring to the local economy. Real Sri Lanka? The vast majority of the country that is not upmarket boutiques, five star hotels, global chains, luxury resorts, etc. Try it sometime, take a train, bus or Tuk Tuk and explore for yourself this amazing country, then maybe you'll understand what I'm getting at.

Not sure India is that much better, especially under the current government. The freedom of speech thing is something India is still trying to get it's head around. I certainly don't condone much about China's censorship or lack of personal freedom, but you're obviously a person who hasn't actually been to China and seen the pace of their development. They're actually spending the money that they're making on the things that the country needs to move forward. India, on the other hand, is developing at a snail's pace, is so riddled with corruption that nothing gets done, and most of the money needed for it's infrastructure upgrades is stolen by the kleptocrats that you call 'politicians'. Tibet and Hong Kong are very developed, they have good roads and rail infrastructure and uninterrupted supplies of electricity.

Yeah, it would be very good indeed, like people of Tibet, Hong Kong where people disappear for criticizing government, and in mainland, where students are run over by tanks and personal freedom is a distant myth. Yeah, sure. Let the whole world come under 'People's China' where the people don't matter to the state.

Quite right .. and in South America with the takeover of Venezuela oilfields by China, and it's investments in Brazil with high speed train across the Amazon to the west coast of South America, it's investment in iron ore and a promise to the rest of South American countries for a further $150 billion. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that rampant corruption in these countries is tied to, and has become synonomous with Chinese investment.

A warm slime of gutter oil floating out across the world's seven seas, submerging all that kowtow to it in exchange for a quick hit of Chinese money. A slime that gags free speech, greases the cogs of political sleaze, and suffocates the earth from clean air and water. Where ever China goes, it leaves a trail of environmental destruction, corruption, and economic imperialism.

I think the record of disastrous large scale Chinese infrastructure projects that litter Africa, and the corruption that went with it, are more than cause for concern.

Maybe it because given the sorry record of large scale chinese construction projects across Africa and the corruption involved? That would be enough to give anyone reason to be concerned.

How come anything and everything the Chinese or Russians do is nearly always described as controversial or just plain castigated by the biased AFP and in the Guardian. Why is there a continual one sided cold war hate campaign by the Guardian and the arrogant west against the Chinese and Russian people and practically anything they do. Just because we dont build ports anymore, no one should; is that it?

Mind you, it doesn't take a great leap of imagination to see how much better off Sikkim, Manipur, Meghalaya etc would be under Chinese rule. India has more or less completely ignored them for the last 60-odd years, left them underdeveloped, and are habitually racist to the people from those states. At least under China they'd have good roads and high-speed trains!

It is in the interest of nation that Tamilnadu should keep quiet despite the genocide of Tamils in Srilanka they said and added that Srilanka would now be loyal to India and will not allow China to build a base. What happened now ? The donkeys in Delhi are useless. If India had atleast not intervened by supplying Srilanka with weapon India would have had a large population with deep links to Indian subcontinent still living in Srilanka now its toast. Good luck you idiots
