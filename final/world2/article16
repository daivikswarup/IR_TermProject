You may free apartheid killers but you can't force their victims to forgive

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">L</span></span>impho Hani is still angry about the assassination of her husband, the former anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani. Twenty-three years after he was shot dead in front of their teenage daughter, she refuses to forgive or forget.</p>

<p>When Janusz Walus, the man responsible for her husband’s death, was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/killer-anti-apartheid-leader-chris-hani-janusz-walus-south-africa-released-prison">granted parole yesterday</a> Limpho Hani was furious with the judge who overruled an earlier decision not to set him free – and suggested that the Hani family should “move on”. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/18/why-south-african-students-have-turned-on-their-parents-generation">Why South African students have turned on their parents’ generation | Eve Fairbanks</a> </p>

<p>“Janusz murdered my husband in cold blood,” Limpho Hani said in an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/12129/it-s-a-very-sad-day-in-south-africa-says-limpho-hani-of-janusz-walus-release">interview on South African radio</a>. “[The judge] told me and my family to move on… It’s a very sad day in South Africa and I am highly irritated that this white woman can tell me how to feel.”</p>

<p>Hani’s attitude has always stood in stark contrast to the narrative of forgiveness exemplified by <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/nelsonmandela">Nelson Mandela</a> in the early years of South Africa’s democracy.</p>

<p> Until recently forgiveness has enjoyed a special place in the story of our remarkable transition out of apartheid. While this may be changing as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/nov/18/why-south-african-students-have-turned-on-their-parents-generation">young South Africans increasingly vent their anger</a> at ongoing racial inequality, the capacity to pardon one’s oppressors is still seen as part of the miracle of our country.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Good apartheid victims wept, they did not rage. They cried out but they dared not swear</p>

<p>Women in particular have been expected not only to forgive, but also to nurture the healing process; not to be bitter and outraged.</p>

<p>And so, by rights, Limpho Hani should have spent the last two decades cutting ribbons and opening memorial centres in her husband’s name. She should have been gracious and pleasant, or serious and reflective; but always, always, forgiving. </p>

<p>She should not have expressed so much anger because frankly, there has been little space or time in this democracy for the unpredictable feelings of victims and survivors of torture and losses beyond imagining. </p>

<p>Good apartheid victims wept, they did not rage. They cried out but they dared not swear. The ugly side of grief – vengeance and the nihilism of loss – have had no place in the vocabulary of the new <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica">South Africa</a>. We are a nation founded on the benign principles of tolerance and forgiveness, not on the craggy rocks of fury.</p>

<p>The deal in 1994 when the ANC took power was that the black majority would forgive the white minority. In other words, black forgiveness would be exchanged for white loyalty to the country. Black people would “let” whites live with them in peace because they were needed to run the economy – forgiveness as a quid pro quo for technical skills. </p>

<p>So Limpho Hani’s public refusal to forgive, indeed her flagrant disregard for this founding promise, is almost heretical. In raising sharp and uncomfortable questions, she has reneged on the unspoken post-apartheid agreement. Her hostility shifts the terms of engagement between black victims and white assailants. </p>

<p>Where black forgiveness has not be forthcoming, some white people have sought assurances of their place in the society. This is evidenced in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/world/africa/raw-tensions-over-race-fester-in-south-africa.html?_r=1">the growing number of whites who voice their concern</a>s that the pact brokered in the founding moments of South Africa’s democracy has been called off. </p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">South Africans have seen that it is not so easy to grieve in an orderly fashion</p>

<p>There is a lot at stake for this group which increasingly complains, for example, that affirmative action represents “reverse racism”. In their view, affirmative action seeks to replace skilled whites with unskilled blacks. They bemoan the new “racialised” terrain of South African debates. Once white skills are no longer necessary – they fear – black rage will have no reason to be curtailed.</p>

<p>This is untrue of course, but it points to a deep-seated set of fears. At the heart of the simmering tensions is a concern, articulated by black and white South Africans alike, that intra-racial anger, if given too much attention, may destroy the very fabric of the nation.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/24/truth-justice-reconciliation-civil-war-conflict">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a>, which investigated apartheid atrocities and granted amnesty to those who confessed to their crimes, accepted this as an unspoken tenet. But this invisible worry provided our new nation with a flawed framework for talking about the wounds of the past.</p>

<p>Each story unearthed by the commission was supposed to end in absolution. If only perpetrators told the truth they would be forgiven by the families of the dead and the missing. </p>

<p>Collectively the commission was intended to move South Africans from darkness to light; from not knowing what happened to thousands of activists and ordinary people to forgiving all the newly discovered sins of the past.</p>

<p>In the years since the commission ended in 2005, South Africans have seen that it is not so easy to grieve in an orderly fashion. The power of people like Limpho Hani, who refuse to forgive in a context in which forgiveness is expected, is that they disrupt the status quo. Hani’s anger rages against forgetting. It insists on being heard and it solidifies her husband’s place in the nation’s collective memory.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">When so much time and energy has been put into forgiveness, the voices of the hurt and the outraged have a place too</p>

<p>I continue to believe that the political path of reconciliation forged by Nelson Mandela and the ANC was appropriate for the time: It was built on a commitment to peace, which was necessary during turbulent transition. As it came to power, the ANC exercised the gracious restraint that is the preserve of the victorious. </p>

<p>But in a plural democracy such as ours, one where so much time and energy has been put into forgiveness, the voices of the hurt and the outraged have a place too. </p>

<p>If a country that has overcome so much cannot make space for pain that continues to be raw for so many families; if the post-apartheid racial script can only accommodate one way of dealing with pain and if that one way is always through the telling of a redemptive tale; if our stories must always have happy and forgiving endings, then surely South Africans cannot claim to be a genuinely plural society. </p>

<p>If some South Africans are angry and do not want to reconcile then there must be a way for all of us to live with that complexity. If a judge in a wounded society like ours can silence the pain of a woman who refuses to forgive the murderer of her husband, then we are not yet the mature democracy we are striving to be. </p>

<p>For 23 years, the Hani family has continued to live in South <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a> without causing anybody harm. Limpho Hani may not have forgiven the man who killed her husband but she has respected the laws of the land and followed the institutional processes of the court system. There can be no better evidence than this of our society’s capacity to withstand withering anger.</p>

<p>Walus, her husband’s killer, may meet the criteria for parole: that is a matter for the justice system to resolve. Should it come, however, his release must not be mistaken for forgiveness. In a country where black lives are still too cheap, South Africans ought to be grateful to the Hanis for being true to their rage.</p>

Zimbabwe was sabotaged. Stop trying to claim Zimbabwe as if its dead and non functional. Zimbabwe is actually still pulling above it weight compared to the sabotage that happened to it. The problem here is the whites still want to dominate the economy/land just like they did in Zimbabwe. This imbalance s going to be addressed whether you like it or not. Once we start addressing that maybe we can talk about Ubuntu. you are still scare mongering the local south Africans while you siphon off money abroad.

Zimbabwe is changing my dear. clearly your brother has embraced it more than you. You shouldn't have supported the sanctions currently rocking my country Zim. Now you just like me, here in dull England looking for pound that's just as weak as ever. Africans are just catching up on the racism game.

Kicking out people of any color who condone the bloody murdering of workers simply for refusing to cooperate with behavior akin to slavery isn't racism. And I'm not sure how you you come to the conclusion it is."Reconcillation" was nothing more than a get out of jail free card for the guys and gals doing the British Monarchies bidding.

Chris Hani was an outspoken opponent of the Apartheid government and actively supported the "armed struggle" against it, but he also had a profound vision for a multicultural South Africa and spoke eloquently of the need for reconciliation and harmony after Apartheid. He was a deeply principled and compassionate man and I believe he would have been an outspoken critic of the Mbeki and Zuma governments.

That accusation is used to divert attention from what the ANC is doing and has been doing since it's inception. They are incompetent and they are worse racists than any white has ever been. The west is totally ignorant on both South Africa and Zimbabwe and they won't admit that they very stupidly supported even more repressive organisations than the previous, so called "racist, oppressive" regimes they had before. The west fucked up in Southern Africa and they damn well knew they doing it too, in the name of political expediency.

Bullshit!! The current ANC regime is worse than any apartheid regime ever was, and what's more, any one with half a brain cell knows that. The country is now ravaged by crime that the ANC promoted against apartheid and there is white genocide happening. I lived in both apartheid and post apartheid South Africa, was born in that region and if there is one thing I know for sure, it's that the ANC was nothing more than a terrorist organisation, and that the country is now worse off than it has ever been at any time in it's entire history. Currently the ANC is running the crime world that they set up against the apartheid regime. Knowing what I do, from living there for many years, I'll never forgive myself for promoting the cause of the black people of South Africa. They have turned non racists into rabid racists and said racists are not white people. Fact. My two brothers are still living in Zimbabwe and South Africa respectively. I know where from I speak.

Hani was a dangerous man. Incited hatred. After all those years, nobody is forced to forgive, but a debt was paid to society. He was in jail for as long as the average murderer whose motive was greed and not politics.So "move on" is about correct. And if you can't? Well, don't. A sentence is determined by a lot of circumstances, but family inability to forgive is not one of them.

If I may - and I am not saying you are doing this, but many people think I can never forgive because I can never forget. I believe it is possible to forgive although one can obviously never forget. My dad was murdered in Cape Town in 1995; I have forgiven the man who killed him although he was never tried for lack of evidence. I can say hand on heart that for all these years, I have been at peace; my father loved me and my family very much and he would not have wanted my life to have been blighted by bitterness and hatred. Nothing will bring him back and I believe I know where he is and that I will see him again. Peace.

There are far more victims of the ANC government and victims of outright racists crimes that have happened after the end of apartheid, than there ever were before the end of apartheid. There is genocide happening against white people in South Africa. Also, the notion or belief that the blacks were there first is also untrue. There were vast swathes of South Africa that contained NO black people before the white people arrived. Blacks were first encountered North East of the Great Kei River in the eastern Cape. Even the Matabele or Ndebele people of Zimbabwe only arrived where they are now in 1820.

To us it may not appear that justice was done. On the flip side, their lives have been transformed by the Biehl family who not only forgave them but took them into their homes and foundation. Her loss was tragic and I do not place myself in her parents' shoes but it would appear that out of darkness some light came - which is the reason why Amy went to South Africa in the first place.

"The deal in 1994 when the ANC took power was that the black majority would forgive the white minority." No it wasn't Sisonke. The deal was that everyone would lay the truth on the table and admit to what had been done, both in perpetuating apartheid and in fighting it. The idea was that apartheid had inflicted damage on the nation as a whole and that the violence and manipulation had rendered many incapable of expressing anything but a blind hatred of the 'enemy'. This idea that 'blacks forgave whites and let them stay' is the simplistic narrative the ANC sold to its supporters while it was indulging itself in an orgy of triumphalist corruption. It's now being resurrected in an attempt to reframe the betrayal of the Freedom Charter as something forced on the ANC by the 'all-powerful' whites. true test is coming - when the ANC loses Johannesburg or Gauteng as a whole, we'll see whether they respect the w

The figure of 3000 murders seems to relate to the estimated 3000-4000 white farmers murdered since 1994. Estimates vary but some put the total number of murdered whites at around 70000 during that period. No that surprising given that there are around 15000-25000 murders in the country every year.

I pulled that line of argument out in the middle of a fairly crazy discussion in downtown Joburg last time I was back in SA. The guy I was arguing with called me an apartheid apologist but his friends laughed him down and he spent the night sulking. The difference, of course, is the immediacy of the brutality of apartheid and colonialism but no-one wants to talk about where the present anger is coming from - the youth aren't upset about Hani's murder; they're pissed off with the broken promise of a post-apartheid dispensation that saw the ANC rip up the Freedom Charter and abandon the poorest people to a wave of political and criminal violence and ongoing poverty. That sense of betrayal has been manipulated since into a narrative that blames 'greedy' white people for the failure of the ANC to educate and emancipate the people.
