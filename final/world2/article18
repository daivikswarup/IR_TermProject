<p>A South Sudanese journalist has been abducted, tortured, burned and dumped near a graveyard, according to local media reports, in the latest attack on the media in the country. </p>

<p>The assault on Joseph Afandy came as he recovered from being held for two months in detention without charge by security forces, after criticising the government’s handling of a two-year civil war.</p>

<p>Afandy, who was reportedly kidnapped on Friday by unknown men in a white vehicle with tinted windows, phoned for help after he was dumped near the graveyard.</p>

<p>“We found him in a bad condition - beaten and burned in his legs,” colleague Ibrahim Awuol told Juba’s Eye Radio on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The journalist is now recovering in hospital.</p>

<p>“We call on authorities to credibly investigate this horrible crime against our colleague, Joseph Afandy, to hold the perpetrators to account, and to ensure the journalist’s safety,” said Robert Mahoney of the Committee to Protect Journalists CPJ’s deputy executive director. “No one should have to endure what this young man has survived.”</p>

<p>Rights groups have accused the security forces of cracking down on journalists, stifling debate on how to end a civil war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed since December 2013.</p>

<p>Seven journalists were killed last year while covering the conflict. Some were caught up in the fighting but a reporter was shot in August in an apparently targeted attack.

<p>Journalist George Livio, who worked for the UN-backed Radio Miraya in the town of Wau, has been in detention since being arrested in August 2014.</p>

<p>Reporters in Juba have described an Orwellian atmosphere in the country, saying only good news about the government is tolerated.</p>

<p>“It is very hard to maintain any level of professional standards here,” said a radio reporter who asked to remain anonymous. “We are only allowed to report about the positives without pointing out weaknesses or what needs to be corrected.”</p>

You should give a wide berth to the drugs.

But the corruption is not just confined to Salva Kiir is it? It will be his second-in-command and then the Minister for Blah and then someone with a little bit of power in an NGO and then someone who has a tribal link with a State Governor and so on and so forth.

South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, is yet another corrupt, preening scoundrel "in a big hat".USA should stop using our tax money for "foreign aid" ( bribes!) to all nation with this and similar leaders.

No wonder aliens have given us a wide berth and will continue to do so.

There were many here on CIF who supported the Libyan bombing and predicted that when Quadaffy was finally deposed the Libyan would build a democracy. Many CIF'ers referred the rebels as the "pro-democracy forces".

Awful. So sad. It makes me angry that governments can't be honest enough with themselves to recognise the benefits of a free press.

The people of South Sudan deserve better..in terms of leadership and government. The kind of "democracy" envisioned by the Western powers who supported the SPLA now wonder if all was for nothing.

No doubt we will learn in due course on this thread that it's our fault.

Wasn't the South Sudan supposed to be the antidote to the brutal, oppressive government of Sudan? How long did it take for the fuck-ees to become the fuck-ers...two years? This is why some of us in the West look at Africa with a combination of pity and terrified amusement. The African way seems to be that whoever is on top sticks it to those who are not. I would like to believe that this is not so, but I do not see much evidence to the contrary.
