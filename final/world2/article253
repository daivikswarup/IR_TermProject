<p>As reformist-backed candidates sweep to victory in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/27/reformists-and-moderates-lead-race-in-early-election-results">Iran’s elections</a>, many voters have taken to social media to share celebratory jokes and mocking memes about the country’s conservative hardliners.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/reformist-backed-candidates-tehran-iran-assembly-elections">Reformist-backed candidates sweep to victory in Tehran</a> </p>

<p>“Dear citizens! Attention please, attention please: Tehran is now free,” read a message widely shared on the popular messaging app, Telegram.<br/></p>

<p>Jokes started circulating on social media on 27 February after it became clear the coalition of candidates supported by the reformists, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/election-day-arrives-in-iran-with-reformists-well-organised-to-seek-gains">dubbed “the list of hope”</a>, was likely to take all of the capital’s 30 parliamentary seats.</p>

<p>One popular quip shared on Telegram imagined the former parliament speaker and conservative hardliner Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel – who eventually lost his seat – resting his head on the legs of Iran’s supreme leader, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a>, telling him: “I won’t go to the parliament!” with Khamenei responding: “Don’t be afraid, my little one. You’ll find new friends.”</p>

<p>With strong <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://telegram.org/privacy">emphasis on privacy protection and anonymity for its users</a> the Telegram app has become a popular platform for pro-reform supporters to spread their message, with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/08/telegram-the-instant-messaging-app-freeing-up-iranians-conversations">one in four Iranian now thought to be using the service</a>.</p>

<p>One joke shared widely on the app showed the head of the Guardian Council of the Constitution, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, pleading: “Don’t push me [out]!” – a reference to the fact that he is was languishing in 15th place on the list of assembly candidates from Tehran. </p>

<p>Other social media users alluded to the house arrest of Iranian opposition figures <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/mir-hossein-mousavi-photograph-emerges">Mir Hossein Musavi</a>, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and fellow reformist cleric Mehdi Karrubi. </p>

<p>The three popular oppositionists were detained in February 2011 after repeatedly challenging the Iranian establishment over human rights abuses. <br/> <br/>The joke has the trio’s supporters declaring that “if Jannati doesn’t get elected, we will take to the streets to protest and claim we’re his fans so that they put <em>him</em> under house arrest.” <br/> <br/>One of the most widespread Telegram memes showed conservative religious leader Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi declaring that it was “haram” [forbidden] to continue counting votes.<br/> <br/>Twitter users riffed on the same theme: @KevinMiston wrote “Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: ‘Please end the vote counting. Please don’t stretch it any longer’.” </p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="rtl" lang="fa"><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B4?src=hash">#شمارش</a> رو تموم کنید لطفا! بیشتر از این کژش ندید 😭 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://t.co/aSsHtO9Yk8">pic.twitter.com/aSsHtO9Yk8</a></p>

<p>Others poked fun at Iran’s highest authority. A viral message lampooned the supreme leader with the text: “I told those opposing the system to vote. But not like this!”<br/></p>

<p>It’s now thought that a combination of reformist-backed candidates, including some moderate conservatives and independents allied with Rouhani, will outnumber the conservatives in the country’s 290-seat parliament.</p>

<p>Many social media users also recognised the role former president Mohammad Khatami played in encouraging people to vote for a list of pro-reformist and relatively moderate candidates.</p>

<p>Khatami released a video online early in the campaign period urging political activists to unite behind “the list of hope”. His <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psMgpk33A60">YouTube video</a> became an instant hit and helped mobilise support – which Twitter users were quick to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Khatami’s role in mobilising voters was celebrated by those who pointed to the fact he has faced severe restrictions on his movement and activities in recent years, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/17/iranian-media-banned-from-mentioning-mohammad-khatami">including a ban</a> on the Iranian media mentioning his name or publishing his photograph.</p>

<p>Khatami’s video also inspired a Telegram message that referenced the controversial frontrunner for the Republican nomination in the US presidential election.</p>

<p>In the joke, Iranian foreign minister Mohamamd Javad Zarif calls up his US counterpart John Kerry and says: “Hey, man, if Donald Trump is really becoming a problem for you guys let me know. I’ll tell our Mohammad [Khatami] to send a message.”</p>

A Westerner may have well grounded objections over personal freedoms, rule of law and some aspects of Iranian foreign policy. However, totally I would be dishonest not to have noticed time and again that Iran, in its peculiar way, is a society with a degree of freedom and political process vibrancy far more serious than that one can observe across the Muslim world. Ironically enough some of our staunchest allies in the ME/Gulf region are mostly autistic autocratic fiefdoms.Led by a few wise and well-meaning people such as Rouhani, Khatemi and last but not least Rafsanjani, steadfast but patient Iranians are clawing back their freedom again.Just let's hope their effort doesn't go to nothing, as has happened before, thanks to hawks in the US DoD, DoS and Congressman on AIPAC's payroll acting at the behest of irrational and short-sighted Netanyahu and the rest of the cabal spawned by the late Ariel Sharon who have unfortunately chosen a very wrong course for Israel. Time will tell.

You can call me a pessimist, but as noted we've seen this before. The hardliners won't give up THAT easily, I guarantee it. In fact, it just might take a full-blown revolution to convince them! Those in absolute, total power will NOT give up their positions without a fight. I hope I am wrong on this.

The "reformist victory" instils hope that Iran is on its path to democratisation - albeit incrementally. It takes another generation for Iranians to really see major social change, as many hard-liners are still around, especially within the Revolutionary Guards, that have a finger in many pies. They determine the course of Iran's foreign policy, mainly in the Middle East. Over half of Iran's population is under 35 and the young people are educated and open-minded. If their peers in the Arab world were the same, the Middle East would be a more peaceful place.

Hey Abdulle - it's not only countries that can be imperialist. Religions can be imperialists too. The imperialists in power in Iran right now, the power that has colonised Iran, and holds the Persian people in bondage, is that foreign import ( Arab ) Islam.

Too much optimism - the Iranian people have been in this position before only to have the Islamic dictatorship send in their goons when it was thought the democratic will ( if you can call the gerrymandered elections this country holds democratic ? ) questioned the despotic rule of the Islamist government.

Well like many reformists they will be ruled by their egos. Let's hope their egos don't lead them to subtly start a coup with outside help or their country will look like Syria and Libya. It suits the western bloc to know now they might get a foot in the door. Freedom is a word misused by most people and political parties who use it to get elected. For a good example the EU controls so called freedom with an invisible Whip.

The revolutionary guard are a great example of a 'non state actors' as well as 'terrorists'. Everything you list above as a critique of 'imperialism' equally applies to your governments use of the guards abroad. When you stop exporting terrorism, then you can complain about the west but not before.

Do you get paid to write these rubbish everywhere? It is not true that single women can walk safely in Tehran. A wife or a women with a male guardian will be safe but not an unaccompanied woman. No 'free' people exist where a government arms and pays for street thugs like the Basiji to attack its own people. The Iranian people voted against this and against trolls like you. It is hard to accept but they do not like you or your politics. I applaud the Iranian people for bravely voting to throw out your brand of politics. Well done to them.

Good result considering extensive election engineering by 'the Guardian Council' which is blatant form of cheating and fraud. It is said that Jena'ati, head of 'the Guardian Council' was in direct contact with the IRGC's intelligence arm who would tell him who should be disqualified. This even caused public criticism by 'the Guardian Council''s own spokesman who complained that "Jena'ati, who was in constant contact with forces outside the council, had turned the council to a taste council'. It is also said Khamenei's own office had been in contact with Jena'ati also instructing him on preventing candidates the 'supreme leader' did not like.

I've seen commentary suggesting that Saudi Arabia is a better ally to have than Iran and there is no getting away from the fact that both are the leading Islamic countries in their relative factions (Sunni and Shia respectively) and run by an oligarchy of old men.But in Iran you get this feeling that they could be reasonably free and democratic country with similar freedoms that other developing countries have. And there does appear to be a genuine respect for learning and education. I feel none of this for Saudi Arabia or any of the countries in it's immediate neighbourhood.

Tell me if it's ever safe to have Nukes for any country or nation? Just watching from thousand miles away what happens when a nuke goes down scares the hell out of any sort of being, what could happen to humanity if that kinda war starts is out of imagination, I myself agree that some nations are radical and a little bit on the edge to launch such bombs but when things go down who's nice any longer? Who's not on the edge?Some reformist party wins here does not mean anything, that's just politics, but if any good comes out, who's to complain, but if not, then one more time it'll show how foolish people can get over politicians playground

"as free as anywhere else"? Did those moderate canditates ban themselves in these 'free as anywhere else' election? No the supreme leader tried to cheat to win the election. And what happened during the green revolution then? Did those protesters kill and beat and torture themselves to death? No the supreme leader ordered this. That is not a 'free' system. That is a police state run by religious crazymen

Iran will never be "free" as they have no idea what it even means! That is a shame too. Soon they will be fighting with someone again, it is in their nature to kill off whatever they dislike.   Until they learn to live and let live the muslim world will not know true freedom.  You see' if my fellow neighbor chooses to wear a dress to work instead of a man's suite it does not affect me anymore than him driving a red or blue car. Well' unless he blows me a kiss, then I may say "go to hell" to him...lol If my other neighbor's wife is cheating on him, again unless it is with me this concerns me not.  The fact is, the rest of the world "expects" a friend and neighbor to live and let live just as he chooses to live their life if it makes them happy. Happy neighbors are friendly neighbors.

You talk nonsense that has nothing to do with my point. I understand why you want to change the subject and blame everyone else, it is easier than realising that it was your supreme leader with his street thugs and police that killed so many of the Iranian people. It was them that killed and tortured during the green revolution. You protect your brutal leader by blaming everyone else except him. You are an apologist for a killer and his killer apparatus. Their blood is on your leaders hands, no one else. Deal with that and stop blaming everyone else.
