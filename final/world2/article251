How my generation of dollar-loving North Koreans will shake up regime




DateTime::::2016-03-01T09:45:18+0000



<p>A generation of North Koreans as familiar with the American dollar as Kim Il-sung is set to dramatically shake up the country, according to young defector Sungju Lee.</p>

<p>Calling those born after 1990 the “market generation”, the 28-year-old says young people are likely to trigger major social and economic changes in the closed-off communist country over the next 20 years.</p>

<p>Capitalism has become an influential force in their lives, Lee says, with nostalgia for life under the “first dictator” – when <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea">North Korea</a> was a new nation and widespread famine had not yet been experienced – no longer entrenching a sense of patriotism.</p>

<p>But Lee, who left the country 2002 and is now studying in UK, says the shift won’t be a result of a rejection of the regime’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kim-jong-un-north-korea-ready-for-any-kind-of-war-against-us/2015/10/10/6270cf60-6dc1-11e5-91eb-27ad15c2b723_story.html">us-against-the-world</a> message, but rather because this propaganda is no longer powerful enough to trump the lure of the markets.</p>

<p>“People of my generation hate the United States but they love the dollar. They hate Japan but they love the yen. Some might hate China but they love the yuan,” he says.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">People of my generation hate the United States but they love the dollar</p>

<p>Lee gives the example of 2009 reforms, which were designed to crack down on the growing power of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8500017.stm">private enterprise and revive socialism</a>. This was a “huge fail”, he claims, and demonstrated that “North Korea cannot control the markets”.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/12/how-millennials-are-shaking-north-koreas-regime.html">Evidence suggests</a> that the so-called market generation has better access than ever to information from the outside world through illegally smuggled DVDs, films and mobile phones.</p>

<p>Lee’s father, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://appgnk.org/tag/sungju-lee/">a former bodyguard</a> in Kim Il-sung’s personal security force, defected when his son was just 12 years old. His mother abandoned him soon after, leaving him to fend for himself on the streets of Hwasong in the north-east.</p>

<p>Lee says he did what was “normal” to survive: he formed a gang with his friends, and “slept in the train station. I was a pickpocket. I fought everyday... I lost two friends on the streets.”</p>

<p>In a passage from his book, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://abramsandchronicle.co.uk/books/young-adult/9781419723810-every-falling-star">Every Falling Star</a>, due to be released in September, the defector describes the experience of being an abandoned child in North Korea. </p>

<p>They came at us, waving metal pipes and broken bottles. Everything became a blur as arms flailed toward and around me. My mind couldn’t keep up with my body, so I just stopped thinking and, as my tae kwon do master had taught me, let technique take over. </p>

<p>I heard that thump of a fist pounding on flesh, and I started kicking anything in front of me.</p>

<p>Then I saw blood... blood pouring from my brothers’ faces and onto their shirts. I attacked even harder then. I started swinging my T-shirts of stones, hearing them crunch against bone. Much later, my brothers would tell me I was like a superhuman</p>

<p>When he was 14, Lee was captured by the “Sang-mu”, a public official, and put into a shelter for street kids. The shelter, where children were forced to clean the streets and carry out other public tasks, is more accurately described as “a grave”, Lee adds.</p>

<p>“People died and we had to bury them with small shovels. We worked and worked and the food was horrible. During the potato season we got potatoes, during the radish season we ate just radishes,” he says. </p>

<p>On 23 October 2002, when he was 16 years old, Lee’s life took a dramatic turn. “I cannot forget that date it was a huge turning point in my life,” he says. He was offered the opportunity to escape the country, starting his long journey to becoming the first North Korean student ever to study at the UK’s Warwick University.</p>

<p>Lee was was approached by a broker carrying a letter from his father inviting him to join him. It said: “Son i’m living in China [and] i’m living well. Come.” </p>

<p>“[The broker] told me he was my father’s best friend, but he was just a business man,” says Lee. The man gave Lee a fake passport, allowing him to fly to South Korea days later. </p>

<p>Like many defectors he then spent more than a decade <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-31904466">trying to adjust</a> to a new life in the midst of a “huge identity crisis... here I was with my [Korean] brothers and sisters but I was being treated like a foreigner,” he says.</p>

<p>“Many defectors are timid because they have strong northern accents, they don’t know anything beyond North Korea and they are scared to make mistakes.” </p>

<p>He says North Koreans come from a deeply engrained communist culture where if “one person says something different from what the community is thinking, people report them”.</p>

<p>Lee is now studying for a masters degree at Warwick University with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.chevening.org/">support of the UK government</a>. When he finishes he wants to apply for a PhD in Korean unification: one of the<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/09/why-many-koreans-cant-face-reunification"> world’s longest running diplomatic stand-offs</a>. “It’s the only way I can go home and see my friends,” he says.</p>

They have no markets and they have no sociaism.

Among the most interesting elements of any escape from North Korea is how it was done; it would have taken an extra sentence to explain

Honestly I do have oodles of respect for many things American. It was a wee bit amusing to see a few impassioned counters to my 'gentle jibe' on a forum where utter contempt of most things 'far east' is not uncommon.

He never says that he personally dislikes the West but likes the benefits of market economy; only that it's dominant view among his generation. And I imagine that some of that has to do with the extreme isolation of North Korea as well. The fact that he risked so much to escape seems to suggest he isn't particularly keen on the government there.

Yes a short article doesn't cover everything a book covers. I suspect a lot of steps were left out, but that is the nature of a short article.

They have no idea what the culture of any nation other than North Korea is. They may or may not love any culture if they knew anything about it. Yes the US has culture just as every other place on earth does.

There is no such thing as a free market, they don't work either. All markets have to operate under regualtions. The cosest things to free markets that exist are places like Zimbabwe and Somaia. That ends up with the majority of the population herding goats barefoot. The most successful systems are a mixture of market capitalism and socialism when it is effective and efficient. Military, fire police infrastructure education and medicine, and working where they work the best with thriving businesses

What works best is the combination of markets and socialism.

They have never been socialist. North Korea has always been a right wing military dictatorship with a figurehead monarchy.

It will at some time fail. IT doesn't have an economy to have anything else happen. The current situation cannot hold. The question is when and how. Will it be a soft landing with the rest of the world pouring in aid or will it be a bloodbath or something in between. Will the rest of the world be able to forestall a refugee crisis by pouting in enough aid.

The one thing NOBODY wants is for North Korea to fail. The cost to both China and South Korea would be too high, with North Korean economic immigrants making the Syrian refugee wave look minuscule.

Yes, he goes across the border with a stranger, possibly pops into his dad's new home in China to say hi and then, aged 12, flies to Seoul on a false passport. No holes in this story then

Apart from the fact that someone who left North Korea 16 years ago, when he was 12, has no better insight into the reality of North Korea today than any Korean yuppie, there are a few holes in this story. So a broker approached him in NK with a letter from his father asking him to join him in China; then a few days later he flies to South Korea on a false passport. How did he get across the border? What happened to his father (did he stop to say "hi dad" before heading off to Seoul aged 12)? But good luck to him for applying his capitalist nouse to getting PR for a book

The pedantic in me feels it's necessary to point out that Milton and Locke were the first to touch upon the Consent of the Governed political philosophy. The United States was the first country to embrace it popularly and codify it as law, though.

North Korea isn't really socialism, though. The reality is that the phrase had lost nearly all of its meaning, and it didn't have very much of it in the first place. But I do agree that the lack of a market economy in North Korea is very damaging to the general populace.

In all honesty, one doesn't even have to read any of the news about the DPRK to know that their economic policy has been an absolute disaster. One can take the fact that from the 50s - 70s, their per capita output was higher than South Korea’s. Now it's a minute fraction. Also, one can just look at a satellite image of the North at night in comparison to it's neighbors ;)

You sure that the sanctions do not affect the economic situation in the country? If you do everything you can to destroy country's economy, you shouldn't be surprised the country has issues with medicine or food even though sanctions don't affect these aspects directly. As for 'disastrous policies', I wouldn't be so adamant in believing everything you get from the news cause the news about NK is extremely biased.



Author::::olman132

Love of the dollar and capitalism will not change NK. The regime will compromise them and force them to adapt, just like in China. The people must change the regime that is imposed on them, or continue to accept the status quo.

The sanctions are based primarily on weapons, dual-use technology (like radar systems), banks and luxury items. There are no sanctions on medicine or food. You can't point to sanctions as being the reason for suffering in North Korea and absolve the disastrous policies of the regime itself of any responsibility.

annaper123, as to your original question of "The US has culture?"



Author::::TiminyCricket
DateTime::::2016-03-01T17:29:31Z
In practice? Depends. The Right of Revolution has existed in one form or another in various nations, but it was only in the US in which it was first codified as a natural right, and thus, is actually an integral part of almost every state constitution in the union.
