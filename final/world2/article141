US zoos secretly fly 18 elephants out of Swaziland ahead of court challenge




DateTime::::2016-03-09T18:37:03+0000



<p>Three American zoos have pulled off an audacious clandestine operation to fly a group of elephants out of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/swaziland">Swaziland</a> despite a legal challenge to block the transfer, enraging conservationists who claim that removing elephants from the wild for display in zoos is cruel and outdated.</p>

<p>The 18 elephants – three males and 15 females ranging in age from six to 25 – were sedated, loaded onto crates and placed on a large cargo plane that arrived in Swaziland at around 7.30am local time on Tuesday. Pictures taken at the scene show several large crates, ostensibly for elephants, being picked up by a crane and placed onto trucks.</p>

<p>The elephants will be split among three zoos – the Dallas zoo, Sedgwick County zoo in Kansas and Henry Doorly zoo in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/nebraska">Nebraska</a> – where they will be put on exhibit and used for breeding purposes.</p>

<p>The unannounced move, which was previously scheduled for May, has stunned an animal welfare group that was due to argue against the transfer in a US federal court on 17 March. The group, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.friendsofanimals.org/">Friends of Animals</a>, has now admitted defeat in its bid to prevent what it calls the “stolen 18” from being taken from the wild and placed into zoos.</p>

<p>Friends of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/animals">Animals</a> filed for an emergency injunction to stop the transfer, argued via a frantic teleconference with US federal court judge John Bates. Bates’s ruling notes that the short timeframe meant he was “not able to definitively resolve the issue”. But he sided with the zoos, which pointed out that the elephants had already been drugged and that leaving them in the small African nation would have put them at risk.</p>

<p>Michael Harris, legal director of Friends of Animals, said the last of the elephants were transferred from temporary holding areas to the plane on Wednesday, ahead of their 9,000-mile journey to the US.</p>

<p>“This is blatantly underhanded, I’ve never seen anything like it in 20 years doing this,” he said. “This is a devious and dramatic way to avoid the court hearing on 17 March. I certainly think the legal fight to save them is over. But the fight to make them martyrs is just beginning – they really are the stolen 18.</p>

<p>“The drugging and crating will be very traumatic for the elephants and will live with them for a long time. The majority of these elephants are under 12 years old, which means they will spend the next 50 years feeling like captives. They will suffer in captivity, there is no doubt of that.”</p>

<p>The US Fish and Wildlife Service has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/01/22/2016-01226/draft-environmental-assessment-dallas-zoo-management-dallas-texas">granted a permit</a> to the zoos to import the elephants, amid <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/26/18-elephants-to-be-flown-us-zoos-drought-puts-pressure-on-swaziland-wildlife">concerns that they will be culled</a> due to the intense drought that has gripped southern Africa. The zoos have said the removal of the elephants from Swaziland’s Hlane national park will relieve pressure on other wildlife, such as rhinos, and has called opposition to the transfer “ideological”.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, the three zoos said they had to rapidly remove the elephants for their own wellbeing due to the deteriorating situation in Swaziland.</p>

<p>“As food supply became scarcer, urgency increased to relocate the elephants to homes where they could be well cared for,” the zoos said. </p>

<p>“The attempt by activists to further delay the relocation only jeopardized the animals. The elephants would have been killed if not relocated. Scarcity of food and water and the risk of malnutrition are creating the most significant health threat to people and animals throughout the region. For the sake of the elephants, we moved quickly to relocate these animals to safe homes with a secure future.”</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.aza.org/">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a>, the accrediting body for zoos, said it supports the removal of the elephants. A spokesman said the three zoos have “taken every precaution” to safeguard the animals. </p>

<p>But activists have argued that the elephants should be moved elsewhere in Africa, claiming that Swaziland’s king has prevented them from migrating and finding food. Non-profit group Groupelephant.com said it was willing to relocate them to South <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a>, calling the US transfer “purely a money-making transaction for Swaziland the zoos involved”.</p>

<p>The drought in southern Africa, fueled by the El Niño climatic event, is a further burden to bear for the continent’s dwindling population of elephants. Recent data <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/03/african-elephants-killed-faster-than-they-are-being-born">released by the UN</a> shows that more African elephants are being killed for ivory than are being born, meaning that the overall population is in decline. It’s estimated that an elephant is killed by poachers roughly every 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Conservationists maintain there are signs of hope for the species, despite the loss of 20,000 elephants to poaching in 2015. Poaching rates peaked in 2011 and have declined markedly in countries such as Kenya. </p>

<p>But the species remains under severe pressure, with Barack Obama <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/03/obama-urgent-action-needed-save-elephants-extinct">voicing fears earlier this month</a> that elephants could vanish in the wild during his lifetime. The US president said such an event would be an “unpardonable loss for humanity and the natural world”.</p>

Since I'm from the USA, I'll talk about it instead : The U.S. has reintroduced the bison, the wolf, the bald eagle, the American crocodile, and the grizzly bear, and the manatee, among others. Africa has a LONG way to go to combat the eradication of the elephant, the gorilla, the lion, and the rhino, amongst many others.

True true. The court avoidance and speedy move is sketchy, but at the same time the elephants are accounted for and able to be tracked as opposed to them just disappearing and reappearing (or not) elsewhere.

The secrecy wasn't from the Swazi government. It was from the groups in South Africa and the US who had alternative relocation plans for the elephants. The Swazi government knew full well what was happening - and what they were getting out of the deal. Let's just say the dollar is a strong currency and leave it at that. It is not stupidity - it is corruption and /or greed.

Shad, the license was originally obtained and in the news, like you say, last fall. There was nothing secretive about it then, and you are right, the Swazi government did indeed claim that they would be killed if not saved. All of this changes when groupelephant stepped in to provide money and a relocation plan for the elephants. It was not necessary any more for them to be 'saved' by the zoos - there was an alternative plan on the table to relocate them to a safe, natural environment. There was a court case underway for Friends of Animals and groupelephant to lay out their plan. The secrecy was that the zoos, despite being midway through the court case, sent a plane to Swaziland, without letting the court, or the other parties in the suit, know, and started sedating and crating the elephants. It was an underhanded bypass of the law.

What pure nonsense. A country of hunters responsible through Teddy Roosevelt for the first wholesale slaughter of the elephants of the African continent, the corpses and bones of which are hidden in crypts? The country that slaughtered all its large mammals and stopped the buffalo run? The country of Cyril the lion murderer dares to presume to lecture our continent about Animal conservation and justify its kidnapping of a species that requires a thousand miles to roam? A nation of gun nuts dares to wag a finger at a continent that alone in the world has sustained the lives and existence of the large mammals, a continent that preaches life rather than death? A continent that contains the world's last remaining wildernesses? You blame the Catholic church for our children and fecundity as if we have no minds and choices of our own, we the children of a people who live the conservation values? You come to plunder our heritage and legacy because you have failed to sustain your own and then you dare to tell us it is 'for our good'? You covet and destroy even what is ours and then you dare to declare that we have no idea of what to do with what we already have? Your greed and hubris are beyond the pale. Hypocrisy on top of a sophisticated poaching method disguised as philanthropy when everything was only due to the bottom line: money. Shame. Shame. Shame.

As much as I am totally against the removal of these elephants from Africa, I have to correct you on your statement of You don't "save" a species by putting them all in captivity. Numerous species, who were critically endangered in the wild, have been taken into captivity, bred and then returned back into the wild after legislation was passed to prevent the same thing from happening again. 2 examples are the American Bison and the California Condor.

Evidently you have never seen the Omaha zoo. These elephants will have 28 acres and a state of the art winter home. Either this or they would have been killed. Yes, these intelligent creatures will miss their family but at least they will be alive instead of bones in a museum.

It may seem cruel but the other option was to kill them. Would you pull the trigger? No, it's not a perfect situation but given the politics in Africa, the lives of the animals were saved.

There was nothing secret about this. I live in Omaha and this was on the news last fall. When the story first came out, if the elephants weren't relocated, they would have been killed to prevent them from starving to death. The lawsuit was brought to prevent the elephants from going to zoos which would have meant certain death for them. We humans have a peculiar mindset when it comes to putting animals in holding facilities. We do this to our elderly by putting them in nursing homes all the time. Our elders would have died if it weren't for us putting them in homes yet when an animal would die without being put into a zoo, it's unthinkable. The Omaha zoo is rated #1 in the world not because of the spectacle of putting animals on display, but because of the treatment of the animals and their conservation efforts. The 6 elephants coming here will have 28 acres and a brand new, state of the art, winter home. For those of you dead set against containment of these beautiful animals, I pose the question of: which would you rather... Would you rather go to Swaziland, take a gun and shoot them in the head? Would you rather go to Swaziland and watch these animals starve to death over several months? Would you rather their dead bones be put in a museum so that future generations could imagine what such a creature looked like before they were all gone? Would you rather have them live in a 28 acre pen where they are still alive? The Omaha zoo single handedly brought back the black footed ferret after it was thought to be extinct. A small family was found in Wyoming years after they were thought to be extinct. From less than 20 ferrets, they have bred hundreds and released them back into their natural habitat. Omaha has the most millionaires per capita and the zoo benefits from their philanthropy. I cannot, however, speak for the wellbeing of those going to other zoos.

As a bioacoustician (recording wildlife sounds and soundscapes worldwide), I was asked by the Director of the Henry Doorly Zoo in the early 1990s to score a source for some proboscis monkeys (Borneo) for his exhibits. This was not legal at the time. Nevertheless, several American zoos and marine parks ran a not-so-secret black market world network securing a long list of animals that would not have been otherwise sanctioned.

The point is exactly that they would not have been culled, or been poached, or have starved. The group elephant had money set aside and a relocation plan on the table. They didn't get the chance to present their side of the argument since the zoos preempted the legal process taking its course by their actions. The elephants would have been relocated to a safe game reserve in South Africa. We failed to find the best solution for these animals when the zoos took the law into their own hands.

I'm glad to hear at least 6 of these elephants are destined for what sounds like a better-than-average environment. However, the area is still much smaller than their natural roaming area. The other concern is indeed that family units are being broken up. 15 out of the 18 animals are less than 12 years old. Elephants mimic human years - that is, they reach puberty at around 12-13, and by 14-15 the bulls spend around 80% of their time away from their families (just like humans, right!?) and finally leave the breeding herd. They only start breeding when they are as old as 30 (ok, unlike most humans :-). Anyways, this all to give you sense of how 'young' a 12 year old elephant is. Still very much dependent on mom. I have an 11 year old myself and cannot imagine him being removed from our family unit. It would be unthinkable.

Overpopulation is an interesting topic that is widely researched and discussed by scientists and conservationists in Africa. The theory of how to deal with it have changed much over the years. Culling used to be the way back in the '80s, but less so these days. Spatial redistribution (opening more fences to enlarge roaming areas) is another, as is the development of a contraceptive. The point here is that it is a problem, but that captivity is hardly a solution. Given the numbers we deal with when speaking about overpopulation, 18 elephants is hardly going to make a dent in that. I don't really see the logic in complaining about overpopulation on the one hand and then claiming the zoos are saving a species by transporting a mere 18 elephants to another country. South Africa has been doing an outstanding job managing and protecting their elephant population, and they certainly don't need 'help' from the zoos. This was a move by the zoo for pure selfish purposes - to draw a crowd. It is inhumane. Their methods of getting them were underhanded. Elephants suffer greatly in captivity. Captivity is not the answer to overpopulation or drought.

I'm with you, not a fan of zoos at all, but I dunno if the africans can protect their critters well enough. And a drought on top of it. Maybe the preserve in SA could have worked, but wouldn't they undergo transportation trauma to there? Maybe this was the right way in the end, I hope the zoos treat them well.I can't begin to describe how painful it is to hear these stories.

That was indeed the plan - to move these elephants to a private game reserve in South Africa. This is what part of the legal battle was about: the fact that there was a plan on the table to relocate these animals to a natural habitat. Before the legal system could run its course, the zoos went ahead and started sedating and crating these animals. You are completely correct that elephant poaching is not as large a problem in South Africa as in other parts of Africa.

Sanctuary in Africa is available. These animals should not be removed as the stress on them can be overwhelming. Time for the US zoo industry to call it quits. The money would be better spent in Africa on habitat restoration, anti poaching measures and animal sanctuary. Awful outcome for them this time.

Exactly. And it looks like lazy profiteering at that! If these zoos want to support the continuing existence of these particular elephants, there are other options besides drugging them & giving them lives in captivity and on display in places like Kansas or Nebraska. They could sponsor conservation efforts in their native habitat, and still sell t-shirts and coffee mugs to local zoo visitors. Sell the rights to name an elephant, or sponsor live feed video on the zoo's website, or some other non-intrusive means of support.
