Ten Years – the terrifying vision of Hong Kong that Beijing wants obscured

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t has been hailed as one of the best films to come out of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> in decades, playing to packed houses and picking up nominations for two major Asian awards.</p>

<p>But if you want to see the independent production Ten Years the only places are private showings advertised through Facebook.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/19/xi-jinping-does-china-truly-love-big-daddy-xi-or-fear-him">Xi Jinping: Does China truly love 'Big Daddy Xi' – or fear him?</a> </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/jan/21/press-freedom-body-calls-for-eu-sanctions-against-chinese-media">As Beijing steps up its crackdown on political dissent</a>, the film’s disappearance has left some moviegoers scratching their heads and wondering whether the long hand of the mainland authorities may be responsible.</p>

<p>The timing of attacks from the mainland and the content of Ten Years appears to bear this out.</p>

<p>The film is a dystopian narrative composed of five short stories in which Hong Kong has been totally taken over by <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> to the point that neither the language, Cantonese, nor local agricultural products can be freely used.</p>

<p>The film first hit the screens at a local film festival in November before getting a wider release the following month.</p>

<p>But general release ended in January – when it was still playing to full houses.</p>

<p>That move coincided with a forthright attack China’s Global Times – the mainland mouthpiece of the Communist party – labelling the film “absurd”, “too pessimistic” and a “virus of the mind”.</p>

<p>A more overt censorship has since appeared with the decision by China that for the first time since 1991 mainland audiences will not be able to watch a live broadcast of the Hong Kong Film Awards nor of the Taiwan Golden Lion Film Awards – Asia’s answers to the Oscars. The website portal QQ.com has followed suit, and it will not cover the Awards. Ten Years has been nominated as one of the films of the year in both awards.</p>

<p>Shu Kei, a film critic and professor at Hong Kong’s Academy for Performing Arts says China’s reaction is a mistake.</p>

<p>“I think it is stupid, of course, for China to cancel the broadcasts. But this is always their reaction when they do not want people to know more about something.</p>

<p>“This is a very important film. The first in decades that tackles the reality in Hong Kong,” he says.</p>

<p>Made on a shoestring – it cost just 600,000 HK dollars (£55,000) to make – it has made profits at every screening.</p>

<p>“It has already made more than 6m HK dollars (£550,000),” says Andrew Choi, one of the producers, “and it is still playing to packed audiences every time.”</p>

<p>Broadway Circuit, Hong Kong’s main theatre chain with many outlets in mainland China too, was asked for comment but did not return calls about why it had stopped showing a lucrative film.</p>

<p>According to Choi they pulled it “they had too many other films to show”. But Ten Years was grossing more than Star Wars at one of its outlets, Broadway Cinematheque, when its run ended.</p>

<p>“I have never heard anywhere else that a film that sells full houses at every single screening is pulled out from the theatres, but no exhibitor will admit to censorship or direct pressure from China,” says Shu Kei.</p>

<p>None of this has deterred its fans. The film has since been showing at private screening at universities and other rented venues. It is advertised through a Facebook page, and still gets daily full houses.</p>

<p>“We actually prefer it this way, as this gives us a chance to talk with our audience afterwards,” says Chow Kwun-wai, one of the directors.</p>

<p>At one such screening at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, filled to capacity, a worried spectator asked what could be done to “save Hong Kong” from its rapid deterioration and loss of identity.</p>

<p>“It is true that things in Hong Kong are happening faster than in our film,” says Chow.</p>

<p>The film captures the angst about the future felt by many in Hong Kong and it strikes a chord with the audience. </p>

<p>Outside the theatre, Ramsy, a 16-year-old student, says that seeing Ten Years made him think that “we must take action ... Some of the worst predictions [for Hong Kong] have already taken place, I have no confidence in China right now. And even the UK cannot help us anymore: nobody wants to stand up to China”.</p>

<p>Since the film was first screened, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/29/hong-kong-booksellers-confirm-arrests-illegal-trading-china-tv">five booksellers of volumes critical of the Chinese authorities have disappeared</a> from Hong Kong, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/09/hong-kong-police-fire-live-rounds-into-the-air-during-clashes-over-plan-to-close-street-markets">police have fired live rounds</a> in the air during night clashes between protesters and security forces over Chinese New year.</p>

<p>“A lot of people tell us: we do not need to wait ten years. All this is already happening”, said Ng Ka-leung, one of the directors. “We need more wisdom and courage to face the future, to face the ridiculous situation in which Hong Kong finds itself in right now.</p>

<p>“Our film is not a prediction: it is about the need to face the future together, when evil seems to prevail we must not lose hope.”</p>

The saddest thing about the comments is that the CCP trolls know less about their own history than the other people commenting who have probably never been to China. I lived in China for a number of years and it is amazing how the place has this veneer that makes you think its just a normal sort of place until you try to do something like access facebook and then when you start to look deeper you realize you are living in a gilded cage where all information is filtered and all opinion is subtly manipulated.

China is not an ethnically diverse place, in spite of what many imagine. Over 90% of the citizens are classified as Han Chinese and identify as such. They feel first and foremost Chinese, and don't want to separate. Yes they speak different dialects, but these have never been written languages and are only spoke in informal situations. Wherever you go in China, you can get around in Putonghua (standard Chinese). The only places which could be considered ethnically diverse are Western and South Eastern areas with a relatively small population. China being an ethnically diverse country held together by the government is just another myth.

Possibly, no-one really knows how bad it is. They have a lot more going for them than any country in the world, but also a ton more bad debt. I agree it's going to get very messy. But if the good people of Hong Kong think that things would be any better under the once-relevant country that are now selling everything they've got to the mainland neighbours they love to look down on....

Mao had undoubtedly committed a lot of serious blunders which had resulted in the death of tens of millions but ask any Chinese for his opinion of Mao, the vast majority would tell you that his deeds outweigh his misdeeds. Ask any Indian if British colonisation was good for India, over 99% would condemn British imperialism.

You may not be from Hong Kong and not be interested in Hong Kong history and you consider yourself an expert? Sure, legislative democracy only came in 1995, but there were attempts by the British to introduce self-rule as early as 1947 with the Young Plan. The debate dragged on for a few years and by then China became communist and threatened to invade Hong Kong unless the British remained in power.

Its nice to hear the perspective of the Communist Party of China. Amazing how westerners can tell, isn't it? You see the English grammar may be reasonable, but it can't hide the thought control, the patternistic statements. Free people just don't speak like this.

Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were completely British territory, and "owned" by the Crown. The New Territories were leased for 99 years. In the early 80s there was a plan to declare Hong Kong Island an independent state but eventually it dissipated.

What you are getting wrong here is that Cantonese, Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka, Shanghainese, Komese, Teochew are all separate languages with separate grammar, syntax, vocabulary and identities.

Wrong on all fronts. Giving the people of Hong Kong true autonomy is the solution. It will allow it to institute its own policy that differentiate it from the neighbouring mainland.

All such films do is just stoking public fear and prejudice against mainland China with ridiculous and sensationalist imaginations. The truth is crystal clear - Nobody is able to save Hong Kong from its inevitable decline, and it'd better accept it. In fact Beijing already gave HK massive support after it returned, no matter during the 1997 Asia Financial Crisis or 2003 SARS. However, the rise of HK was under very special historical circumstances when China was underdeveloped and closed to the outside world. With the rise of China its role is just finished. In fact if it were still under British rule now it would only do much worse. Actually Beijing didn't do anything negative to HK in recent years, before the clearly misguided and baseless uproars erupted which teared HK society further apart. Of course the majority of the HK population live in frugal conditions and can't see much hope for the future and the government has been working always in favor of the big capitals, and for this they indeed have reasons to complain and feel uneasy. But such extreme social stratification has always been the norm in such a colonial society and has absolutely nothing to do with Beijing. If the Hongkongese want to do anything they should first just get rid of their sense of inferiority in the face of westerners and acknowledge their colonial past and see what they can do about it in the era of a rising China. I don't think anybody is able to ban the playing of any film in HK yet, so while I think the film is just sheer demagogue in the same manner as Trump and it's better off disappearing, blaming so-called censorship on its not being played is going in the same vein as the film itself - imagining something out of nothing.

Certification is not a requirement for showing films. Basically, it is a process where it the age suitability gets determined. It is not a must, unless you want to attract more family audiences. It has nothing to do with this.

Oh, the masters, really? A Latvian was the first commander of the Gulag, and there were LOTS of Latvians in NKVD. In the Soviet times, Latvians and Estonians always had the best jobs (the hard work in the factories was done by Russians, Ukrainians and others), they were free to use their language and education in it was provided from kindergarten up to (and including) PhD degrees. Newspapers, books, PhD theses were published in the "local" languages. At the same time, Latvians and Estonians were free to go and study and work anywhere in the Soviet Union with scholarships and positive discrimination to help them along the way. What Latvians and Estonians prefer not to remember is their past before the Soviet Union - with German-speaking elites and the locals doing farm jobs without any access to proper education or healthcare. Now, what about the 40% of the population of Latvia who speak Russian and PAY TAXES? What about their human rights? You see, the problem with selective application of human rights is that it always backfires and the weaklings should know better than to use it to torment others. Things are changing, Russia is on the rise (as is China) and soon there will be hell to pay.

There are not autopsies published about the 2000 or so dead protestors killed in the centre of Beijing.And it is more than probable the some were crushed - combining tanks with people only works if you intend to kill since tank crew have a very bad view of the outside world.Killing several thousand peacefu protestors in the centre of a capital city is very very rare and have never been done in Washington or London.

Sadly, Scotland never experienced the Enlightenment or the Industrial Revolution. Until Mel Gibson the Liberator arrived on the scene to remind them that they were, in fact, a people of Celtic heritage, they lived under the sorry delusion that they were actually just one of many 'Anglo-Norman' factions. Tragic stuff with a happy ending but that's Holyrood for you...

In contrast to the Russians, the British have returned every single inch of land they grabbed in the Opium Wars. The Russians, on the other hand, are still holding onto the Chinese land they took from China in the Second Opium War. So when the time come to the PRC to claim trauma and historical injustice from foreign powers in the Opium Wars, the Russians better look at themselves in the mirror and stop lecturing others.

You are totally wrong. Britain handed over Hong Kongbecause there was no way to hold it any more. One of the last acts of a long-defunct empire. Prince Charles cried openly. It was the end note.
