<p>Hundreds of videos have been posted on social media begging the Chechen leader, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ramzan-kadyrov">Ramzan Kadyrov</a>, to stay in power after he threatened to stand down when his term ends in April. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/28/chechnya-leader-announces-intention-to-stand-down-at-end-of-term">Chechnya leader Kadyrov says he will quit at end of term</a> </p>

<p>Speaking <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1609494/">to a Russian TV channel</a> the 39-year-old said he had no desire to continue as leader and that “the nation’s leadership needs to find another person so that my name isn’t used against my people”.</p>

<p>Since then a public campaign voicing support and adoration for the leader has gained momentum, with many posts featuring crying children — amid suggestions the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.rferl.org/content/chechnya-kadyrov-resignation-campaign-staying/27583657.html">campaign has been endorsed or instigated</a> by government officials. </p>

<p>On Instagram – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/kadyrov_95/">which Kadyrov uses</a> to issue various edicts and announcements – a Russian-language hashtag that translates as “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8/">Ramzan don’t go</a>” had been used on more than 7,000 posts as of 1 March.</p>

<p>The day after Kadyrov’s announcement a group calling itself the Civic Forum of the Chechen Republic released a statement saying “society sees no alternative to [Kadyrov] and there can be no talk of successors”.</p>

<p>The statement was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.chechnya.gov.ru/page.php?r=126&amp;id=17638">published on the official website </a>of the Chechen administration, stoking speculation the that announcement could be a PR stunt to rally support. </p>

<p>Kadyrov all but inherited his post as leader following the assassination of his father, Akhmad, in 2004. He also inherited a Kremlin strategy that came to be known as “Chechenisation”, which encouraged Chechen paramilitaries to fight against the separatist rebels and Islamic radicals in the second Chechen war.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Kadyrov’s resignation interview came on the same day that tens of thousands of people marched through Moscow’s streets to mark the anniversary of the killing of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was gunned down just meters from the Kremlin. One of the men now under arrest in connection with the killing is a top commander in a paramilitary unit close to Kadyrov.</p>

<p>“There isn’t a clear replacement for him. There is international pressure that points to him as an obvious bad guy, the links to the Nemtsov murders, so maybe there’s an effort to distance the Putin regime from all that, and have him step down,” said Olga Oliker, director of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> and Eurasia Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, Kadyrov has been Putin’s guy in Chechnya,” added Oliker, author of Russia’s Chechen Wars 1994-2000: Lessons From Urban Combat.<br/> <br/>“Who replaces him? What credibility he has, comes from his dad. So who comes next? Does it fall apart?” Oliker asked. “Does anyone in Moscow really know what’s going on in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/chechnya">Chechnya</a>?”<br/></p>

A genuine mistake and it is sometimes hard when using a phone to comment. Despite having a slight Russian style, your English is actually pretty good - My intention was not to criticise your grasp of English but to verify your origin. (The Russians who comment here tend to be quite shy about their nationalities).

Ever since I saw Daesh driving columns of T-72's and posing with Russian kit like the ZU-23-2 "Sergey" and 9K32 Strela-2/SA-7 I've been wondering how the Russians made contact to sell them. Now it all makes sense. I wondered why Tsar Putin kept a mad-dog Sunni Islamist in the house. In an age where their main export (oil) is suddenly worth less than the barrel than contains it they're going to have to fall back on their second biggest export;- weapons of death.



Author::::TheinfamousmrFox

Really...? You're still pretending that Russia has done anything other than help Daesh? You've been selling them weapons, bombing their opposition and lying about who you're bombing since you got there.

I don't know what's more pathetic. This strange notion you have that your failed bs info war is important enough for anyone to hire people to copy or that you think a failed mirroring attack detracts from the fact that he makes a damn sight more sense than your propaganda.

Russia has asked where the Freedom Fighters within Syria are located so they can be written out from the targeting computers but it looks like the batches produced by the US only amounted to 5 persons. Or about $100 million per friendly terrorist - the Yanks were certainly 'taken to the cleaners'.

The current Turkish government believes that All Terrorists within Syria are 'Freedom Fighters ' even those who are ISIL. This says a lot for your lack of principles that you agree with the current Turkish Government.

Once the British workers loved Extra Stout - it was even recommend by the NHS to be taken by pregnant mothers. Now the British teens + 20 somethings target 'Happy Hour' boozing that can last for hours - perhaps the teaching in schools should include the damage caused by consuming cheap imported alcohol that rots their kidneys and liver.The Irish still favour bootleg booze made from potatoes- I found it OK for emergency fuel for paraffin lamps but it was too raw on the palet. At one time Polish Vodka was all the rage but at 140 proof the medical downsides could be as lethal as drinking meths.

He's young at 39. Maybe he just wants to take his piles of loot and go enjoy himself in some secluded villa. Compare Chechnya to almost anywhere and I think you'll prefer almost anywhere.

Actually a Chechen islamist militia attacked Dagestan not the Government. Though effective government had collapsed and the Russians saw it as an opportunity.

Given that your grammatical mistakes are very Russian a very pro-Putin stance on Ukraine, Russia, and Chechnya, can I conclude that the president you are speaking of is Putin? If so, I disagree that he is a placeholder but yes, the country is being run by a small elite and most of them have strong personal connections to Putin.

There are hundreds of victims in other locations and all of that was documented in the White book by the investigation committee of the RF and all of that is addressed to the UN. Tit for tat my ass, they killed women.

Is that 400 people in mass graves John? NO. Is that MH-17 Victims being paraded as evidence? NO. Did Lavrov openly make those claims? YES. Did the groups ( OSCE ) that he claimed backed up those massive figures say he was lying? YES. Did Amnesty international say he was lying. YES.

Actually......this is the most noble thing he can do. Obviously he is no saint, but, no leader ever is. A wise leader realizes that the best thing that one can ever do as a leader is help turn over the reigns in a non-violent but yet a politically tugging environment instead of chaos.

Ukierania directed MH17 to the war zone air space. It's not a matter of belief but a material fact. Now, one can reasonably believe Poro & Co directed the plane to Donbass to be shot down on purpose stupidly hoping the blame would fall on Russia and that will mobilize the entire West to declare war on Putin for his Poro's cause. The question is whether Kyev committed that stupidity out of well.. plain stupidity or was there a murderous intent for political, propaganda and (they wished) military gain?...



Author::::sexywhiskers2k16
DateTime::::2016-03-04T18:45:45Z
What's implied should be obvious to you ie Kadyrov is a murderous gangster ditto by association is Putin and the entire Russia is a mafia dictatorship with a crumbling economy.. The regime invaded Ukierania, bombing "moderate opposition" in Syria. poisoned Litvinenko, opposed to queer marriage and behind of any murder of any nobody there is - the stock Guardian set of talking points. Kindly remind me if I miss something.

Adoring a leader is one thing but when it is made difficult or dangerous to criticise them, that is something entirely different.

Your second response is interesting and I do believe you - For many, it must be an opportunity to hit at Kadyrov's forces abroad, as well as Putin's.

What's wrong with people adore their leader?.. There is something - just ask the Guardian which seems to be insinuating something like that as per usual... Of course, whoever is behind that piece of trash of a content would rather wars in Chechnya go on up to this day. Alas, you can't always get what you want... State Department. Enjoy the messes you made in other places though ie Syria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan... Pity wars in Ukraine and Georgia didn't last long enough for you eh?.. Hey, ever tried to meddle in Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan?.. Armenia perhaps? What if a long bloddy festering conflict over there?? Simply imagine the beauty of it all: Thousands dead, wounded, refugees, anti-Russian hysteria in the media... Now there's an idea... Go ahead, punks, give a shot, make your day.
