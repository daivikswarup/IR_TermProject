Martin Crowe tributes reflect the man, and show cricket at its best

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>f our friendships are the best measure of our worth, then Martin Crowe must have been a great man. A better batsman even than his average signified, and a brighter thinker than his writing suggested. Crowe <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/03/martin-crowe-obituary">died of lymphoma</a> last Thursday, at the age of 53. In the last five days he has received an extraordinary, almost unprecedented, number of exquisite tributes. In this paper, Mike Selvey spoke of Crowe’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/03/martin-crowe-batting-master-craftsman-mike-selvey">“ethos of fair play, responsible behaviour and enjoyment”</a>, and admired the “rational fortitude” with which he faced his illness. Greg Chappell described <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/04/martin-crowes-insatiable-curiosity-made-him-the-thinking-mans-cricketer">Crowe’s enquiring mind</a>, his obvious “talent and athleticism”, his “intelligence and desire to succeed”. In The Times, Mike Atherton wrote of “one of the game’s keenest minds”, a man who stood up to “rampant ego, selfishness, boorishness, bullying”.</p>

<p>They go on. On <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://cricketwithballs.com/2016/03/03/the-hero-who-wore-a-white-helmet/">Cricket With Balls</a>, Jarrod Kimber marvelled at the perfection of Crowe’s batting, a “beautifully illustrated coaching manual come to life”. In Wisden India, Dileep Premachandran described the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-blog/martin-crowe-marked-by-nature-gone-too-soon/203067">“unflinching honesty and vulnerability”</a> of Crowe’s writing. Cricinfo, where Crowe did much of that writing, surpassed itself and everyone else. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/978251.html">Mark Nicholas wrote</a> that Crowe had become “an irresistible conscience for those of us left behind”. Ed Smith <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/978855.html">addressed Crowe’s two lives</a>, the first as an “effortless technician”, “majestic and lordly”, the other as a thinker, “equally deft and assured”. And then there was Gideon Haigh, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/890241.html">whose eulogy for Crowe</a> was too fine to fillet for a single line:</p>

<p>Martin’s love of cricket was fathomless: so passionate he needed to break from it from time to time; so profound he always found his way back to the fold. His great theme in the last while was anger and ill-feeling on the cricket field. The world was so full of it; why could cricket not provide some sort of refuge, a better example?</p>

<p>Few cricketers have received so many moving tributes, or provoked such an out-pouring of fine and thoughtful praise. Each article is affecting when read on its own, and taken all together the collection is entirely overwhelming. In death Crowe inspired the best of his colleagues in the press box, just as in life he once inspired it in his team-mates on the field. The sorrow of it is that he wasn’t around to read all these words, but you hope they will provide some solace for his family in their grief. Crowe seems to have touched so many people. There are others, too: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/content/story/977969.html">the men he played with and against</a>, and the ones he mentored once he was done. <br/></p>

<p>As for the man himself, it feels like there’s little left to add, least of all from those, like me, who only knew him from what they’d seen or read on page and screen. Because, aside from their subject, the one thing that each of these articles shared was that their writers had a personal connection to Crowe. Selvey and Chappell both spoke of seeing him for a final time in New Zealand. Kimber mentioned meeting him in India. Smith, Atherton and Premachandran referred to their email conversations. Haigh and Nicholas talked at length about their friendships with him, Nicholas’s forged early in Crowe’s playing days, when he was still a student, and Haigh’s made long after Crowe had quit playing, though not studying, the game. Friendships forged on cricket fields can sometimes seem just a little stronger and longer-lasting than those made elsewhere. And as Haigh says: “With Martin there was no such thing as a trivial contact. Perhaps because it was his own aim, he made you want to be your best self.”</p>

<p>Add them all up, and they serve as a remarkable testament to Crowe’s own qualities, and also to those of the game he loved so much. He shared that love with this disparate range of writers, from England, Australia, and India, some young, others old, some great Test players, others strictly amateur, all equally smitten with cricket. Crowe’s memory, like the sport, is so well-served by such an array of fine minds and talented writers. The internet has made so many publications from so many different places so much more accessible that readers are spoiled for choice.</p>

<p>Had Crowe been able to read any of these tributes, he would have been delighted, you guess, not only by the praise for his own batting, captaincy, and writing, but also the way in which his passing provoked such an expression of love for the sport itself, and so brilliantly illustrated the way in which so many people, from so many different parts, are bound together by their mutual enthusiasm for it. “What we can strive for is to restore our sport’s lost integrity and loving feeling, so the fans can be lifted once more from their daily grind,” Crowe wrote <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/875999.html">in his final column</a>. “International cricket, nation v nation, is about patriotism and a bit of tribalism, but not hate.” His death seems, for a time, to have bought the community around cricket just a little closer together, united as so many people in their feelings for him. </p>

Great post.

Depends on the job. Why do you think many kiwis come for a while, then go home. Matter of fact, why are there so many Brits here if what you say is true?

Beautifully written, Andy. Of all the tributes, Mark Nicholas's was for me the most moving, not only because of the emotional outpouring from a clearly grieving Nicholas, but because of the astonishing letter from Martin to his brother Jeff reproduced in it with the latter's blessing. This letter, written just a month before his passing, represents Martin's last thoughts on the game he loved, and it makes gripping reading.

I noted, in the article, the description of Martin Crowe's batting as:

Remember the two huge sixes (think they where back to back) he hit at Arundel during first match of the 1990 tour of England. The second one was even bigger than the first and almost hit the ice cream van. The match was interrupted by a streaker who also used to play up front for Arundel Football Club, I remember some wag saying as a policeman dashed after him "he never moves that quickly when he's chasing back"

I remember he once walked without waiting to be given out - against Australia. Border returned the compliment, in the same match as I recall, which was a rare sight indeed. Cricket was the better for his presence.

Martin Crowe was a great batsman, captain and a wonderful cricket analyst. He will be missed by cricket fans around the world. I pray to God that his soul may Rest In Peace.

Egelatarian society eh? never worked there for the shit wages (or the shit Pacific Peso) have you-why do you think so many Kiwis leave such a geographically beautiful country to come and work here? :as for the Kiwi sense of modesty, get off the grass!

Unsurprising comments in this piece: the Kiwi trait of modesty is hugely endearing, especially when juxtaposed against brash Aussie arrogance across the Tasman Sea. In the (more or less) egalitarian society of NZ, the realities of the 'Tall Poppy Syndrome' (where if one is too full of oneself, one is cut down) meant that Crowe learned to temper his ego earlier than most sports superstars. RIP Martin.

I was fortunate enough to be at the ODI World Cup match at Eden Park between New Zealand and Australia. At half time in what was a pretty high intensity match Martin was inducted the NZ Hall of Fame (or some such thing I think). Knowing of his illness the presenters had a lump in their throat, the Aussies in the crowd, as well as the Kiwi's, had a lump in their throat and you could hear a pin drop when he spoke and the applause at the end seemed as great as when McCullum took on Johnson and whacked him for a couple of sixes. Not a quiver or tremble was there in his voice as he spoke of the pride he had in the way in which the Kiwis were playing their cricket. I don't know how many of us could have managed such single minded concentration that in such circumstances, but maybe that was Martin. I imagine most of us though would be as happy as he was to see the things which we have believed in for most of our lives coming true as we approach death. Perhaps that gave him some of that calmness.

Bang on the money as always Andy. As a 46 yr old I enjoyed watching Martin Crowe batting in England many summers ago. The deaths this year of several of our formative icons now makes us acutely aware of our own mortality.It was an emotional rollercoaster reading several of the articles you mention, a mixture of tears at the sadness of his early passing, pride that cricketers and cricket writers can write such emotional and articulate thought,s and a different sort of pride, namely that the qualities of human decentness can be valued and praised. I would love to have my friends say just 10% of the nice things said about MC in these lovely obituaries. It would mean I made a small mark on peoples' lives.Anyway as I said above, a nice round-up Andy and keep up the good work.

I don't recall any unsavory incident on the cricket field involving Martin Crowe. In fact, he is the role model cricket needs.

His first tour of England was the first cricket that - as a seven-year-old - I sat up and took notice of.

What a magnificent player, the owner of the best cover drive I've ever seen.

I had the privilege of following "that" World Cup and watch him captain and bat: it was received wisdom that he was possibly the best batsman in the world at the time.

Well put, Andy. What's impressive is how the tributes aren't just from former teammates, but also those who provided his greatest challenges when playing; the number of tributes from all over the cricketing world is testimony to the qualities of the man.
