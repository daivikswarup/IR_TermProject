Australia top world cricket's rankings but greatness awaits on foreign soil




DateTime::::2016-02-24T04:04:13+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>ith their 2-0 trans-Tasman series win and faultless party-pooping effort in Black Caps skipper Brendon McCullum’s farewell Test, Australia now find themselves on top of the ICC rankings, claiming back a title they’ve held for just three months out of the previous five years.</p>

<p>As milestones go it certainly grabs the headlines and provides a neat full stop on a 12-month period that also saw Australia establish supremacy in the one-day international arena, but perhaps of greater significance in the long term was simply that a new-generation side has won an away Test series under the fledgling captaincy of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/steve-smith">Steve Smith</a>.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/24/australia-reclaim-no1-test-ranking-with-victory-and-series-win-over-new-zealand">Australia reclaim No1 Test ranking with victory and series win over New Zealand</a> </p>

<p>Smith pointedly noted as much in accepting the various trinkets and tchotchkes in the presentation area after the Christchurch win. To prove themselves truly worthy of further platitudes, Australia simply have to keep winning tough Tests like these and in doing so continue to master unfamiliar environmental factors.</p>

<p>Prior to this series vice-captain David Warner had predicted an Ashes-like intensity to the New Zealand assignment and at least in the sense of the overcast skies and green wickets encountered, at times it was. Doubts will have lingered from last winter’s campaign in England, when the Darren Lehmann-era swagger was comprehensively shown up amid the familiar sight of swing-induced batting collapses. </p>

<p>Yet in the past two weeks, all of the top order batsmen bar Warner himself allayed fears of a repeat and showed a newfound capacity to adapt to their brief, often punishing the bowlers in lengthy stays at the crease. At Wellington, Adam Voges hung around long enough to be asked for rent money, as did Joe Burns in Christchurch.</p>

<p>The other thing Australia did was make one of the world’s most potent and confident opening bowling combinations look pedestrian. Trent Boult’s series analysis of five wickets at 53.80 and Tim Southee’s three at 67.33 were result-shaping. Feisty Neil Wagner was a bundle of energy in the second Test but he was the Black Caps’ only specialist bowler of the series whose average didn’t top the half-century mark.</p>

<p>For those who stared disapprovingly at the mid-30s averages of those assembled around Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey in the last half-decade, what cannot be understated when appraising this Australian side is the present dominance of those batsmen. </p>

<p>Granting Usman Khawaja’s 49.54 and Joe Burns’ 49.29, all of the top five currently possess Test averages around or above 50, the traditional marker of batting greatness and at least in the short term, an emphatic argument for the team’s current lofty status. So too, in a less quantifiable sense, is the sheer variety of batting on display; Warner’s indomitable boundary-sprees, Smith’s fidgety mastery, Khawaja’s balletic flourishes, cool-headed Voges sending Statsguru into meltdown.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/24/steve-smith-admits-he-must-set-a-better-example-as-australia-captain">Steve Smith admits he must set a better example as Australia captain</a> </p>

<p>Still, the odd pointer to Australia’s shortcomings lingers. A batting titan at home, Warner again endured a lean run away. The rapid upward curve of Mitchell Marsh’s bowling output has made him undroppable but he’s still only making tentative steps towards establishing himself as a worthy Test six, and there lies potential stumbling blocks during Test tours of Sri Lanka and India in the next 14 months.</p>

<p>Australia’s solid all-round bowling performance also didn’t shake the feeling that this attack doesn’t possess quite the same edge without Mitchell Starc and his defence-splitting yorkers, though Jackson Bird was certainly no slouch as a fill-in. The fielding, as dismal in the last twelve months as at any point since Bob Simpson packed in his weathered baseball glove, is now showing signs of improvement. The slip catching in particular sharpened up noticeably in this series.</p>

<p>What will resonate far less comfortably was the combustible atmosphere fostered by captain Smith in the wake of Josh Halzewood’s DRS brainfade. It jarred badly enough with Hagley Oval’s bucolic surrounds but in a high-stakes, hot-tempered series against the likes of India or England and in front of a less accommodating umpire than affable Ranmore Martinez, a calmer approach might not hurt.</p>

<p>As far as the rankings achievement itself, the final throes of the game in Christchurch gave a decent glimpse of why Test cricket remains an impenetrable concept to outsiders. On day five, with Australia needing only 16 runs of the game’s eventual 1,411 runs to take out the series, the 40-minute lunch break was called. When play resumed Australia quickly claimed the ICC Test Championship mace, named for a tournament that does actually exist. No grand finale, no winner-takes-all face off between the two best sides, just a giant novelty cheque and an extra heavy item for the oversize baggage check-in.</p>

<p>The irony of cricket rankings systems, of course, is that in conferring upon both teams and individuals the tag of “best in the world” they tend to beg subjective qualifiers or just outright scoffing; “X team from now wouldn’t even beat Y team of five years ago”; “X hasn’t even <em>played</em> against Y in the current rankings period”; “how can a team containing Dean Elgar/Varun Aaron/Chris Tremlett be the best at anything, really?”</p>

<p>For a game in thrall to statistics, it is at least fitting that a side can be pipped to top spot by a matter of decimal points. When India leapfrogged South Africa to take the mantle a month back, the Proteas actually slipped right down to third spot and only 11 rankings points separated first from sixth, opening up the possibility of not only Australia’s current surge but those of others over the coming year. The presence of strong and even competition is a conclusion you might draw from this, but a more honest explanation is the outsized impact of home-ground advantage.</p>

<p>And that is the real puzzle for Australia now: can they drive home this achievement on foreign soil, particularly on the subcontinent? The shambolic 4-0 whitewash suffered at the hands of India in 2013 might be an Arthur-era relic, but with bits and pieces line-ups consigned to the past and wins rolling, the other opponent they contend with now is expectation.</p>

Wow, if my team had beaten Australia, India and South Africa in the last 18 months I would be absolutely shattered and asking for them to sack the team, the coach, and the selectors lol. I think you are suffering from the "I'm an Aussie I never give the poms any respect" syndrome.

You are right about individual games counting towards rankings but it is not consistently applied, if you google Scrap the ICC World rankings, you'll see the flaws in the current system. However, the ICC have just announced plans for a two division Test championship so I'll stop moaning !

With the bat Marsh is averaging 23 which is pretty poor, if it wasn't for the stellar form of the five above him in the order it would make him pretty much unselectable other than as a specialist bowler which he isn't up to filling.

He's averaging 35 which isn't horrendous> He's twenty-four and he seems to have taken over Watson's role of breaking established partnerships, which invariably translates to runs. The sub continent's another story, but I'm pretty pleased with his progress thus far. And I'm a Maxwell fan.

i'm sorry but i'm afraid i don't understand. each game does affect the ranking points and hence the rankings. yes, it would be better if each team played the same amount but there is a chamionship mace that goes to the top ranked nation, if i'm not mistaken.

I couldn't care less about the ICC test rankings, nor do sane India fans. I don't recall a brouhaha BTL (ie in this forum) nor a brouhaha on reddit.com/r/cricket, which is the other cricket forum that I follow, when India took the #1 ranking a month back. I agree that official rankings need weigh away wins more than they do home.

And also to his credit, Smith has admitted his mistake, says he has a lot to learn about being captain, and that he has to be a better example for his team.

I agree, looked like the bowlers are really bowling to their field. Have to give Smith credit, he manages the changes very well, slick..

Seeing this is his first indiscretion I'm more than happy for Hazlewood to get the fine, learn from his mistake and move on. From what I saw, for the most part this series was played in great spirits and there is a definite improvement in attitude. Smith will age and learn how to act as a captain. Mind you I am ever the optimist! What really impressed was the discipline of the bowling attack: their willingness to stick to a plan for sustained periods was great to see.

I thought Hazelwood was alright- my was I wrong! Burns seems like a decent bloke, Voges, I've always like Lyon. Australia played really well overall, I was surprised by the ease with which they played the Kiwi bowlers, the field placings were excellent and the fielding is improving. Just a shame they are so unlikable as a group.

I mean on a per game basis...with the aim of a trophy like every ODI and T20 competition to give it all more of a point... Would be very sad if Test cricket faded away but that's the way it's heading....

I was really talking about Anderson - and Broad who will be in his early 30s by next Ashes. Finn, although talented, has had an up and down career and has had temperament and fitness issues. Stokes is talented but seems way too temperamental. As for Ali, England still don't seem to know what to do with him. Wood is fitful and injury-prone. If I were an England fan I'd be worried about the post-Broad/Anderson era. I'll be sad to see them go as a hard-nosed duo since they were always a bit of a worry for the non-English fans and a bit of mongrel makes for good competition.

No we just let your media go mad. And yes I know ours is as bad. Read an article during the London Olympics in the SMH which was still banging on about how great Sydney 2000 was. But then given London 2012 was such disaster for Oz we will allow you a bit of nostalgia.
