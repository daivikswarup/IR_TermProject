Alan Henry obituary




DateTime::::2016-03-07T17:37:59+0000



<p>Alan Henry, one of the most respected and prolific of motor racing writers, delighted in telling stories from his early years in the sport, such as the one about the time he spotted <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-1981/37/obituary-mike-hailwood-mbe-gm" title="">Mike Hailwood</a> tucking a paperback book inside his overalls before a qualifying session for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza in the early 1970s. Hailwood explained to Henry that he expected his car to break down and wanted to have some way of passing the time while stranded out on the circuit.</p>

<p>Henry, who has died at the age of 68 after a long illness, provided informed and incisive commentary on the sport as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanhenry" title="">the Guardian’s Formula One correspondent from 1988 to 2009</a>. In that capacity, and previously on behalf of the weekly newspaper Motoring News, he attended more than 650 grands prix and became a familiar figure to a galaxy of champions.</p>

<p>A shrewd assessor of driving talent, he considered Stirling Moss to have been the greatest of all time, and relished the arguments with colleagues provoked by his choice. He was never sycophantic and tried to look beneath the surface of success or failure. Of John Watson, the gifted but complex Ulsterman who won races but never the world championship, he wrote: “Perhaps he thought too much.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the accuracy of his scoops could annoy the great and good, as when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-ayrton-senna-1433227.html" title="">Ayrton Senna</a> approached him in the paddock one day in 1987, upset by a story in which Henry had predicted his move from Lotus to McLaren for the following season. The two had known each other since the Brazilian’s apprenticeship in Formula Ford. “What do I have to do,” Senna demanded brusquely, “to get a half-sensible relationship with you?” The story turned out to be true, of course.</p>

<p>Senna was the last of those he knew well to die at the wheel. In the early days there had been several others, in particular <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/ita/preview/peterson.html" title="">Ronnie Peterson</a>, the brilliant Swede, who often entertained him at his home in Maidenhead, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/wales/entries/9a0c1cec-ed01-33d2-bb03-c4540de21ecf" title="">Tom Pryce</a>, the Welsh ace, at whose funeral in Ruthin in 1977 he delivered the address.</p>

<p>Born in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, Henry attended his first British Grand Prix in 1964, at Brands Hatch, driving there on L-plates in the car that belonged to his mother, Margaret. He left Westcliff high school for boys – where a teacher advised him that he would never make a living from his obsession with motor sport – to study law, at his parents’ behest, but soon followed his father, Clifford, into the overseas department of Barclays Bank in the City, where he spent four unrewarding years.</p>

<p>In 1968 he contributed his first freelance report to Autosport, the weekly magazine. Regular appearances in print led in 1971 to an invitation to join the staff of Motoring News, a rival weekly, whose proprietor confessed that the best he could offer was an annual salary of £1,500 and a well-used Lotus Cortina as a company car. Henry was then earning £998 a year from the bank and driving his mother’s Mini. “Life is full of difficult decisions,” he remembered, “and this was not one of them.”</p>

<p>Two years later he graduated to covering the grand prix circuit, often accompanying his journalistic hero, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://stevemckelvie.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/jenks-recounting-of-his-1955-mille-miglia-record-ride-with-moss/" title="">Denis Jenkinson of Motor Sport</a>. In the 1970s he test-drove the Formula One cars of the Shadow, Benetton, Arrows and Renault teams, a privilege of which no journalist today could dream.</p>

<p>He went freelance in 1988, joining the Guardian while contributing columns to a variety of magazines, including F1 Racing and Autocar, and editing Autocourse, the annual summary of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a> season. He was awarded membership of the British Racing Drivers’ Club, a rare honour for a journalist, and sat on the club’s board from 2004 to 2006, helping to secure the future of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.</p>

<p>The depth of Henry’s knowledge enabled him to produce a string of first-rate books blending factual detail with a deep feeling for the romance of the sport. They included Ferrari: The Grand Prix Cars and Stirling Moss: All My Races, biographies of numerous drivers from Niki Lauda – a close friend – to Jenson Button, histories of the Williams and McLaren teams, and The Powerbrokers, in which he analysed Bernie Ecclestone’s takeover of Formula One.</p>

<p>In later years he travelled the world in the company of two kindred spirits, Nigel Roebuck of Autosport and Maurice Hamilton of the Observer. With the veteran French journalist Jabby Crombac as a fourth member (<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft15941.html" title="">until his death in 2005</a>), they were known to their Fleet Street colleagues as the Cartel: often teased for their anorak-level expertise but also admired for their readiness to share insights and historical knowledge.</p>

<p>Blessed with a wit that veered from the whimsical to the gently sardonic, Henry was amused but never seduced by the celebrity side of motor racing. Contact with the real people behind the action – the designers, engineers and mechanics – was always part of the allure, as was the constant travel. “F1 people like to complain about the getting there and the coming back; the time spent in airports, the delays, the security, the overcrowding, the overbooking,” he wrote. “It’s true, this is one negative side of the job. But look where it takes you.”</p>

<p>In 1980, he married Ann Fowler. She survives him, along with their children, Nick, Emma and Charlotte.</p>

Great shame; I didn't know this either. I last saw him about ten years ago when he joined one of The Old Farts' (old boys from Westcliff High, circa 1958) sessions in The Crooked BIllet in Leigh and then a curry house. He was a good friend at school; we usually sat together in 'A' Level Geography. We socialised a good deal out of school. I recall one occasion when Alan was driving his Mum's Morris Minor from The Barge at Battlesbridge to The Plough & Sail at Paglesham - along Watery Lane which in those days had a number of lethal hump-back bridges. Most people slowed down; one was especially dangerous, being on a bend. Not Alan - he took one at speed. I was behind him and still, 50 years after the event, have a clear mental image of the Morris Minor "taking off", all four wheels in the air. Alan's face was a picture of elation! It was our Headmaster who told him that he'd never make a career out of fast cars. There's some more on Alan in my autobiography "Girls, Go Carts and Gob Stoppers".

I had no idea - far too young for one so gifted. For so many years I enjoyed his writing.

Oh my god, I have just found out this great guy has died. Just goes to show how motor sport is ignored by the press, if it were a football, cricket. rugby or horse racing it would be splashed everywhere.He was an excellent journalist and a fine chap, my condolences to his family.

AH was one of the reasons I became a huge fan of F1... I read everything I could in my formative years and still go back to his writings now... he had a depth and humanity that most journalists today wouldn't understand. RIP and condolences to his family.

Yes, he was an excellent writer, with wit, insight and intelligence and a refreshing lack of hyperbole.
