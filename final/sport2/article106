Wallabies star Kurtley Beale set to sign with Wasps for A$2.7m

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/kurtley-beale">Kurtley Beale</a> is reportedly set to sign a record two-year deal worth A$2.7 million (Australian dollars) with the London Wasps, according to reports in the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>Such a deal is unlikely to be matched by the Australian Rugby Union even if Beale enters into a flexible deal which allows him to play in Japan.</p>

<p>It would make the Waratahs and Wallabies inside centre the highest-paid player in the English premiership, and the equal-highest paid Australian abroad along with Matt Giteau at Toulon.</p>

<p>Crucially, the 27-year-old – who has a troubled disciplinary record – would still be able to play for the Wallabies given he has now played 60 Tests for Australia.</p>

<p>The Wasps director of rugby Dai Young, while unwilling to discuss specific transfer negotiations, said: “You’ve got to do your own due diligence. </p>

<p>“You certainly don’t want to bring anyone into this environment who’s going to upset the apple cart with the players. </p>

<p>“I certainly don’t want to bring anyone here who won’t maintain the standards of what we expect of Wasps players and staff. I take my responsibilities very seriously on that. </p>

<p>“A lot of people make mistakes, and I’m sure me and you have made a few when we were younger. Some are more documented than others. </p>

<p>“But I’m confident anybody I bring into this environment I’ve done my homework on. What they’ve done in the past is the past. </p>

<p>“But I’m confident that any player who is in this environment will not reflect poorly on Wasps.” </p>

<p>Should Beale arrive, he will team up with the former England fly-half Danny Cipriani who will return to his first club from Sale next season. </p>

Piatau has a hell of a test record ,14 wins from 14 .If he had comitted to NZ after the RWC he would have had a RWC win under his belt and he could have named his price if the money was his main aim.

This will be the spot vacated by Charles Piutau going to Ulster. I'm hoping his contract with Ulster is only two years as I'd really like to see CP back at Wasps as he is a devastating centre.Looking good for Wasps next season. Homegrown or British talent throughout the squad and a sprinkling of southern hemisphere magic to learn from and to entertain us, the fans. Well done, Dai.

I think a lot of that is also to do with the (as I understand it) poor relationship between the French clubs and their Union - guys playing for their clubs in the rest weeks between internationals etc - makes the RFU and the Premiership Teams relationship look rosy

Having looked at the example of France, I fear that the more top foreign players are introduced, the worse the England team will become.

"So you think it's OK for players to do what is in their interest, but not for clubs?"Personally yes, i do think that. Clubs and franchises in the SH are all about creating the best national team - I'm not naive enough to think that will happen in the AP but it would be good if they could.

The Wasps recently put a massive offer in for Pocock that was higher than what Dan Carter is earning in Paris.

Folau has great acceleration and of course an incredible step, but his top speed is actually pretty slow for an outside back. Folau's greatest strengths would include his ability to evade defenders and make line-breaks, his directness (Beale can be quite lateral at times), his consistency.

Folau is rapid, and has a very good kicking game.

I think this is from the Australian version - hence the reference to Aus dollars. It is quite likely given the Guardians' increasing obsession with SH rugby that news of Wasps move to Coventry is parked in the journalistic equivalent of a railway siding waiting for all the express news coming North to go by.

Fair comment. He was a very good player to watch before the wheels fell off. I hope he can refind that form with Wasps.

This is way too pedantic a discussion for my liking, but from their own documentation..."the “Club” means London Wasps Holdings Limited (company number 04187829); "



Author::::Mark Davis

London Wasps Holdings is precisely that - the name of the holding company. Not the club. It's just Wasps. And has been for many years now.

Is he faster? Folau is rapid, and has a very good kicking game. Folau is 1st choice for the Aussie 15 jersey too.

If we're going to be so fussy, the name of the club is London Wasps Holdings Limited. It hasn't changed.

Forget this month then (when he has been playing at 10 instead of the injured Foley and killing it).



Author::::DrStaunch
DateTime::::2016-03-09T16:15:17Z
Has been? He's in the form of his career. He has been the best player for the best team in Australia over the last couple of years.

Beale hasn't been considered a FB since 2011. At Melbourne he was a 10 (admittedly his first couple of weeks before Cipriani left he was going to play 15) with Gerrard at 15, and since returning to NSW he has been a 12 (covering at 10 at the moment while Foley is out) with Folau at 15.

When was the last time Cipriani "upset the apple cart"? Always got the impression his reputation has held him back somewhat, particularly with England, based on a few misdemeanours in his younger days, some of which were blown out of proportion



Author::::ConorJ
DateTime::::2016-03-09T15:27:37Z
Maybe not, though he is more flexible than Piutau, he covers 10-15 pretty much, excellent to have in a matchday squad.

"London Wasps", eh? Kurtley is in for a shock. Nice to see Guardian sports journalism keeping right up to the minute.

I still think Cipriani would make a great scrum half in the Joost mould. And Eastmond should try his luck on the wing



Author::::Hulamula

It wouldn't surprise me. Consistency was a flaw for them at the beginning of the season, but it seems they have found their feet and I think they could win the title.

Beale has a better kicking, passing game and better vision than Folau, and is faster.

Folau is far better than Beale, imo. The only 15 better than Folau is Ben Smith.



Author::::propagandalf
DateTime::::2016-03-09T12:38:29Z
If he is moving to a NH side, Wasps is probably the best place for him, as they have quite an expansive + attacking game plan. I think he would struggle at a more conservative side like Leicester or Saracens.



Author::::propagandalf
DateTime::::2016-03-09T12:32:36Z
To be fair, players like Wade, Simpson, Daly, Haskell and Cipriani all came through the Wasps academy. So there will be 5 ex-academy players in their XV next season, which is pretty good.

“You certainly don’t want to bring anyone into this environment who’s going to upset the apple cart with the players."So it seemed like a good idea to go for Beale AND Cipriani???? Best of luck

You can't blame the player for taking the money but you can blame the club for a lack of foresight in not being able to develop their own players so they don't have to waste their money.

2.7 million in Australian dollars? How much is that, about 700 quid?



Author::::Kieran McManus
DateTime::::2016-03-09T11:52:56Z
The difference between Wasps and the teams that you've mentioned is the fact that they'll be using their own money. The Ricoh Arena will generate massive income for the club, and with the land and potential development around the stadium that has already been talked about, this will only increase in time. Wasps aren't running up millions in debt and being bailed out as a rich man's toy.

So Wasps lose Charles Piutau but gain Kurtley Beale? IMO Beale is a slight downgrade on Piutau who is a complete FB, however it appears the deal taking him to Ulster was non-negotiable. Beale is talented but I'm not convinced he'll provide the value that Piutau has.
