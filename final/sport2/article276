The battle for Wentworth golf club: ‘I hear they’re going to have a riot about it – a posh people’s riot’

<p>The grass-cutters and leaf-blowers begin their hum at 5am, manicuring the three full courses and one nine-holer of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wentworthclub.com/">Wentworth Club</a>. Until recently, those who lived in the multimillion-pound houses abutting the greens put up with this audible intrusion, seeing it as a small price to pay for living on one of Britain’s most exclusive estates. But last October, those who were members of the golf and tennis club received a letter <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/31/wentworth-golf-club-members-revolt-against-china-based-owner">that truly shattered their peace</a>. It seemed that they were effectively being turfed out of their club. The missive told almost 4,000 people that they would need to leave and then reapply for just 800 places. And for the privilege they would have to pay a £100,000 debenture – effectively an unsecured loan – on top of an almost doubling of their annual fees from £8,388 to £16,000. The receivers of the mailout did not take it well. Even the over-75s – who have currently been given an exemption – are less than happy.</p>

<p>Wentworth – one of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24378868">more than 140 golf clubs in Surrey</a> – was sold for £135m in 2014 by restaurateur <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/13/the-day-i-tried-to-become-a-non-dom">Richard Caring</a> to the Reignwood Group, a Chinese conglomerate chaired by Dr Chanchai Ruayrungruang, one of China’s richest men. Last October, the club’s chief executive, Stephen Gibson, announced a “multimillion-pound investment to become the world’s finest private golf and country club”, including major renovations of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wentworthclub.com/golf/west-course/">West Course</a>. But alongside this came the intimation to members that in essence they would be financing the plans by being asked to stump up free loans.</p>

<p>The Wentworth Estate was developed in 1924 by George Tarrant as an affluent community with a golf club at its centre. It sired the Ryder Cup and is currently the host of the PGA World Tour organisation. Private roads lined with sumptuous homes wend their way to the greens and vast, crenellated clubhouse. There are tennis courts, swimming pools, bars, restaurants and a spa. Drive to the door and you will be met by a footman; walk inside and you can see why some have a membership but never hold a nine-iron in their hand.</p>

<p>Inside, the club is spectacular, with windows affording vistas of the lawns and the lake. Walls are lined with wooden boards, the names of cup winners cherished in gold. Cabinets are filled with trophies and the main lounge has a portrait of the revered Tarrant. The rooms move through the “traditional English club” of the Burma bar (the 19th hole) to a lighter, art deco vibe in the main restaurant. Members recline in chairs, reading the paper, sharing a bottle of wine with friends, watching the television. Few are dressed in golf attire, as if plaids and pastels are strictly the preserve of the greens.</p>

<p>Now almost 90% of those members are up in arms. Some have formed a group called the Resistance or the Wet Feet Action Group, so called after a Chinese proverb that says: “It never rains on your neighbours without getting your feet wet.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://wetfeetwentworth.com/">Its website states</a>: “As Wentworth is currently a members’ club, thousands of British people play there every year, as guests of members and in invitational tournaments etc. Chop it down to a few hundred ultra-high net-worth foreign members and it will disappear from view and turn the club into a ghost town. Wentworth will be lost to the nation, only ever seen through glimpses on TV if and when the PGA Tour goes there. It will ruin the social lives of many of the 1,100 households of the estate, denying access to three of the best golf courses in the world, including to many promising and up-and-coming golfers, effectively closing down the tennis club and leaving the estate with no community. Members, both resident and non-resident, have had enough and have come together to stop this impending travesty.”</p>

<p>Eric Leon is chair of the Wentworth residents’ association and has lived on the estate for 21 years. “Unlike other golf clubs, ours is very much a part of the life here. It was conceived as an integral part of the estate. Traditionally it has been a community. Tarrant’s idea was not only grand houses, but a mixed community – there are still bungalows on the estate that are reasonably modest, though obviously with the pressure on the market and the attractiveness of the area, a lot of these are bulldozed away and replaced with much grander houses.</p>

<p>“It explains some of the reaction – the changeover of the club could accelerate that trend. If you make the club appeal to the super-wealthy, it destroys the fabric of the community. Enjoying golf or tennis or even walking is something that doesn’t seem to have been understood by the owners, who may have seen it like a normal golf club. Not everybody is angry about it though – there are a number of very wealthy people at Wentworth, and a number of them would think a very wealthy club would suit them.”</p>

<p>Take a walk around the estate and it is not hard to clock the super-wealth – over the walls you can see fountains and arbours, sculptures and acres of gardens. Gates and intercoms cut off driveways, and verges are peppered with signs warning that there is a security presence – pavements are dotted with the petals of blossom shedding early, leaving the imagination to speculate that some hired hand will be along in a moment to tweezer it all up. Builders come and go to vast sites constructing both faux-Georgian mansions and modernist edifices. One such mansion – South Drive – complete with four reception rooms, swimming pool, sauna, gymnasium, staff accommodation and garaging for four cars, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://search.knightfrank.co.uk/vir140004?carousel=true">is on the market</a> with a guide price of £18,950,000.</p>

<p>Owners of properties such as these are perhaps the target of the new Reignwood plans, but Leon points out that the vast majority of people are just wealthy, not super-rich. “They are maybe sitting on houses that are worth money, but a lot of the owners in Surrey are asset-rich but cash poor,” he says, before conceding that some of his neighbours are billionaires. Take Pyotr Aven, head of Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest commercial bank; the King of Malaysia; Ron Dennis, chair of McLaren; and Adrian Heavey, founder of Tallow Oil. Leon smiles resignedly: “Next door to me they are rebuilding Villa Oman for the king of Oman.”</p>

<p>Until now, Wentworth residents have been happy to live side-by-side. The club meant the well-off mixed with the wealthy, but now that the well-off have been told they are not welcome, they’re warning that disruptive direct action is entirely within their legal means. A document sent to Reignwood and seen by the Guardian warns that the new proposals are a “breach of the Wentworth Trust”, that it has a duty to preserve the character and nature of the club under a formal trust deed. It cites “breach of restrictive covenants” and points out that the Wentworth Estate Roads Committee has the right to enforce restrictive covenants under the deed, because its prior approval “is required for any future property development, use of sponsored advertising signage, erection of tents and grandstands and organisation of rock concerts”.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/02/wentworth-pga-championship-at-risk-dispute">Row over plans to increase Wentworth fees puts PGA Championship at risk</a> </p>

<p>This is a subtle threat to the PGA Tournament to be held in 29 May. It goes on less subtly: “The PGA Tournament is a nuisance and causes significant disruption to the day-to-day quality of life of the residents of the Wentworth Estate for many weeks before. The disruption and nuisance is amplified by additional activities such as BMW-sponsored events, including rock concerts, which are not necessary or incidental events to a golf tournament.”</p>

<p>The document points to a concert by “English supergroup” Mike and the Mechanics, for which tickets are already being sold with the marketing plug: “The ‘quiet please’ signs will be cast aside following play in the third round of the 2016 event on Saturday, May 28 and the amplifiers cranked up as the multimillion-selling band perform on the new, expanded BMW Show Stage in the Championship Village.” But the residents could quite easily pull the plug.</p>

<p>Michael Parkinson, a resident and member, is also reported to be up in arms: “They came in without any regard for the traditions or feelings of members of the club and tried to assume that everybody would just go away quietly. They have misunderstood the nature of the club. A lot of members will go elsewhere. Maybe that is what Reignwood want. Maybe they will get their car park full of Lamborghinis.”</p>

<p>Nigel Moss spearheads the Wet Feet Action Group. “Our memberships terminate on 31 March. We have to reapply before then, despite having paid joining fees in the past. Then if we pass their selection process we have the privilege of paying £100,000 in an unsecured loan that is non-equity-linked, non-interest-bearing, restrictive in trade, and if you do trade it, the club will take 30% commission. This is uniquely onerous in the UK.”</p>

<p>Moss and his group are prepared to take action. “Where there was tolerance, understanding and celebration, the mindset changes when you get kicked out – whether that’s the risk of getting hit by golfballs or refusing to put up with the three months of disruption that comes with the PGA. Our club is like the pub, the church, the canteen on the estate, but Reignwood has no sensitivity to that, and is booting out people who have been members for decades. Their approach is offensive and uncompromising. They are targeting a niche group of people while alienating the vast majority. Back home in China, the government is banning golf because it is considered too elite and a hotbed of corruption. But that is what they want to do here.”</p>

<p>Last night the club made an announcement that it was offering “final enhancements and improvements to its new membership structure”. It said that members could “pay a non-refundable deposit of £20,000 towards their debenture and membership, with the balance deferred to and payable by 31 December 2019”. It added that “subscriptions for all memberships will be fixed for the 2017 and 2018 membership years, and then rise only in accordance with RPI for the following three years up to 2022”.</p>

<p>Stephen Gibson, chief executive of Wentworth Club said: “A great deal of time has been well spent discussing with members, residents, numerous elected committees and other interested groups, the new vision and plans for the future of Wentworth Club. I believe that these changes we are announcing clearly show our commitment to our existing members and local residents, who are an integral part of the Club’s past and our future. All of the improvements we have planned as part of our new membership structure will ensure a club of exceptional quality, which sets unparalleled standards on and off the course, while – very importantly – being centred around families and local residents.”</p>

<p>Songhua Ni, vice chairman of the Reignwood Group, said: “We are now looking forward to achieving our vision of making Wentworth Club the world’s premier private golf and country club.”</p>

<p>But last night members laughed off these “concessions” as “playing around the edges”. They knew what was coming – in a note from Reignwood’s lawyers, they had been informed of the revised plan to stagger the debenture payments and increase the memberships from the planned 800 to 888, because eight is a lucky number in China. “It’s not lucky for the current membership,” says Moss. “Nothing has really changed. It is still fundamentally flawed. They say they want to consult with us, but so far that has been lip service.”</p>

<p>Leon also believes they are insufficient. “They are still cutting the membership by more than half. There are still many areas of concern, and we reserve the right to start litigation on some of the issues.”</p>

<p>Sir Stanley Simmons, 88, former president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologist, and a Wentworth member for more than 50 years, says the whole business is a great shame. “They are trying to make a very upmarket country club at the expense of a very good golf club. I understand that the members are going to explore every avenue of resistance.”</p>

<p>Down in the parade of shops that marks the centre of Virginia Water, the enclave of which Wentworth is a part, locals were disturbed by the goings-on up at the club, and the implications for the village. Begoña Dervish, owner of Reflection beauty salon, is concerned that being kicked out of their club might drive people away from the community. “It’s like what is happening in London with all these foreign investors buying flats that they never live in. The super-rich are oligarchs and Chinese, and they are not putting money in to secure the nation. It is a transient community and has a very negative impact. They are not going to be people who come in here 15 or 16 weeks a year. It’s very much a concern.”</p>

<p>Over at the British Legion, a very different sort of club altogether, greenkeepers in Wentworth-branded T-shirts nursed pints and muttered that they didn’t want to get involved, whoever owned the club, they still needed to work for them. One man at the bar had no such concerns. “I deliver stuff up there and I was in a place today where the dog’s got his own house and the garden is bigger than my house. They just want members like that,” he said, “I hear they’re going to have a riot about it – a posh people’s riot.”</p>

<p>Past the pool tables, three men were chatting in a corner, each of them gardeners working for houses on the estate. One laughed: “I would have thought it was reasonably well done up and they don’t need to raise this money,” said one. “They want to turn it into an exclusive, rich-person’s playground and put a ring of steel around it. They’ll fly in by helicopter and play two rounds of golf a year. We live in a different world down here, but at the present moment we can walk through the estate and the club, take our dogs, walk round the greens with the lovely trees and the lake – they have signs on the edge of the estate saying ‘private residents only’, but you can go in. If they do what they want, I bet we won’t be able to do that any more. Although there are a lot of people up there who won’t care.”</p>

<p>But it is clear many at Wentworth do care. And if they don’t get what they want, they’re just not going to put up with flying golf balls any more.</p>

Wonderful news. Couldn't happen to nicer people. However, the sums involved will amount to little more than pocket money, but still, nothing better than watching the rich trying to eat each other.

I regularly play at Wentworth and many other top clubs for free, simply by taking advantage of one of the old rules of golf. Professionals are given courtesy of the course by golf clubs. I'm not sure why this is but who cares ? So I tell them I am a professional and they let me play for free. It really is as simple as that. And the great thing is that you don't have to be any good at golf to be a professional, just look at Ian Baker Finch.

When I was a teenager, a friend of mine conducted a private 'war on golf', which in retrospect was not unconnected to his feelings about his largely absent father. Anyway, this war took the form of regular nocturnal forays onto the local golf club course to take a large dump in one of the holes. In the event that this campaign is unsuccessful, I recommend this strategy to Michael Parkinson.

So the well-heeled are finding that they are not well-heeled enough. Now they might have some idea what it's like for the rest of us. The awful truth that has to be faced is that in the absence of appropriate legislation, or better still cultural obstacles too great for it to overcome, money gets what money wants. In my part of London, to the horror of most of us, we lost our local brewery because a developer wanted it. No arguments concerning the community value of Young's brewery cut any ice. It made the best beer in the country, in the opinion of many, and its drays, drawn by their beautiful heavy draught horses, were a local feature that we natives were very proud of. Everyone loved the Young's horses. Now they are all gone forever and we are the poorer in those elements of life for which there can be no financial recompense. In place of the brewery we are going to get another faceless concrete tower complete with yet more 'exciting retail opportunities', gated communities and the sort of poncified watering holes that are supposed to substitute for a proper pub. Ask yourselves this: would the Danes allow the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen to suffer the same fate, or the Bavarians allow their breweries in Munich to be demolished? Of course they wouldn't. The national culture wouldn't allow it even if the law did. But here we are ruled by Conservative values that do not accept or conceive of any other values but the monetary. We are governed by the collective of arrested development, a gang of public school nerks with, between them, a cumulative emotional age of nine. Hard-faced emotional cripples with a telepathic understanding of what their kindred spirits in the world of finance want them to provide. Provide it they do, and to hell with any other considerations. The UK, or to be more precise the Square Mile, launders quite phenomenal amounts of criminal money that need to be invested somewhere. The UK places no restrictions on foreign ownership of land. Put these two facts together and what happened to Young's brewery and what is happening to Wentworth should not surprise. Richard Caring was born here but inherited his non-dom status from his dad. What government concerned with fairness allows such an obscenity? But this, and all other Conservative administrations, have never been anything but a financiers shag-piece. Our council, Conservative since some disgraceful gerrymandering ensured it would remain so and, incidentally, Maggie's favourite, could have saved Young's but stated loudly that it wanted to be rid of it. The bankers' bum boys saw financial opportunities and all else was swept aside. The sense of loss is awful. Wentforth is likely to experience something similar.

I know hindsight is a wonderful thing...but £135m for the club could have been a bargain for the members. Between 4000 of them that's £33,750 each. Maybe they should offer to buy the club from the new owner. £50k each and he's made an instant £65m profit and they have a private club.
