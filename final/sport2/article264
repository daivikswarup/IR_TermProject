Sergio García takes share of first-round lead in Honda Classic at five-under




DateTime::::2016-02-26T00:55:15+0000



<p>A week after describing his own play as terrible, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sergio-garcia">Sergio García</a> turned a spectacular start into a brilliant 65 to share the lead after the first round of the Honda Classic at PGA National.</p>

<p>García holed his approach to the par-four 2nd from 148 yards for an eagle and added four birdies and a bogey to finish five-under par alongside the American Michael Thompson.</p>

<p>The world No5 Rickie Fowler, who played alongside Garcia, had a flawless 66 to share third with his compatriot William McGirt, with Ireland’s Shane Lowry another stroke back following a 67.</p>

<p>García, who missed the cut in the Northern Trust Open last week, dropped just one shot in the windy conditions, although that was the least of his worries at the time.</p>

<p>After pulling his drive on the 6th into a lake, García elected to take off his shoes and socks and splash out from the edge of the water, but could understandably be seen anxiously looking over his shoulder for signs of nearby alligators.</p>

<p>The world No19 emerged unscathed and produced the perfect response with birdies on the 7th and 8th and parred the next nine holes before a two-putt birdie on the 18th.</p>

<p>Speaking about his flying start, García told Sky Sports: “I hit two really good shots on the 1st and hit a good putt but just missed it right, and then on two I hit a great drive and a beautiful eight iron and managed to hole it.</p>

<p>“It’s funny because the last six or seven times Rickie and I played together either he holed out or I did. Today we both did [Fowler chipped in for par on the 10th] and it’s always nice to see. I took it quite easy this week after playing terrible last week so it was nice to go out there with low expectations and I was able to play well.”</p>

<p>Lowry was level par for the day before holing from 18 feet for birdie at the 17th and then just four feet for eagle at the par-five 18th after a stunning approach over the water. “I hit a great drive down there and had 215 [yards] to the front, 243 to the flag and the wind was howling out of the left,” the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational winner told PGA Tour Radio. “It was just a hard three iron and try to not let it go right. I was just trying to get it up somewhere on the left side of the green and thankfully it came off straight at the flag and released down to about three feet. It was a nice way to finish.</p>

<p>“I was just happy to shoot under-par out there, it’s so tough. It’s very tough mentally, every shot requires a good shot, you don’t get away with any bad shots out there. I am very happy with where I am. I’ve got a long way to go so hopefully I can get a good night’s sleep tonight and get out there tomorrow afternoon and do something.”</p>

<p>Asked if he was playing at the highest level of his career, the three-time European Tour winner added: “Definitely. I feel like I am good enough to compete week in, week out. I’ve done OK since the start of the year, I’m pretty happy with my first three tournaments and obviously very happy with my round today and looking forward not only to the weekend, but the whole season.</p>

<p>“I’m playing over here a little bit more and going back to Europe and playing. I have a very exciting schedule this year and I’m looking forward to a lot of things.”</p>

<p>Rory McIlroy, who won t eh event in 2012 to become world No1 for the first time, was seven shots off the pace after an erratic 72, while his playing partner and defending champion Padraig Harrington had a 73 which included a double bogey after losing a ball in a palm tree at the 10th.</p>

<p>McIlroy was one-under par after 13 holes but took six at the 14th after finding three separate bunkers and, after a birdie on the 15th, bogeyed the 16th and 18th, the latter with a three-putt from 10 feet.</p>

Nice to see Sergio play well today. Having followed the golf season closely this year I have big expectations for Ricky Fowler. Seems to have removed the erratic play from his game and he's playing with confidence. As for Rory I feel that until he sorts his putting out it will be another frustrating year for him. He's gone from being a streaky putter 2012-2014 to just being a bad putter 2015-2016. He barely makes any unless they are cosied up next to the hole and misses way too many of those round momentum putts inside 10 feet to save Par. If things don't improve quickly I don't see him getting close to winning a major this year.
