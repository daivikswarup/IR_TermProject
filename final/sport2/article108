Eddie Jones puts Manu Tuilagi on the bench for England’s crunch with Wales




DateTime::::2016-03-08T20:49:31+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/manu-tuilagi">Manu Tuilagi</a> will make his long-awaited return to Test rugby against Wales after being named in England’s squad for Saturday’s crucial Six Nations fixture at Twickenham. The Leicester centre has taken Alex Goode’s place among the replacements, with Wasps’ Elliot Daly retaining his place on the bench.</p>

<p>Tuilagi has not played for England since June 2014, having been sidelined with a groin problem for 15 months. Richard Cockerill, the Tigers’ director of rugby, suggested at the weekend it would be unwise to recall him prematurely but England’s head coach, Eddie Jones, clearly feels it is a risk worth taking.</p>

<p>The Northampton tighthead Kieran Brookes has also nudged out his club-mate Paul Hill, with Joe Launchbury replacing the injured Courtney Lawes. Exeter’s Luke Cowan-Dickie has been retained as cover at hooker for Jamie George, who hurt an arm at training on Tuesday.</p>

<p>It seems, though, that England will stick with the same starting XV <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/27/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report" title="">that defeated Ireland last month</a>. That would mean a second start for Saracens’ Maro Itoje in the second-row and Ben Youngs staying at scrum-half ahead of Danny Care. Retaining Daly also gives Jones the luxury of an extra specialist centre, which would almost certainly ensure Tuilagi is not needed until the second-half.</p>

<p>Within the England dressing-room, either way, the big man’s return will be warmly received. “Wherever Manu plays, even if he has a bad day, someone will still get taken down or he is going to run through someone,” said the Wasps flanker James Haskell. “Very few players have the ability to do that but Manu is pretty special. He’s pace, power and strength personified. I have played with him against some of the best teams in the world and he causes everybody trouble.”</p>

<p>Wales’s head coach Warren Gatland, meanwhile, has warned England’s fly-half George Ford to brace himself for a testing examination after naming an unchanged starting XV. “We won’t disappoint George Ford in terms of where we go on Saturday,”he said. “We won’t be throwing the ball all over the place, we will be pretty direct. We’ve got players to get us across the advantage line … hopefully when we do we can play some pretty positive rugby.”</p>

<p>Gatland believes there is no reason Wales cannot repeat <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">their dramatic Rugby World Cup pool victory</a> at the same venue. “The guys are training well and we are treating Saturday like a final. It will be one heck of a game and whoever wins probably wins the Six Nations.”</p>

<p>He is also looking forward to pitting his wits against Jones who, in his view, has added “a bit of an edge” to England. “He has been honest and opinionated and I think that’s been great for the game. It sounds like his players are really enjoying the environment and thriving on that.</p>

<p>“When he does say something out of turn it is important the media don’t jump on him, otherwise he will clam up and stay quiet. Give him the licence to speak his mind and say what he wants to say without analysing everything.”</p>

<p><strong>England</strong> (probable) M Brown (Harlequins); A Watson (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), O Farrell (Saracens), J Nowell (Exeter Chiefs); G Ford (Bath), B Youngs (Leicester); J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton, captain), D Cole (Leicester), G Kruis (Saracens), M Itoje (Saracens), C Robshaw (Harlequins), J Haskell (Wasps), B Vunipola (Saracens).</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong>: J George (Saracens) or L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), M Vunipola (Saracens), K Brookes (Northampton), J Launchbury (Wasps), J Clifford (Harlequins), D Care (Harlequins), M Tuilagi (Leicester), E Daly (Wasps).</p>

Rugby is now a professional sport which sort of brings with it the assumption that the intention is to generate money. Watching 30 men wrestling in a mud bath has fairly limited commercial appeal. That is why World Cups, wherever they may be played, tend to be scheduled to a time where excessive mud is unlikely. An occasional 'mud wrestle' is fine (England v France 2003 for example) but it is not what the majority of spectators would like dished up as the regular fare.

If the said grand slam decider I would agree with you, but England have a huge Points advantage over France. So even if they win tomorrow and lose in Paris, they will likely win the championship. If Wales win, they have Italy to beat.

And just in case the subtlety is wasted on you, the claim made by wyngwili was that she/he "didn't like men who smack women around". Fair enough. Nor do I. But there was absolutely no suggestion at court that this is what had happened. I would go so far as to say this is potentially defamatory, under your definition.

Can Daly play full back? Not seen too much of him, only at 13. But I agree, Goode is an excellent full back, nearly as good under the high ball as Brown, a better kicker, and a much more dangerous counter attacking runner - doesn't get isolated and brings wingers into play.

Unfortunately, even as a Welshman, I can't agree with you on the kicking thing. Some of the Welsh crowd regularly booh oppostion kickers and it's such a stupid thing to do as do the people doing it really think it's going to put off a person who does that for a living?!

It is effectively the decider. If England win, then they would have to lose by a cricket score against France - and that's assuming that France beat Scotland; if Wales win, they only have to beat Italy by any score.

I've always had a good time at Cardiff, never had any problems with Welsh supporters - a very sporting crowd. Plus, they don't whistle at the kicker like the sweaty socks do.

You'd have thought that from the way everyone assumes England and Wales will both win their final games wouldn't you? Obviously I can't see Italy beating Wales and England should beat France as they have been awful so far (but I wouldn't underestimate them in Paris). Wales and England look like the only teams winning it so this match will decide it in a way. There, I've just contradicted myself..

Wrong on A and B.Do you know what libel or slander are? Let me give you a lesson.They are collectively known as defamation, libel and slander are civil wrongs that harm a reputation; decrease respect, regard, or confidence; or induce disparaging, hostile, or disagreeable opinions or feelings against an individual or entity. The injury to one's good name or reputation is affected through written or spoken words or visual images. The laws governing these torts are identical.

yes they do - if the game continues in the same direction, without the most basic of skill levels on demonstration, with an obsession with defensive patterns at the expense of any flair- a side step, grubber, dummy, inside/outside break, offload, I'm not watching it, millions of others won't watch it, youngsters won't play the game, people won't view the game, sponsors won't sponsor the game - it's dull, it's basic and quite frankly the standards are low - so yes, they need to up their game - if your'e happy watching shit on a stick fair play,not me

Winning the 6N is not that great a deal. Ireland and Wales have managed it a few times recently but have generally come up short when faced with Southern Hemisphere opposition. What the recent World Cup showed was that when playing rugby in fair conditions a good defence is not enough to take you to the business end of the competition. Until the 6N teams develop decent attacking skills they will just be making up the numbers at future World Cups.

A harsher person could though it would ignore the fact that he has always beaten those sides, including playing at 10. Well, he has never started 10 against Samoa or Uruguay.

Really - he certainly didn't miss a tackle against Ireland - I'm not sure that I've ever seen him miss a crucial tackle. He must have done missed a tackle or two here and there, but I can't remember them. One certainly don't say about him as used to be said about Cips that he just can't tackle for shit. He does go backwards, but unless you want every player on the field to be built like a brick shithouse, that's inevitable. And going forward, ball in hand, he is just sublime. Usefully, he is playing himself back into form, just like the rest of the team. It's almost like EJ knows what he's doing...



Author::::ConorJ
DateTime::::2016-03-09T19:06:29Z
Ha, yeah. Know it can't last forever, though it's a reasonably viable option. Been impressed so far though doubt he will be a 12 long term.

The loss of Jamie George is a real downer. He brings so much more than simply scrummaging and set piece stability. He can be a talisman. CD has tenacity but is much more raw.

Play a fluid back three using Daly - in either - as he has played FB for Wasps - he could do either - but less time at wing
