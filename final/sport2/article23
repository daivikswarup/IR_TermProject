Wigan maintain 100% record with five-try show against sorry Leeds

<p>Wigan piled on the misery for the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/superleague">Super League</a> champions, Leeds, with a five-try rout in their Grand Final rematch at the DW Stadium.</p>

<p>The Warriors led only 6-0 after 55 minutes but they were the more inventive team throughout and eventually cut loose to run out 28-6 victors and maintain their 100% record. The win meant they also draw level with the surprise early pacesetters Widnes, whom they host next Thursday.</p>

<p>A fourth defeat from their first five games leaves the Rhinos languishing in ninth place, although they were spared the embarrassment of being beaten to nil for the first time since 1998 when the full-back Zak Hardaker grabbed a last-minute try.</p>

<p>The champions had the veteran second-row Jamie Jones-Buchanan back after a nine-month injury lay-off and gave a delayed Super League debut to the Australian hooker Beau Falloon but they were still without five senior players through injury and were a pale shadow of the side that sealed the treble <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/10/leeds-wigan-super-league-grand-final-match-report" title="">at Old Trafford in October</a>.</p>

<p>Wigan, who had been less than convincing despite winning their opening four games, were forced into a late change when the England half-back George Williams pulled out with a hamstring injury, which meant a Super League debut off the bench for the 20-year-old Nick Gregson.</p>

<p>The Warriors’ captain, Sean O’Loughlin, who started Wigan’s first three games at prop, tried his best to fill in at stand-off but the home side struggled for cohesion for long periods in the absence of their young playmaker.</p>

<p>Wigan enjoyed a glut of possession and looked far more threatening but ruined their promising build-up with some careless handling on the final play and Leeds were relieved to be only 6-0 down at half-time.</p>

<p>The home side thought they had opened the scoring on 10 minutes when the second-row Liam Farrell ran on to a pass from his England team-mate Matty Smith to slice through the Rhinos defence, but the video referee Richard Silverwood disallowed the try for an obstruction in back play.</p>

<p>Leeds ignored the chance to kick for goal when they were awarded a penalty in front of the posts during a rare foray upfield, only for the prop Adam Cuthbertson lost the ball near the line. Otherwise they spent most of the first half defending inside their own territory.</p>

<p>The only first-half try came on 26 minutes when the right wing Dom Manfredi broke away and, although he was eventually hauled down by Hardaker inches short of the line, the second-row John Bateman nipped over in the next phase of play. Smith added the goal and the score stayed at 6-0 for another half an hour as the visitors continued to soak up the relentless pressure.</p>

<p>Leeds were just showing signs of getting into the game when, just short of the hour, their hosts struck with two tries in six minutes to end the game as a contest.</p>

<p>A break from the Wigan prop Ryan Sutton set up the position for the centre Oliver Gildart to force his way over at the left corner before Manfredi took a pass from Anthony Gelling to jink his way over at the other corner.</p>

<p>Smith kicked his second goal to make it 16-0 and Leeds’ defensive efforts began to take their toll as the prop Tony Clubb and Gelling went over for further tries in the space of four minutes.</p>

<p>Leeds finished a well-beaten side but at least had the final word when Hardaker crossed as the hooter was about to sound and added the conversion himself.</p>

At one point last season Mac left Sinfield on the bench and paired McGuire and Sutcliffe in the halves. Leeds fans thought we were looking at the transition you refer to. Then Sutcliffe got an injury which kept him out for 6 months. And now he's fit, McGuire 's crocked. And we have another youngster (Lilley) who is looking a decent prospect. But they will take time to bed in.

Nice to see the Rhinos taking a beating. Without the veterans Sinfield and Peacock they look like a Championship club. Now that would wipe the smile off the face of their arrogant and snotty fans. I remember when they came to Tattersfield, all the fans could do was to demean the club and take the piss out of the ground. From then on every Leeds defeat puts a smile on my face. The way this season is going for Leeds, I will be smiling very often.

Leeds problems lie at the door of GH. He has worked hard at his reputation of deep pockets but very short arms. He was instrumental in destroying the uner 21's(?) a couple of years ago and refuses to run a reserve team this year. Both JJB and Falloon needed at least a couple of games at a lower level. As a Wire fan we know all about transition and the answer is not always young players. The cheque book should have come out, that's the least the loyal Leeds fans deserve.Wigan with a very physical approach at times look impressive but they need to add a couple of classy inside backs, that was always their way.The same physical approach caused Broncos no problems. Next week v. Widnes should be very interesting, was impressed with their sometime classy play on Thursday. Why did Wigan lose patience with both Brown and Mellor?

Like your thinking! And still think Leeds will turn this around too - but you need to find some leaders. Maybe when McGuire's back, but then he's at that injured as often as he plays stage of his career. In reality, there were enough decent Leeds players on the pitch last night to have put in a better display against what is hardly a classic Wigan line-up at the moment - but if what are now senior players go missing then you're going to struggle.

Burrow has been the big disappointment for me, he really needs to be leading the team and isn't.

I agree completely. Watkins misread that plain and simple. If Sarginson had been ahed of the the player that passed to Farrell then I would say penalty. But he wasn't. Disallowing the try because he was about 20cm ahead of Sarginson is a technicality gone mad. As a Wigan fan I would have expected it to be given against us if it had been at the other end of the pitch.

So many things wrong about Leeds at present - Burrow's brainless running on 4th tackle and abject kicking, hardakers kicking and lack of passing, halls lack of form, injuries, youngsters in key positions, treble hangover, retirements, flooding and so on but...

It's injured players + retirements that's the problem.

Yes, Cuthbertson was such a bad buy he could have been MoS, Ferres was excellent for England last season, Briscoe, another international, was a huge upgrade of Jones-Bishop (so in demand he went to Salford and now Wakefield).

Not that JJB was 100% with tackle technique It was Handley that was penalised, correctly

Agree. Not sure (apart from Garbutt) that Leeds recruitment has been great. Did they really need Ferris? I remember when they took Tom Brisco. Want what they needed either.

Can we stop with the Leeds have injuries'. 5 Snr players, well Wigan had at least 4 (Williams, Tomkins x 2, Mclaorum). What this does show is a lack of forward planning and youngster development by Leeds. Last season they should have been transition planning knowing who they are leaving. But they didn't. Also for a city the size of Leeds where RL is so developed the quality of there back up youngsters is poor. Ultimately Leeds would be better placed to deal with 5 injuries and regardless the performance and effort was poor.

Yes I am. Sargenson (if that's how you spell it) only ran in a straight line. Not once did he look up to see where the Leeds players were. I actually thought Watkins ran in to Sargenson which caused the block but definitely should of been a try. (Wolves fan)

Oh i agree there was a lack of effort. mac won't stand for it and players will either up their game or be got rid of.

better performance by wigan, happy with the result. happy to have gildart in the team too, thought he was excellent tonight, if overshadowed by the wingers.

Can't see Leeds doing much this season. OK they have injuries but a team that are reigning champions should have back up available and they haven't.

I'm not sure where to start.As soon as we got to 10-0, at the ground we felt pretty safe. But I think the score says a lot more about Leeds than Wigan.

I'd agree with that - until about an hour in I thought this was going to be another 'play badly & scrape a win' performance. In which case we either hit real form & potentially run away with the league, or this is as good as it gets & we'll start losing soon enough. As it was, Leeds started to run out of gas & we finally capitalised. Still left oddly concerned, despite what is on paper a great start to the season.

Leeds have a fair few out injured.

Good to see JJB back, perfect tackling technique, lift the opponent way above the horizontal and even if losing proper between the legs grip, grab hold of the shots. Wait keep the opponent as vertical as possible. Then lean over pushing all your weight down.Only thing in his favour is opposition player running over and making contact on his back mid down weight application. HaHa! Says the ref you've not played for a whileThe bloke plays again is too soon.

He may well end up having a great season when everybody is fit, but at the moment I'm not sure what Brett Ferres running at centres brings to Leeds. It seems to end up congesting the flanks to the detriment of the actual outside backs (Joel Tomkins excels at this as well), leading to desperate offloads and gaps where he should be when the play restarts.

scoreline was a fair reflection and Wigan really should have been out of sight by half time. I'm not too downhearted by this as Wigan simply ran over Leeds when they ran out of steam. Perhaps they're waiting for Tomkins to come back but they didn't show much that would worry a team who were better organised and less affected by injuries than Leeds.

Looked like Leeds were playing uphill all game.
