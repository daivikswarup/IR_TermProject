F1 testing tells us little but Mercedes still look best in a tighter field

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>atching testing in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a> is akin to being trapped in the middle of a speech by Donald Rumsfeld. The former US defence secretary, who might be described as pellucid when placed beside the politicians who infest F1, talked about known knowns, known unknowns and then unknown unknowns – things we don’t know we don’t know. Quite.</p>

<p>Testing is a smokescreen multiplied by 11 teams, a sleight of greasy hand, a noisy dissimulation, a study in agonistic behaviour. When it is all over, few people are any wiser.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/24/lewis-hamilton-scorns-f1-rule-changes-and-wants-bigger-say-for-drivers">Lewis Hamilton scorns F1 rule changes and wants bigger say for drivers</a> </p>

<p>But in the kindly warmth of a February Catalan sun, Formula One folk looked about themselves on Thursday afternoon and dared to be hopeful. With just over three weeks to go before the start of the new season in Melbourne on 20 March, there was a sense of defiant optimism in the paddock.</p>

<p>Bernie Ecclestone offended people in F1 the other day when he said the sport was the worst it had ever been. They feel he not only damaged the product but also that he was plain wrong. The people who run F1 may well be terminally hopeless but the drivers and teams are confident enough to exchange nervous smiles as the real action approaches.</p>

<p>Paddy Lowe, Mercedes’ technical whizz, told me at the end of the first four-day testing session: “We are going to see a healthier, more sustained grid and tighter, with the back moving towards the front, which is really good.</p>

<p>“Manor will be in the mix. Honda have improved. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/renault">Renault</a> are going to be on the up. The teams in general are in better shape than they were in 2015.”</p>

<p>The quickest two cars will be Mercedes and Ferrari, probably in that order. It has been difficult to compare them this week because they have been running very different programmes. Mercedes have pounded in the miles <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/20/eddie-izzard-marathon-runner">like Eddie Izzard</a> while Ferrari have done shorter runs, using softer rubber.</p>

<p>The relentless professionalism of Mercedes has been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/24/lewis-hamilton-scorns-f1-rule-changes-and-wants-bigger-say-for-drivers">so impressive this week</a>. They have brought innovations to the car on an almost daily basis.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ferrari">Ferrari</a>, though, have caught the eye, like a show-off neighbour driving an old Testarossa. At this stage Mercedes may still be a little faster but last season’s half-a-second a lap may be down to two or three-tenths.</p>

<p>Behind them, Williams could well hang on to the third place they have occupied over the past two seasons, a great achievement for an essentially small team. But <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/red-bull">Red Bull</a> are likely to chase them harder, particularly in the second half of the season, when their extra resources will start to make up for their lack of preparation after making an end-of-year engine deal with Renault.</p>

<p>So the top four could well be the same as last year but the gaps between them may be narrower. It’s what comes after them that is fascinating. The other seven teams argue, with some credence, that they will be in the midfield.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/force-india">Force India</a>, middleweights who always fight like cruiserweights, have looked good in Barcelona this week, though they have pushed themselves a little harder than some of the other teams.</p>

<p>Haas appear to be the best new team we have seen for a while. Toro Rosso, now with a 2015-spec Ferrari engine, could be good enough to embarrass Red Bull on a few occasions.</p>

<p>Renault, like a number of teams, are likely to come good later in the season. But again it will be a major improvement on last year when – as Lotus – they often seemed on the very brink of extinction.</p>

<p>But if everyone is holding down a midfield place, who will come last? Last season it was Manor, who were being lapped every 10 circuits. But now, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/01/mercedes-engines-f1-manor-marussia">with a Mercedes engine</a> and another technical deal with Williams, they are entertaining loftier thoughts.</p>

<p>Sauber, the great survivors, did not bring this year’s car to Barcelona, so they are already off the pace. That leaves us with <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/mclaren">McLaren</a>, yet another midfield aspirant. The good news for Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso is they will be better than last year. The bad news, I think, is it will not be by much. So they still look bottom-three material.</p>

<p>Apart from on Thursday, when they had more problems, they have put in a lot of miles at the Circuit de Catalunya this week. But as Ron Dennis, the CEO, observed many years ago, it’s easy to make a reliable slow car. And McLaren have looked as slow as a hearse this week.</p>

Of course it'sall about the driver- provided the driver is in a Mercedes (for 2016) or on rare occasions, a Ferrari. One thing to note, the better drivers tend to end up in the better cars

It's definitely the only sport that attracts dull bores who don't like it but feel it necessary to comment. Bore off.

Plenty of specialist websites cater for that. This is a generalist paper. Better journalists than the specialist f1 press. If worse coverage.

27 marathons has nothing to do with F1. It's a tiny distance in testing. 



Author::::harryshawyer

It's topically relevant because he's running a lot of marathons. Hence, pounding the miles like Eddie Izzard. It's called a simile and it's a figure of speech that compares one thing to another.

A couple of drivers battling for 8th place won't make compelling viewing for most.

Not really.

What would be very useful would be a table showing the fastest lap time by each of the drivers over the past week. That would give us at least some basis of comparison (no matter how small).

It is more than possible that there are 3 seconds between super softs and Mediums, are you sure they were on the supers or were Ferrari on the ultras? There are now 7 compounds available this season ultras (purple), Super (red) Soft (yellow) Mediums (White) Hard (Orange) and the inters and wets. I don't think Mercedes went anywhere near the ultras as they didn't really want to show their hand.

I already thought Toro Rosso embarrassed Red Bull quite a few times last season.

I also miss a notion on McLaren. They seem to have build a decent car, yet the topspeed is between 15 and 20kmh down on the rest of the field. So much for Honda 'on the up'.

"Manor wil be in the mix" Manor has been awful, and crashed out twice with a questionable new Pastor Maldonado-like driver, although on his day Pastor actually could do some decent laps."Honda has improved" Honda did 10% of the laps the Mercedes guys were doing. Honda was also way down on power, and took the F1 director from his position. On top of that they didnt have enough spare parts so after 2 and a half days of testing, Alonso was taking his kart school kids out for the day."Renault are going to be up"Renault have not improved one bit over teh winter, according to Ricciardo. The Renault factory car was very problematic with lots of red flags because it stopped on track."At this stage Mercedes may still be a little faster but last season’s half-a-second a lap may be down to two or three-tenths." So you also watched Ted Kravitz Skysports notebook.

F1 must be the only sport in the world where they try and drum up excitement about a mid-field battle.



Author::::FarPostDel
DateTime::::2016-02-26T08:36:29Z
Too early to tell of course, but Manor look promising (compared to recent form). That midfield battle, which gave the most exciting racing last year, could be getting even closer. Especially if McLaren pull their finger out.

Don't rely on the guardian for technical data y'all! Just come here for the opinion pieces

Yeah, it's all game-playing between Mercedes and Ferrari methinks. And given the seeming confusion around the new quali rules, I doubt we'll truly know until after the first pit-stops in Melbourne.

Actually, lap times are useful, in comparison to the lap times on last year's test for the same team.



Author::::HiramsMaxim
DateTime::::2016-02-25T21:37:09Z
Sadly, I think you are completely correct.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-25T21:35:44Z
I agree it doesn't tell us much, hence my post. Mercedes laps don't tell us much either though, Ferrari have been equally reliable.



Author::::DavdyP
DateTime::::2016-02-25T21:30:41Z
Testing really doesn't tell us anything. All they're doing is collecting data to put into the simulator. Fastest laps are meaningless because we just don't know the set-ups, fuel loads etc.

He's likely trying to drive the value of the sport down by harming it both to weaken the position of the manufacturers and be able to buy back control at a song.

The article explained why a table of lap times would tell you nothing of value.

Why did you mention Eddie Izzard? What has that go to do with F1??



Author::::AgeingAlbion
DateTime::::2016-02-25T19:49:52Z
It's because of the tendency of the media to think only in terms of party politics eg Rumsfeld's politics are wrong, therefore so is everything he says about everything



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-25T19:49:17Z
There's a soft inbetween. Pirelli have said the medium to soft is about two seconds, so that seems about right when they ran the softs earlier in the week.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-25T19:43:15Z
It is about the driver. Vettel will blow Kimi away, Hamilton will probably get the upper hand again etc etc

You are writing an article about f1 and yet the only numbers in the article I can spot are 11 (teams), 2015, 10 (circuits) and 1 (F1). How is this journalism that appeals to the average f1 fan?



Author::::Jervillian
DateTime::::2016-02-25T19:33:06Z
Mercedes today on the medium tyre, both 3 seconds down on the Ferrari on super-softs. Surely the s/s tyres aren't worth 3 seconds? Even with heavier fuel loads?



Author::::daveuk82
DateTime::::2016-02-25T19:32:45Z
When was it ever just about that? Senna and Prost had a car that won 15/16 races in 88 and that wasn't just down to their ability. The first ever official F1 race (Silverstone 1950) had 3 Alfa's 2 laps clear of the rest.

This week Bernie Ecclestone -- who has billions in cash in the bank from F1 itself -- said that he "would not buy a ticket for an F1 race". Yes...he really said that. Why should I be interested in either testing or the race?



Author::::euro3000
DateTime::::2016-02-25T18:45:42Z
Drawing any real conclusions from a 4 day test with each team running a different program and different tyre compounds is a fools errand, but it does really look like the mid pack and back markers have closed up so that will definitely make the early parts of qualifying more interesting.



Author::::HiramsMaxim

I agree. I never understood the reaction to that. Its a very common expression at NASA, and in any sort of risk analysis.

I'm no Rumsfeld fan, but in the speech mentioned he made perfect sense. Known known - there is a collection of stars in the Milky Way. Known Unknown - how many of them have orbiting planets with some form of life on them. Unknown Unknown - the earth is scheduled for destruction tomorrow to allow for an intergalactic hyperspace bypass so it matters not. And so on.
