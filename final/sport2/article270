Tiger Woods's agent denies 'ridiculous' reports golfer struggles to walk




DateTime::::2016-02-22T20:58:11+0000



<p>Tiger Woods’s agent has rubbished suggestions that the former world No1 has such bad back pain that he has trouble sitting down and climbing stairs.</p>

<p>Reports from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/secrettourpro/status/701462667777744897">Secret Tour Pro</a>, and golf writer Robert Lusetich claimed that Woods, who hasn’t played since August, is struggling to walk, and needs a driver to take him anywhere while he sits in the passenger side with his seat fully reclined.</p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">I'm told <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TigerWoods?src=hash">#TigerWoods</a> condition worsened. He can't move well; painful to sit. Sits in car with seat fully reclined. No forseeable return. Sad</p>

<p>But agent Mark Steinberg completely rejected the claims on Monday.</p>

<p>“The tweets that appeared this weekend about Tiger’s health are ridiculous and absolutely false,” he said. “It’s reprehensible that every few months someone makes something up and it’s treated like a real story. Tiger continues to work on his rehabilitation and we will have an accurate update at the appropriate time.”</p>

<p>On Friday, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://abc7ny.com/sports/tiger-woods-return-to-golf-still-uncertain/1208207/">Steinberg told ESPN</a> that he had no update on Woods’ status, echoing similar comments he made at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/12290018/tiger-woods-faces-large-mountain-climb-wd-farmers-insurance-open-golf">Farmers Insurance Open earlier this year</a>. There has been no official update since Woods, 40, said in early December that he had yet to begin rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Woods has not played since the Wyndham Championship in August, where he came 10th. Since then, he has twice had surgery on his lower back, the latest coming on 28 October. Neither Woods nor Steinberg has said what the October surgery involved.</p>

<p>“There is no timetable for this and that’s been the hardest mindset adjustment, is that I don’t know,’’ <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/01/tiger-woods-future-golf-career">Woods said on 1 December</a>. “So where is the light at the end of the tunnel. I don’t know, so that’s been hard.’’</p>

And the surgery he keeps having on his back is just a cover for that ?

Not at all.It's just the obsessive discussion and adoration by the US network commentators.

Sounds more credible than the old stories that he could walk on water.

His sponsors will want to know sooner or later. They won't continue paying north of $10m per season to use Nike clubs if he's not seen to be using them on TV.

You are very correct.But I belong to a highly ranked private Club in Canada and the sound is turned off the TV when he is playing.It cuts out the acid comments of the members who all know their golf.

Perhaps Tiger could show up at Augusta & hit an honorary opening tee shot along with Arnie, Gary & Jack.

If you're asking people on a golf page to choose between sex and golf, I hate to break it to you but you might be surprised by the answer you get...

'millions of shots you took' sure, you can call them 'shots' if you like? I think it is something else that has caught up with him.

One day the world will know the truth behind Woods wins. His incredible; power, strength, size and sexual drive. And then his sudden demise, once Golf became an Olympic sport.Still looks like all that 'power' is now catching up with him!

Never coming back and that's for sure. Its a little shame he's not talked about as the greatest of all times now, but as a crocked sex addict constantly trying and failing to recapture his form. anyhowYou should see my new missus - Tiger would

A cursory look at ratings comparing Tiger filled and Tigerless tournaments will show the weakness of your conclusion.

When he does the US commentators will ruin that tour be showing every stroke, regardless where he is in the field and talking only about him. The result beng that millions have just stopped watching golf because of the commentators.

Shagger jokes are welcome here..Very pertinent to Tiger I would say..And when he is not in pain Tigermight be laughing heartily at them..Thats his mindset..Believe me between the lack of enjoyable sex or enjoyable golf..He would be missing the first one a lot more..SA nude beautiful woman spreadout and willing on your bed or a bunch of dufises in plaid pantsand white belts talking about never having sex much anymore..Who would you choose??

What a graceless comment. The guy is 40 yrs old and his back is stuffed. Show a bit of basic humanity

If true Wood's health issues are the result of too many people not wishing him well.It's not too late. He needs to use his considerable wealth to help the needy, learn basic good manners and earn good will.

Two lots of low back surgery in two months does not sound promising for a return to the pro circuit. If this is the end then it is a sad end. For all of his personal failings he was, when in his pomp, one of the greatest athletes of his generation. I wish him well with his recovery, and that he will find success and happiness with whatever the future holds

Shame to hear this, even if the rumours are false, he's obviously not great. He might have been advised to quit a few years back.

There's an easy way to squelch the rumours, Tiger.
