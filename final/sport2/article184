Venus Williams' return to Indian Wells an antidote to an ugly week for tennis




DateTime::::2016-03-11T09:30:30+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells is always a big event in the tennis world, even if nothing out of the ordinary happens. Indian Wells and the Miami Open provide the tennis world a look at the biggest stars as the tour rumbles towards the French Open and Wimbledon.<br/></p>

<p>Last year, Indian Wells had one of those “Earth stood still” episodes when Serena Williams <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/mar/12/what-everyone-is-getting-wrong-about-serena-williams-return-to-indian-wells">decided to end her 14-year unofficial boycott</a>. The original decision to stay away from the event came after allegations of racist abuse towards the sisters at Indian Wells in 2001 (that Serena was booed by American fans in the final against a foreign opponent, Kim Clijsters, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://espn.go.com/sports/tennis/columns/story?id=3952939">is beyond doubt</a>). It was a watershed moment and another step taken in tennis’ awkward dealings with black people and race. This year, Indian Wells will have another striking return when Venus Williams returns to the tournament for the first time in 15 years. And though it is significant news in itself, her return has received little attention, overshadowed by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/10/maria-sharapova-andy-murray-ban-drugs-test-meldonium">Maria Sharapova’s failed drug test</a> and Serena’s presence last year.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/mar/12/what-everyone-is-getting-wrong-about-serena-williams-return-to-indian-wells">What everyone is getting wrong about Serena Williams' return to Indian Wells</a> </p>

<p>About the only thing that seemed more unlikely for years than a 35-year-old <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sjogrens-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20020275">Sjogren’s Syndrome</a> stricken Venus being back in the top 10 at the end of 2015 was her playing at Indian Wells again. But her sister’s much publicized choice to make peace with the California desert tennis community, and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/21/tennis/serena-williams-indian-wells/">overwhelmingly positive reception</a> that Serena received last year, spurred the elder Williams to participate at the prestigious event at least once more in her career.</p>

<p>Venus comes into Indian Wells seeking her 50<sup>th</sup> singles title after a fine performance against a rather pedestrian field in Taiwan. That tournament win, where she didn’t drop a set en route to the title, was a nice consolation prize for the disappointment she felt <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/19/britains-johanna-konta-downs-venus-williams-in-australian-open-upset">after losing in the opening round of the Australian Open</a> to eventual semi-finalist and British No1 Johanna Konta. </p>

<p>The annoyance of that Konta defeat, coupled with losing a marathon contest to Russian teenager Daria Kasatkina to start the year in Auckland, brought questions again as to whether Venus could truly sustain an elite level at her age.  But the win in Taiwan and return to Indian Wells signal the remarkable desire and love for the game the seven-time grand slam singles champion still has.  </p>

<p>Make no mistake, Venus did not owe it to herself or anyone else to create a new chapter in her Indian Wells story, just like her sister last year. Chatter around how refreshing and mature it was for Serena to show reconciliation was foolish then and foolish now if applied to Venus as well. Especially by tennis media figures who aren’t black and do not fully understand the painful dynamics of the acerbic treatment the entire Williams family received during Serena’s final with Ciljsters in 2001. Again, the right decision for them would not be whether they decided to return but whether they decided <em>at all</em>, regardless of their final choice.</p>

<p>It’s why it was comforting for the eloquent Venus to share her thoughts on that tumultuous experience again.   </p>

<p>“I remember the hurt I felt. I remember my confusion and disappointment and anger,” a candid Venus <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theplayerstribune.com/venus-williams-indian-wells-tennis/">wrote on </a>The Players’ Tribune. “I remember how the coverage of it at the time didn’t seem concerned with me and Serena, as people, at all — but rather only with the story itself. And with the version of the story that would get the most attention, regardless of the truth. I remember feeling that I had been wronged, and that I had done nothing wrong. I remember feeling that I had unfairly gotten the brunt of the blame for a bad situation.”</p>

<p>Moreover, it was good to see Venus cite her little sister as being the catalyst in swaying her change of heart.</p>

<p> “And it was in that moment, seeing Serena welcomed with open arms last year at Indian Wells, that I think I fully and truly realized what being the big sister means,” she added. “It means that, for all of the things I did first, and all of the times when I paved the way for Serena, the thing I can be most proud of is <em>this</em> time. When Serena paved the way for me.”</p>

<p>As Venus outlined, just because she is more calm on court than her sibling doesn’t mean she has no edge to her. Leaving aside her continuing to be a remarkable competitor more than two decades after turning pro, there is a willingness to fight for the injustices she sees. It’s why she fought so hard for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2013/07/02/how-venus-williams-got-equal-pay-for-women-at-wimbledon/">equal prize money for women at grand slams</a>. That steely resolve is also why she is respected by many in the WTA locker room while still keeping close to a tight inner circle. Trust has to be earned for Venus to be comfortable with a person, and when that trust is breached, as she and her family felt it was that controversial day in 2001, then Venus will cut off a relationship. Fortunately for fans at Indian Wells, Serena has allowed her to return to a place where trust was broken.    </p>

<p>In a week where tennis and, in particular, the WTA has been rocked by the Sharapova controversy (the tour decided to give its players <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.si.com/tennis/2016/03/09/wta-prepares-players-indian-wells-maria-sharapova-doping">a guide to how to best answer any questions</a> about the Russian star’s admission), seeing Venus play in Indian Wells is a major blessing that they can take solace in. And no one inside the tennis world should take it for granted or overlook it. </p>

Hate to be the one to break it to you, but all one has to do is lift weights or do some other form of resistance training. It's just as true for women as it is for men. Many female tennis players are afraid to "bulk up," bowing to the same kind of social pressures that are embodied in your comment. Thank goodness Serena Williams is dedicated to being the toughest competitor she can be. The result is that women's tennis has at least one consistently fit, gifted, outstanding champion.

Oh please stop it with this! Venus is a great player but please compare and see the arms and shoulder size on Serena. Who has bothered to ask for testing? WHEN? Do the comparisons...she is a monster.

"Old enough to be the mother of many of her competitors". She's 35!

Both Williams sisters are legends. Anyone who tarnishes the sport's image need to be disciplined, no matter how prominent an athlete they might be.

What happened in tennis last week and Venus' return are two independent events with little bearing on one another.

And, what's really sad, is that most of this abuse comes from her own jealous, insecure countrymen. These two women have shown nothing but class in the face of it all. I am so proud of them. What they were given by their parents can never be taken away. Keep your eyes on the prize, ladies.

Strength of character, determination and a highly developed sense of fairness are qualities fully developed in few. That is why we are so fortunate to see this displayed so eloquently by women who have achieved much while enduring tremendous abuse and intolerance for long periods of time. The Williams Sisters are especially impressive and can only be role models for all of us when so many are demonstrating so many character flaws. Republican politicians and their legion of fans should take special notice.

Venus, not only an amazing tennis talent, but a real class act; despite the racism, the sexism and all round disrespect she has had to deal with, she keeps smiling and keeps winning. Her strength of character has always been just as important as her physical strength. I hope she keeps playing for many years to come. Venus at her best at Wimbledon was a privilege to watch: absolutely masterful at the net. If there is any justice the tennis gods will grant her one more sparking fortnight there.

I like the fact that she's always gracious when she loses and manages a smile and a "well done!" along with the handshake, despite the fact she must know she would have creamed the same players if she hadn't had an autoimmune disorder.

Venus has been such a superb ambassador for the sport since maturing into a Grand Slam champion. She's handled herself with grace and dignity despite all the muck that's been thrown her way (Indian Wells 01 was truly a nadir, but check out her US Open semi against Capriati later that year to see how ugly the racial bias she had to deal with so regularly was - even in her home Slam). That's never been more evident than following her Sjogren's Syndrome diagnosis - she could easily have retired from the sport and rested on her millions, but instead her love for the game sees her persist and persevere against the competition despite the odds being stacked against her. I'd love nothing more than for Venus to triumph at one of the big tournaments again - she's a class act, a real inspiration, and watching her on a grass court in her Wimbledon heyday was truly one of the great privileges of my tennis-watching life. Slay a bit, Venus! I, and hopefully the Indian Wells crowd this time, will be rooting for you.

Sisters are bona fide legends and would of been if born in any era. Really terrible treatment at Indian Wells and I'm glad Venus made the stand, really highlighted the issue. Powerful people these two
