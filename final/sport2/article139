Susie Wolff set to star among revolving cast in Channel 4’s F1 coverage




DateTime::::2016-03-03T15:16:35+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a> is a rumour factory, a gossip-fest with some background noise of car engines at high revs. It would be cheaper if they used Muzak.</p>

<p>On many days, such as Thursday at the Circuit de Catalunya – the penultimate day of the second week of testing before the season’s opening race in Melbourne on 20 March – it is very possible not to see a single car in action, except on the TV screen.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/02/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-f1-testing">Lewis Hamilton wary of Mercedes F1 hype after topping timesheets in testing</a> </p>

<p>The noise of F1, it often feels to me, even its current reduced state, is merely to drown out some of the more malicious canards. The tittle-tattle and whispers are all part of this most political and neurotic of sports. And I have a tasty morsel for you: In London next Tuesday, when <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4">Channel 4</a> announces its new Formula One presenting team, I understand that Susie Wolff will be unveiled as one of the star guests.</p>

<p>The former Williams test driver, who is also the wife of the Mercedes motorsport director, Toto Wolff, is not expected to feature every time. But she is set to be one of the biggest attractions as Channel 4 announces plans to change its talking heads from race to race.</p>

<p>When I put this to Channel 4, in general, and David Coulthard, in particular, they stonily refused to confirm it. But my understanding is Wolff will join others, including the former Red Bull driver Mark Webber, in an effort to mix up the opinions that are given to us.</p>

<p>All Coulthard would say was this: “We’ll have a professional presenter. Then we’ll have a mix of diverse people, some of whom will be recognisable to the masses, and some will not. We will have a range of different views.</p>

<p>“The full team will be announced next week but as a fan of motor sport, I am excited by some of the people we have coming in.”</p>

<p>The fact that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/11/david-coulthard-channel-4-f1-top-gear-bbc-jake-humphrey" title="">Coulthard</a> and the highly impressive commentator Ben Edwards have joined from the BBC, following Auntie’s decision to get out of F1, is almost enough to guarantee the success of the new format. But it will be interesting to see if Channel 4 can live up the high standards it has already shown us with its coverage of cricket, horse racing and the Paralympics. It also knows that the BBC, ITV and Sky have all covered F1 with some elan.</p>

<p>Channel 4 will televise 10 races live, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/british-grand-prix-channel-4-live-formula-one" title="">including the British Grand Prix</a> in July, and will broadcast practice sessions and qualifying. It will also show highlights of all 21 races. Its first live race will be in Bahrain, the second event on the 2016 calendar.</p>

<p>Naturally, Coulthard can’t promise the racing will be any better than the past two seasons, which have been comprehensively dominated by Mercedes.</p>

<p>He said: “I’m very excited about the year ahead, even though the reality is we will have – if we’re lucky – two teams battling for the championship. I think Ferrari will be stronger. I think they made a big step with their power unit and they will be stronger this year. I think it will be Mercedes and Ferrari at the front.</p>

<p>“Honda will be better but sadly I think it will be another year of frustration for Jenson Button and for Fernando and McLaren fans. I don’t think they will be getting any podiums this year.”</p>

<p>Coulthard feels Nico Rosberg has to beat Lewis Hamilton if he is to be taken seriously as a great driver. He said: “Nico came off the back of what happened in Austin [<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/25/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-world-title-third-time-us-grand-prix" title="">where Hamilton won the world title for the third time last yea</a>r] and delivered what would have been a championship-winning campaign if it had happened earlier.</p>

<p>“If Lewis retires and Nico wins the championship does that mean he’s a great champion? I suspect for him to be seen as a great champion he has to beat Lewis in the same car. But it’s in his hands. He can certainly beat Lewis on occasions.</p>

<p>“I have sympathy with his plight. I didn’t have the consistency to beat Mika Hakkinen [at McLaren] across a season. I had to do it on occasions and taste the champagne. But the ultimate goal is to become world champion.</p>

<p>“The strength Nico had in 2014 was to nail the qualifying. Lewis struggled to piece that together. But Nico couldn’t beat Lewis in wheel-to-wheel racing. Last year, Nico lost a bit of his qualy performance until later in the season. So he needs to strap together his 2014 qualy with 2015 end of season.</p>

<p>“He’s got all the data at his disposal – he knows everything about Lewis, what strategy he is planning to do. He can see inside the mind of the chess master he is playing. He’s got a chance.”</p>

<p>But I think I’ll ask Susie.</p>

I find turning on the television more than 3 minutes before the start of the formation lap is a complete waste of time anyway. Adverts, "news" I had from Autosport the previous Tuesday, explanations of things aimed at people with little to no knowledge of the sport, fluff pieces with drivers telling us nothing of import. I can't be bothered watching any of that whether it is interspersed with adverts or not.

Although Mrs Clark senior would be bloody mint interviewing Hamilton. "Take that ear ring out", "Do you realise how ridiculous those tattoos will look when you're 90?", "Nearly 30 and not married?" "What a waste of good champagne". You get the picture.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-03-04T22:15:34Z
Totally agree. One of the reasons I solely watched Sky's coverage (apart from it being superior in every way) was bloody Suzi Perry. Terrible presenter.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-03-04T22:11:37Z
She's not going to be a commentator, she's going to be a pundit. The two are poles apart.

One who can use an apostrophe, I'd hope.



Author::::Richard Williams
DateTime::::2016-03-04T19:15:25Z
It doesn't mean she will be a bad commentator. Mansell and Hakkinen were great drivers, but I imagine they'd be crap commentators. So would Raikkonen.



Author::::Richard Williams

She was connected to Williams during the time that her husband has been running Mercedes. She is very bright and well able to have her own opinions. Mercedes won't be needing her help anyway. Not everyone does what their spouse says, some people have independent brains you know.

Lets hope they're mad then. Id rather flatshare with Eddie Jordan than listen to her quacking away holding a mini ipad for no reason, wearing over sized heels for no reason and contributing the square root of jack to my enjoyment of F1. She is to presenting what I am to deep sea fishing.

Does an ad break puncture the excitement anymore than a 'cooking pasta with Jarno Trulli' VT piece?



Author::::daveuk82
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:33:58Z
...sorry hit reply before finishing the post. So yes there will be ads in the build up/post race but the bit that counts won't. Build up is all well and good but those 5 minutes (plus the time of the formation lap) is more than enough to build the tension up after the final ad break.



Author::::Simon Atkinson
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:32:45Z
As I said I find adverts just puncture the excitement of the build up.



Author::::daveuk82
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:30:33Z
No but the races themselves which usually in Bernie/Formula 1 terms is defined as being from the 5 minute FOM sting until the end of the podium.



Author::::daveuk82
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:19:13Z
Well she'll at least be a balance to David 'Red Bull Ambassador' Coulthard.



Author::::daveuk82
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:16:33Z
She's not even GP2 standard much like Carmen Jorda who was awful in GP3, as proved when Dean Stoneman took her seat.



Author::::Simon Atkinson
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:13:12Z
So there will be no adverts before the start of the race then?



Author::::daveuk82
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:12:12Z
Did you miss the bit where C4 said they are showing the (live) races without adverts.



Author::::Simon Atkinson
DateTime::::2016-03-04T11:49:14Z
The difference is that adverts on cars and around the track are not intrusive.



Author::::plkrtn
DateTime::::2016-03-04T11:43:09Z
You can't complain about advertising considering how many are plastered over cars, racers and tracks in F1. 



Author::::plkrtn
DateTime::::2016-03-04T11:41:38Z
Well I don't mind her comments about women not breaking into F1 but her own husband has failed to give her a drive... So that says a lot about her own level which is probably GP2 quality.



Author::::plkrtn
DateTime::::2016-03-04T11:40:05Z
Well I'm sure her husband being the director of Mercedes F1 isn't in any way going to conflict with her opinion in any way, shape or form.

Don't knock Pedro, his involvement gave the greatest headline ever.

Have you got something worth while to say then?



Author::::Antony OBrien
DateTime::::2016-03-04T11:08:37Z
A greater depth of what? The only thing she's got experience of in depth and the back of a grid in a shit racing series. A never was talking about something she never did.

Yeh well, she's not my favourite cup of tea. Ive always had a hearty dislike for the 'Pedro Diniz's' in F1 and whilst I know f1 has always had pay and play merchants and indeed it was founded on rich guys going racing. I don't have to hide my contempt. After all, most of them don't hide their lack of ability.

Like you - ID and DC all 'know' so much about F1 and are as boring as phuq- get Alan Partridge and Nick Mason. Not talkaholics who prevent even a second to hear the limited engine noise with their constant corporate , bland and obvious statements,

Indeed that was it's strongest selling point



Author::::Ieuan Johns

She's actually very smart and could make a good analyst, a far better one than a driver.



Author::::Ieuan Johns
DateTime::::2016-03-04T09:47:33Z
MotoGP is definitely more exciting, but so what? F1 is meant to be about the pinnacle of technology and ability, not necessarily excitement. Plenty of room for both formulas and most motorsport fans consume both happily.



Author::::Ieuan Johns

She said she wasn't interested and signed (for a big pay hike) with BT sport.

Funny how everyone has been saying that for 40 years, yet it never dies.



Author::::Ieuan Johns

Awesome, if she concentrates on portraying what goes on behind the scenes to inform the viewers she will be a great addition. Assuming she doesn't just drone on about gender issues like a broken record as she has done before of course.

Ferrari tested the new halo design on their F1 car today. What they didn't show was the F1 drivers have also asked for interior changes to the car - they want a glovebox compartment - so when they race on a Sunday - they keep their bloody handbags in the car !

I agree with you on the whole FanBoost thing - it feels a bit cheap. But it's the only downside I have with the whole thing. Other than that, I'm a convert in every other way, I suppose.
