Maria Sharapova’s single error excuse is a suspension of disbelief too far

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">D</span></span>o forgive the remote diagnosis but it is clear by now that Maria Sharapova has tested positive for hamartia. If <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/25/hamlet-barbican-review-benedict-cumberbatch-imprisoned-prince" title="">you’re unfamiliar with hamartia</a>, it may sound like the sort of medication your family doctor would prescribe to ward off a series of colds or a massive coronary. (I don’t know about you but whenever I go to my family doctor I always insist on the stuff that has only been exhaustively clinically trialled for different ailments to the one which it is treating in me, but which just seems like it “made me healthy”. I’m like: “Trial it on me! I’ll be a trial of one!” And I urge you to use this approach next time you can’t shake off the flu <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/26/serena-williams-wins-maria-sharapova-australian-open-quarter-final-2016" title="">or Serena Williams</a>.)</p>

<p>Hamartia dates back to Anciente Greeke Tymes – not in the same way as medicinal leeches but as a concept in literature. Aristotle defined it in his Poetics as a missing of the mark, an error of judgment in a protagonist that brings about their downfall. Pretty much ever since, critics have spent a lot of time arguing whether hamartia means a moral flaw or a tragic error. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/08/maria-sharapova-press-conference-failed-drugs-test-meldonium" title="">They will now be joined in this activity by tennis pundits</a>.</p>

<p>The tennis public – all those wonderful people out there completely in the dark – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/nike-and-tag-heuer-cut-ties-with-maria-sharapova" title="">will also have to decide</a> whether the events that are now beginning to unfold for Sharapova are down to an act of miscalculation, or a moral failure. It is always this way with any failed drugs test in which the athlete <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/mar/07/maria-sharapova-failed-drugs-tennis-video" title="">claims to have made a huge mistake</a>. The scale of the peril is dizzying when you think about it. We are asked to believe someone’s single, simple failure can spectacularly torpedo <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jun/15/maria-sharapova-wimbledon" title="">all the years of sacrifices, all the work, all the strain, all the pain</a> – physical and mental – all the lost childhood, all the lost education, all the triumphs, all the disasters, all the history, all the highly paid advisers. All this can be lost in the click not made. That really would be too cruel, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Yes. Yes, I’m afraid it would. I don’t think life works like that and I certainly don’t think the detection of doping works like that. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/russian-warning-maria-sharapova-meldonium-athletes-vitaly-mutko" title="">It barely even works, as we can all see</a>.</p>

<p>One thing we do know about downfalls, from watching them in any other arena than sport, is that it never turns out to have been just the one thing. You never read the statement “He/she had it all” in the anatomy of an implosion without going on to discover that rather than being a bizarre anomaly, the act that precipitated someone’s fall was in fact <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/23/bryan-cranston-i-scare-people-breaking-bad-walter-white" title="">of a piece with more of their earlier behaviour</a>.</p>

<p>Those struggling to achieve clear sight might care to consider this sort of thing at a remove from tennis. For instance, I am often struck how often a relatively minuscule sum ends up being crucial to the downfall of someone hugely rich and successful. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/19/archer.politics2" title="">Think of Jeffrey Archer</a>, who famously won a libel action against the Daily Star, which had alleged he had paid for sex with a prostitute. He had secretly given a friend <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jul/20/conservatives.archer10" title="">£19,000 for an alibi</a>. The alibi was (accidentally) for the wrong night, so was never needed, yet despite his slightly miraculous triumph, Archer couldn’t help greeting the friend at one of his star-studded Christmas parties – in front of other guests – with the jocular salutation: “This man owes me £19,000 and has not paid it back.” That reckless, suicidally arrogant joke incensed the friend so much he took the tale of the fake alibi to the News of the World, sparking a chain of events that would lead to Archer’s incarceration for perjury. Perhaps Jeffrey Archer still deludes himself that things would have been different if only he hadn’t said that one reckless, suicidally arrogant thing. And yet, Jeffrey Archer was a reckless and suicidally arrogant man.</p>

<p>Alternatively, consider Jonathan Aitken, whose libel case against the Guardian <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jun/08/uk" title="">relied on his wife having accompanied him to the Paris Ritz for a key weekend</a>, and not having remained alone in the Swiss hotel in which the couple were then staying. By the time of the trial, the hotel was out of business but the Guardian’s Owen Bowcott persuaded them to look at the printed reception records bundled down in the basement. And there he discovered that on the Saturday night in question, in an act of fatal parsimony, Aitken’s wife had phoned down to demand the room rate be reduced by 80 francs. Single occupancy, you see.</p>

<p>If only, if only … And yet, far from being freakish, isolated incidents, we can all see now these behaviours were sadly indicative of the men and women involved. They were those kind of people. Their mistakes reflected that. They were not outliers.</p>

<p>There is no reason sport should be any different. Unless Sharapova herself is the freak result, the lone imploder for whom one unclicked link really does collapse the citadel, then on the balance of probabilities she is that kind of person, just as are all those other 2.2% of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/meldonium-maria-sharapova-failed-drugs-test" title="">meldonium-using athletes identified by Wada in readings</a>, which suggested its qualities simply must be performance enhancing. Either that, or global sport had a serious angina epidemic on its hands.</p>

<p>Sharapova’s story has always been prettily told and, as with the best fictional examples of such things, you can <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/18/doctor-faustus-review-marlowe-chris-noth" title="">still feel sympathy for the protagonist</a>. But the single, momentary error is a suspension of belief too far. I don’t believe in: “If only I hadn’t …” I believe in: “If only I wasn’t …”</p>

Denial, denial denial - all her results are tainted. Just as Lance Armstrong had all his wins removed this needs to happen to Sharapova. She may not like it but she has no place in the sport. She needs to start thinking about a new life. Tennis needs to clean it's act up. Drugs in sport need to be weeded out including football where testing is a joke.

Migraines and Ibuprofen works for you? I find it useless but my doctor suggested taking 1200mg of soluble aspirin within the first 15 minutes of the migraine occurring could work and it does. Another option is to wrap a prepared towel around your head that has been prepared by soaking it in water then frozen in the freezer - home use only, obviously.

The medication was suggested and supplied by her own doctor in her country of origin. Once I was seeking an aid to stop smoking that was banned in the UK ( to protect the UK industry of anti smoking AIDS which were much more expensive with a weaker record) even though it had a proven track record. Perhaps you have heard of it - Tabex ( containing Cystisine) with very few side effects - only £6 per course. Both the Lancet and the NHS recommend it but commonsence from our government fell on deaf ears as usual.

lukethomas...Good comment? The problem for WADA & this is only my view, We need oversight on substance use , Unfortunatley they are starting to open up a pandoras box & by listing medication across the board they are playing into the hands of drug manufacturers who will simply change the chemical formulae key ingrediant,s of a particular tablet etc, & this catch up phase will never end, What was called ABC today will be DEFG tomorrow as an analogy of course ? ........for instance there are now more than 100 different anobolic steroids, They started out with 5 main categories Some athletes are always going to need drugs ( asthma) & other conditions it is unrealistic to ban all drugs, They need a new mission statement otherwise they are going to have to dig a deeper hole ............john

Dear Ms Hotspur, thank your for another intelligent question. You are absolutely correct to point out the good taste which Maria exhibits in public. But you must understand, maria is a fairy princess for the Russian children kept alive in orphanages through her tennis sponsorship money.and these clothes, these cars, are all just props in keeping alive hope in these children's hearts.

DateTime::::2016-03-11T13:50:56Z
austcitz1991 Your theory that there is possibly an anti Russian agenda at play here is interesting. That M Sharapova used a very recently prohibited drug is indisputable. Taking the substance before it was banned is completely irrelevant. As such, a punishment at the lower end of what's available would make sense. But this lenient approach would not suit the agenda (If there is one).

I do understand your point. Ibuprofen is not prescribed hence somewhat safe. I have reoccurring migraine. My GP changed my meds twice. They don't want my body to be reliant on meds to function. They are trying to find something that will stop the migraine. That is what professional medical practitioners do. They will not allow someone to take prescribed medication for a long period of time...to avoid long term use side effect.

Why so hard to believe? She was taking this stuff for 10 years, it is announced as banned 3 weeks before the ban comes in, and just over a month before the Australian Open. And by announced as banned, i mean a crumby link with an alternative name for the substance was emailed out; and everyone thinks it is totally unbelievable that this was missed?

mach924, Joan Ryan,cecile, At least we know there are 3 dopes out of 1623, Cite a science based medical research on meldonium,s capabilities , because only recently they " WADA" have decided to research this drug, IE Meldonium is not a performance-enhancing drug it just helps to protect the athletes heart from the consequences of physical overwork. That means it watches over athletes health ( Professor Ivar Kalvins.) is that to difficult to understand?

The only "mistake" she made was not coming off of meldonium when WADA added it to the banned list. Until then she knew precisely what she was doing. There was no reason for her to be taking the drug other than performance enhancement/reduction of recovery times.

In your Opinion you "think" Maria is better than Venus. I think Venus is a better player and frankly years from now people won't be talking about heads to heads stats. They will be interested in the Grandslams, Olympics and the Fed Cup.So far Venus has 7 Grandslams (single) and 13 Double.. She also got Gold in Olympics and has won the Fed Cup numerous times. Meanwhile Maria only got 5 Grandslams and a bronze in the Olympics.. Venus still tops her ..A very God talented Clean Venus... Maria has made more money on endorsements coz mainly she is a tall thin Blonde, just a mediocre tennis player in my Opinion. On the other hand the William sisters are just a Class act to deny it is Just absurd.
