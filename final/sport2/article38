Anyone tell me whats going on in the "Line them up and fall down" clip? What was the guy with the basketball meant to do? Jump over them all? There's no way he can get at he basket without setting them off like a newton's cradle. Is it punishment for them?

I can't stop laughing at it. He got his foot stepped on? Welcome to football! He was jumping behind where the only striker was anyway! Haha, that ball is going nowhere, and he puts it straight into the goal! Hahaha

He was stamped on by Cheryshev. Should have been a foul. Google for the enlarged image.

The clock only starts when a player on court touches the inbounds pass. Presumably the clock the timer was using had tenths of a second on it, whereas the one on screen does not. Perfectly feasibly that pass and the release of the shot happened within, say, 1.4 seconds.

From Sid Lowe's piece this week: 'He [Kameni] protested that he had been fouled as he moved towards the ball and Denis Cheryshev later admitted he had indeed trodden on the goalkeeper’s foot. “Do you think the goal would have happened if you hadn’t?” Cheryshev was asked. “No,” he replied.

Nothing dodgy going on in that keeper clip and the world's slowest clock in the basketball.

No matter how many times I see that Kameni calamity, it still makes no sense. In fact, it makes less sense the more I see it.
