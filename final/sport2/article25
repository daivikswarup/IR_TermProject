Maria Sharapova’s aura will forever bear a blemish amid the doubts




DateTime::::2016-03-11T14:09:17+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he sweat of the ladies’ singles final was still drying on the honeyed skin of Maria Sharapova as a handful of reporters were ushered into a room the size of a broom cupboard to meet <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jul/04/wimbledon2004.wimbledon4" title="">the new champion</a>. There wasn’t even enough space to sit down. She was 17 years old and at the end of our allotted few minutes one of us asked how she planned to spend the prize money.</p>

<p>Well, she said carefully, the thing she’d like most would be a Porsche Cayenne. She seemed to have given the matter some thought, even though she wasn’t yet old enough to drive unaccompanied on the roads around her Florida home.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/09/maria-sharapova-error-excuse-drugs">Maria Sharapova’s single error excuse is a suspension of disbelief too far | Marina Hyde</a> </p>

<p>Within 10 years of that sunlit Wimbledon afternoon in 2004 she would become a brand ambassador for the German carmaker, appearing in its advertisements at the wheel of vehicles that were once considered the four-wheeled expression of masculinity. This week, however, Porsche joined the chorus of sponsors announcing that they were <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/nike-and-tag-heuer-cut-ties-with-maria-sharapova" title="">suspending or not renewing their association with the Russian</a>. There is a certain irony in the fact that the announcement of the end of a prime example of high-end feminism came on International Women’s Day.</p>

<p>At Wimbledon in 2004 the teenager gave another striking response to a question posed after her semi-final. She had spent the night before the match working on a sociology essay, she said, prompting someone to ask if it took her mind off the task ahead. “No,” she said without hesitation, “that’s not how it works. When I do one thing, I concentrate on that thing. When I do the other thing, I concentrate on that.”</p>

<p>The ability to compartmentalise her obligations must have been of enormous benefit as she navigated her way through her career on and off the court. She was always punctual, always businesslike, always focused on the task at hand, whether it be trying to beat Serena Williams or promoting Swiss watches. Which makes it all the more surprising that she should have failed to open any of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/09/maria-sharapova-error-excuse-drugs" title="">five official emails</a> informing her that the heart medicine called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/meldonium-maria-sharapova-failed-drugs-test" title="">meldonium</a> – or mildronate, as she knew it – had been placed on the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/maria-sharapova-failed-drugs-test-australian-open-2016-tennis" title="">athletes’ banned list</a>.</p>

<p>The appeal that made Sharapova the best-paid woman in world sport for 11 years in a row has always been based on paradoxes – starting with the contrast between that imperious, sometimes disdainful demeanour and a glorious smile that seems to come as naturally at unguarded moments as it does during a fashion shoot. To love her, you had to ignore her habit, before receiving serve, that quite blatantly forced her opponent to wait while she stood in the back court, facing in the opposite direction, reversing the normal protocol by making the point run to the receiver’s rhythm. Or the way she responded to moments of difficulty in a match by raising the volume on the prolonged scream emitted after each of her raking ground strokes, a tactic surely aimed – whatever she might have claimed – at disrupting her opponent’s concentration.</p>

<p>There was also the invention of the Sugarpova. Surely it must say something about a woman clearly proud of her own carefully maintained body that she would exploit her fame to sell sweets to children in a world struggling to control obesity among a generation hooked on sugar.</p>

<p>Her own drug was unknown to most of us until this week. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/10/maria-sharapova-meldonium-drugs-lawyer-explains" title="">She took meldonium for 10 years</a>, allegedly on prescription from her family doctor to treat a variety of ailments. But if there is one thing we know about athletes it is that even the non-cheats among them will explore any potential marginal gain in the effort to acquire an edge.</p>

<p>Bradley Wiggins gave an inadvertent glimpse into that mindset this week. Answering a question about Sharapova, he replied that he felt sorry for her but that there was no excuse for ignorance of the annual updates to the list of prohibited medications. Then he added: “British Cycling are really on the ball – Richard Freeman, the doctor – in terms of things that have been changed, saying: ‘Please don’t take this any more.’”</p>

<p>He was telling us that Britain’s top cyclists, famous for the zero-tolerance approach to doping imposed by their managers, are no strangers to substances that become banned. This might be thought to put them in a bracket with all those Russian skaters, ski jumpers and goodness knows who else who have been paying around £5 for a packet of 40 tablets of meldonium imported from Latvia for the last few years.</p>

<p>Sharapova’s smoothly staged press conference raised more questions than it answered. The elaborate medical explanation was quickly undermined by expert testimony, making it seem an attempted cover-up, and that the evasion was creating far worse problems than a simple admission that she had taken a legal substance because it offered performance benefits.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/maria-sharapova-mea-culpa">ITF’s silence over Maria Sharapova’s confession does nothing for integrity</a> </p>

<p>Even her detractors would admit that Sharapova brought beauty and drama to the court. Her five grand slam wins were evidence that she mounted a consistent and often lonely challenge to the long dominance of the Williams sisters. It was excruciating to watch her struggle through her shoulder problems in her early 20s, two major operations meaning that in 2009 she turned up at Wimbledon barely able to summon the pat-a-cake serve of a novice on a public court.</p>

<p>She looked then as though she might be finished. But her enormous strength of will, and quite possibly the unadvertised benefits of meldonium, brought her through that crisis and enabled her to contend once again for the biggest titles, even if Serena’s own drive to overcome physical problems meant that the Russian would for ever be second best.</p>

<p>Well, she is finished now. Perhaps her lawyers will succeed in ensuring that her sentence is a light one and that she can return to competition still close to her peak. Maybe her admirers in high places will even ensure that she takes her place in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/russian-warning-maria-sharapova-meldonium-athletes-vitaly-mutko" title="">Russia’s Olympic squad</a>. No doubt over the coming years she will continue adding to her fortune. But our view of her will never be quite the same.</p>

<p>She is not a Lance Armstrong or a Marion Jones. She did nothing technically illegal until those last couple of months. No one will be erasing her name from the honours boards and there will be no asterisk against her name in the record books. But her statement this week, and the doubts it raised, ensured that wherever she goes her aura will bear a permanent stain, like a thin layer of pollution hanging above the horizon in an otherwise clear blue sky.</p>

Athletes universally take all sorts of remedies and supplements. None of them take those remedies and supplements because they think it will diminish their performance so it follows that they are trying to improve their recovery time, stamina, muscle gain and so on. That surely is unarguable, so the ethical complaints about Sharapova taking a drug that was not on the banned list are rendered entirely moot. When tennis players eat a banana or swig an energy drink between games they are doing it to maintain their performance levels. But bananas and energy drinks are not banned so its ok.

It's like a poor detective story as the statements change again. She now claims she disd not take it everyday for 10 years ( was it just before a match?) and that it wasn't that she forgot to open the emails but that she could not find the relative data. How much money do the members of her retinue earn. Did she declare what she was taking before each tournament. ?She is a cheat, about to lose a lot of money, while 'Head' needs to buy copies of 'Medicine for Dummies'.

If all nearly all athletes were/are taking drugs as indicated in the article then this includes her opponents, so levelling the playing field as far benefits go. So her achievements in the past should remain untouched. Mr Williams is right, though - this incident will remain a strong part of her image from now on. I can't imagine what she was doing not opening the notifications. I can't believe that she would continue on purpose, just too risky.

What is happening here, why do we have so many apologists for drug cheats in these comments. Is it because the precious white middle class leisure pursuit called Tennis could never have such problems, is it because MS is an attractive ambassador for the sport.... I don't know.

Head, who have issued a statement in support for, and continued and extended sponsorship of MS, have also questioned WADA's reasoning for banning the substance. Interesting to see if WADA responds.http://www.head.com/en/news-detail/title/head-issues-statement-concerning-maria-sharapova/

Yes. WADA flexing its muscles, bringing down a celebrity athlete. WADA should have to show a drug that is to be banned does in fact improve performance. Loss of livelihood is a serious penalty.it is nevertheless interesting to compare the Essendon footballers case. There the players took a drug that was an enhancer, but they, the individual players, had no guilty intention. And it is they who are paying the (severe) penalty.Both cases` are unjust to the sportspeople involved.

DateTime::::2016-03-12T05:41:19Z
What's your authority for saying this drug is a performance enhancing drug. How does it enhance performance ? WADA's statement on making the ban carefully avoids stating that it improves athletic performance.



Author::::GeeWiz
DateTime::::2016-03-12T05:36:10Z
A comment comprised of "perhaps', "it is possible", and "who knows?" is not of much value.Why don't you do some research and find out for yourself if it is addictive or has withdrawal effects. Why not email WADA and ask them ?Look at WADA's website and see if WADA claims this drug actually does improve athletic performance, and if so how ; what does it actually do.

DateTime::::2016-03-12T05:26:45Z
You're right its dodgy. She's been ambushed here by WADA - they want a big scalp so they can show the world what tough guys they are. And they don't even claim that it enhances performance !

I cant help feeling Sharapova has been ambushed here, set up so WADA can claim a celebrity scalp.The ban on this substance only commenced 1 January 2016, and apparently 15 athletes have already been slapped with bans. So WADA is at least pretty quick off the mark - suspiciously so in my opinion. My quick research indicates that this drug has no harmful effects and furthermore that it does not in fact enhance performance ! Yes, that's right : look it up.And if you read the actual statement by WADA on the making of the ban you will see that WADA does not even claim that it in fact enhances athletic performance, only that it believed athletes took it because they believed it did. So if the drug does not in fact improve performance, the athletes who have used it can hardly be called cheats. The suspension of a professional sportsman or sportswoman deprives them of their livelihood - it amounts to a fine of very substantial proportions. Surely it should be a requirement for WADA to prove this drug actually does enhance performance. The individual athlete is paying the (heavy) price here. Surely, similar to like the criminal law, a person must be shown to have actually had the fraudulent advantage and the intention to do so.This leads to the Essendon footballers case : It is clear that none of the suspended players had any guilty or nefarious intention, the drug program was devised by and administered by the club, and the players had no choice but to go along with it. Again, no guilty intention, but the individual players are paying a severe penalty !I believe AFL footballers command salaries of $250K a season, maybe more, and I suspect Maria Sharapova will be losing more than that, not to mention sponsors removing their support.To incur fines of this magnitude in a court of criminal law, you would have to commit a pretty serious offence.

I doubt this will "stain" her reputation. It was not illegal prior to 2016. Sharapova was never in the same class as the Williams sisters nonetheless she has had a very good career. I do agree, however, that if she is suspended I will not miss her screaming on every shot. Now could we suspend the rest of the screamers?
