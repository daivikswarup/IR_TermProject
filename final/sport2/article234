Adam Scott aiming at No1 after Doral proves good guys can triumph

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>henever <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-scott">Adam Scott</a>, a reluctant hero, tastes victory heads are nodded in widespread approval of a talent entirely matched by his character. When he is not involved in golfing competition the Australian hardly registers in global headlines at all. It seems a deliberate act of seeking peace.</p>

<p>In 2014, Scott invited close friends to a party at his Bahamas home; some dodged the offer, unaware that the occasion was his marriage to his architect partner, Marie. Justin Rose was among those who had thought better of attending, blissfully unaware of the gathering’s significance. Scott did not take Rose’s snub personally – in fact, he found it highly amusing, as is becoming of Scott’s wonderfully appealing nature.</p>

<p>At the Players Championship of that year, Scott bashfully admitted that he was a married man. This was not arrogance, weird secrecy or some act of anti-media protest. One of the finest sportsmen in the world, and one with fantastic human appeal, he simply revels in the non-spotlight or understated life. And yet his golfing demeanour is a recurring source of inspiration.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening in Florida, Scott had no choice but to see his name in lights again. Victory at the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral was not only relished by Scott but appreciated by a wider golfing audience who have watched this 35-year-old suffer some professional trauma. The Open Championship of 2012, where the Claret Jug was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/22/open-2012-ernie-els" title="">effectively handed over to Ernie Els,</a> represents a case in point.</p>

<p>Within 10 months, Scott was the Masters champion. If that garnered epic coverage, typically the birth of Scott’s daughter, Bo Vera, just over a year ago was a whisper. The former world No1 would not have it any other way.</p>

<p>“Her birth affected me in a huge way,” Scott said. “I hope only in a positive way. You know, absolutely my first priority becomes my family and whatever they need.</p>

<p>“It’s only been a good thing. I think both my wife and I put in a lot of time last year with our daughter; maybe that had some effect on my golf or maybe not. Maybe my mind was not as switched on. It’s hard to know. I don’t really care. But I’m happy we did. We were just like any first-time parents, had no clue what we were doing last year and I had no clue how to manage my wife or my daughter or my career at that point.</p>

<p>“I had some big sit-downs at the end of last year and planned this year out a lot better, so we all knew what we’re doing after nine or 10 months of having a child and how we’re going to manage that travelling around, and so far, it’s gone well.”</p>

<p>Through an understanding of parental responsibilities, scheduling progress or whatever, Scott is a golfing man possessed. Back to back wins on the Florida swing – he claimed the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/28/adam-scott-sergio-garcia-honda-classic" title="">Honda Classic</a> at Palm Beach Gardens by a shot – trigger memories of Tiger Woods in his pomp and, more immediately, endorse the notion that Scott is a leading candidate for the 80th Masters. The Georgia extravaganza is now only four weeks away.</p>

<p>“No. I think <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/02/bubba-watson-enigma-golf-masters-augusta" title="">Bubba Watson</a> is,” replied Scott when asked if he should now be regarded as the favourite for the first major of the year. “Even if I won every tournament I play before the Masters, if Bubba keeps finishing second, I’d still think he’s favoured. It just sets up so good there for him. Obviously his record there is amazing over the last couple of years. He’s got to be feeling great about his game.</p>

<p>“You know, I’m happy if my name is in the mix. I wouldn’t shy away from it. I’m not just trying to put the pressure on Bubba, but he’s obviously playing fantastic. He won in LA and was second to me in Doral. Augusta around the corner, he’s got to be thinking this is looking really good for him.”</p>

<p>Scott added: “I’d love to just bottle up where my game’s been at the last couple weeks and move forward a month. That’s going to be the hard thing for me to do, to manage my expectations and also manage my game to keep it right here.</p>

<p>“I can’t just keep pushing. I have to pace myself kind of so I don’t over-work it and try and get too prepared and do all that. It’s finding that balance the next month for me that’s going to be really important, but obviously the confidence is going to be high right now. So I just want to do everything to keep that there.”</p>

<p>The bigger, wholly logical, target is therefore: “I think probably a mini-goal starting the year or backend of last year was to try and get back to world No1. I think it’s a fair goal, because I’ve been there before and if you get to that point, I think I’m going to achieve what I want in the game.</p>

<p>“So that’s probably a bit of a long-term goal. I wasn’t thinking I should just get there by, you know, September this year or something. Over the next couple of years, I want to give myself a chance to play consistently well and move back up there, get back to No1, hopefully some wins and another major and another major comes along in that time. It would be amazing to get back there.”</p>

<p>By Scott standards, this represented effusive-speak. When his clubs do the talking, few in golf can compare. Two Sundays in quick succession, the good guy really did win.</p>

Rubio is the candidate preferred by the Republican establishment. Rubio introduced a tax plan that would eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains, lower the corporate tax rate to 25% from 35%, and set the top rate on wage income to 35% from 39.6%. He represents the interests of the 0.1%, not mainstream America. Cruz wants a flat tax on incomes, but also a VAT on most goods. This would disproportionately hit the less well off. Fairness and equity are concepts that have escaped Cruz, Trump and Rubio.Both Rubio and Cruz show more loyalty to the PM of Israel than the President of the United States. Cruz and Rubio would happily take the US into another ill fated misadventure in the Middle East. They see nothing wrong in restricting gun sales for ex criminals or those with serious mental health issues. Both their tax plans would see the budget deficit over a $1 trillion and on a path upwards. Neither want to see the minimum wage rise, as they have no concept of what is is like to struggle from day to day. Trump also has no idea how most Americans live. His policies are not want America needs.

Ewan Murray was and is the reason that I choose to watch Sky Golf coverage with the Volume off , whenever He and the other incumbent Crichtley are voicing the ridiculous opinions , disguised as commentary . This failed golfer is in his own opinion the "Experts Expert " as this nonsensical article suggests ! why This idiot is paid to express his view in writing as well as on the TV remains a mystery !

No, because they didn't triumph, did they? Do you think the headline should say:

Yeah - I can't believe an article about Adam Scott's surge of form this year doesn't mention his switch to the short putter. It's a massive, massive change to the way that he plays.

I won't judge him either way but he is missing out if he doesn't go. The atmosphere will be incredible, as will the rare opportunity to share a stage with other world class athletes. One day when he's retired, he will attend the Olympics and think, 'bloody hell!'

Rubio would not be worse than Cruz or Trump (or Clinton for that matter).

Don't think he has any intention of competing at the Olympics.

You can say what you like about Trump as the Republican candidate, but Trump's roll was as a sponsor and owner of the golf course, therefore I would of been very disappointed in Adam Scott had he not acknowledge Trump, but Scott the professional and good bloke that he is was always going to be gracious to Trump.

He's playing golf, not politics.

I'm not sure there are too many social-minded Democrats on or around the PGA Tour. If anything, 'no-platforming' (almost always a stupid idea anyway) would only make a low-key guy like Scott a massive pariah amongst one of the strongest GOP voting blocs -golf fans- there is.

Very interesting headline. Are you implying that players like Rory McIlroy, Danny Willett, Phil Mickelson, Jimmy Walker and Paul Casey are NOT good guys? Yes, I intentionally left out the homophobic, caddie-abusing Watson.

Good to see Scotty wielding his short putter so effectively!

The tournament was at one of Trump's resorts. Trump was the host so to speak. A major sponsor of the tournament is not one to be snubbed, even if their political views are repugnant.Adam Scott is not a political person. He keeps a low key profile for himself, wife and daughter. Shaking hands with Trump is not endorsing him for President. It is acknowledging his relationship to this golf event.Donald Trump, US President, would be a disaster. A President Cruz or Rubio would be even worse.

Maybe Rory (who has set up home in Florida) was demotivated to win the tournament because of Trump’s political ambitions in ------- (fill in the seven letter space).

Very disappointed that Adam acknowledged, let alone shook the hand of Donald Drumph (AKA Trump). It would have been a good way to influence golfing voters by showing his disendorsement of the bouffant.

Let's hope Scott sticks to his convictions & gives the absurd Olympic golf tournament a miss.
