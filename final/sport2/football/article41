Dean Holdsworth gets down to business after boarding Bolton rollercoaster

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">D</span></span>ean Holdsworth remembers driving up to Bolton 19 years ago, seeing the Reebok Stadium lights from the motorway and feeling a rush of adrenaline. Man and club have come a long way since Holdsworth spent six years there between 1997-2003 but find themselves reunited at the beginning of a new era.</p>

<p>Holdsworth is now the Bolton chief executive after his consortium, Sports Shield, secured approval from the Football League to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/bolton-wanderers-takeover-completed-sports-shield-consortium-dean-holdsworth" title="">complete a takeover</a> in a joint venture with the Inner Circle Investment Group. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/22/bolton-takeover-high-court-tax-hearing" title="">The deal</a> has been six months in the making yet, for the struggling Championship club, which has had to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/22/bolton-neil-lennon-staff-coaching" title="">sell off numerous assets</a>, change cannot come soon enough.</p>

<p>Bolton are bottom of the table and 10 points from safety with 10 matches remaining but, more significantly, they were minutes away from extinction during the last week in February. A winding-up petition regarding £3m of unpaid tax, brought to the high court by HMRC, was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/22/bolton-takeover-high-court-tax-hearing" title="">adjourned at the 11th hour</a> and only after the club’s sale had been confirmed five minutes before the hearing was to start.</p>

<p>It was a close-run thing. The petition was adjourned until 7 March to allow the takeover to be ratified and this week was delayed again until 14 March, by which time the outstanding bill is expected to be paid. Holdsworth’s consortium bought Bolton from the former owner, Eddie Davies, for £1 but has handed over £7.5m as working capital until the end of the season.​ Another £10m has been provided as proof of future funds and, although there have been a series of complications during the process, without Holdsworth’s intervention the club were minutes from potential liquidation.</p>

<p>“We exchanged contracts at 11.55am and the court hearing was at 12pm,” Holdsworth said of the initial takeover agreement in February in London. “It couldn’t have been any tighter. It was incredible and emotional to see the solicitors’ emails come through. To have gone through six months of everything, to finally see an email which tells you the contracts have been exchanged was pretty special. It was a relief because it has been a rollercoaster.”</p>

<p>What started as a casual cup of tea between Holdsworth and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/10/phil-gartside-bolton-wanderers-chairman-dies-aged-63" title="">Phil Gartside, the late Bolton chairman</a>, has ended with the former striker in control of the club for whom he made more than 150 league appearances. Along with a small group of investors behind Sports Shield and Inner Circle Investment Group, Holdsworth has the task of transforming a club who have struggled spectacularly since relegation from the Premier League in 2012 after 11 years in the top flight.</p>

<p>Davies has agreed to write off around £175m of debt owed to him by the club. Even so, Bolton, who have a home derby with Preston on Saturday, are starting from scratch and without a number of assets, including the training ground recently sold to Wigan Athletic.</p>

<p>Another relegation beckons but Holdsworth is not giving up hope of a late reprieve and will be busy in the loan market once their transfer embargo is lifted. The 47-year-old, who also played in the top flight with Wimbledon, is confident his experience gained after retiring – when he managed clubs including Newport County and Aldershot – will stand him in good stead for a career in football administration.</p>

<p>“I see myself as an upstairs person now,” he said. “I’ve got businesses and have been busy with those. I absolutely love managing and coaching but unfortunately I think that has passed me by now. But I love football and love being part of a winning regime.</p>

<p>“Having worked in many football environments, managing a board of people has always been a football education. I’ve always wondered why boards have never got involved in the analytical side of player acquisitions and recruitment. They put a lot of trust in a manager who says: ‘OK, I’m going to go away and spend a lot of money on this or that player.’</p>

<p>“I think that education gives me an advantage when it comes to future acquisitions, the brand, and what we’re trying to build. How do we play, what does a No9 or No10 look like? I think a lot of clubs lose their way. Do some clubs understand what it takes to be a modern-day player or a modern-day manager?”</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Holdsworth keeps faith with the manager, Neil Lennon. Change will doubtless come and, with a future in League One likely, plans must be made for the future. For Holdsworth, who remembers the days of a club on an upward trajectory, getting Bolton back on the right path is a cause worth fighting for.</p>

<p>“They are where they are because of the facts not because of history,” he said. “The form of the team this season hasn’t been good enough. There are players there who can make a difference and the infrastructure of the club, the history of the club, should rank as Premier League.</p>

<p>“I get a tingle every time I drive up to the ground [now the Macron Stadium)and see the floodlights on the M61. I get the same feeling I had when I was there in 1997 when I joined, when I wanted it to be my home. I still get it. This for me is an emotional decision because it means a lot to me and I’m seriously honoured to be the owner and chief executive.</p>

<p>“I want it to be special again, I want to get that heart back into the club. I’m going to work my socks off to get there – we’ll give it everything we can. I want the fans back, I want the seats filled again. I want to see it rocking again. It was special when I was there and can be again. I know it can be done.”</p>

Good that he found time inbetween battering his wife to conclude the deal.

I hope he is a better chairman than he was a player.

To be fair, he could hardly be worse than the current incumbent or the previous 4 when it comes to...well...er...competent management.

Well, something is better than nothing, of course. But as far as I can tell, Inner Circle is basically Ken Anderson, ex-football agent banned from being a company director for eight years due to tax evasion. And the investors' lack of obvious capital makes it easy to envisage a short, asset-stripping stewardship before selling on. It would be really great if the Guardian followed up this piece with more scrutiny of Sports Shield and Inner Circle. Especially given that 'club legend' Deano has foregone the chance on his first day to be plain-speaking and transparent in favour of bigging up the benefits of his very average managerial experience.

He was hardly the leanest of specimens during his playing days either...

Fingers crossed this goes well for Bolton. As a Leeds fan, I have had plenty of experience of people coming in and promising the earth.

It's worrying when a chariman says he is going to influence transfers and training, but the fact he is an ex-player means he knows a bit about what he is talking about. That being said, without him we wouldnt have a club anymore, so he can do whatever he wants for a while, especially if he keeps us up.

Fascinating, but who is, you know, the person at the back of this? Has anyone thought of following the money to find out?

Gosh, he needs to roll up his sleeves, step up to the plate, pull his socks up, steady the ship, bring his A game and give 120%. And the Guardian should keep on with its inventive headlines.

Hmm, I do hope it turns out okay for Bolton, but reading his comments regarding how he loves management and coaching, how boards should become more involved with transfers, how he knows what a striker looks like, it does appear that Lennon (or whoever) won't be getting much of a say in the running of things. How long until Holdsworth pops into the dressing room after a defeat, or starts making suggestions on who should be in the team...Hope not but fear it will end in tears.
