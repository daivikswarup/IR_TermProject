<p>Click to enlarge and debate the strip below the line.</p>

<p><strong>1) </strong>Goal. The only thing to be wary of is any potential gamesmanship from the injured player – but it seems pretty clear this wasn’t a deliberate attempt to impede an opponent. The defender should have done what he’s paid to do, and played to the whistle. Award the goal, and call on the physio. <em>Thanks to David Jones. </em><br/></p>

<p><strong>2) </strong>Nothing. The laws state that a player who removes his shirt “after scoring a goal” is cautioned for unsporting behaviour. There’s no reason to penalise this player: he can wear two identical layers if he’s cold, and he can take one off if that changes. If he left the field without permission to hand this shirt to a fan then that could pose a booking risk – but use some common sense. Get on with the game. <em>Thanks to James Stillman. </em><br/> <br/><strong>3)</strong> It’s a deliberate attempt to con you and cheat the opposition - but your hands are tied. You have to send him off and allow another player to take his kick. All you can hope is that when you report the facts after the game, the competition will do the right thing, intervene and award the result to the opposition. This is clearly an area where the laws need amending, to stop rewarding those who break them. We’ll see what emerges from the IFAB’s recent laws overhaul - but changes are proposed which should mean offending teams will no longer receive unfair benefit from their wrongdoing. <em>Bruce Nelson wins the shirt. </em></p>

3. Turn down the volume on your hearing aid, point at your ears and smile inanely, then give your shoulders that cute, helpless shrug. Continue grinning and pointing to the spot. When he's taken the penalty, come over all serious and demand "What did you just say? How dare you? Wait until the FA reads this. I didn't even know such positions existed, let alone were achievable by human beings."

How about for the current double jeopardy for sending a player off and awarding a penalty, you allow the attacking team to choose between either:

I've never understood why having a player sent off allows your first pen taker to take the 11th pen. Either you should just lose, as there is no-one to take the 11th pen; or both teams should only have to provide 10 takers.

Scenario 3: For all the talk on YOTR about changing rules, has his ever happened? Whilst this is a potential source of cheating, if it is not something which is a problem then efforts might be better spent eradicating things which are a problem (like hordes of players descending on the ref after every decision).

That's the most plausible theory of the rule that I've ever heard.

One for The Knowledge, I fancy. The only case I have found of a player being sent off during a shootout was Diego during the Intercontinental Cup match in 2004, but as he was the first penalty taker and was sent off for unsportsmanlike after scoring his kick (which stood), it's pretty much the reverse of Keith and Paul's evergreen "sweary donkey gets sent off on purpose to avoid taking penalty" scenario.

He bangs on about it a lot, but has anyone ever done it?

But what if a player has been wrongly sent off? Then the punishment is too severe.

So the third question wins the shirt despite this having appeared previously, albeit with marginal differences in the scenario.

1.GOAL from the law Goals Ain't Based On Sympathy (GABOS)2. take the shirt off the awful runt give him a good hard slap and then sell the shirt on ebay for a bit of extra wage3. start swearing back and mocking the player till he takes the kick and misses

1. Straight forward, play to the whistle. Goal stands.2. Taking off your jersey is an offence because you no longer meet kit revulations. If he has a jersey on underneath, it doesn't matter that he took one off. He's still in full kit (regardless of whether a goal has just been scored or otherwise) there is no reason to take action.3. You take control of your game, look the player in the eye and hush him. Inform him that you know what he's trying to do and to take the kick, signal for the penalty to be taken. If he says anything more and is player 21 to kick, you send him off and player 22 is omitted from having to take a kick to even up the numbers. If he's player 22 you make him take the kick regardless. Procedure is that any breach in rules once the kick is signaled to be taken, if the ball goes in, the kick is re-taken, if he misses you then send him off.

Given that there is no way a player can get sent off during a penalty shoot out unless they wanted to be it would make sense to call it a miss (but not if sent off during normal time as that would be a double punishment)

I read somewhere that the taking off your shirt rule is imposed at the wish of sponsors, because when a goal is scored its one of the only times a close up of the shirt with the sponsor on is shown

3. When I was younger I was convinced there was a law relating to penalty shootouts to say that if a team had had a man sent off, then when it came to the 11th penalty in a shootout, it counted as an automatic miss because there was no player on the pitch to take the kick.It would stop an incident such as this one, and seems to me to be an obvious law to have in real life as well as YATR.

For number 2, send him off. There's a time and a place for giving young fans shirts, it's not firing the game, and incidentally it's not in a parked car ant night behind a take away either.

3. There is an argument that he is not swearing at me, but at the giant Sergio Aguero who has grasped him around the legs. I'm feeling charitable, so I will book both him and Aguero and allow him to take the kick.

1. Every coach says play to the whistle.2. As long as the undershirt doesn't have the name of his, newborn, it's ok.3. Pretend you didn't hear what he says, so he takes the kick, misses. Make sure you smile at him as he walks back in shame. Gamesmanship just got uglier.

It's kind of hard to explain to the disciplinary board how you only came to remember that the words he used were foul and abusive 2 or 3 minutes after he said them!

It's kind of hard to explain to the disciplinary board how you only came to remember that the words he used were foul and abusive 2 or 3 minutes after he said them! In any case what do you do if he actually scores despite everything? He shouldn't be on the pitch to do anything of the kind.



Author::::BaldlyGoing
DateTime::::2016-03-04T19:46:35Z
1) No, accidental obstruction is accidental and should not be punished! In any case the question clearly states that the defender stops of his own volition.



Author::::BaldlyGoing
DateTime::::2016-03-04T19:43:26Z
1) how can he have been offside if he's leaping over the first attacker to get to the ball? If he was behind the first attacker then he can only have been offside if the first attacker was also offside in which case the game would already have been stopped.



Author::::BaldlyGoing
DateTime::::2016-03-04T19:38:48Z
2) Nope! Being incorrectly attired is the offence. he can take off as many as he likes as long as there's a legal one beneath it. Probably a good idea for him to ask first but get on with the game. Nothing to see here.



Author::::TimTravelstead

(1) Unless the striker tore a muscle in his head, goal. I did not have it in my head to blow the whistle (because its when you decide to blow the whistle that counts, not when you actually do), I have not stopped play, and no head injury is involved -- so play on and goal.



Author::::jamesblanchard

Is there a reason you can't have him take the penalty and then send him off?



Author::::cloudwarrior

1) Goal - play to the whistle2) yellow card and off - taking off shirt is the offence. Could be wearing a DJ underneath and still a card.3) get him to take spot kick and detail incident in match report. The player should expect a retrospective ban.

3) ...is quite an interesting one. Foul and abusive is always open to a referee's interpretation, so there is a case for letting it bounce off you and taking no further action. However, think back - you should have given the teams some briefing as to your expected use of language beforehand.

1) Goal, play the whistle2) Book him, second yellow and the red. It doesn't matter what the player is or isn't wearing underneath3) Book him, send him off and note it in your match report

1.Unless you blew the moment the first attacker collapses, or it was a clash of heads which you should have stopped play for if you'd seen it, goal has to stand, unless the 2nd attacker was offside, so check that with your assistants, too.

1. Goal. Play to the whistle. It is the referee's job to stop play for injuries, not a player's.

1) If the stricken striker interfered with the defender (even if accidentally) it is an indirect free-kick for the defending team. If not it's a goal.2) No issue3) Send him off. The other team also get shortened a player, that is their 11th player is also excused, both teams will be down to ten penalty takers. If the other team hadn't had their 11th shot, this works fine. If they already had their 11th penalty and scored, again there should be no issue, they can withdraw one player from the second round. If their 11th taker had missed, I'd cancel that and allow a retake by their next player.

1) Goal, obviously



Author::::Sacko
DateTime::::2016-03-04T12:28:39Z
true, but the teams are only allowed to be "evened up" before the penalty shoot out begins, if a player is injured or sent off during the shootout then no further adjustments are taken.
