<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/melbourne-city">Melbourne City</a> kept their A-League title chances alive by toppling ladder leaders Adelaide on Friday night, coach John van ‘t Schip says. City’s 1-0 away win, courtesy of mid-season recruit Nick Fitzgerald’s first goal for the club, lifts them to 38 points – equal with Western Sydney and Brisbane, and just one shy of Adelaide.</p>

<p>The Wanderers and Roar could jump both United and City with weekend wins but van ‘t Schip rates the victory against Adelaide as vital for his club. “Of course it means alot. But it doesn’t say anything yet,” he said. “It means a lot because if we wouldn’t have won this game then we would have been out for the title chances.</p>

Adelaide United's remarkable rise to the top of the A-League</a> </p>

<p>“Now, we’re in, we’re still in. And we close the gap to Adelaide, we’re equal now with Western Sydney and Brisbane – they still have to play of course. So that is what we wanted and we succeeded in that and I’m very happy.”</p>

<p>City deservedly snapped Adelaide’s club-record unbeaten league streak of 14 games, with former Central Coast Mariner Fitzgerald netting the winner in the 71st minute. Fitzgerald was signed by City in late January and scored with a classy left-footer.</p>

<p>“I’m very happy for Nick because he worked very hard and the finish was terrific,” Van ‘t Schip said. “For his confidence, of course, it’s important.”</p>

<p>City host Brisbane next Friday night in another crunch game between finals-bound clubs.</p>

<p>“Next week we have another big game so we have to put in the same effort and the same fighting team spirit if we want to continue getting the results,” Van ‘t Schip said.</p>
