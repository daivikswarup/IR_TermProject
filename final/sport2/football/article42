Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino embodies Kloppball and enthrals the Kop

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">S</span></span>hut the curtains. Turn up the volume. Never mind, for now, the world outside. This was a genuinely stirring occasion on English football’s borrowed stage, a meeting of fifth and sixth in the Premier League played out in front of an angry, restless crowd under the slightly sepia Anfield lights.</p>

<p>Before kick-off it had seemed likely to be a game made for Jürgen Klopp’s high intensity running game. And so it proved to be, on a slightly wild evening that saw <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/liverpool-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report" title="">Liverpool take a 2-0 lead in the first leg against Manchester United</a> and Roberto Firmino emerge as the dominant figure, a player who already looks the itinerant tattooed Brazilian embodiment of early Kloppball.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/10/marouane-fellaini-manchester-united-liverpool">Luck runs out for Marouane Fellaini and misshapen Manchester United | Paul Wilson</a> </p>

<p>In the buildup Klopp had called this “the mother of all games”. There are some who would portray it as a more cobwebbed Miss Havisham-ish thing, a little dusty and backward-looking a kind of Europa-inflicted indignity. These two clubs have been English football’s grand old European frontiersmen. But this is also a story of diminishing returns.</p>

<p>The last five seasons have brought <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/09/bayern-munich-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report" title="">just one European quarter final</a>. Defeats come these days at the hands of teams like Besiktas, Basel and Wolfsburg. And yet to linger on any of this – decline, shrinking back, the fear of second-rankdom that so offends the Premier League’s sense of <em>amour propre</em> – is to miss the point completely.</p>

<p>This is the kind of tie that exists in its own distinct pool of light. Anfield was a feverish place before kick-off, the air crackling weirdly with snatches of song, bursts of booing. Klopp stood for a while soaking it up as the flags on the Kop billowed, from Scouse Power to the slightly insistent European Elite. It is a rare quality this ground possesses, a pent-up celebratory urge to fill the night with those old sentimental songs.</p>

<p>The great thing about Klopp is that he gets this. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/03/borussia-dortmund-jurgen-klopp-arsenal" title="">heavy metal football</a> schtick is as much about emotion and intensity of purpose. Whatever his ultimate successes at Liverpool it already seems certain this will be a warm period in the club’s history, if only because Klopp clearly loves the idea of this club, loves the sound and fury, loves derby games whatever the branding at the side of the pitch.</p>

<p>It is an energy that comes through in his tactical approach, and which was carried on to the pitch here by a player who is fast emerging as a chief lieutenant of the forward press.</p>

<p>Firmino was everywhere in the first half, dextrous in possession and precise with his high speed passing. In Brazil they have a saying about players who go out and “wear the shirt”. When he plays like this, Firmino looks like he wants to be buried in it. Time and again in the first half he laid the ball off and simply sprinted full-pelt into space after a pass, a pocket of space a moment of profitable disorder.</p>

<p>In a way the theory behind the much vaunted <em>gegenpress</em> is a bit like the old direct football stylings of Wing Commander Charles Reep. Both run on the principle goals often come from a fast turnover of possession followed by three or four quick passes, and that to create is often to destroy, steal, force an error. Here Klopp went for the throat, selecting his boldest attacking lineup, with Firmino, Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho a hugely energetic triple-press behind Daniel Sturridge.</p>

<p>Firmino’s first charge-down was greeted with a shout of approval from the corrugated noise funnel that is the Kop end. Emre Can, Firmino and Coutinho linked well, Firmino sprinting backwards with the kind of manic purpose most forwards reserve only for going the other way. United absorbed most of this at first, that packed midfield a well-knitted obstacle. And for a while the noise dipped, the game taking on a slower rhythm, drawing Klopp up from his seat to scream at Alberto Moreno, urging more, better, faster.</p>

<p>Moments later the opening goal arrived, made by a stunning no-look-style pass from Firmino that took Daley Blind out of the game. Nathaniel Clyne felt enough contact to go down. Daniel Sturridge buried the penalty with a sense of ceremony.</p>

<p>And suddenly <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a> were in one of their frenzied periods. The Klopp way can often break the game down into two fronts, one at each end, with midfield a chaotic no man’s land. There were ragged moments of mass-defence in Liverpool’s box, Mamadou Sakho’s involuntary jerks and shrugs and spasms on the ball particularly striking in the frenzied air (and misleading too: this is simply how he concentrates, dammit).</p>

<p>It seemed fitting the second goal was scored by Firmino in the second half. It seemed fitting too that it should come from high up inside the United area, pressure drawing a mistake and Lallana laying a cool pass for the leader of the press-gang to smash the ball home. Anfield went bats. The air crackled. Red smoke began to billow across shutting out the sky, the night, the desire to be anywhere else but here.</p>

<p>This tie is of course only half over, the home team a work in progress, But for a while, lost in the noise, seduced by Firmino’s slaloming runs, it was easy to look beyond this much maligned competition to the Liverpool that might emerge once the squad has settled, the new stand grown some flesh on its bones, Klopp wound himself a little more into the fabric of the place.</p>

Have some sugar, maybe a digestive and calm down dear. Klopp, as the article intimates, looks like he's combining a vision, ethos along with cash and determination. Patience as well as cash is needed in football, something Utd fans seem to have very little of which is ironic considering they had a manager pleading for it and saw LFC struggle when their dominance ended post Dalglish/Hillsborough. Success isn't a God given right. SAF dominance over FA and PL meant plenty of brown envelopes and having less penalties awarded against his team in 5 years then LVG did had a season. Utd have the resources, they're in aCL spot but all those fans who jumped aboard a pristine ocean liner streaming effortlessly from trophy to trophy it's not going well. Seasick and seemingly can't cope with enduring a journey on a tug boat for a bit. Hilariously. I've really enjoyed watching Klopp and LFC when they've played well. Bodes very well for them. Klopp *sighs* what a guy....

Can't say I agree with most of this, but well written article nonetheless. Personally, I thought the best player on the pitch was Can. Poised, assured, and possessed of great strength. Ultimately though, the quality of both teams was quite low on the day. Granted, I am only a lowly neutral, but it seemed like the field contained 22 extremely fit Championship players.

Forget the Stone Age football, awful tactics and excruciating media interviews, LVG can beat Liverpool. Give him a ten year contract and another £1bn to spend. To finish sixth.

Klopp loves a full back bombing on; Schmelzer, despite all the praise heaped on Reus, Lewandowski et al, was utterly fundamental to 'Kloppball', acting as an auxiliary winger. The difference, though, is that Schmelzer is also a pretty darn good defender. For me it's no coincidence that Schmelzer having a big dip in form coincided with BvB's poor season at the end of Klopp's reign

We're actually not getting worked up, just finally feeling like we might get our identity and pride back under this manager. Whether that will bring long term success is up for debate and observation but Klopp brings a hell of a lot of feelgood and we're bloody enjoying it so far.

A lot of speculation dressed up as fact there. Markovic isn't a winger and he's definitely not a wing back either, and the point that he hasn't had a chance under Klopp is a valid one. Origi was written off previously so your definitive opinion needs to wait.

Ryan, I'm actually not the Liverpool-hating person you think I am.I had no problem with that 'contentious' penalty against Palace, for instance - that seemed pretty straightforward. In this case it was just - odd… Depay leaning on him in a weird way maybe could've put Clyne off balance, maybe not. Didn't really look like it to me, but I didn't see a replay that showed clearly how his feet were positioned when he went down. Maybe if I saw that it'd change my mind, but otherwise I found it very debatable.

Erm, Markovic can play either flank. Chalk on the boots right footed right wingers are really a thing of the past.

Firming just needs to keep his head out of the clouds and focus on his game! He's a talented kid but needs at least or two playmakers alongside him in order for him to shine. Him and coutinho are the making of a solid pairing in midfield!

Funny how every penalty Liverpool are ever awarded was an incorrect decision. Meanwhile, only 3 have been given while they've played the most matches of any club in England. Sour, sour, sour grapes.

True but Dortmund's fans are far from the silent crowd at the emirates. I have been to Dortmund's home stadium in 2011, and boy the crowd is immense. Despite Anfield's own legendary reputation, I very much doubt they can match the yellow wall, leave alone beat it. When both sets of fans are equally passionate plus one side has double the numbers, doesn't take rocket science to figure out which will be even more intimidating. But I haven't visited Anfield so will not pass final judgement on that myself!

Usually I'd be ranting about Diverpool, Clyne's bought pen, Coutinho's embarrassing yellow card and even Fellaini's elbow was only near Can's face because he had already begun falling over to try and get him sent off.

haven't seen much of Sturridhe so far because he was injured and i didn't follow liverpool. BUT what i saw in the last few games - man, what a talented player. He always finds a teammate under highest pressure; he scores when he wants ;-)If you need a worldclass 9 who can play, here you have one.
