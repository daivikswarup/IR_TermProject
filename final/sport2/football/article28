This regular feature offers Premier League footballers the chance to demonstrate their artistic skills on paper rather than on the pitch, with a self portrait and dramatic reconstructions of real-life incidents.

1.) roll your eyes and say 'women' and abort the game, immediately send an application after the match to only officiate men's football from now on2.) send both 6 and 9 off3.) nick the ball while they're fighting and take it home

The answer to 3 is obvious. You offer to cut the ball in half and give half to each scorer. The scorer who gives up his claim for the sake of the ball is the ball's true owner.

Question 2 doesn't make any sense. Why would he be booking no 9 instead of no 6? Surely he is intending to card no 9 for the current offence and then looks at his notebook to see that he has already given a yellow card to no 9 and then sends him off when in fact it was no 6 that he had previously carded so in fact both no 6 and no 9 now have one yellow card each. All the answers that say book no 6 are therefore just plain daft. No 6 has absolutely nothing to do with this incident. The only decision the referee has to make once the mistake is realised is to decide whether no 9's reaction was sufficiently intemperate to merit a second yellow card now.

At the end of the game, the ball in play must be handed to the referee who carries it off the pitch and returns it to the relevant club official. Their argument is with the club and that's where it should be going. Obligatory yellows for not knowing the fricking laws of the game, as usual!

Quite amusing. But I would be very grateful if somebody could furnish me with the actual answer too!

It all depends on whether the multiball system is in use, in which case there would be several "match balls".

1.Switch the corner to the other side of the pitch, but consider abandonment if this isn't the only part of the playing surface that's in this sort of state.2.Admit the mistake, book the number 6 & tell the number 9 you understand why he got upset and that's why you ain't giving him any sort of card for his reaction. Do however let him know you are reporting it to the authorities.3.Tell them to worry about it when you have left the stadium and they are not under your jurisdiction-it isn't a given right for anyone to claim the match-ball, perhaps they ought to contact the club sec. first about two balls needed.

On re-reading scenario 2, I think the ref needs to be stood down until he can recognise different players."Instead of cautioning the no 6" means that the centre-half is the one you should be about to book, but "you mistakenly dismiss the no 9 for 2 bookings" seems to mean that you straight out book the wrong player (on top of any confusion about which way up your notebook is).

1) the rules are simple, the ball must be placed in the corner arc. If the water doesn't allow this, I'd ask the groundsman (or groundswoman) to come and try to clear the water. If the water can't be cleared enough to allow the ball to sit on the ground, I might ask the groundsman (or groundswoman) to make a small mound for the ball to sit on.

1) In the drawing, there's ample room to place the ball legally, in front of or behind the puddle. Can't believe all the "you might have to abandon" comments: this is football, not croquet or something.....

1. Send off both players - it's this kind of behaviour that is ruining football2. Send off both players - it's their mistake, not yours3. Send off both players - then cut the ball in half with a Stanley knife and award half to each



Author::::wjousts

Alternative for #3 - Tell the players that the only fair solution is for you to cut the ball in half. Which ever player says "no, it's okay, I'd rather 'im 'ave it than see it destroyed" gets to take the ball home. Clearly they love it more.

1) If the field is completely waterlogged, then abandon the game. Otherwise tell them to take the kick from where they are supposed to take the damn kick.

1) If the pitch is flooded, ask them if they want to bring on a sub. To cover the embarrassing silence, abandon the match as the pitch is clearly unplayable.

1- Call the game off if the field is unplayable.2- Book No. 6 and send off No. 9 (straight red) for violent conduct. I don't care about the mistake, this is referee assault.3- What kids. The ball is the referee's until the end of the match, so the referee takes the ball, and hands it back to the home kit man/commissioner/person in charge. Besides, in professional games, there's about half a dozen match balls, so there should be one for everyone.

1. Make a polite enquiry as to why one of the 22 women on the pitch hasn’t already dealt with this by means of a mop and bucket. In the very unlikely event that this causes any controversy, you can always make a statement on Twitter afterwards and then enjoy a couple of weekends in the garden for a change.

1) Tell her to stand next to the puddle and then jump in it soaking her legs, that'll teach her.2) Well now he does get to be sent off for being such a pillock, to really drive home the point take all the other players out for ice cream and leave him behind.3) Cover the ball and the players hands in oil, first one who manages to pick the ball up can keep it

1. You need to judge whether the pitch remains playable. It might have been at the start of the match, but if the weather has worsened and flooding is occurring, you can abandon the game. Otherwise common sense would say move the corner kick to the other side if it isn't also flooded.2. Apologise and rescind the yellow to the number no9. However, he can't act like that and it would be dissent, so he would then be booked for that instead, earning himself a nice warm bath. Then caution the no 6. include Everything in your match report etc etc etc. next week lower Leagues etc etc.3. Tell them to calm down. Remove ball from field. get changed. go home.

3) Many games these days use more than one ball.Certain there will be several balls prepared for the game.Take the ball back to the dressing rooms. Tell them to come and see you individually when they have calmed down a bit.Give them one each from those prepared for the game. Ideally from those balls that have been used.If anyone complains tell them you run the kindergarten not them

1 - A little tricky. If she's playing it short, I'd tell her to put the ball on the correct spot. It's pedantic but it's the rules. 



Author::::starcade

1) Examine the pitch to determine whether it is playable at all. Abandonment is not out of the question, since, if you take their protests into account, you cannot have the player legally take the corner from that corner. I'd have had the lino take a real close look and probably let common sense prevail, simply owing to the conditions. Any other result is going to force a significant delay to get the spot playable -- if you do that, simply use common sense and retake the corner.
