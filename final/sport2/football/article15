When Saturday Comes still shooting from football’s fringes




DateTime::::2016-03-11T20:59:00+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>here was a slightly odd incident a few years back when I worked at the football fanzine When Saturday Comes. Early one morning there was a knock at the door and a Very Popular Well Known TV Presenter came in and started saying things like “Hi! … Lads … All right? Yeah. Just filming upstairs … Lads! So. Yeah Hi!”</p>

<p>There was a bit of slightly baffled nodding and smiling. It wasn’t really a popping-in kind of office. But Very Popular Well Known TV Presenter seemed nice. Eventually he went away. So, er, do you know him then, someone said after a while. No. Do you? … Oh right. Odd. Seems … OK though.</p>

<p>A few hours later there was another knock. Lads! Hi! All right? Great! …Great. Listen, we’re doing this filming and, well, I just wondered if it would be OK for …” And so a little later, in an atmosphere of mild, tolerant bemusement, Very Popular Well Known TV Presenter was installed in the editor’s chair, WSC T-shirt on, bookcases groaning behind him, doing his piece to camera.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2016/feb/10/respect-season-ticket-holders-stadiums">How to earn respect from established season ticket holders: shut up and wait</a> </p>

<p>The programme went out a while later. In isolation it would have been possible to infer that Very Popular Well Known TV Presenter was indeed – though he doesn’t make a thing of it, naturally – the beating, throbbing heart of the 1980s punk-football zine crossover scene, dispensing his kindly words of wisdom like a great steaming Toby jug full of wonderfully warming bovril-flavoured piss.</p>

<p>In the years since, when people have asked how you get on in the media, I sometimes remember that afternoon and think, yeah, that’s how you do it. Showing a bit of brass neck. Transparently name-dropping left-of-centre football magazines in an attempt to assume an implied gravitas and borrowed sense of cool. I mentioned, I think, that this all happened when I used to work at When Saturday Comes.</p>

<p>It should be said that Popular Well Known TV Presenter is clearly a decent chap and has been a high-profile friend to the mag since. Which is no small thing for an independent magazine kept afloat by its long-standing subscribers, and which celebrates its own 30th anniversary this month.</p>

<p>Every few years these WSC-still-Standing pieces tend to appear, each time with the same unspoken, fearful subtext that this might even be the last of them. By now the early days of WSC are well rehearsed. An offshoot of the music fanzine Snipe, first published from a semi-derelict shed in Upper Clapton Road, it was conceived by the journalist Mike Ticher and then developed with the current editor Andy Lyons.</p>

<p>What seems odd now is its complete novelty at the time. In an era when football has smeared itself across every surface it seems inconceivable that until March 1986 nobody had really thought of producing a concerted alternative voice to the cramped daily pars of the back pages or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/sep/06/alan-hansen-match-of-the-day-horrible" title="">the avuncularities of Match of the Day</a>, that the most common alternative literature on sale at football matches was the odd National Front magazine.</p>

<p>There is a founding irony in WSC’s invention as a response to this, sparked mainly by a sense of mild irritation at football’s marginalisation, its portrayal as an outsider activity, preserve of boot boys and knuckle-draggers. The early years often involved taking a stand against the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/12/hillsborough-inquest-hears-chief-constable-fans-blamed-for-deaths" title="">institutionalised disdain for supporters</a> in the wake of Hillsbrough and other disasters. And beyond simply making the point that people who are interested in football can also be interested in things like music and books and films, that this is an activity that also deserves a place in the light.</p>

<p>Albeit, as an early-teenage reader the important stuff in the middle always seemed secondary to the fun bits at either end. Firstly the covers, my favourites of which are probably the famous, trailblazing Hillsborough one from June 1989, when WSC carried the strap-line “Unanimous verdict” over pictures of the FA’s Graham Kelly saying “it wasn’t our fault, the police (“It wasn’t our fault”), Margaret Thatcher (“It wasn’t our fault”) and finally a crowd shot of some fans saying “Oh well it must be our fault again.” Plus of course the one with a huge entirely unrelated picture of the teenage Ryan Giggs and the headline RYAN GIGGS: IS HE BEING USED TO SELL MAGAZINES?</p>

<p>The real gold was at the back though in the directory of club fanzines that seemed to take you off on a secret tour of the country. Blind, Stupid and Desperate (Watford). When Skies Are Grey (Everton). The City Gent (Bradford). The Square Ball (Leeds). Sick In The Basin (Partick Thistle). Fly Me To The Moon (Middlesbrough). Brian Moore’s Head Looks Uncannily Like The London Planetarium (Gillingham). The Leyton Orientear. Dial M For Merthyr. Finisterre. Fisher. German Bight. It’s like a slightly angry football version of the shipping forecast.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2015/dec/15/punjabi-wolves-fans-group-culture-molineux">Meet Punjabi Wolves, the fans' group bringing culture and noise to Molineux</a> </p>

<p>It is customary at this stage to credit WSC and its co-fanzines as a founding spark for a certain kind of voice, a way of writing and speaking about football that is there now in the explosion of blogs and fan sites. Certainly a huge cast of football writers, formats, TV shows and politicised ways of looking at the sport have spun out of its rather raw beginnings.</p>

<p>Above all it is a curious irony that a magazine founded to offer a way out of the fringes has in fact ended up spending the vast majority of its life in the Premier League era, protesting not about marginalisation but often the exact opposite, aspects of a sport that has turned itself inside out for television, marketing, profiteering owners and all the rest.</p>

<p>Which was the point, I suppose, about Very Popular And Famous TV Presenter, the ghost at the door, spawned in good faith by that same impulse, an emblem of the slightly Skynet aspect of the world WSC helped to make. Not that this is an entirely worthy enterprise, or indeed one without fangs. Perhaps the most famous piece of recent times was a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/42-Media/145-no-love-no-joy" title="">review of Tim Lovejoy’s autobiography</a> by Taylor Parkes, a long‑time WSC writer. Perfectly realised in its eloquent, calm, unarguable disdain for every single fibre of the Lovejoy entertainment persona. It’s still out there doing the rounds, a definitive advertisement for the eternal values of scepticism and creative dissent.</p>

<p>For now WSC remains a kind of conscionable voice at the fringes, a hospitable place, selling you only a magazine, some jokes, and a sympathetic voice for everyone from ad hoc contributors to the terrifyingly well-informed pedants of the letters page. Let it always be there!</p>

By an upgrade/remake, would you suggest it goes back to being a grassroots campaigning magazine? Almost every other bloody national football media outlet has gone the other way - ie corporate bollocks.

My favourite monthly read. Don't know what I'd do without it since The Word bit the dust. WSC isn't just about football, it's as much about the society that football is embedded within. The magazine is no longer about football being marginalised, it is about the marginalisation of things - people, communities, and of course some of the wonderful things about football that we are in danger of losing forever. Yes, the editorialising on the evil of the PL can get a bit tedious and repetitive, and if your are a supporter of one of the 'Big Clubs' it come sometimes be a bit of a bittersweet read. But WSC offers one of those increasingly rare things - a voice of dissent and protest in an increasingly Murdoch-owned, corporatised, and nationalistic world. And it's funny and about football. What's not to like?

From a distance and at first glance it actually looks as though the fanzines and their readership back in the 80s have got everything we wanted for football, and yet it feels like we're still stood on the outside.

WSC used to print pictures of strange football related things readers had sent in.They once had a piece of smart notepaper upon which was a crayon drawing of God knows what - the sort of thing that a 3 ear old might scribble. The notepaper heading read 'From the desk of Paul Mariner.'

I first discovered WSC around issue 5 - The Charlie Nicolas Cover. It was also very amusing in the early days - a feature called 'We Want Clive (Thomas) dissecting the rogue's worst refereeing led one contributer to observe that one badly injured player 'continued his shamming from a stretcher'. WSC gave rise to other fanzines that didn't have its staying power. 'The Absolute Game' was a good General Scottish football mag and there was a fanzine produced in Birmingham that only made it to around issue 14. Its name escapes me though.

I'll see everyone's 'buying it since' card and raise it to a house with all 350 issues in it (albeit an official facsimile of issue 1) and most of the books. When it came out I think my preference was actually for the other national fanzine Off The Ball - which always seemed to have a little more edge - but sadly it didn't last and become the Murdochian Media Empire WSC now is.

Yes, always remember picking up Mo Mo Super Mo in Sportspages, the Montrose fanzine. It was so good, my friend and I embarked on a trip to Scotland (from London) to see them play against Queen of the South. Fittingly it was a 0-0 stalemate witnessed by 350 people who had all walked to the ground except us. We were mentioned over the tannoy.

I still read WSC but not as avidly as back in the day. Then it had an amateurish and sparky relevance - just like early rock fanzines and like the other club fanzines mentioned. But now it needs an upgrade if not a remake. I can see without some interest in football you would not give it a second glance, but I am not sure how many "real fans" read it. Ronay mentions online forums- a different world mate: vitriolic and vindictive and dodging the libel laws, but passionate and also often extremely funny. Contrast last year Blades supporters' forums with the liberal - and even anti-football - agenda followed by the main stream press and WSC. It does cover "the game" in out of the way places - Bratislava's third tier - and historical blind spots - Finnish top flight, review of the season 1988-9. It also does serious stuff on grass roots football - but who would go to read this? Junior coaches, football administrators, Trevor Brooking? Some of the writing is as cliched as anything knocked up by Tim Lovejoy - Harry Pearson being a case in point. The letters' page offers anorak-like pedantry as readers compete to be snarky about Mark Lawrenson and, yes, Tim Lovejoy. The front covers are still good - never fail to make me laugh. But it is a fringe publication and not for all the right reasons.

Taylor Parkes left me cold when je wrote for Melody Maker, but hes matured into a terrific writer.I think hes been very open about his depression, however, and his consequent lack of a high profile career.Ive read his bemused comments about how his ex Caitlin Moran, for example, can churn out her well renumerated drivel without shame.Barney too is in a different class to his WSC days.From this article he appears to be a few years younger than me,mind you,(from his pics I assumed he was older-sorry BR), so the callow nature of his earlier writing makes sense.

I agree. WSC went through a very 'worthy' period, when, for example, it refused to list Red Issue for crimes agaimst political correctness (it was awful at times).I probably only buy it every 2nd or 3rd issue now, but its matured into a fine mag.

The early issues were defiantly anti-Arsenal.Sarcastic articles like '5 interesting facts about the Gunners'.As soon as the fanzine network developed though, they're really was a golden period of inter-team empathy, though. The most important thing was being a fan, and we had to unite against the dark forces massed against us.Via Italia 90 etc, it was almost too successful, and here we are now, with our football just a money teat for the super rich to suckle from.Don't get upset about the anti-Chelsea stuff. I'm constantly bemused by the type of person who witters on about 'big clubs' and whether Chelsea are or aren't such.We are, to my eternal indifference, and we just have to take it.

Mike Ticher used to produce a run of the mill music zine called Snipe.I met him outside a sold out Husker Du gig at the Mean Fiddler, after he'd been thrown out for selling it, and he told me he was thinking of starting a football fanzine.As a fellow Shed denizen, I told him I thought it was a terrible idea cos there was no market there (football fans and readers had no overlap, I insisted).Spot on as usual.

Been reading it since 1989. Still worth subscribing to. There's a lot more "big club" content than in the early days (well, Chelsea have always had a lot of coverage, but they weren't a big club then) but there's still liberal and well written coverage of the lower divisions and the non champions league foreign game which is not available in many other places now.
