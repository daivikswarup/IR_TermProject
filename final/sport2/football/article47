<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league" title="">Europa League</a> holders <strong>Sevilla</strong> played out a goalless draw in the first leg of their last 16 tie at <strong>Basel</strong> after having Steven Nzonzi sent off three minutes from time for a second bookable offence.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/liverpool-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report">Liverpool’s Sturridge and Firmino make feeble Manchester United pay</a> </p>

<p>The Spanish side had dominated the second half, with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/basel">Basel</a> goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik making good saves to deny Nzonzi, Kevin Gameiro and Yevhen Konoplyanka.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Athletic Bilbao</strong>’s Raúl García headed the only goal of a near-farcical first leg of their all-Spanish tie with Gary Neville’s <strong>Valencia</strong>. García glanced in from a free-kick after 20 minutes to give Bilbao the least they deserved from a match played in torrential rain and on a saturated pitch at the Estadio de San Mamés.</p>

<p>The fourth Spanish side to have reached the last 16, <strong>Villarreal</strong>, ran out 2-0 winners over 10-man <strong>Bayer Leverkusen</strong> at El Madrigal. Cédric Bakambu scored both goals, getting his side off to a flying start with a fourth-minute opener and then doubling the lead 11 minutes into the second half.</p>

<p>Leverkusen had their goalkeeper Bernd Leno to thank for a fine late save from Léo Baptistão but their night ended on a sour note when Tin Jedvaj received a second booking in injury time.</p>

<p><strong>Sparta Prague</strong> and <strong>Lazio</strong> drew 1-1 in the Czech capital. Martin Frydek rewarded Sparta for a bright start with a superb opener after 13 minutes but Marco Parolo pounced on a rebound to equalise before the break.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/lazio">Lazio</a> went the closest to a winner with Antonio Candreva hitting the bar.</p>

<p><strong>Shakhtar Donetsk</strong> claimed a 3-1 win over <strong>Anderlecht</strong> in Lviv. Two goals in the space of three minutes from Taison and Olexandr Kucher gave the Ukrainian side the lead during a first half in which they also hit the post through Eduardo.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> rallied after the break and pulled one back through Frank Acheampong but Eduardo’s 79th-minute effort ensured a healthy lead for Shakhtar.</p>

<p>And Mehmet Topal scored an 82nd-minute winner as <strong>Fenerbahce</strong> beat <strong>Braga</strong> 1-0 in Istanbul. The decisive strike came just moments after the Fenerbahce goalkeeper Volkan Demirel made a fine save to deny Josué at the other end.</p>

So last decade. Most competitive is the new strap line, I do believe.

Two fixture times. Personally I'd be inclined to watch A. Bilbao/Valencia (same time as Bayer/Villareal), followed by Sevilla/Basel (same time as Manchester United/Liverpool).

Bayer Villareal looked the pick of the ties after perhaps Spurs Dortmund, maybe I will check the second leg of this as I can see Leverkusen getting back into it. I have watched too much of Sevilla in the Europe League over the years! Thanks for the reply!

Plenty of open ties left. I think any of the games with Spanish involvement could be decent. So how about Basel - Sevilla?

That game should have been called off, it was an absolute glarpit

Missed all the games unfortunately, for the second leg can someone recommend me a game? Dortmund Spurs looks over.

villarreal showed why the spanish are so far ahead. they schooled leverkusen. no one expects you to win away from home in europe, even more so in spain, but if you can't even score one away goal to keep yourself in the tie, you're deservedly going out.

Why would Rafa go to Valencia when he can go the centre of footballing excellence that is Newcastle?

Dortmund vs Sevilla/Villareal looks the best match up for the final at the moment.

Bayer hardly created any clear cut chances though, the fact that Bakambu's goal in the 4th minute was only the 2nd best chance of the game says it all, 2-0 at that point and Villareal would have cruised through... yeah, Bayer had some good possession but lacked the cutting edge, and Villareal looked hardly troubled.

Haha.. a 1-0 win at home in a two-leg tie.. More like a dunk in a teacup

I thought there wasn't too much between the two sides but Bayer conceded these two goals way too easily for that level. The first one was a comical defense with a terribly misplaced header from Papadopoulos. The second one was also rather stupid. Giving away the ball after a corner. Unbelievable how high up the pitch they were on the counter. Bellarabi was the only player who was anywhere near Bakambu and that was only due to his pace. He is a winger... Leno also didn't look too good for that goal but he made up for it with that last save.

It depends on how seriously you take the Europa league.

If all things go as expected next week, 6 out of 16 sides in the latter stages of a European competition again... the domination continues, the next best would be the Bundesliga with 3 sides.

No report on the Villareal/Bayer game so might as well chime in here.

According to El Correo it was a "beautiful match with a retro look" ("partido precioso con un aire retro"). Never change, you crazy Bizkaians.

Caught the highlights of the Valencia/Bilbao game and a replay of the Villareal game.

I can't remember the last time a game in England,was played on a quagmire,with torrential rain that showed no signs of abating. Which only emphasizes the excellence of the football served up. Especially by Athletic Club,who were outstanding,a fact the scoreline unfortunately doesn't reflect. Hopefully we'll finish the job off at the Mestalla,as our superb display last night deserves.

The rain was coming down very hard, and the pitch was very poor in many parts, almost like a pool, a shallow one. In some parts when the ball landed, it died. It was actually a good bit of skill on the players' part to try for periods to play w/o letting the ball land.

Talk of farce, but no details. What went wrong in the Valencia/Bilbao match?



Author::::Puro

WTF! the only way for La Liga teams to be eliminated in Europe is by having another La Liga team beating them. They're bloody amazing.

That match in San Mamés was brutal. The field was worse. Ryan was superb.
