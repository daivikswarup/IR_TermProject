Newcastle appoint Rafael Benítez as new manager to replace Steve McClaren




DateTime::::2016-03-11T14:35:28+0000



<p>Rafael Benítez is confronting possibly the biggest challenge of his managerial career after succeeding Steve McClaren at <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited">Newcastle United</a>. The former Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid coach made an immediate impact, interrupting a scheduled squad day off by summoning his players for an introductory meeting and training session on Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old Spaniard has signed a three-year contract – understood to contain a break clause facilitating a potential parting of the ways in the summer should Newcastle end up in the Championship – believed to be worth at least four times McClaren’s £700,000-a-year salary. He is in line for a significant bonus, believed to be in the region of £2m, if he keeps the club in the Premier League this season.</p>

<p>Benítez now has two days to coach his new team before their trip to Leicester City, the leaders, on Monday night. Apparently undaunted by the task of ensuring the division’s second-bottom side – who have won only six league games – avoid relegation, he clearly could not wait to be back in a tracksuit, just over two months after being <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/04/rafael-benitez-sacked-real-madrid-manager-zinedine-zidane" title="">sacked by Real</a>.</p>

<p>“I have the pleasure to confirm I have committed to a legendary English club, with the massive challenge of remaining part of the Premier League,” he said in a statement that acted as a rallying call to supporters. “It will be a challenge not just for me and my staff but for the players, the club and the fans. All of us must push together in the same direction and with the same target in mind. Personally, it means my return to the Premier League, closer to my home and my family. I can’t be happier. C’mon Toon Army! The club and I need your total involvement!”</p>

<p>Already Benítez seems to have succeeded where McClaren – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/11/newcastle-united-sack-steve-mcclaren-rafael-benitez" title="">sacked at 11.30am</a> on Friday – John Carver and Alan Pardew failed, by dismantling key elements of the club’s previously rigid management structure. Crucially, Benítez, who holds the title of manager rather than head coach, has been offered considerable autonomy over recruitment and permitted to assemble his own backroom team.</p>

<p>A man who left his home on the Wirral, Merseyside, for Tyneside before dawn on Friday will be joined at St James’ Park by Fabio Pecchia, Francisco de Míguel Moreno and Antonio Gómez Pérez. The existing coaches Ian Cathro and Simon Smith have survived a cull that led to Paul Simpson, Alessandro Schoenmaker and Steve Black departing with McClaren.</p>

<p>Lee Charnley, Newcastle’s managing director, was delighted to announce the installation of a former Champions League-winning coach as the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/11/mike-ashley-newcastle-steve-mcclaren" title="">ninth manager of Mike Ashley’s nine-year tenure </a>as Newcastle’s owner. “In Rafa we have, without doubt, secured the services of one of Europe’s top managers,” he said. “We are proud to have him as our manager.”</p>

<p>Benítez was in the north-east by the time McClaren, effectively a dead man walking in the wake of last Saturday’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/newcastle-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report" title="">3-1 home defeat by Bournemouth</a>, was sacked by telephone after rejecting a chance to meet Charnley in person. The former England coach did, at least, receive an apology for a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/steve-mcclaren-rafael-benitez-newcastle-wait" title="">protracted public humiliation</a> borne with dignity and stoicism. “We acknowledge that reaching this decision has taken a number of days and that this has caused uncertainty for everyone involved, in particular for Steve and the players, for which we apologise,” read a club statement.</p>

<p>Charnley, whose position has been undermined by his determination to appoint McClaren last summer, added: “I would like to thank Steve personally for his services to Newcastle United. He is a man of integrity and class and he has conducted himself with great dignity during this difficult time.”</p>

<p>McClaren later released a statement via the League Managers Association. After expressing disappointment at the decision and confidence the team would have avoided relegation under his charge, he refused to display any bitterness. “I would like to place on record what a privilege it has been to manage Newcastle,” he said. “It is a great a club – the embodiment of the city, with incredible supporters. Newcastle United is a club that must build for the long term to deliver what the supporters deserve – success and silverware.”</p>

<p>The timing of McClaren’s departure means Benítez will renew old acquaintance with a noted enemy, Sam Allardyce, on Sunday week when similarly relegation-threatened Sunderland visit for the most important, and surely edgiest, north-east derby in years. The Wearside club have won the past six meetings – their past four victories coming, coincidentally, in Allardyce’s, Dick Advocaat’s, Gus Poyet’s and Paolo Di Canio’s second game in charge of Sunderland respectively.</p>

<p>When Newcastle lost 3-0 at the Stadium of Light last October no one could have imagined that Benítez – then managing Cristiano Ronaldo and company at Real Madrid – might be pondering whether to select Emmanuel Rivière for the return match.</p>

Although he wasn't liked by most I thought he did a great job at Chelsea when he caretakered for a while. I think he'll collect his bonus at the expense of Sunderland.

I find it more incredible that Mclaren commands a salary of 700k per year than the fact that Rafa gets 3 million. Benitez is clearly much better value at those prices.

Best option out there and our best manager in a decade and I'm supremely happy it isn't an other jobsworth British manager. I would have liked the fireworks of Pearson but the sight of half the squad hanging from the rafters may scare the little talent we have away.

Benitez has proved to be passionate, paranoid and completely deluded throughout his management career so he should be a perfect fit for Newcastle.

If he really wants to be successful at Newcastle - and good luck to him - Benitez should shave off the goatee. He's never been the same man/manager/coach since he grew it.

I don't think it's strange at all. They are second from bottom and only 10 games remaining. Even a great manager could struggle to keep them up with so few games remaining. In other words, it wouldn't be his fault if they go down.

Benitez wasn't hounded out of Liverpool by the media - it was the Gillet/Hicks debacle and him getting involved in the internal politics that led to the drop off in team performances and him eventually going. Not quite my cup of tea as a manager but he is very tactically astute and at the time he did have the connections to lure top players such as Torres, Alonso, Mascherano etc. to Liverpool.

At least he's having a go at a *ahem* lesser club. More than Mourinho would do...

A charlatan who won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005 and took us to another FINAL two years later in 2007 and to a semi final in 2008. A charlatan who achieved more points per game in season 2008/09 than 17 of Liverpool's 18 League title winning sides. Rafa is a genius who was hounded out of Liverpool (just like Saurez) by the London / Manchester dominated media who feared him. Good look Rafa.

As a West Ham fan in peace, I think this is the first good news for Newcastle for a very long time, and I’m pretty sure this appointment will keep them up. They have good fans, they’ve deserved better than they’ve had in the past, in my experience they don’t expect much more than a good team trying their best. Look forward to seeing you at the Olympic Stadium next year.

As usual Rafa arrives with big fanfare. Fast forward 6 months and I expect him to be shuffling back to merseyside with his tail between his legs.Good thinking from Newcastle to insert a caveat so he won't get a payout. Liverpool, Inter and Real have already been burnt by this charlatan.

From Ashley's perspective its an absolute no brainer. He'll pay Rafa £3m if they stay up, 3 months money plus his bonus, and the club will make £100m. If they go down and Rafa leaves, he's done £1m at 100/1 , good odds I'd say.
