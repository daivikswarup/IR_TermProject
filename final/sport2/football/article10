<p>Steve McClaren has been sacked as the manager of Newcastle United, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/11/newcastle-rafael-benitez-new-manager" title="">with Rafael Benítez appointed as his successor</a>.</p>

<p>Benítez, a former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager, has been appointed on a three-year contract. He arrived at St James’ Park on Friday to complete the deal and is believed to be keen to start working with the players as soon as possible. The club hopes him to present him on Saturday.</p>

<p>McClaren’s dismissal has been a matter of time since last Saturday’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/newcastle-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report" title="">home defeat by Bournemouth</a>, which left Newcastle second bottom of the table.</p>

<p>“After the defeat to Bournemouth on Saturday the club has spent some time considering its position and has today concluded that Steve McClaren’s employment with the club will end with immediate effect,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20160311/statement-from-managing-director-lee-charnley_2281670_5411363" title="">read a statement</a> on the club’s website.</p>

<p>“We acknowledge that reaching this decision has taken a number of days and that this has caused uncertainty for everyone involved, in particular for Steve and the players, for which we apologise. However, we felt that this time was necessary to ensure the right decisions were reached with the best interests of the club at heart.”</p>

<p>The club’s managing director, Lee Charnley, said: “I would like to thank Steve personally for his services to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/newcastleunited">Newcastle United</a>. He is a man of integrity and class and he has conducted himself with great dignity during this difficult time.</p>

<p>“Steve worked tirelessly to try and bring success to Newcastle United. He has the utmost respect of all the players, staff and management and he leaves with our very best wishes and sincere thanks.</p>

<p>“We feel that a change is now needed in order to give the club the best possible chance of securing its Premier League future. A further announcement on a successor to Steve will be made in due course.”</p>

<p>McClaren, appointed in the summer to replace John Carver, has overseen only two wins from Newcastle’s past 12 league matches and despite insisting he would “fight on” in the wake of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/newcastle-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report" title="">the abject 3-1 defeat by Bournemouth</a>, the club’s owner, Mike Ashley, and Charnley, have acted in an attempt to stave off relegation.</p>

<p>Benítez is not used to taking on the task of saving a team from the drop but has been keen to return to the Premier League, where he has worked with Liverpool and more recently with Chelsea, who appointed him as interim manager after the dismissal of Roberto Di Matteo in 2012. He won the Europa League with Chelsea before leaving to take charge of Napoli.</p>

<p>His most recent coaching job, at Real Madrid, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/04/rafael-benitez-sacked-real-madrid-manager-zinedine-zidane" title="">ended unhappily in January</a> after seven months. He was sacked and replaced by Zinedine Zidane, with the club third in La Liga. Madrid suffered a humiliating <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/21/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report" title="">4-0 home defeat by Barcelona</a> on his watch.</p>

<p>Benítez won an FA Cup and Champions League during his time in charge of Liverpool.</p>

<p>McClaren’s refusal to quit prompted a number of calls for Ashley to take action, including from the former owner Sir John Hall – from whom Ashley bought his controlling stake in the club in 2007.</p>

<p>On Sunday Hall told BBC 5 Live’s Sportsweek programme: “Ashley’s got to step back, it’s his responsibility, he has put the cash in, and it hasn’t happened. So he’s got to put a rescue plan in. I would be inclined to say to the manager ‘It’s time to go’ and bring somebody else in.”</p>

<p>McClaren was subjected to a torrent of abuse from the stands at St James’ Park last Saturday, and one supporter hurled his season ticket on to the roof of the dugout as he walked out in disgust. The defeat left Newcastle on 24 points, level with 18th-placed Norwich and one behind Sunderland, who are 17th, although the Magpies do have a game in hand.</p>

<p>Newcastle’s next match is on Monday, at the league leaders, Leicester City. That is followed by a derby at home to Sunderland a week on Sunday.</p>

If he had a bit of loyalty he'd have been in charge of derby in the prem most likely, stayed up or gone down he'd be a hero but now he is a zero for derby and Newcastle

It's not a question as to whether Swansea will get relegated but rather whether or not Newcastle can get three points when they play them.

Benitez turning out some weird kind of expert for dysfunctional clubs could be Newcastle's best bet of survival though. Which in itself probably says a lot.

Sunderland fans are in no position to gloat. They shielded a criminal in their squad because they valued a few extra points over the potential damage to the club's reputation. The board acted horrendously. And they have that overpaid chancer managing the team. Yes, he may well keep you up, but who'd pay to watch an Allardyce team hoof it 60 yards upfield every time they get the ball?

Hear hear. what an embarrassment these clowns are. No shame at all, just barefaced lies and the typical meaningless corporate platitudes. I really feel for Newcastle fans. Their fight is our fight; this shambles could happen to any of our clubs.

That struck me as a poor choice of words, too. Those characteristics have been sorely lacking from the club's hierarchy so we can add blatant hypocrisy to the charge sheet for these classless goons wrecking a much-loved footballing institution.

I just put the league cup in as it was a bit more prestigious 30 odd hears ago.The key word I used was winning. Actually having your name on a cup.Even the glory days of finishing second and being runners up and everyone's favourite losers are nearly 20 years ago. No not a big club by my definition.Nearly men 20 yrs ago. No where near men at the moment.

Hmm when I read it his deal hadn't been confirmed, and it suggested they were mulling over a 10 match offer, which is now a clause apparently. Thanks for the toss pot comment though.

I thin Newcastle have just enough about them to stay up if Rafa can organise them sufficiently and light a fire under them. My beloved Spurs have them on the last day of the season. Picture the scenario - Newcastle need a win to stay up, Tottenham need 3 points for the title (I can dream yeah?!) could be a cracker!

Harsh on Swansea. They made the right call in bringing in Guidolin when Monk wasn't working out. He's got them playing a lot better. They've got a healthy lead over Sunderland (33 vs. 25). Can't see how they'll get dragged into it.

What on earth they are thinking sniffing around Benitez, if he is interested then sign him up on a proper contract. Relegation or not, he's a class above other prospects.

Nufc has the same affliction that my club safc has' it's crappily run. Until you do something about the owner and board, who are clueless, you're really only trying not to go down. Benitez may give them a bounce in the short term but if we beat them again shortly then the bloke is under massive pressure straight away.

By your own definition, here goes;What is your definition of "A Big Club"Mine would include winning a major honour in the last 30 years or even 40 at a push.League Cup - really? FA cupPremiership/1st division (old style)EUFA/EuropaChamps League/ European CupAnd also being regular challengers for these honours in recent yearsWell in the period 1994 - 2005 we were involved in European competition in no fewer than 10 out of 11 seasons. We also reached the FA Cup final twice (losing to the league champions on both occasions),two further FA Cup Semi finals, the UEFA Cup semi final, finished 2nd in the league twice, though admittedly only truly challenging the first time, with 2 further top four finishes. I'm sure this fares pretty well against all but the most established clubs.You could include having a National team players in the squad or sought after name players.We had numerous international players over the past 3 decades, many of whom I'm sure you will have heard of. At the present time, maybe less so, but England capped players in Shelvey and Townsend, Dutch internationals Krul, Janmaat and Wijnaldum and French regular Sissoko. A manager who has won honours across Europe and could potentially bring further success.Champions League winner Benitez not big enough?
