Golden Goal: Troy Deeney for Watford v Leicester (2013)

<p>“<em>When I’m older I can look back on it. Even though we went on to lose to Crystal Palace in the final, the fans still have that day.… That goal does prove that it’s never done until it’s done.

It’s why we love it, for moments like tha</em><em>t” – Troy Deeney in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://talesfrom.com/watford/">Tales From The Vicarage</a>.</em></p>

<p>Troy Deeney wasn’t in the Watford team at the start of the 2012-13 season. Not because of poor form or injury but because he was in prison, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18584603">sentenced to 10 months inside</a> for attacking, along with his brother and two friends, a group of students in Birmingham. One of the victims had his jaw broken, another needed 20 stitches and the judge described the incident as a “gratuitous beating”. He was released after serving half his sentence, and made his first appearance in September. In May, he scored probably the most dramatic goal in Watford’s history.</p>

<p>A few twists of fate – or, if you prefer, results in football matches – meant Watford and Leicester very nearly didn’t meet at all <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/12/watford-leicester-city-championship-play-off">in the 2013 Championship play-offs</a>. On the final day of the “regular” season Watford faced Leeds United, knowing that if they won and Hull did not then they would claim automatic promotion. Hull did their bit, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/04/hull-city-cardiff-city-championship">drawing 2-2 at home to a Cardiff City</a> side who had already sauntered away with the league title, but Watford could not manage the win <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/04/watford-leeds-united">in a game that was nearly as frantic as the play-offs</a>. In the first half, the keeper Jonathan Bond (only in the team because Manuel Almunia had hurt himself in the warm-up) collided with Ikechi Anya and was taken off on a stretcher, brace around neck and oxygen administered. His replacement, 19-year-old Jack Bonham, was at least partly at fault for both Leeds goals, the second of which was a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTLiagk86oA">Ross McCormack lob that condemned Watford to a 2-1 defeat</a>. Meanwhile Leicester, who suffered a spring collapse having been in the top six for most of the season, started the day in eighth place with only a vague chance of even making the play-offs. Needing to win at Nottingham Forest and for Bolton not to beat Blackpool, Leicester’s 90th-minute strike at the City Ground and the Trotters’ 2-2 draw allowed them to scrape into sixth. Given the way it all ended, Leicester’s late goalscorer that day, Anthony Knockaert, might have wished he hadn’t bothered. </p>

<p>And so, to the play-offs, home to giddying triumph and unrelenting despair. The first leg was a relatively tame affair by the standards of what was to come, David Nugent <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/09/leicester-city-watford-championship-playoff">giving Leicester a 1-0 win in a game they probably should have won by more</a>, particularly given that Deeney was suspended having been sent off in the Leeds game. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/12/watford-leicester-city-championship-play-off">The return</a> was of a much higher standard from the off, Watford taking the lead through a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://youtu.be/PutOqD4g8ao?t=6m20s">brilliant volley by Matej Vydra</a> which would have been the highlight of many other games. The tie was level for only four minutes, as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://youtu.be/PutOqD4g8ao?t=8m">Nugent popped up again</a>, nodding home from a corner having flummoxed his marker to make it 2-1 to the visitors on aggregate, only for Vydra, arguably the division’s best player that season, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://youtu.be/PutOqD4g8ao?t=21m35s">to draw Watford back level 20 minutes into the second half</a>, finishing neatly after a one-two with Deeney, which was the way it stayed until five minutes into injury-time, with extra-time seemingly a certainty. </p>

<p>You don’t get a lot of time to think in football. When the whites of the goalposts loom, there is scant chance to coolly weigh everything up, consider the pros and cons, then carefully decide on the best course of action. You especially don’t generally consider the potential consequences. So when Knockeart drove into the penalty area with 95 minutes on the clock, at best he may have foreseen glory, being chaired off the pitch held high as a hero, Wembley and the Premier League. </p>

<p>Knockeart, having clearly expended all his upper body strength getting past Matthew Briggs outside the area, suddenly suffered an unfortunately timed moment of weakness when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://youtu.be/PutOqD4g8ao?t=33m5s">Marco Cassetti’s hand rested on his shoulder,</a> and the winger’s neck yanked back like an excited dog trying to escape its lead. He was not Leicester’s regular penalty taker, and the only two spot-kicks the side had scored that season had been converted by Nugent and Chris Wood. (As an aside, Wood was off the pitch at the time, having been replaced by one Harry Kane, on loan from Spurs, who had shared the bench that day with Jamie Vardy – that’s 35 2015-16 Premier League goals unable to get a start for a Championship team in 2013). There seemed little debate about whether Knockeart would be taking this one though: he grabbed the ball, went through what looked like an elaborate repertoire of breathing exercises and had on his face the look of a man about to void his stomach all over the Vicarage Road turf.</p>

<p>He managed to keep his pre-match pasta down, but if he had just vomited and given the penalty to someone else, he might ultimately have felt happier. Knockaert hit a weak shot straight down the middle – Almunia saved with his feet but pushed the ball straight back to the Leicester man. Not learning his lesson, Knockaert tried to dink the ball over the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/watford">Watford</a> goalkeeper, rather than putting his foot through it, and it was saved again. “I was so relaxed out there,” Almunia said afterwards. “I guessed the direction the penalty was going, saw the ball dropping in front of me and turned.” And then all hell broke loose.</p>

<p>“As soon as Manuel saved the penalty I knew we were going to score,” said Deeney after the game. Cassetti hoofed the ball clear with no real intention of starting an attack, more to just get the thing as far away from the Watford goal as possible. Anya brought the ball down with a touch that would have made Dimitar Berbatov raise his eyebrows in appreciation, and hared off down the right wing, speeding past Andy King like Super Mario on a power boost. It is at moments like this that you realise how differently the brains of sportspeople are wired, because in such a frantic situation all logic would leave the heads of most, but Anya had the presence of mind to halt his jet-heeled run and play a short pass to Fernando Forestieri ahead of him.</p>

<p>The Italian took one touch to shift into a crossing position, another to create a little more space as Jeffrey Schlupp attempted to jockey him, then clipped a looping cross to the back post. Waiting, unmarked, was the defensive midfielder Jonathan Hogg, who had been dropped to the bench for the game as the Watford manager Gianfranco Zola sought more attacking intent but came on when the coach realised more control in the middle would be useful. Hogg played 38 times that season but had not scored a goal and so, finding himself unmarked six yards out and even with a tricky angle and a ball with no great pace on it, you’d forgive him for going for glory. “I saw Kasper Schmeichel jump in a big star shape with his arms and legs out,” Hogg said in Lionel Birnie’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lionelbirnie.com/content/tales-from">Tales From The Vicarage</a>. “I saw a defender run to cover the line and in that split-second I thought: ‘It’s got to be a hell of a header to get over the keeper and over the defender.’ I heard Troy screaming at me so, being the unselfish man I am, I let him take all the glory!”</p>

<p>His header back was nicely cushioned and Deeney – who had really only ambled into the attack as if he knew where he would need to be and when, so realised there was little point in hurrying – called off Vydra with some gusto and tried to arrange his body into the correct position to strike a bouncing ball. “There were five or six Leicester players there in and around the box but they were in shock,” said Deeney. “It was kind of six v six and naturally the defenders were trying to cover the goal, so they ran in, which left me with a bit of space.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/dec/05/sp-golden-goal-fabio-grosso-italy-germany-2006">Golden goal: Fabio Grosso for Italy v Germany (2006) | Nick Miller</a> </p>

<p> These are the sort of situations in which time slows down. There was only the briefest of moments between Hogg’s header and Deeney’s strike, but it seemed to take hours. “I just wanted to keep it from going over,” Deeney <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0993238106?keywords=tales%20from%20the%20vicarage%204&amp;qid=1456160036&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">told Birnie</a>. “I wanted to keep it down and on target. It was kind of like a free shot because if I missed, we still had extra time.”</p>

<p>He did not miss. “There was no way I was placing it – if the keeper had saved it he was ending up in the goal as well,” Deeney told the press after the game. As the ball struck the net Schlupp, on the floor having tried to block the cross, appeared to be in the utmost despair and was matched (and then some) by Knockaert, who again looked like gastric pyrotechnics were imminent. “Anthony is distraught as you would expect,” said the Leicester manager Nigel Pearson. “Unfortunately that’s the nature of the beast.” Not long after the game, Knockeart apologised on Twitter: “I’m really sorry for the fans to Leicester. I’m very sad for everyone. Thank you very for you support all the season. I LOVE LEICESTER.”</p>

<p>After the final whistle there was a surreal and even more cruel scene as the Leicester players were forced to stay on the pitch long after the game had ended, raucous celebrations occurring around them. The Watford fans flooded onto the pitch, and while they were kept to the Rookery Stand half by stewards, this blocked off the route to the tunnel, meaning Knockeart and his team-mates were forced to wait for the undulating ecstasy to subside. </p>

<p>After the goal, as hell was breaking loose on the pitch, so it was among the commentators. “DDDDEEEEEENNNNNEEEEEEEEYYYYY!!!!” bellowed Sky’s commentator Bill Leslie, encouraging us not to “scratch our eyes”, but his contribution was matched by Johnny Phillips, the reporter for Sky Sports News who had the unenviable task of describing what had just happened to people who couldn’t see it. Phillips was reduced to screaming incredulity, just about managing to get out that Deeney had put the ball into the net, but like everyone else he was rather overcome by the moment. “You’re encouraged to ‘colour’ the game, but I wouldn’t say you’re encouraged to lose it as I managed to do,” says Phillips, who wrote a book about covering football for Soccer Saturday, called <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1909125105?keywords=johnny%20phillips&amp;qid=1453828888&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">Saturday Afternoon Fever</a>. “The problem I had was that I started off pretty excited with the penalty save itself – if Leicester had scored that they were through in really controversial circumstances, so when they came to me I was already a bit high-pitched, so I had nowhere left to go really. It was all chaos behind me – I think there were flares going off, pitch invasions and all that, so it didn’t look too out of context.” The BBC Three Counties radio commentary was even more frantic, so much so that it’s completely pointless trying to do it justice by explaining it: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/22512064">have a listen yourself</a>.</p>

<p> Deeney ran straight to his family in the crowd, dispensing with his shirt on the way. “The euphoria came over me,” Deeney told Birnie. “I was in prison and it didn’t look like I was even going to come back and play. I had my family there, my brother, my friends. As soon as I scored, I didn’t see anyone else – I just saw where they were and ran to them. They had the same mentality as me. As soon as I scored they thought: ‘We’re going to him.’ They’re climbing towards the seats and I jump over the advertising boards. I didn’t realise how big a gap there was behind there, so it’s a good job my brother caught me. I was totally caught up in the moment.”</p>

<p> For Deeney this was of course particularly extraordinary and about more than merely the goal. His father had died the previous May, a few weeks after the striker had been sent to prison, and anyone wishing to advocate the rehabilitative nature of incarceration could use Deeney as a poster boy. “I’m not going to say I’m thankful [for being jailed],” he <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/26/watford-troy-deeney">told the Guardian before the final</a>, “but I’m glad that I got to see the opposite end of the scale. I have grown up massively. I nearly went broke so that was a massive thing as well. I save money and stuff now, I don’t drink. It is a case of making sure that my partner and my son never have to go through all the stress they went through, because when I went away nobody saw what they had to deal with because all the bills still come through and I wasn’t getting paid so she had to cope with all that.”</p>

<p>On the sidelines, Zola discovered the perils of the slick-bottomed shoe on grass as he hared down the touchline in celebration and tumbled to the floor as he tried to corner at speed. “I lost it,” he said afterwards. “I don’t know whether I was chasing Troy or what, but I just felt the ground going. I said to myself that I had to be composed and respectful but you can’t control the passion … I didn’t know what I was doing, I felt the ground slip from under me and I’ve probably pulled something, but it’s OK, I can’t feel it now. That’s the passion, that’s why we love this game.”</p>

<p>Watford would go on to<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/27/crystal-palace-promoted-premier-league-kevin-phillips"> lose the final to Crystal Palace</a>, but in some respects that hardly mattered. Just look at what those involved say about it. “I’ve never felt anything like it in my whole career – not even when I scored in the Champions League for Roma,” said Cassetti, while Hogg said it was “definitely, by a long chalk, the best thing I’ve experienced in my life”. “I looked at the faces of my team-mates afterwards and there are not many things that can make you feel this way,” said Almunia. </p>

<p>A goal like that is a once in a generation thing, impossible to beat for a moment of joy and catharsis, and surely worth more than a mere place in the Premier League. Ripping off your shirt, falling over in sheer joy, better than the Champions League. What else could you possibly ask for?</p>

Yep. As the first season of the Pozzos' reign we went through fucking loads of players (remember Neuton? Steve Leo Beleck? Geoffrey Mujangi Bia?!) but the ones who made the effort to throw themselves into it and properly integrated themselves into the town (Forestieri, Pudil, Battochio, Vydra, Ekstrand, Abdi...) ensured we'll never forget them. Love them all. And Cassetti! What a guy. Pure class.

As a Watford fan of nearly forty years I can say, hand on heart, this is my favourite moment in football. I watched it on TV that day and I can still hear the commentator in my head, it's like football commentary ear worm: "Now here come Watford. Forestieri. Here's Hogg. DEEEEEENEEEEEEY!

That pass by Marco, though. Naturally, the Deeney Moment is an astonishing example of everything primal for which we love, and are addicted to; football - but Cassetti's ball over the top to Vydra, played with the perfect trajectory and velocity with what must have been the very outside of his right little toe is everything beautiful which can be found in football. It genuinely leaves me baffled now when I see it. Had Cantona played that pass, it would be endlessly replayed and held aloft by all.

I can still see the look on my son's face when he turned to me after Deeney's goal, "Dad, can I go onto the pitch?" Like he was going to ,listen to anything I said.

I agree with this. We'd been pretty good, but slightly inconsistent for two thirds of the season, before the collapse saw us scraping into the play-offs with our own dramatic moment at Forest.

I meant that they'd spent so much already. That promotion winning squad still held a lot of £1mil+ signings- it's not as if they were all shipped out. Even Vardy at the time seemed crazy money.

A painful moment for us Leicester fans, but I feel a real 'Sliding Doors' moment. Go back and erase this and we might well lose the spirit we have now that overcomes adversity. This moment was the catalyst for the next season in which we won the league. I believe our 'Great Escape' of last year was also somehow linked to this moment and that escape is informing the miracle we are seeing now.

Worth pointing out that this actually turned out to be a good thing for Leicester. We'd have won the final v Palace and if we'd have gone up that season there's no way we would have been able to stay up with that team. Pearson picked them up off the floor after this and got another season to develop the team. We ran off with the league title, taking 4 points off Watford and winning 0-3 at Vicarage Road along the way, and were in a better position to stay up once promoted. Watford shed twice as many tears as we did that day in losing the final in limp fashion, before waiting another two seasons to go up.

Not really true. We spent a lot of money under Sven but this all proved counter-productive in the end. Pearson's remit 2nd time round was to clear out the overpaid rubbish so we could comply with FFP, and improve the team.

agree with your last sentence totally. I didn't see this one live but did have the pleasure, as a neutral, of watching Merson's live coverage of Aguero's last minute winner for City in 2012 on Soccer Saturday and just chuckling away to myself on my couch falling in love with football all over again, even more ironic as i didn't really want them to win the title
