Manchester United’s Anfield surrender exposed club’s identity crisis

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">N</span></span>orman Whiteside scored in two FA Cup finals before his 21st birthday, the second a glorious winner to deny Everton a treble. He is the youngest person to play in a World Cup and hit an awesome winning goal in an FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at the age of 17. Yet when he meets <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> fans, they do not want to talk about those achievements. All they want to discuss is the Norman conquest of Anfield.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/liverpool-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report">Liverpool’s Sturridge and Firmino make feeble Manchester United pay</a> </p>

<p>In April 1988 United were 3-1 down with 10 men against possibly Liverpool’s greatest side when Whiteside came on as substitute. He roamed the green with vigilante intent, hoofing Liverpool all round Anfield and inspiring an improbable 3-3 draw. The game meant nothing in the grand scheme – Liverpool were running away with the title – but then <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/manchester-united-liverpool-europe-sir-alex-ferguson" title="">Liverpool v Manchester United fixtures</a> have always been a competition of their own, with an intensity that makes the phrase “bragging rights” seem far too frivolous.</p>

<p>After that match in 1988 Alex Ferguson said that teams left Anfield “choking on the vomit”, an early indication of his loathing for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a>. For both clubs the fixture has always been a crystal-clear window into the soul – the result is all important but the way it comes about is often more revealing.</p>

<p>In 1992, when United blew their chance to win the title for the first time in 25 years, their failure was confirmed by a painful 2-0 defeat at Anfield, in which Ian Rush finally scored his first goal against United. But the way in which they raged against the dying of the light – they hit the woodwork three times and Bryan Robson and Paul Ince played the full match despite being nowhere near fit – showed that the long-term was nothing to worry about. When a Liverpool player shouted “Fuck you!” at Ferguson after the game, he had even greater reason to come back stronger.</p>

<p>Louis van Gaal won his first four fixtures against Liverpool but in only one of those games – the slick <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/22/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report" title="">2-1 win at Anfield last season</a> – did United hint that they might be going somewhere. That was part of a surreal month period in which they also thrashed Spurs and Manchester City but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/liverpool-manchester-united-europa-league-match-report" title="">Thursday’s compliant defeat</a> was far more indicative of the club’s health.</p>

<p>Before the match Jürgen Klopp <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manchester-united-europa-league" title="">called it “the mother of all games”</a>. United played as if the fixture was the third cousin on their mother’s side, twice removed. Van Gaal is culpable but so are hundreds of others. This was the logical conclusion of an erosion in standards and values that gathered pace when the Glazers bought the club in 2005 and accelerated further when Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.</p>

<p>The shabby manner in which David Moyes was sacked in 2014 is the best example that the problem is as significant off the field as on it. Van Gaal, a once brilliant manager who is past his best, deserves better than to be openly ridiculed. And to blame him exclusively is grossly to oversimplify a complicated story of compromise, politics and self-interest.</p>

<p>For United surrendering at Anfield is the most unthinkable thing of all. Or at least it was. The game stirred passion to such an extent that Ferguson <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/1263874.stm" title="">once sacked Peter Schmeichel over a row</a> that started because he thought Schmeichel’s goalkicks were too straight. The club’s identity has changed so much in the last decade that things such as Whiteside’s rampage and Gary Neville celebrating a last-minute winner in front of the Liverpool fans in 2006 feel like something from a bygone age. “The punishment was a joke,” said Neville of the fine he received as a result, “but I’d pay the money again and again to have that feeling.”</p>

<p>It is a feeling that many modern players would not understand. To some extent this comes from the manager, who prefers robots to humans, but there were far worse defeats at Anfield under Ferguson, the greatest manager of all. That included a 3-1 defeat in 2001 so appalling that Ferguson broke the habit of a lifetime and publicly criticised his players. “Maybe they have been here too long and take success for granted,” he said. “Liverpool worked harder than us.” There was an even tamer surrender at the Etihad in the title decider of 2011-12, when a muted United did not have a shot on target.</p>

<p>The difference is that, under Ferguson, such performances were generally the season’s exception rather than the rule. It is better to have one obvious nadir than umpteen contenders. United’s display on Thursday night was not surprising, never mind shocking. The players they have are not very good. They are also far too nice and bear no resemblance to perfectionist winners such as Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Roy Keane, a man whose game face should have been a modernist painting entitled ‘Standards’.</p>

<p>Those players cared about the club they played for, something that is less common these days. It would be easy and entirely wrong to blame this on the reduction in British players, as Luis Suárez, Rafael da Silva and Pablo Zabaleta have shown in recent years. It was Rafael, a Brazilian full-back, who single-handedly defended United’s honour against City and Liverpool by picking fights with Carlos Tevez, Lucas, Martin Skrtel and others.</p>

<p>The problem is not unique to United; it is simply more acute because of what went before. There is no easy fix because the world has changed: football is a mercenary industry for players and managers, and masculinity has changed enormously in the 21st century. The strong, silent type is an endangered species, and Steve Archibald’s comment about team spirit being an illusion glimpsed in the aftermath of victory looks truer by the year.</p>

<p>The identity of a club comes primarily from the manager, so having somebody who stays for more than a couple of years would help. That does not necessarily preclude José Mourinho, who it is said has long planned to build a legacy at United in the final 10 years of his career.</p>

<p>There are obvious risks in United hiring Mourinho but the risks are even greater for him. A humongous repair job needs to be done on and off the field, just as when Ferguson came to the club. Not even a specialist in success such as Mourinho comes with a guarantee of trophies this time. But when it comes to restoring United’s identity, he does have at least one thing going for him: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/29/chelsea-liverpool-field-notes-rivalry" title="">he really cannot stand Liverpool</a>.</p>

Under Ferguson Utd were a team to be feared, not least because of the class of '92. They played like they cared, they played like they couldn't stand the prospect of defeat - barring the ever mercurial Berbatov. But over the last four, maybe five years, the team looks like they are simply taking a wage. The blood and venom is gone from them. They look callow, lacklustre, impartial.

In recent times the most glorious days were about the time Gary Neville was at his best. Of course there were others. I am old enough to remember going home from school and seeing people queuing in the dark evening streets of Manchester with the awful news of Munich. So many young boys; and Duncan Edwards battling on for days. And our own Frank Swift too. But things have changed dramatically with the TV money and the big investors. Clubs may find it hard to control whom they get as buyers; but the Glazers have been poor for ManUtd and that remains a huge hindrance. For all the criticism the City investors have done much good and at its best this team is brilliant.

Mourinho is not a pragmatist. His Real Madrid team played devastating, counter attacking pinpoint football against Barcelona. He was the first to try counter attacking against Guardiola after realising that was the only way to beat that bald headed prick. Ancelotti copied his style against Guardiola's Bayern Munich in the Championship League where Real were rampant. Whilst Ancelotti would have been the best solution for United, he won't be available for the next 3 years or so and the only viable option to fight Guardiola is Mourinho. No more softness and lack of ambition (like Moyes and Van Hoof), what is needed at United is steely determination and the stomach to fight to the very end. Man Utd is one of the biggest job in football and I doubt that Mourinho would be foolish enough to screw this one when he knows that he can make it his last job in club football. Just one more thing is needed...ban Gill, Ferguson and Charlton from interfering in the club's affairs (like Shankly at Liverpool) and leave the Devil to do his work at Old Trafford in peace.

United is bound to be back with the new fair play financial rules that guarantee that no English team will ever be able to challenge them for transfers like City and Chelsea did with their sugardaddy owners. And I am an Arsenal fan saying this. But that being said even a super club can have a very long sojourn in the wilderness like Liverpool or Arsenal's recent slump. Ferguson winning his last title with the team that next year got Moyes fired shows how huge the right manager is in sports. So while I am enjoying each and every loss at the Evil Empire, I know eventually they will find the right coach, probably Jose and be back to winning things again. They just have to find the right manager, with their revenues and money they will always be able to get enough talent to win if they have the right manager guiding the ship.

Two steps forward, then three steps back is what United seem like at the moment. But then the whole of the Premiership is not really up to scratch for competing in Europe. No good being a biggish fish in a small pond, the seagulls of Europe will come round and eat your sardines, to quote, or possibly misquote an ex United player.

Boasting you won it five times is really embarrassing. Of course Ferguson under achieved in Europe and would like to have won more but then he was up against much better teams in his era, stellar teams like perhaps the greatest Barcelona side of all time. Liverpool have won fuck all for decades, not even the Premier League, and in European terms these days they are minnows behind the likes of Real Madrid, Barca, Bayern etc. It is highly likely Liverpool will never get there again.

It is easy to criticise the manager, and he rightly deserves some blame for the way he has let some top notch players go and spent 300 mil on some who are simply not up to scratch. Above all it is the players who have to take responsibility, and especially the older players need to show some leadership. The indomitable spirit of the likes of Keane, Cantona, Neville, Robson, Scholes, Beckham, Cantona and many many more have set a standard, but now there is no one that demonstrates that. Simply put if you step over that line in a United shirt then you should be prepared to fight, for everything, for every ball, for every pass, for every throw in. I don't think I would be wrong in saying that the spirit of United (and perhaps Ferguson) , the sheer fighting spirit, the never say die attitude is what attracted many of their supporters but what we are seeing now is a disgrace to the memory of that, a fucking disgrace. Everyone (bar the goalkeeper) should hang their head in shame for that performance, everyone.

A sound analysis, though maybe too positive an assessment. Martial looks like a potentially great player and Carrick and Rooney have had excellent careers but their best days are gone. Mata is a fine player but has limited influence and intensity. Not sure about the 'youngsters': Varela and Lingard are already 22 and don't look like top quality to me. United has wasted a huge sum of money over the past 2 years and got very little in return. Need a new spine so figure on spending another 120m on that in today's market.
