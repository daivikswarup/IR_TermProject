<p>Nicolás Gaitán and Talisca scored in the last five minutes to give Benfica a dramatic 2-1 win at <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/zenitstpetersburg">Zenit St Petersburg</a> which sent them into the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/benfica">Benfica</a>, leading 1-0 from the first leg of the last-16 tie and fielding a makeshift defence, fell behind in the 69th minute to a Zenit goal scored by the Brazilian striker Hulk.</p>

<p>With Zenit pressing for a second, however, Benfica snatched an 85th-minute equaliser when Gaitán was first to react after Raúl Jiménez’s long-range drive hit the bar and he headed in from the rebound.</p>

<p>The substitute Talisca scored with the last kick of the game to leave Zenit waiting for their first ever quarter-final place. Benfica, twice European champions, reached the last eight for the first time since 2012.</p>

<p>The first hour was a cagey affair with few chances, although Benfica nearly snatched an away goal in the fourth minute when Jonas’s curling free-kick was tipped over the bar by Yuri Lodygin.</p>

<p>Zenit came to life after a double substitution by André Villas-Boas just before the hour and immediately created chances. They went ahead in the 69th minute after Yuri Zhirkov, who appeared to foul Nelson Semedo, broke down the left and crossed into the middle where Hulk, who up to that point had had a dismal game, headed in.</p>

<p>Lodygin saved Zenit when he brilliantly turned away Victor Lindelhof’s header but Benfica were on the ropes and Zenit nearly grabbed a second when goal when Artem Dzyuba ran through the middle of the Benfica defence but his shot was blocked by Ederson.</p>

<p>Gaitán’s goal would have been enough for Benfica to advance but the visitors completed a 3-1 aggregate win six minutes into added time when Gaitán burst forward and a lucky bounce presented Talisca with a chance which the Brazilian crashed home in style.</p>

Let me guess, Zenit played a game in which they stifled the life out of their opponents and then attempted to nick a win with a counter punch goal?

Dzyuba did a Ronaldinho there!!!!!Beating a bunch of players on his own only to mess up the shot.Had he passed it at the end of that run instead of shooting,it would have been a goal.Great match though.It'll be a surprise to many that despite not being European "elites",these teams can still play exciting football.

Gaitan's been linked with Man Utd since Ferguson was manager. I think English clubs generally don't trust the Portuguese market due to its propensity to produce players with incredible stats who promptly fail or underachieve as soon as they leave for huge sums of money. Jardel, Postiga, Quaresma, Jackson, Carlos Alberto, Mangala, Javi Garcia. Sure there are successes as well (Ronaldo, Falcao, Bruno Alves etc) but generally the Portuguese market and its incredibly convoluted network of third-party ownerships have been fleecing the world for ages and it puts off people.

Benfica are a Wonderful Club and team; I always like watching them the few occasions I've caught their matches on CL highlights and pains me to see them often dumped into the Europa.

Yeah, you're right... also, realistically I'd expect Wolfsburg to be the one to go through, and we can't have that, now, can we? So let's just wait & see how it all pans out. (After all, Atleti didn't work out all that bad, and who would have predicted that?)

Don't be like Zyryanov of Zenit! He was sure he could beat Benfica in the tie... and look what happened.

I was about to post the same. More. Likely to do so in the Europa League though.. Barca and Bayern are just too strong...

- Mister, you know, that you have an old score to settle with "Anderlecht". You met with the team even 26 years ago, heading Bucharest "Dynamo", they lost in the semi-final of the Cup Winners' Cup. If we compare the great "Anderlecht" 1980-1990-ies and the current team, in whose favor will be a comparison?Read!

I may have been born in London but coming from a Portuguese family background I'd love to see another Portuguese team win it. All we got is Mourinho's back to back UEFA Cup and Champions League back when I was 11, Guttman's Benfica, AVB's Europa League with Porto, and the Porto team that won it in the 80s.

A well-deserved win, even with a makeshift defense (although Linderlöf and Everson are turning out to be quite good) and the clear foul the referee didn't see when Zenit's scored. And watching Villas-Boas almost crying is as good as winning.

Gaitan is worth 25~30 million honestly.Sanchez is a real prospect considering his age (18) but too early to know if he'll keep this level of perfomances. Here's another one to keep an eye on...Nelson Semedo (RCB).

Força Portugal. Not a Benficista but may the spirit of 04 be with you. Would love to see a Portuguese team win the big one again.
