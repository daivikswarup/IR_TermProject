Yohan Cabaye penalty eases Crystal Palace past Reading in FA Cup




DateTime::::2016-03-11T22:08:25+0000



<p>Crystal Palace can thrill at the prospect of a trip to Wembley. A team who have been rudderless of late in the top-flight edged into only the fourth FA Cup semi-final in club history at Reading’s expense here, all that frustration at the concession of a late penalty which was so costly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/07/crystal-palace-damien-delaney-spell-liverpool" title="">at home to Liverpool last Sunday</a> eased by the manic celebrations of one of their own. This side’s fortunes have fluctuated wildly within a matter of days.</p>

<p>A tight contest had been drifting towards a replay, the visitors’ pressure frustrated by Ali al-Habsi’s brilliance in the home goal, when their hosts finally cracked to reward Palace’s relentless pursuit of progress. Jake Cooper was the fall guy, pulling Yannick Bolasie with his right hand as a ball was looped back optimistically through the middle, which Habsi might otherwise have hoped to claim. There was some contact as the centre-half stepped across the winger, just as there had been when Damien Delaney’s left knee touched Christian Benteke’s heel last weekend. Cooper duly trudged off at the flash of a second yellow card.</p>

<p>The award was put to Alan Pardew, a player at this club on their only appearance in an <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/fa-cup">FA Cup</a> final back in 1990, in the aftermath. “I don’t really think you should ask me because, obviously, I ain’t got a clue about penalties after last weekend,” he offered. “But I’d said to my players that, having defended Damo and [criticised] that decision so publicly, if they did go down they had to be very sure they’d been impeded.” His opposite number, Brian McDermott, did not sound entirely convinced by Bolasie’s eager tumble, but acknowledged his own player had “raised his arm”. It said much about Habsi’s inspired display that he still mustered a hand to Yohan Cabaye’s spot-kick, thumped down the middle, but could not keep it out.</p>

<p>That the visitors put gloss on the victory with a second in stoppage time, the substitute Fraizer Campbell converting from virtually on the goal-line after Habsi had pushed his initial attempt on to a post, at least reflected their overall dominance even if the Omani deserved better. The 34-year-old, an unused substitute when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/11/manchester-city-wigan-athletic-fa-cup" title="">Wigan hoisted this trophy in 2013</a>, was magnificent in holding Palace at bay until four minutes from time. If he had done well to thwart Cabaye’s first-half free-kick and suffocate attempts from Emmanuel Adebayor and Bolasie, the reaction save to deny Mile Jedinak the opener 10 minutes into the second period defied belief.</p>

<p>The goalkeeper had somehow thrust out a left hand to paw away the Australian’s emphatic header, and would repeat his trick on another Cabaye set-play while the tie remained goalless. Elimination felt cruel on a player described by his manager simply as “an outstanding human being”. Pardew, pacing his technical area in frustration as his team huffed and puffed but could find no way through – the story of much of their campaign – might not have been quite so complimentary, so sick of the sight of the hosts’ No26 he must have been while the resistance held.</p>

<p>Even so, there was a vibrancy to Palace’s attacking here, albeit against a team ensconced in mid-table in the Championship, having slipped from joint fourth on Christmas Day to a potentially precarious position eight points shy of the cut-off. Wilfried Zaha, who riled the locals after clashing with Chris Gunter early in the second half, was outstanding, scything beyond an exposed Jordan Obita at will and galloping upfield in partnership with Bolasie. Adebayor needs a goal to restore confidence but there were glimpses again of his quality, while Cabaye looked more at ease than of late. In victory, the FA Cup can feel like a positive distraction once again.</p>

<p>Not that Palace had this all their own way. In Ola John, a Dutch winger who has swapped Benfica for Berkshire on a season-long arrangement, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/reading">Reading</a> posed a threat of their own who might have plundered where the visitors were so profligate.</p>

<p>He had already seen a shot deflected just wide when Wayne Hennessey horribly misjudged Hal Robson-Kanu’s in-swinging centre and, instead of allowing it to drift behind, merely knocked the ball down obligingly for John to collect. The goal gaped but, with Palace’s defenders helpless and aghast, the angle proved too tight for the forward to convert. His other opportunity had been squeezed out 14 minutes from time, amid Palace’s 15 corners and the hacked goal-line clearances summoned by Gunter and Stephen Quinn. Robson-Kanu’s centre bypassed the clutter in the six-yard box to reach John, unmarked at the far post, only for Hennessey to claw away a header that might have been better directed across goal. It was a smart stop, and one desperately needed by a goalkeeper whose own recent confidence has been rather battered. His reward was to see Palace’s pursuit finally yield reward in what time remained.</p>

<p>“I’m pleased for our fans who have suffered in our home games of late,” added Pardew, who had spent four years at Reading when cutting his teeth as a manager before an acrimonious switch to West Ham. “It’s great to see that end behind the goal happy with a semi-final to come. That brings an excitement we hope rubs off on our league form.”</p>

<p>They could be 16th and six points from the relegation zone by the time they next play but, for one night only, those concerns could wait. Palace can rejoice at the thought of Wembley.</p>

Yawn. Less than 10% of season ticket holders and club members have signed the petition (assuming that the signatories are actually part of CPFC). Always a few who can't or won't accept the decision.

That's a little hysterical, don't you think? He's not the only football manager (or fan) to only see faults when they go against his team. Are you so scathing with everyone? If so, you probably need to get out more.

Haha! Good one.Palace were the better team but they looked average and never felt they were going to score from open play (hence why Dean felt the need to give them a hand). If that's showing the gulf in leagues then quality in the prem has definitely dropped!The game just reminded me why I hated the prem - cheating players who can't stay on their feet and poor refs who constantly look to give the bigger teams a boost.

I think Pardew could do a lot worse than approaching Al Habsi and offering him a contract.

I don't think the passing is the problem. The likes of Emmanuel Adebayor need to get into better positions. In one notable incident Bolasie sprinted forward to the goal line and it was obvious from the tight pressure he was under that his cross would be shallow and into the six yard box, and sure enough it was. But where was Adebayor and his run? Yards back, no where near the cross when it came.

Oh Well....I was dreaming of another semi final this year. After the previous one was 1927.I do think McDermott should have shown a little more ambition and played a more attacking line up- it is the Cup and you only really have the one game to win dont you. I do understand why he played deep with this Palace side they have frightening pace and can move the ball very quickly and strike on the counter.Palace deliver the ball up front in record time and really can move the ball around with great fluidity, Gunter and Obita really were stuggling against Zaha but they lack bite on the final yards......they really need a consistent striker and I can see why they are struggling for goals. Despite Al Habsi making some fine saves, I never felt we were being given a knock out punch untill the penalty......if I am fair the better team won so I am not gripping about it. Cooper has to learn that if you body check a player in the modern game they are going to fall like a sack of potatoes......

Agreed. I was not that bothered about the result but when I saw that pen given, I switched off. And Lawro saying he shouldn't have touched him. Wanker. There are times when this game seems more like netball than football

It's these looney left referees, I have seen loads of idle, foreign defenders remaining oh the pitch. You can't dribble from one end of the pitch to other without seeing them everywhere. Sitting in groups around the area. Loitering like they own the place. It's penalty correctness gone mad!

The penalties for Liverpool and palace were both soft but it just shows the hypocritical Pardew up for the fraud he is.It also shows the TV interviewers up as the suckholes they are scared to ask questions.

Soft penalty, given by the linesman. As with sunday I've seen them waved off, but there was contact. Penalty karma for us perhaps, and personally I'd rather it happened this way round if it was going to happen.



Author::::MarkNoBull

I thought that Palace were actually fairly toothless up front for most of the match. Sure, they created chances, but you'd expect that to arise against a lower league team.

Don't I recall Robson-Kanu disgracing himself a few weeks ago by roughing up the penalty spot so Burnley would miss?



Author::::thisisanicknamelol
DateTime::::2016-03-12T07:04:45Z
The trouble is, if players don't exaggerate, there's a high chance the referees will miss the actual offence. In real-time, the tap of an ankle, clip of a shin or impeding of movement is less than a second. Only in some situations, like when a shirt is really tugged a way back, or if the defender has his arms all over the oponent and drags him down, is the duration of foul long enough for the offence to be conspicuous. A referee can have moments of eagle-eyedness, such that he can spot a slight offence, but usually only if it happens to meet his gaze. A ref would have to be attentive at every single flashpoint to catch every single offence and no human is that consistent without being assisted.

That was baby shit soft, no doubt. Both strikers dived -- they all do, so the issue now is whether or not there was enough contact to "warrant" the dive. I'd say Cooper (?) actually put his hands on Bolasie first, while it looks to me that Benteke dragged a leg to ensure contact. By those low standards, I'd say Delaney was a bit more unlucky than the Reading lad.

No, I don't think the dive warranted a yellow on Bolasie. There was the slightest of a touch. I think, and would hope, Dean would just have waved play on. But like you said Dean was in a position where he couldn't see how little contact there actually was. 



Author::::sailthedarkenedseas

He pretty much admitted it was a dive. Which it was.

It's all very well being honest and "innocent" when you're a lumbering 6'4 defender. The old 'should I go down when I surge into the box and feel the slightest touch' dilemma is not likely to be an issue for him.

No way any manager will criticize his best player after a rare boosting win following an epic slump in form. Doesn't make Pardew less ridiculous, but he dug himself a hole with his antics last game.
