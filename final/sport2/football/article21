<p>Gianluigi Buffon is three minutes away from equalling a 22-year record after Juventus beat <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/sassuolo">Sassuolo</a> 1-0 to move six points clear at the top of Serie A on Friday.</p>

<p>Paulo Dybala scored the only goal of an entertaining match as <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/juventus">Juventus</a> kept a 10th successive clean sheet in the league. Buffon has now not been beaten in Serie A in 926 minutes, the second-longest stretch in league history.</p>

<p>The unbeaten record in Serie A is held by Sebastiano Rossi, who kept a clean sheet for 929 consecutive minutes for AC Milan from 12 December 1993 to 27 February 1994, beating the previous mark set by the former <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/29/leonardo-bonucci-spotlight-inter-juventus-serie-a" title="">Juventus</a> goalkeeper Dino Zoff in 1972-73 by 26 minutes. Buffon can match Rossi’s record in next weekend’s derby match at Torino.</p>

<p>Sassuolo were the last team to beat Juventus in the league back on 28 October and the leaders, who have admitted that that defeat shook them out of their complacency, have won 18 and drawn one of 19 games since.</p>

<p>Dybala nearly got Juve off to a flying start with a vicious, dipping shot which Andrea Consigli tipped over the bar. Consigli also saved Alex Sandro’s header with his feet but Sassuolo, who are seventh on 44 points, missed the chance to go ahead when Alfred Duncan shot wide after 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Dybala showed him how it was done in the 36th minute when he curled the ball into the net off the inside of the post from 20 metres after Juan Cuadrado raced down the flank and laid the ball back to the Argentinian.</p>

<p>Juventus attacked relentlessly for the first hour but Sassuolo refused to lie down and put them under pressure in a tense finale.</p>

<p>Sansone was always dangerous, first testing Buffon with a snapshot and then breaking forward and nearly catching him out with a shot which the veteran struggled to parry.</p>

Yeah he wasn't a great goalkeeper but he was tall and good at saving penalties, and when you have players of the calibre of Baresi, Maldini, and Costacurta in front of you it certainly helps.

It is obvious that Dybala deserves to be a Barca player. Would be perfect for him to learn from the maestro himself.

I would say that he Rugani is not yet ready to be a first XI player, which is fine and understandable given who is in front of him and his inexperience at the top level. I trust Allegri in that Daniele will become a rock for club and country in the future. Now is not the time.

And a dream backline of Demichelis, Otamendi and Sergio Romero.

I'd go with the Shatner's Bassoon formation.

Lemina hasn't been included in the list [here].

Gianluigi Buffon is a legend whoever you support. It's only fitting that he will (probably) take this accolade from Rossi.

Amazing goal from Dybala, his left foot is gift from God. Buffon beats record, doing a couple not most difficult saves, but still. We continue the way to win in Series A. It is very good and important. And, of course, we wait game in wednesday. Will be fantastic match, I am sure. I looked rates from bookies and just laughed. 6,0 on passage of Juve in 1/4 (clean winning is 500 percents from amount) against 1,15 on passage of Bayern (like you understand, only 15 percents). We are dividing 500 on 15 and getting a little bit more then 33. In 33 times!!! I do not believe, that our chances are so low. Even after 2-2 in first game, even against Bayern on Allianz. It is just funny. Whence and why so huge difference?

I would love to see those XI with a 3-5-2.Unfortunately ALLERGY may have this 4-4-2 in mind:BuffonLich, barza, bono, sandroCuadrado, khedira, marchisio, pogbaDybala, manzoThe only variation from the first leg would be sandro in for evra. Still pogba would be wasted on the left.

I think you're right about Lemina. Chiellini I think is trying to be ready for the game.



Author::::encasedsliceofsheet
DateTime::::2016-03-12T04:42:05Z
He's not yet assertive, I think by his own admission. I don't think he's especially slow, not on the turn or one on one. I think his drawbacks are the types most likely to recede with time.

Chiello is broken!And I was told that lemina is not included inthe CL list!? Is that true?

It was cool to see Buffon make some nice saves today, really earning a shot at the record, instead of just standing around behind an impenetrable defense.

I'm not sure, but maybe. Barzagli won the world cup at 24. I just wonder about his pace and he seems very hesitant going forward. I really hope that it's just growing pains, because it would be wonderful if he blossomed. We'll see, I guess.

Alas both Di Maria and tactical sense won't let that happen.

What a pure inventors goal by Dybala. Half a step of space and he curls it to the corner. Also some fantastic pinpoint passes through the game. Alex Sandro is a very strong player. Asamoah is still not fit by a long shot. Cuadrado is light and dark. Glad Rugani got another run out, but I don't think he's ready for the limelight. I don't know if he's got what it takes to be a first team player. (I'm sad to say)

I'm glad this story mentions that it was a good match (it was). It bothers me when some people will see a score, and not having watched it, assume it was boring.

Front two of Higuain and Aguero, Dybala and Messi behind. The dream forward line. Would need a few kickers though.

I think like a lot of 90s Italian goalkeepers, he was made to look better than he actually was by having a typically masterful Italian defence in front of him.

...and to think he nearly scored a better one with only 30 seconds on the clock... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BGF_gBZ1IE
