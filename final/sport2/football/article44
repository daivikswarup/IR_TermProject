MLS weekend preview: Mike Magee could be LA Galaxy's best signing




DateTime::::2016-03-11T11:00:00+0000



<p>It looked bleak for LA when Lamar Neagle scored after four minutes. DC United were on the way to victory at the StubHub Center last week, but then Mike Magee rekindled memories of his first spell in LA, scoring twice and assisting on one other as the Galaxy ran out 4-1 winners. The former Chicago man rolled back the years, to use the lamentable parlance of our time, and LA had gotten over their humiliating Concacaf Champions League exit, at least for a little bit.</p>

<p>LA have spent big in the off-season, but of all Galaxy’s star signings, the return of Magee might be the most significant. The 31-year-old has battled a serious hip injury and he barely played for Chicago last year, and even Bruce Arena admitted his transfer is something of a gamble, but Magee’s class is undeniable. The 2013 <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/mls">MLS</a> MVP makes those around him play better, and brings calm and precision to the hurly-burly of midfield. “He’s a guy that wants to be on the ball, and I think we need more of those types of players,” said AJ DeLaGarza. Quite so. Nigel de Jong has many attributes, but he’s not exactly Gerson, is he?</p>

<p>LA travel to Colorado on Saturday, and even Giovani dos Santos could feature after leaving the DC game with a leg injury. Their record against the Rapids is good, and they should get what they’re after.</p>

<p>It’s tough to pick a conference winner in the East, but you could do worse than put your money on Toronto and Montreal. The teams from Canada’s biggest cities won well at the weekend, and, unsurprisingly, their premier attacking artists were at the heart of things. Sebastian Giovinco made one and scored one as TFC snatched and grabbed against the Red Bulls, and Ignacio Piatti was a class above in Montreal’s impressive 3-2 win at Vancouver.</p>

<p>Is it sacrilege to suggest Piatti resembles Zinedine Zidane in style (we’re not talking ability here)? He’s a couple of inches shorter than Zizou, but the Argentinian plays with his head up and his back straight, and finds pockets of space in front of the back four where he can jink and weave and prompt in with elegance. His opening goal in Vancouver was beautiful – a dribble past three and a fine shot that left David Ousted clutching thin air. Montreal host the Red Bulls at The Big O, while Toronto stay in the Tri-State area and play New York City FC. It’s extremely early days – caveat alert! – but things don’t look half bad in Canada.</p>

<p>Houston haven’t beaten Dallas since 2012. FC Dallas have won five consecutive regular-season meetings against their rivals. Dallas won their opening game last week 2-0 against Philadelphia; Houston could only draw 3-3 with New England. Do all signs point to another Houston loss?</p>

<p>Well, yes and no. Houston were unfortunate against the Revs: they looked to be home and dry at 3-2, only to give up a stoppage-time equaliser to Daigo Kobayashi. Dynamo coach Owen Coyle had talked of his desire to make his team more attractive to watch, and new signing Cristian Maidana sparkled in a game that showed their attacking endeavour as well as their defensive ineptitude. Houston are optimistic for a playoff spot this season, and what a time this would be to end their Texan skid.</p>

<p>However, this Dallas side is made of tough stuff. Dallas picked up where they left off last season, cruising to a 2-0 victory over Philadelphia on opening day. They looked good, and the only blip was an injury to Colombian wizard Fabian Castillo, although coach Oscar Pareja says he could yet be fit for Sunday’s game. Mauro Diaz made both goals, and young talents Carlos Gruezo and Maxi Urruti have bolstered an already stellar squad. Dallas look in ominous form already.</p>

<p>Philadelphia had re-modelled their squad in the off-season, and much was expected of USMNT beefcake Maurice Edu as their defensive midfield pivot. But now Philly require a a rethink after Edu was ruled out for up to four months with a stress fracture in his left leg.</p>

<p>“It’s a big blow,” Union boss Jim Curtin said. They were poor in their opening game against Dallas, and now Union travel to Columbus – a ground where they’ve historically struggled – with issues in midfield, particularly with Tranquillo Barnetta still week-to-week with a knee injury.</p>

<p>Last year Philly got off a terrible start, winning just one of their first 11 games, and they can ill afford another defeat at the Mapfre Stadium, particularly after a 2-0 defeat in Dallas that could have been even heavier were it not for some solid goalkeeping. “I’d say that Andre [Blake] bailed us out a bunch tonight,” Curtin admitted after the game. “We need to have a good mentality and stick together through a tough time.” Veteran Brian Carroll will try to fill the void at No6, but Philly have a job on their hands.</p>

<p>Perhaps no team in MLS is as dependent on one star as Orlando City are on Kaká. The Brazilian had a fabulous first year in central Florida, scoring nine league goals and generally being the soccer luminary he is, but even he couldn’t drag the team into a playoff spot in their debut season. </p>

<p>Kaká is missing for Friday night’s televised clash with Chicago – he pulled a thigh muscle last week and sat out the 2-2 draw with Real Salt Lake – but thankfully for Orlando, Antonio Nocerino should be fit to start. The former Italy international doesn’t possess Kaká’s class, obviously, but he comes with a pedigree, and head coach Adrian Heath admitted being pleasantly surprised by the quality of his finishing – plus his joie de vivre.</p>

<p>“The one thing that’s come through, he’s only been here a couple of days and he’s already a really integral part of the group,” Heath said. “He, shall we say, enjoys life.” How cryptic! What could Heath possibly have been referring to? Whatever: a win and a goal on Friday night and Nocerino can enjoy as much paté and as many quails’ eggs as his little heart desires.</p>

MLS teams did well when the tournament was moved back to mid-March, which is allegedly why the other federations voted for it to be moved forward to February. The US/Canada only has 2 votes.

Let's face it, no one is 'HOT' form because each team has only played one match so far. I was so disappointed by MLS teams' results in the CONCACAF CL. We MUST change the approach on the training dates and start sooner or pressure CONCACAF to start the knockout rounds later. The Mexican teams are a little bit better than MLS teams but only a little bit. With the lack of training the gap was insurmountable.

If these match ups are half as good as last week's, another treat in store.

Being down Castillo gives Houston a chance. I still think Dallas has it.
