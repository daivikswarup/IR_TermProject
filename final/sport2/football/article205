PSG and Zlatan Ibrahimovic send laboured Chelsea crashing out




DateTime::::2016-03-09T21:48:13+0000



<p>By the end, it was a sobering reminder for Chelsea that when it comes to the hierarchy of European football there is no longer a place for them at the top table. They might have unfathomable riches, fierce ambitions and some high reputations, but so do teams such as Paris Saint-Germain and, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/11/chelsea-psg-champions-league-match-report">for a second successive season</a>, the French champions had the personnel to reach the quarter-finals to a celebratory chorus of <em>La Marseillaise</em> from the away end.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/09/diego-costa-chelsea-paris-saint-germain-zlatan-ibrahimovic-champions-league">Diego Costa discards mask to show he is no fraud but PSG have real superhero | Barney Ronay</a> </p>

<p>Laurent Blanc’s team still look short, perhaps, of the smooth excellence regularly witnessed by the crowds at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and, on their good days, Real Madrid, but they were still a good degree superior to Chelsea and, in the process, it was another fine night to be <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/zlatan-ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>. In this fixture last year the Swede was sent off after 31 minutes. He looked affronted by the memory, laying on PSG’s opening goal for Adrien Rabiot and effectively killing the tie with the close‑range volley that made it 4-2 on aggregate and meant Chelsea needed to score three times in little more than 20 minutes.</p>

<p>It used to be said that Ibrahimovic never played well against English opposition but he made sure of showing his better qualities here. Ángel Di María was not far behind in the list of outstanding performers, no matter the mistake that led to Diego Costa making it 1-1, and the 2012 winners must have left the pitch knowing it might be a long way back to the top. Tenth in the Premier League, Guus Hiddink talked about “lost terrain” and admitted it might be some time before their next European tie.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea">Chelsea</a> put in a spirited effort and will reflect on the attack, a minute or so before Ibrahimovic’s goal, when Kevin Trapp made two saves in quick succession to keep out Willian and Eden Hazard. Ultimately, however, Chelsea’s leading players did not rise to the occasion and they lost their defensive structure, as they have so many times this season. Costa, the one player PSG could not handle, had to come off after an hour and Hazard was also injured. As he came to the touchline there were some boos for the 2014-15 double player of the year after another peripheral performance.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/09/chelsea-psg-five-champions-league-talking-points">Chelsea 1-2 PSG: five Champions League talking points from Stamford Bridge | Dominic Fifield</a> </p>

<p>Chelsea thus could not keep up their fine record of saving themselves in this kind of assignment, having gone through eight times in the previous 13 ties when they have lost the first match. It is coming up for five years since they last played a home match in this competition without scoring and if we are being generous, perhaps it might have been a different conclusion if Costa had remained on the pitch.</p>

<p>Hiddink talked of them being “too respectful” in the opening part of the game and having lost 2-1 in Paris three weeks ago, the first telling blow came after 16 minutes. Di María had quickly made it clear he was determined to have a prominent role and it was his pass that sent Ibrahimovic clear on the right. Kenedy, Chelsea’s young left-back, had deserted his post. Branislav Ivanovic did not follow Ibrahimovic’s run and these small lapses had considerable ramifications. Ibrahimovic slid the ball across the six-yard box and the Swede’s expression was one of joy even before Rabiot applied the final touch at the far post. Ibrahimovic knew the pass had been weighted beautifully.</p>

<p>With a 3-1 aggregate lead, PSG promptly threatened to make it a stress-free night, knocking the ball around with the confidence that might be expected of a team who have turned Ligue 1 into a procession. Costa, however, was focused and forceful from the start. He has seldom looked better since last season’s opening months at the club and in the middle part of the game there were glimpses of the stubborn streak that has been the hallmark of the more productive Chelsea teams.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/mar/09/chelsea-1-2-psg-agg-2-4-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-in-pictures">Chelsea 1-2 PSG (agg 2-4): Champions League last 16 second leg – in pictures</a> </p>

<p>After 27 minutes, Di María had a sudden and unexpected wave of his old Manchester United form, dithering in the centre of the pitch and allowing Pedro to dispossess him. The Spaniard is hardly a tenacious tackler but his desire to win the ball maybe surprised his opponent. Willian was running in support, breaking with pace, and PSG were vulnerable straight away. Costa took the ball in a central position, turned inside Thiago Silva with great determination and aimed a low shot beyond the oncoming Trapp.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Chelsea, Costa’s exertions finished with him aggravating the tendon problem that kept him out of the game against Stoke last weekend and that was a significant setback given the problems he was creating for PSG’s all-Brazilian defence. Bertrand Traoré bounded on, offering youthful energy, but he did not have Costa’s simmering presence and Chelsea missed their leading scorer.</p>

<p>The game was still open at that stage but midway through the second half Di María reminded everyone of his penetrative qualities with some brilliantly effective wide play. Thiago Motta’s pass was expertly delivered in the buildup and the Argentinian, operating for the most part in an elusive central role, had peeled away on the left. Ibrahimovic was anticipating the cross and he was delivered just what he wanted and where he wanted it. The volley flashed into the roof of the net and it would have been an incredible feat of escapology to spare Chelsea from that position.</p>

It was a poor PL last season. Other to managers have developed tactics and methods that have improved performances. Mourinho has stood still. He is incapable of adapting, or so it seems given how incapable he was of adapting his methods when the wheels fell off this season.

It wasn't great, but it wasn't a "wretched performance" against Bournemouth. They are a well organised side, that was fired up after a terrific performance against Everton and had an even greater sense of camaraderie and desire to do well because of Harry Arter.

Couldn't agree more. They made the wise bet (easy to say now) to preserve Verratti for the oncoming games. PSG will be a lot stronger with him. They also handled the Aurier case really wisely, giving him a significant time off the pitch including for this one.. but still keeping the door open to have him back for the remaining decisive game, as he had raise to an incredible level of performance ultimately (which might have got a bit too much to his head). No one will wish to draw Paris in the quarters.

Yet again, you continue to make completely spurious points. You assume that, eventually, form would have improved under Mourinho? Where was there any evidence that was the case? FFS, before the Leicester loss, we lost to bloody Bournemouth at home in a wretched performance.

Oh, ok, I misread your comment. I just don't think Fabregas has been so poor as to deserve being singled out. Although I don't watch Chelsea every week, my impression is the whole team has been roughly on the same performance level this season.

Pedro's done alright. New league, struggling team, some nagging injuries, etc., have all hampered him.

The theory is absolutely correct. By every metric, the performance under Hiddink is vastly better than it was under Mourinho this season.

Be careful of what you wish for. PSG weren't even at the top of their form yesterday. I don't know who the "we" is that you're referring to in your last sentence, but if it's not Barcelona I wouldn't be too gleeful about meeting Paris. And, as we say over here in the Ville Lumière, Allez Paris.

Not being able to get into the Spain team means virtually nothing except that you aren't as good as Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta, or Alonso. Even Cesc Fabregas at his peak was at best a squad player behind those 4 - and who could blame him? Plus, top class is just a platitude, you don't have to take it literally. I do think he was top 3 best midfielders in the league the year MU won the title. Without him Arsenal would have fallen apart completely, and he was a big part of the reason they managed to stay in the top 4.

I hadn't seen too much of Chelsea since the Hiddink takeover, but assumed that they were back up close to last year's quality - or at least the season before - given their unbeaten run.But when Costa limped off you feared for them because he was the focus for all their creativity, and head and shoulders above the next best option

Let's be honest, neither of us watch Ligue 1 so we can't really answer that question. But my guess is there's plenty of pacy, intense players in Ligue 1 (after all, Kante was playing there just last season!) ... it's probably a league filled with raw, athletic players.

True, his role has changed over the years. Blanc has been changing him into a wing forward, which suits him better. There is still a learning curve tho.



Author::::sac_zine
DateTime::::2016-03-10T16:50:00Z
But then turn that around, how often do PSG play a team that counterattacks with real pace and intensity?

Agreed, Pedro hasn't been great, but he's not been surrounded by guys putting out man of the match performances week in week out.

Not a filler at all. He scored 58 goals in 204 league appearances for Barça.

you say this because I'm french and because you have this false perception of french mentalityno problem I'm used to it when I go to EnglandBy the way thanks for not complaining one second to the fact that Ibra was offside on the second goal, even if this goal was splendid and we deserved it. But at this time of the game, I was expecting a chelsea goal honestly. First 20 minutes of the second half were a disaster for us.but anyway chelsea has to change the way they playgood luck



Author::::Quicknstraight
DateTime::::2016-03-10T15:03:36Z
The point is that we've done a lot better since Mourinho was fired. And I am sure Hiddink had inout into that game where Holland was nominally in charge.
