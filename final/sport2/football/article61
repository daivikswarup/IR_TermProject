<p><span class="bullet">•</span> It was a good day for several of the division’s strugglers, with <strong>Charlton</strong> earning just their second win since November with a 2-1 win at <strong>Brentford</strong>. Callum Harriott scored both goals – the first after just 19 seconds. <strong>Rotherham</strong> shocked <strong>Sheffield Wednesday</strong> at Hillsborough, winning 1-0 in a South Yorkshire derby, and <strong>MK Dons</strong> beat <strong>QPR</strong> 2-0. <strong>Bolton</strong> couldn’t continue the trend, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/leeds-united-bolton-wanderers-championship-match-report" title="">going down 2-1 at Elland Road</a> to drift 10 points from safety.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> <strong>Burnley</strong> returned to the top with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/05/burnley-beat-blackburn-rovers-top-championship-andre-gray" title="">victory in the East Lancashire derby</a> against <strong>Blackburn</strong>. <strong>Middlesbrough</strong>, who <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/04/middlesbrough-wolves-championship-match-report" title="">beat <strong>Wolves</strong> 2-1 </a>on Friday, and <strong>Hull</strong>, who <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/03/birmingham-city-hull-city-championship-match-report" title="">lost 1-0 at <strong>Birmingham</strong></a> on Thursday, had Saturday off, leaving <strong>Brighton</strong> and <strong>Derby</strong> with a chance to gain some ground. The Rams obliged with a welcome 2-0 win over <strong>Huddersfield</strong>, but Brighton were held to a goalless draw at <strong>Preston</strong> – their 11th away draw this season.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> <strong>Cardiff</strong> and <strong>Ipswich</strong> improved their play-off prospects with victories: the Bluebirds beat <strong>Bristol City</strong> in the Severnside derby at Ashton Gate, while Ben Pringle got the winner as <strong>Ipswich</strong> saw off Nottingham Forest. In the day’s highest scoring game, <strong>Reading</strong> and <strong>Fulham</strong> played out a lively 2-2 draw.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> None of the top four could find a win, with <strong>Burton</strong> drawing 1-1 at <strong>Crewe</strong>, <strong>Wigan</strong> matching their result at home to <strong>Peterborough</strong>, <strong>Gillingham</strong> playing out a stalemate at <strong>Scunthorpe</strong>, and <strong>Walsall</strong> slipping to a home defeat to in-form <strong>Barnsley</strong>. The Tykes climb into the top six, a place below <strong>Millwall</strong>, who closed on the teams above with a comfortable 3-0 win over <strong>Blackpool</strong>.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> A last-gasp Che Adams penalty rescued a point for <strong>Sheffield United</strong> at <strong>Fleetwood</strong> on a difficult day for the pack chasing play-off places. <strong>Coventry</strong> lost to a late Ian Henderson penalty against <strong>Rochdale</strong>, <strong>Southend</strong> lost by the same score at home to <strong>Chesterfield</strong>, and <strong>Bury</strong>, with 15-year-old Rob Harker on the bench, held <strong>Bradford</strong> at Gigg Lane.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> Only <strong>Port Vale</strong> kept pace with Barnsley in sixth, after a 2-0 win over <strong>Colchester</strong>. Elsewhere at the bottom, <strong>Shrewsbury</strong> snatched a vital victory at <strong>Doncaster</strong> thanks to Shaun Whalley’s winner, while <strong>Oldham’s</strong> home tie with <strong>Swindon</strong> was called off after heavy snowfall at Boundary Park.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> There’s no stopping <strong>Northampton</strong>: the leaders have stretched their advantage over <strong>Oxford</strong> to 13 points after a 4-1 win at <strong>Carlisle</strong>, with John-Joe O’Toole grabbing a double. The U’s took the lead twice at third-placed <strong>Plymouth</strong>, but had to settle for a 2-2 draw. <strong>Accrington</strong> failed to close the gap after a controversial goalless draw against <strong>Wimbledon</strong>, with referee Trevor Kettle whistling for half-time with Stanley in the middle of a goalscoring move.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> <strong>Portsmouth</strong> and <strong>Bristol Rovers</strong> both kept up the chase with away victories. Pompey won 2-0 at <strong>Stevenage</strong>, while Rovers did the same at <strong>Notts County</strong>. <strong>Leyton Orient</strong>, <strong>Wycombe</strong> and <strong>Mansfield</strong> all missed the chance to occupy a play-off place, all losing by a single goal to <strong>Luton</strong>, <strong>Newport</strong> and <strong>Yeovil</strong> respectively.</p>

<p><span class="bullet">•</span> The Glovers weren’t the only team at the bottom celebrating – <strong>Dagenham &amp; Redbridge</strong> got a first home win of the season against <strong>York</strong>, but are still seven points adrift of <strong>Hartlepool</strong> in 22nd, after they earned an impressive 3-1 win at <strong>Barnet</strong>. Elsewhere, Ollie Watkins got the winner as <strong>Exeter</strong> edged out <strong>Cambridge</strong>, and <strong>Morecambe</strong> ended a run of five straight defeats with a draw at <strong>Crawley</strong>.</p>

Watching it on tv, its an unfathomable decision. Why blow just AFTER the player has turned to shoot in the six yard box?

I agree about getting Bong back, but dropping Bruno? I quite like the back four at the moment (although that changes from game to game - Im fickle that way)

Some of the Albion players ARE actually quite good.

Well, the Burnley Buffalo claimed another Tri-pointer with a win-game against the Blackburn Rovers. This leaves the Brighton Albion with some yardage to make up despite their 15-5 winning season, after a zero-filled ball game at The Preston Prouds...etc etc

My thoughts on the Football League? Any chance we could get more than a few paragraphs on non-Prem English football? No far better for a British paper to cover the sodding MLS in much greater detail.

Carlisle should have been a run of the mill 1-0 win for the Cobblers. Thanks to that tool, Keith Curle, the Cobblers were given the bone and they absolutely smashed them.

Blimey, that new dawn didn't last long. What has happened ? It was suggested that Wagner was the brains behind Klopp.

A painful defeat for York City at Dagenham. The new manager, Jackie McNamara has not stopped the rot . A total of 42 players used tells it's own story. There was a bit of hope when we beat Notts County and Exeter City in successive home games but to go to Dagenham who were without a win in nineteen home games and manage just two shots neither on target says everything. It's back to the Conference or whatever it is called now with an uncertain future if we do not manage to bounce back in the first season.

We are going places, but they are all in the wrong direction. Another loss for Town, another three points gone. Wagner, time to do something or our time in this division could be over in due course I reckon. COYT!

I couldn't believe that the Addicks actually won a game. It still looks too late to avoid relegation because making up an 8 point gap given our form just looks too much.

I read reviews of the game on a Wimbeldon fan site I follow yesterday and the overwhelming view of the Dons fans was that Accy were robbed by a stupid descision.....still they will take the gift and it keeps them in the running for the play offs.....

I'm going to stop watching Premier League and Champions League football, it makes me expect too much from my lot.

Millwall 3-0 Blackpool, but god we were poor. Fortunately Blackpool were worse. I don't remember when the Lions last impressed me with their football. If we could string a few passes together it would help, but I think I am asking too much.

We had our best XI on the pitch today, and for the first half we showed Preston what an established Championship team looks like. Up to the last third that is, where we ran out of ideas, barely tested the keeper and looked pretty toothless. Preston realised in the second half they could actually play, and but for a wonder save by Stockdale would have taken the lead. Pretty soon after Preston decided to take the point and towards the end we seemed to agree. Two points dropped for the lack of a Striker.

We (QPR) deserved to lose today. I don't understand why Jimmy didn't start Polter and Phillips, also, why he took off Hall, thus moving Perch to right-back breaking up his pairing with El Khayati which seemed to be working okay. Konchesky didn't add anything. We were the better team in the first half, but didn't offer much threat to Milton Keynes Franchise. Second half they came out strong and clearly wanted to win more. The only positive was Alex Smithies is playing really well for us. Henry also had a decent game, but then you know you're in trouble when he's your best player.

Right then. The play-offs were always a bit far-fetched but any danger of going down disappeared well over a month ago. Our record against the top four reads P6 W2 D3 L1. The first eleven cost 70K (plus a couple of loans) and it's only ten months since we threw away going up second at Colchester. In other words, and we can lose the lot from now on as far as I'm concerned, (headhunters look away now please) Simon Grayson is the Championship Manager of the Season.

Brentford really need a new keeper, the second goal was a gift. The rest of the team also need a kick up the jacksie, appalling defending today.
