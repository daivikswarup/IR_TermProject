Tottenham left with mountain to climb against Borussia Dortmund




DateTime::::2016-03-10T20:10:14+0000



<p>So much for the theory that this was going to be a night for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenham-hotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> to measure themselves against one of the top teams in European football. Mauricio Pochettino may as well have waved a white flag from the moment he handed in the team-sheet as Borussia Dortmund tormented the Premier League club to such an extent that the second leg at White Hart Lane has already been rendered irrelevant.</p>

<p>Evasive about where his priorities lay on the eve of the game, Pochettino made it clear that it is the Premier League title or nothing for Spurs this season by making seven changes – only the suspended Dele Alli was enforced – from the side that drew against Arsenal on Saturday. By the time Harry Kane was brought on with 14 minutes remaining, Dortmund were rampant and the evening had turned into an exercise in damage limitation for Tottenham.</p>

<p>Dortmund were exhilarating to watch and it is easy to see why there is so much excitement in these parts about the way Thomas Tuchel has re-energised the club since replacing Jürgen Klopp as manager in the summer. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was outstanding up front and took his tally for the season to 33 goals in 38 appearances, the wonderfully gifted Henrikh Mkhitaryan ran the game from midfield and Marco Reus scored twice.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/mar/10/borussia-dortmund-v-tottenham-europa-league-last-16-live">Borussia Dortmund 3-0 Tottenham: Europa League last 16 – as it happened</a> </p>

<p>Reus’s second was a moment of beauty and highlighted the chasm in class.</p>

<p>Dortmund swept from one end of the pitch to the other, completing 21 passes before the ball arrived at the feet of the Germany international, who then showed superb technique to clip a half-volley beyond Hugo Lloris.</p>

<p>With Dortmund in an identical position to Spurs in their domestic title race – both clubs are second and five points behind the leaders – it was hard to avoid the conclusion that Tuchel views the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league">Europa League</a> much more seriously than Pochettino. Dortmund’s manager made only two changes to his side and was rewarded with what he described as a “huge performance”.</p>

<p>As for Pochettino, the focus now turns to Aston Villa on Sunday and a game that Spurs simply have to win, not just to keep alive their title hopes but also to vindicate the way their manager approached this fixture.</p>

<p>“I’m very disappointed with the result,” Pochettino said. “It was a bad day at the office, we need to accept that. I have no regret because I think when we analyse we picked 11 to try to win the game. I think we started the first five minutes OK but then it was a very bad day for us.”</p>

<p>This could still turn into a historic season for Spurs but they quickly need to get back on track. Tottenham have picked up only two victories from their last seven matches and it was hard to see how Pochettino could talk about any positives on a night when his callow team were so comprehensively outplayed.</p>

<p>“We know the circumstances,” the Spurs manager said. “You need to accept some period in the season where sometimes it’s good and bad. The last few results have not been what we hope but I’m not worried. The players are very sad but that’s normal. We now have a big challenge on Sunday against Aston Villa, and we are in a very good position in the league to try and give our best.”</p>

<p>Dortmund were so impressive and the only surprise was that the game was half an hour old before they took the lead. Tom Carroll and Ryan Mason were overrun in central midfield, Nacer Chadli was anonymous up front and it was easy to feel sympathy for 18-year-old Joshua Onomah, who was starting only his fourth game for Spurs.</p>

<p>The early chance that Christian Eriksen swept into the arms of Roman Weidenfeller, with only 38 seconds on the clock, was no sign of things to come as Tuchel’s side began to go through their gears, targeting the space that opened up on the flanks, where Ben Davies, the Spurs left-back, and Kieran Trippier, the right-back, were horribly exposed at times.</p>

<p>Aubameyang had already seen a goal disallowed for offside and volleyed on to the roof of the net when he put Dortmund ahead. Marcel Schmelzer picked up possession wide on the Dortmund left and his measured cross was met by the Gabonese, who climbed above Davies to send a powerful downward header into the corner.</p>

<p>If the interval provided Spurs with some respite, there was no let-up after the restart. Mkhitaryan, with yet another sublime pass, set Aubameyang free inside the Spurs area and the striker’s low shot slid across goal to Gonzalo Castro, who struck the outside of the post.</p>

<p>Dortmund, however, did not have to wait long for their second. A short-corner routine saw Castro whip in a cross that Neven Subotic, who had been on the pitch for only three minutes, flicked on for Reus, ghosting in at the far post, to volley powerfully into the roof of the net.</p>

<p>The best, however, was still to come, with Reus applying the coup de grace with his delightful finish after Castro had picked him out with a pitching wedge of a pass. Dortmund were enjoying themselves by that point and came close to adding a fourth in the closing stages.</p>

<p>Pochettino later talked about how Spurs would “still try and fight for the tie” but he was kidding nobody.</p>

Tots looked tired and lethargic. I was expecting a cracker of a game instead it was one-way traffic. Return leg is going to be even worse.With so much money rolling around in PL, you'd think they could put some decent performance in Europe.

Statistically at BornSlippy909's dimension, No, statistically in this dimnsion. I can give you a link if you wish. I've never knowingly heard them so I can't comment, therefor the chance of me remembering them in 40 minutes let alone years is slim. Don't shoot the messenger, I don't tell folk what music to buy any more than I tell them what football to watch. Just because people buy more One Direction records than Beatles records and watch 'the prem' rather than something better says all you need to know about .... Popular

Ha, I get to watch a team playing in Europe most years, and consistently playing poorly in Sunday matches after Thursday Europe games. It's happened for years, and a team like Spurs just doesn't have the squad depth to be able to rotate and play in multiple competitions in the same manner as the bigger clubs. And remember our playing style is high pace - our players look knackered at the moment.  So yeah, we have a tiny chance to win the league, and a bigger chance of getting top 3, so I'm willing to give up another bunch of Europe games for it. But mainly I'm a Spurs fan, so that means I'm mostly worried about us messing it up and dropping out of the top 4.

Rugby is first priority this weekend with Italy in Dublin on Saturday. On Sunday I've requested to watch Carpi/Frosinone, and BVB/Mainz following that. Not sure that second request will be granted by the boss. Leicester/Newcastle on Monday, followed by a quick run through of some highlights.

Thanks to Fox Sports relegating the EL games to FS2 I didn't get to see the game till today - that was ugly.Still, we were looking for a test of our progress so how did we do? Yeah - obviously we were crap and Dortmund were very good (although, with crisper finishing they could have done us for 6-0).I took a look back as far as mid-December and it looks like since then we've only had 2 weeks where we've not played 2 games a week despite going out of the Capital Cup early. If we do manage to finish out the season with a top 4 place we'll be faced with a similar schedule but will be facing top teams (like Dortmund) in every mid-week game.The team we put out in Germany was good enough to get us through the group matches in the EL, but would have us dead last in the CL group matches.As much as that hurt, Pooch needed to see how far away we are to holding top 4 and competing in the CL next year - yeah - long way to go. But, finishing top 4 must take priority as without that we'll never attract the quality players we need to get to that next level and hope to stay there.Maybe we'll get another go at Dortmund next year, but its not happening this year. (tell you what though, if I'm a Villa player I'm not looking forward to Sunday - someone's gotta pay).

To be honest I don't get all of this B-team waffle. What if Bürki, Sokratis, Subotic, Gündogan, Sahin and Kagawa would have played for Weidenfeller, Bender, Pisczcek, Durm, Weigl and Castro? I guess nobody would have even mentioned it. Maybe some notes about why Ginter (World Cup winner) was not on the pitch...

Hear,hear. Well done Dortmund for playing a strong line -up, they were a joy to watch. Its a pity spurs ruined the game as a contest by playing a reserve team. If i was a Spurs fan at the game last night i would have been severely pissed off with that line up.what's the point in entering a tournament if you dont take it seriously.

Spurs are ahead of schedule They were expected to finish 6th and with a bit of luck challenge for the top4 The fact that the established CL teams have all been poor this season has let in Leicester and Spurs In a 'normal season' the league leaders would normally have 65+ points at this stage of the season - Leicester and Spurs would be fighting for 3rd or 4th Enjoy the ride - and hopefully we use the experience to kick on, whatever happens

Good post, PresB. I can only echo your sentiments. I had the chance to get a tic via friends down in Germany and, despite a 2,400 drive there and back, I was still so happy about the prospect of seeing Spurs in Dortmund. Fortunately, work commitments forced me to decline. I say fortunately because if I'd had any prior knowledge of the team we put out last night, I would've stayed firmly put at home. As a one of the Spurs faithful, I can't believe that I'm writing this, but it's true. This was a massive fixture for us and I'd been looking forward to it since the draw. I thought we were being serious about the EL and truly thought we'd give BvB a game with some real opposition. It was not to be. Today I've been plagued by mail and calls from my mates down in NRW telling me how disappointed they were that Spurs didn't make an effort and how easy it was to win without moving up into third gear. I had even played with the idea of splashing out on the home leg at the Lane as I'm back in London for a few days next week, but I think the Bournemouth game is by far the better option. I've been to the Westfalenstadion many times and love the place. I have never experienced any bad behaviour from the officials similar to your own last night. Can fully understand that made what was destined to be a crap night 'at the races'. Well for us at least.

Also, Poch's first priority is to Tottenham Hotspur FC NOT the consideration of neutrals. He will be judged by his decisions by Spurs fans and management, not Cerebral Football, starting with Sunday's game against Villa.
