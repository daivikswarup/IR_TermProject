<p>Slumping Sydney FC’s prospects of an <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league">A-League</a> finals appearance have taken another hit, with an inept first-half defensive display contributing to a 3-1 home loss to Wellington.<br/></p>

<p>Seventh on the ladder heading into the round, the Sky Blues’ streak without a win has stretched to eight games. They conceded two goals in a minute early in Saturday’s game at Allianz Stadium and another before half-time when they were booed off by disgruntled fans.</p>

<p>Sydney lost playmaker Milos Ninkovic midway through the half with an ankle ligament injury, which will keep him out of the Wednesday’s Asian Champions League away game against South Korea’s Pohang Steelers.<br/></p>

<p>Sky Blues coach Graham Arnold made his other two substitutions at half-time, bringing on Senegalese internationals Mickael Tavares and Jacques Faty for Milos Dimitrijevic and Aaron Calver.<br/></p>

<p>Sydney can’t say they weren’t warned, as the Phoenix threatened to score on three occasions against a shaky looking defence before the visitors hit the front. Former Sydney striker Blake Powell turned and shot cleanly after the home team failed to clear a left-wing cross in the 12th minute.</p>

<p>A minute later, Wellington’s lead was doubled, when Hamish Watson sidefooted a Roly Bonevacia through-ball home from just inside the penalty area. Bonevacia slotted a third goal in the 37th minute when Sydney again failed to properly clear a cross.</p>

<p>Sydney dominated the second half creating a number of chances, but couldn’t add to a 51st-minute close-range strike from leading scorer and Slovakian international Filip Holosko, who notched his seventh goal of the season, after replacing Ninkovic.</p>
