Mike Ashley and Newcastle: how to suck the spirit out of a football club




DateTime::::2016-03-11T13:00:03+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen Newcastle United slump into another of their serial crises during what passes for stewardship under Mike Ashley, the grand old club look wrong in every respect – from “top to bottom”, as their hero of yore, Alan Shearer, recently lamented. Yet another manager, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/11/newcastle-united-sack-steve-mcclaren-rafael-benitez" title="">Steve McClaren, has been dispatched from the ejector seat</a> months after he replaced Newcastle’s discount experiment with John Carver’s career and wellbeing. Substantial money has actually been spent on signing players – £80m in the summer and January – but this has prompted only bewildered questions about the quality of recruitment by the chief scout, Graham Carr, who in effect selects the players in the decision‑making structure insisted on by Ashley.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/11/newcastle-united-sack-steve-mcclaren-rafael-benitez">Newcastle sack Steve McClaren and close in on Rafael Benítez</a> </p>

<p>With all of it leading the club stumbling incoherently into another relegation battle at a stadium built for cavalier adventure, the whole modern incarnation of St James’ Park looks dire. Ashley’s tainted retail empire, Sports Direct, has its logo on every wall and in everybody’s face around the ground, while the players Carr has signed according to the Ashley value policy of being under 25, pull on the noble black and white shirt with Wonga emblazoned on their chests.</p>

<p>The mood among an army of supporters who actively want to embrace the club as an engine of pride and regional identity is sour, angry, baffled and betrayed. Newcastle are facing the drop for the season when the financial divide between Premier League and Championship will gape wider than ever, alongside Aston Villa, another big club of great tradition failing under a billionaire owner.</p>

<p>Yet while Randy Lerner has almost said his farewells at Villa Park, and announced he will not be over from America much any more, Ashley is involved with the hierarchy – threadbare as it is – at Newcastle and sanctioned all that spending. Somehow, nothing they do is working.</p>

<p>The club reversed the clinical, misery-inducing strategy set out by the managing director, Lee Charnley, last season, 60 years after Newcastle last won a domestic trophy, the FA Cup, of in effect surrendering ambition in the cups in favour of aiming for a financially comfortable position in the upper half of the league table.</p>

<p>Then, out McClaren’s team limped from the Capital One Cup in September to a 1-0 home defeat by Sheffield Wednesday, after which Charnley – to his credit – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/25/newcastle-director-apologises-fans-steve-mcclaren" title="">sent an email to supporters</a> apologising for “a very disappointing start to our Premier League campaign, and a painful early exit from a cup competition that we were determined to give everything in this year”.</p>

<p>Fourteen league matches after that, of which only four were won, a run punctuated by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/28/crystal-palace-newcastle-premier-league-match-report" title="">the 5-1 thrashing</a> administered by their former manager Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace, Newcastle trudged out of the FA Cup in the third round, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/09/watford-newcastle-united-fa-cup-match-report" title="">losing 1-0 at Watford</a>.</p>

<p>That has left top-flight survival as the only aim and, with the Premier League finalising its unbelievable £8bn for the total 2016-19 TV rights, Ashley cannot contemplate missing out on so much money. Charnley’s apology in September talked about being in it all together and not apportioning blame (“We have sat down as a collective – myself with Steve and his coaching team, and Steve with his players …”) but the ringing of the relegation alarm drowns out such emollience.</p>

<p>It is natural at times such as this to see Ashley’s ownership as a permanent dead hand, which has brought his cheapskate, bottom line‑obsessed practices of Sports Direct to a football club that have always relished stars with a touch of extravagance.</p>

<p>It is easy to forget that after his first hideous period of ownership, when he seemed to buy the club for a good time then saw them relegated in 2009 and promised to sell up, the Ashley tenure briefly came together. In 2011‑12, after Carr’s scouting had brought in talent including Yohan Cabaye, Papiss Cissé and Hatem Ben Arfa, Pardew took the team to a fifth-placed finish, and the then managing director Derek Llambias pulled the finances back to sanity.</p>

<p>Then Ashley <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/18/joe-kinnear-newcastle-appointment-shambolic-interview" title="">appointed Joe Kinnear as director of football</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/19/derek-llambias-resigns-newcastle-united" title="">Llambias left</a> the next day, other clubs including Leicester City overhauled their recruitment, including from France, and Newcastle, with their talk of the top 10 and lack of interest in the cups, came across as too financially matter-of-fact for their own good. As they scramble to stay up now, Charnley must know, even if Ashley still gives an air of being detached, that there is only so much spirit you can squeeze from a football club.</p>

I noticed that too this morning. I wonder if the store isn't making money, and they're cutting their losses before signing a big lease. The other thing that struck me about that is that the signs are deliberately amateurish-looking, like the sort of banner a football fan might write on a bedsheet to express dissatisfaction with a struggling manager, but if you get up close, you can see that they're actually printed.

It is - the mood is incredibly positive judging by our fans boards, social media and the people I've spoken to. With McClaren at the helm, there was nothing but dread and resignation, with Benitez there is hope and optimism. Amazing how one man can inspire such a change.

The vitriol against Ashley is understandable. But..... He has just signed up Rafa! At Newcastle, to have this manager! That must be hailed as something remarkable and positive.

I know I should not moan, however the quality of the syntax and grammar are as poor as Newcastle's football. The content is lively and interesting, yet at times it is unintelligible.

Was surprised at the nasty and vitriolic abuse being heaped on McClaren by too many Newcastle fans. He was never that good but the structure and restrictions placed on the/any Newcastle manager by Ashley are legion and destructive for the club and its results; so are the fans now giving Ashley a free pass?

The possibilities for greatness are massive at Newcastle, one of the biggest one city clubs in the country,but so many managers such as my own club Celtics former boss O' Neill have taken one look and walked away. There has to be a reason and maybe it's the owner. That said I would caution Ashley from interfering with Rafa who's a proud guy or this will end in tears also. If it goes well who'll claim the credit though. I wish Rafa well the fans there deserve better.

Relegation is one thing, the "feel" of the club is another. The lack of ambition that the club shows undermines the dreams that fans have. Other than supporters of about 4 clubs, most of us know we are unlikely to win things but taking away that dream of winning something makes some people question what it is all about.

The problem at Villa is that Lerner has lost interest. As a result it has been run on a cost minimisation basis. In the later O'Neill years and since there have been a number of expensive departures and no expensive replacements. This worked for a while but has ultimately caught up with them.

Just at the top, apart from Leicester, I would think Spurs, Hammers and Stoke fans would be pretty happy with the state of things. I would also hazard a guess that Watford and Bournemouth fans would be happy about their teams generally punching above their weight and playing nice football.

Could you provide examples of contesting for every premier league title bar two? Going back, I can see : 15th, 10th, 16th, 5th (ok), 12th, 1st (championship - whoop), 18th (lovely), 12th, 13th, 7th, 14th and a few years of challenging. Six times finishing in the top half, in 20 years.

Sure. A big side would challenge domestically for every title - not Newcastle then who have they've finished in the top half of the table 6 times in 20 years and in one season they were relegated. A big side could afford a player who is 17 million plus -hmm, ten years have passed since Owen's 16 million; 20 years since next in the slot of Shearer. A big side isn't sponsored by Sports Direct, Wonga, Poundland, or TK-Max and doesn't have a stadium plastered with those names. Happy to hear your thoughts.

So who from the top half you want to be sacrificed for Newcastle



Author::::mannschaft2010
DateTime::::2016-03-12T00:13:46Z
Or may be encourage and support them each match so that they can get better. But fans at NUFC don't think that ways - they are angry inside and just go out and punch the horses. Bit disgruntled but I don't buy this try and play football thing. In essence United fans want a winning team but they don't have one so they get on the players back.



Author::::mannschaft2010
DateTime::::2016-03-12T00:08:31Z
Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and most clubs on the continent work on that model and fairly successful. It is a non argument.

DateTime::::2016-03-12T00:06:28Z
I respect your views Sid as you are refreshing on so many issues but on this I think the fans are the problem. Before Ashley they had 40 years of thousand odd players and probably 20 managers but never went anywhere. Always it all comes down to the pressure of the place. Well if the players don't have a free and fair environment to express themselves then Newcastle will keep getting what they are sowing in the stands. Bring on more pressure and big club non sense.

Just like FSG at Liverpool, Cellino at Leeds, the Glazers and co at Utd, Lerner at Villa and a whole host of others I can't be arsed to mention - far too many of English football's greatest clubs are being led to rack and ruin by arrogant bastards who think they know it all when they actually know fuck all.

You're so right, Domx. Fond memories indeed, the excitement, the atmosphere, the end-to-end stuff. Hopeful this loathsome cretin finally gets the hint and we can see those pulsating games again. Newcastle have always been a lot of fans' second team. let's not let Ashley wreck it.
