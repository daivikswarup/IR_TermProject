Liverpool’s Sturridge and Firmino make feeble Manchester United pay




DateTime::::2016-03-10T22:04:39+0000



<p>The only possible regret for Liverpool, on a night when they brutally exposed Manchester United’s shortcomings, is that they did not make it an even more chastening experience for a team that, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/20/louis-van-gaal-jose-mourinho-midtjylland-manchester-united">even in hard decline</a>, has rarely put in such an undistinguished performance on Louis van Gaal’s watch, or one that reflects more ignominiously on their manager.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/10/roberto-firmino-liverpool-manchester-united">Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino embodies Kloppball and enthralls the Kop | Barney Ronay</a> </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a> did everything their loud, appreciative crowd could have wanted and if it was not for David de Gea’s goalkeeping they would have established an even more commanding lead to take into the second leg. Anfield has not sounded so good for a long while and, on this evidence, Jürgen Klopp’s team will have to be strong favourites to finish the job at Old Trafford next Thursday.</p>

<p>United, in stark contrast, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/10/marouane-fellaini-manchester-united-liverpool">played with a lack of personality</a> that must have been startling for their supporters. It has been a recurring theme in a season of drift and malaise and Van Gaal’s team chose a bad night to demonstrate, once again, they have lost the identity that once made them such feared opponents.</p>

<p>It was a harrowing night for a club with United’s ambitions, on the ground of their sworn enemy, and perhaps a few of Van Gaal’s players might have to be reminded about the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/manchester-united-liverpool-europe-sir-alex-ferguson">history between these clubs</a>. There was only one team that seemed to comprehend the significance of the fixture and fulfil the necessary obligations. That team had a Liver bird on their shirts, the ball at their feet and a raucous crowd who will take great joy from the dishevelled state of their opponents. It has certainly been a long time since You’ll Never Walk Alone has been sung here with more heartfelt volume. One banner in the Kop bore the words: “European Royalty”. Others showed Liverpool’s haul of five European Cups and three Uefa Cups. These are the moments when Anfield feels like a special place and the players rose to the occasion. Nobody could ever accuse Klopp’s men of failing the traditions of this match.</p>

<p>Liverpool tackled and chased with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/10/roberto-firmino-liverpool-manchester-united">energy and vigour the German considers essential</a> for his teams. They were quick to the ball, strong in the challenge, and, crucially, they also had players, most notably Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho, who could add wit and refinement to their attacks.</p>

<p>There might have been doubts about the penalty that gave Daniel Sturridge the opportunity to open the scoring and, equally, a trace of offside before Firmino capitalised on some wretched defending to double the lead. Ultimately, however, United were comprehensively outplayed and fortunate it was not a more punishing result. De Gea was exposed with a frequency that must have alarmed Van Gaal and, at 1-0, saved his team three times in the first half, keeping out Coutinho, Sturridge and Adam Lallana. The save from Coutinho, in particular, was outstanding.</p>

<p>Liverpool were so superior Van Gaal abandoned his 4-1-4-1 system at half-time and effectively started again. Michael Carrick, a central midfielder, was brought on to play in a new three-man defence. Daley Blind and Guillermo Varela took on the role of wing-backs while Marcus Rashford was taken off and Memphis Depay moved into attack in a hastily cobbled together 3-4-1-2 formation. It made little difference and, tactically, it felt like Van Gaal was confusing even himself. Marouane Fellaini’s elbow on Emre Can could result in a disciplinary charge and, on top of everything, the story of their night also encompassed the kind of malicious chants from the away end that United have repeatedly asked their fans to drop from their songbook.</p>

<p>Klopp’s players took far more responsibility on the ball and when they lost possession they gave everything to get it back. These are the occasions when a team needs sturdy characters and aside from one moment early on, when Klopp angrily berated Alberto Moreno for not closing down quickly enough, there was a vibrancy about the home team that made it difficult for their opponents to settle.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/mar/10/liverpool-v-manchester-united-europa-league-last-16-live">Liverpool v Manchester United: Europa League last 16 – live!</a> </p>

<p>The noise might have been doused inside the opening 15 seconds if Rashford, too raw for an occasion of this significance, had not wasted a chance to open the scoring before most of the players had even touched the ball. Thereafter, United seldom troubled Simon Mignolet in Liverpool’s goal and the home team went ahead after 19 minutes when Firmino clipped a beautifully weighted pass into Nathaniel Clyne’s path and the Spanish referee, Carlos Velasco Carballo, decided Memphis Depay had tripped the player inside the penalty area.</p>

<p>Sturridge beat De Gea with the penalty despite the goalkeeper getting his fingertips to the ball and, with the noise intensifying, Van Gaal talked afterwards about his players failing to cope with the atmosphere. When he was asked a follow-up question on the same subject, the Dutchman then denied saying it. His performance in the press conference, describing Fellaini as one of the outstanding performers, was almost as bizarre as his team’s lethargy.</p>

<p>Klopp spoke about Anfield sounding just as he had imagined it when he took the job and, after 73 minutes, the noise reached its peak. Carrick had the chance to clear but could only scuff the ball straight to Lallana. Firmino was waiting to Lallana’s left and scored with a rising shot in front of the Kop. Liverpool ought to have won by more and they will have seen nothing to make them fear Old Trafford.</p>

I really do wish people would add a bit of perspective to the "Liverpool got everyone banned from Europe" Farrago! UEFA Banned all English Clubs from competing in Europe Fair enough, it happened because of Liverpool, but it's not as if Liverpool actually said "well if you're gonna ban us, then ban everyone else as well". And don't forget the political motivation behind the ban, English Clubs were starting to get a foothold in European Competitions, as well as Liverpool, Aston Villa Nottingham Forest, Spurs, even Ipswich all tasted European success prior to 1985 Continental Europe wasn't getting a sniff! Nobody's denying what happened and us, more than anyone are the last ones to deny it. They were trying to think of some way to restore what they saw as "The Status Quo" and this was a golden opportunity, it's a downright disgrace that people had to die in order for that to happen

Where you hope we're headed and where we actually are are a million miles apart from each other. We're punching way above our weight (but only when we feel like it). For Klopp to fulfill his potential he needs world class talent. Name me a single Liverpool player who fits that badge: day in, day out, quality. Let's see how far your delusion goes.

Thanks, I write one of these like every week for fun, but I don't post many of them because I feel a bit self-conscious and don't want to bother people too much who are just here for actual, more direct football stuff you know. I had way more on this too, I had Ali-Frazier and Foreman in there I think, a whole thing on radio football, shore fishing and French football broadcasts, but it was cut for time.

It's funny only a few years go Liverpool v Man Utd played out a 0-0 draw on a Sunday afternoon and home counties hacks were taking how these games had become meaningless in an era of the Wenger everything is moving south . Here we are playing each other in a European competition and who would have imagined that a few years a go.? The amout of interest as I count is 1727 comments seems a bit more than meaningless to me but then maybe Europe is just that little more interesting than Little England and it's Premier Leauge.

Surely Ed Woodward is missing a trick here? The one thing at the club he hasn't monetised is the right to sit in the manager's seat during match days. Imagine what that could fetch at auction on a per game basis. Fire LVG and auction off the managership in one game chunks, no not one game chunks winner stays on. Two birds, one stone.

And yet with decisions of this kind, they do get it right more often than not. It's the really unjust mistakes which we remember. However the game was won, the result was the right one despite two flawed decisions. For what it's worth, I can see Liverpool beating them again next week, 1 - 2. Next round, Klopp v his old club Dortmund?

And my point is that they don't have the talent that good coaching is going to be able to do enough for. That's why I said what I did about them not having anyone that you would trade for an LFC like for like at their position. Yeah they need 4+...way plus.

I honestly don't think Liverpool are ahead of United. I certainly wouldn't swap United's squad for Liverpool's at the moment. Don't forget that United have also suffered from a horrendous injury situation. Luke Shaw was playing really well when he was injured and it'll be a big boost to get him back. United also look to have some good young players coming through - and they are better than Liverpool's youngsters who have only been trusted against the likes of Exeter whereas players like Rashford have been scoring against Arsenal.

another dismal MU performance - it would certainly appear that LVG is only a one trick man - and that trick certainly does not work with the players available. If he is not capable of doing any better than I am afraid it is time to hand in the towel.

It's from the FA laws of the game. I can see your logic but on the line is, and always has been, a penalty. You can actually email the FA and they will clarify this for you.

The point is 15 players aren't needed with good management and coaching. A lot of the United squad could be kept as 'squad players' but the starting 11 need 4+ players.Mercs playing for money haha. You act as if players go to Liverpool for the love of the club. Also Liverpool will likely be without CL football too so are in the same position as United in attracting players. Only as you said United can pay the higher wages.

Yes, 15 players. Who from the team they put out would you take over his counterpart from Liverpool aside from the GK they'll be losing in summer? I can't see anyone. I'll entertain discussion of Chris Smalling, and that's it. That was maybe the worst and dumbest 4-2-3-1 ever, followed by one of the worst and dumbest 3-5-2s. Their best hope was to go 4-5-1 and clog up the midfield and play for a 0-0. 



Author::::cpeskett
DateTime::::2016-03-11T16:32:34Z
Seems to me it is not definitive and could be construed either way, which would allow for it to be ruled a penalty or not. Not really a good thing to have on the books. It should say whether the line itself is part of the penalty area or not. Considering the number of times this has been in question, it really should be clarified properly.



Author::::Klopptimism
DateTime::::2016-03-11T16:24:30Z
Yeah...that's not what it meant at all. I feel confident that's not how Ferguson would describe knocking Liverpool off.
