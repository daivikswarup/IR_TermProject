English game lacks Champions League quality – but at least it is unpredictable

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>wo down, two to go. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/chelsea-psg-champions-league-match-report" title="">Chelsea’s exit from the Champions League</a> means half of the Premier League’s four entrants have gone and, barring something miraculous in the Camp Nou next week, Arsenal will join them, leaving only Manchester City, assuming they <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/24/dynamo-kyiv-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report" title="">finish the job against Dynamo Kyiv</a>.</p>

<p>Had it not been for a tough knockout draw for Italian sides this season, the Premier League’s fourth Champions League slot might have come under serious threat from Serie A for 2017-18. As it is, England has picked up half a point more than Italy so far this season and, with only two Italian sides left in European competition one of them Juventus, who must go to Bayern Munich after a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/23/juventus-bayern-munich-champions-league-match-report" title="">2-2 draw in the home leg</a>, that advantage should be increased. Given the Premier League’s wealth – it has 17 of the 30 clubs with the highest revenue in the world, according to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/21/manchester-united-deloitte-football-rich-list-premier-league-real-madrid-barcelona" title="">latest Deloitte report</a> – the fact that the coefficient is even an issue is faintly embarrassing.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/chelsea-psg-champions-league-match-report">PSG and Zlatan Ibrahimovic send laboured Chelsea crashing out</a> </p>

<p>If nothing else, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/manchester-united-liverpool-europe-sir-alex-ferguson" title="">Liverpool and Manchester United</a> being drawn together guarantees the Premier League another half-point. The Premier League’s coefficient should be robust enough to withstand the Italian challenge for at least one more season.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t alter the fact these are strange times for the Premier League. Assuming there is no remarkable comeback from <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity">Manchester City</a>, there will be a different league champion for a fourth season in succession. Not since 1993 – the first year of the Manchester United hegemony – has there been flux like that. Before that it was 1973, the first year of the Liverpool hegemony. It seems unlikely this is the beginning of a period of domination for Leicester, Tottenham or Arsenal.</p>

<p>Next season will probably begin with more serious challengers for Champions League qualification than any other since the Premier League began in 1992. This may be the most even top-end for half a century. There are the four wealthiest clubs, Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea, of whom at least two and possibly three will be under new management (with the likelihood that doubts about the fourth, Arsène Wenger at Arsenal, will become <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/08/arsene-wenger-banner-arsenal-injuries-fa-cup-hull" title="">more and more vocal</a>) and therefore in transition, that cover-all excuse for English clubs who are pretty much all always in transition. There will be Tottenham with their exciting, young side and highly impressive manager. There’ll be Liverpool with their inspirational manager who will have had a summer to mould the squad as he would like.</p>

<p>Those six will be the favourites, but the supporting cast is strong as well: West Ham, looking to take a more permanent place at the top table after their move to the Olympic Stadium; Stoke City, with their host of former Champions League winners and other £20m-plus signings; Everton, buoyed by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/28/everton-majority-shareholder-farhad-moshiri-increase-stake-bill-kenwright" title="">fresh investment</a>; and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/09/marcilo-agro-leicester-city-barney-ronay" title="">Leicester</a>, who may be champions.</p>

<p>Louis van Gaal has blamed the fact the Premier League is “a rat race” for its struggles in the Champions League. If that is true, it’s only going to be rattier and racier next season. It is possible <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/01/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-new-manager-summer" title="">Pep Guardiola</a> will settle rapidly and turn City into a relentless winning machine, or that the new man at Chelsea will perform immediate surgery and galvanise the remnants of last season’s champions, but at the moment it feels as though next season could be the equivalent of a huge bar-fight in a Western, a giant melee of flying bottles and chairs, with the foreign sophisticates standing to one side, polishing their stilettos and watching on with a mixture of horror and fascination.</p>

<p>For years, the cliche was that the Premier League was a competition in which anybody could beat anybody and, while that isn’t quite true, reality has moved closer to the image of late. Only 12 games in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague">Premier League</a> this season have been decided by a margin of four goals or more; in Germany 19 have and in Spain 24. Spain’s performances across the two European competitions (none of its seven clubs have yet been eliminated) gives the lie to any thought of La Liga being about only three clubs but it is the case that there are more easier games there.</p>

<p>The gap between top and bottom of the Premier League is narrower than in the other two nations with four Champions League entrants. That’s understandable: the top side in the Premier League in 2014-15 took only 1.53 times <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2015/06/02/where-the-money-went-chelsea-top-premier-league-cash-table-with-99m-prize-020601/" title="">as much in prize money as the bottom team</a>, as opposed to a ration of 11.3:1 in Spain and 2:1 on Germany.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/manchester-united-liverpool-europe-sir-alex-ferguson">Liverpool v Manchester United: a deep-rooted, tribalistic rivalry finally set for Europe | Daniel Taylor</a> </p>

<p>That might not be a recipe for European success (although it would help if English clubs didn’t waste so much money in their demand for instant success; they’re like an old housemate of mine who, when the kettle broke, would order a flashy new one online rather than simply changing the fuse, leaving us with a cupboard overspilling with perfectly serviceable nearly new kettles), but it has led to a league that is unpredictable and fun.</p>

<p>This is subjective but, by comparison with the Premier League this season, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague">Champions League</a> has felt a little stale – PSG playing Chelsea, again; Barcelona playing Arsenal, again; Bayern potentially playing City, again: a long weary march to largely predictable semi-finalists when it finally gets going for real.</p>

<p>In that regard, it’s hardly surprising if the big clubs are looking at the Champions League and wondering how it may be enlivened. The problem is that, with their thinking dominated by self-interest, their conclusion seems to be the competition needs more of the same, a guaranteed presence of a complacent elite. The Premier League this season suggests the opposite is true.</p>

<p>The recent complaint – not unreasonably – has been there is a lack of quality at the top end of the Premier League, something that, for all the delights of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy, Dele Alli and Harry Kane, is borne out by European results. But if the alternative is a league season that’s done by March, it may be a trade worth making.</p>

But for Abramovitch and the Qataris, there would have been only 3 winners, so I guess that's a slight improvement, although Liverpool made a brave effort in 2009 and 2014 with the crumbs from the Red Sox' table.

It has been a very unpredictable Premier League season but there has only been five winners of it since it began in 1992. Hardly unpredictable in that respect.

But our league is the richest in the world and players come to it because they get more money than elsewhere. Which is just as well because they have zero chance of winning any Champions League medals.

The trouble with the theory that we are somehow still the best - i.e. the most entertaining - while also conceding that the quality is inferior, is that we end up celebrating style over substance. The same people who support this theory are the first ones to criticise Arsene Wenger for his quest to play beautiful, entertaining but ultimately losing football. I like Arsenal and Wenger for their desire and passion and ultimately because they are different, but you can't base a league on this philosophy. For one it doesn't lift the standard as a whole. We see Leicester, bless them, being able to take on our "big boys" not only because of the diminished quality of Man U, Chelsea, City etc, but because of the formulaic nature of our league. The league may be unpredictable in results but the general play is less creative, less subtle and less mercurial than our European counterparts. We look ponderous and one dimensional not just against the top drawer clubs but even against second tier clubs, who have the benefit of playing against the best every week in their leagues. England is in danger of losing one of our 4 places in the Champions League because of our clubs poor performances in Europe. Will we be so smug when that happens? And don't get me started on how our League feeds into our National teams inability to cut it anymore on the world stage....

Really? What a pathetic excuse of an article! Don't get me wrong, I support Liverpool, have and always will but the quality of football in England is just utter crap! To render this crap as competitiveness in lieu of quality football is reaching for a truth far too inconvenient to believe.

It's extraordinary nobody faces the reality.The premier league top teams fail because English players can't play simple.Dont believe me?think I am biased?The European championships will be going 56 years this summer and only one large European football country has never won it,never indeed made the final. Extraordinary fact not faced up to by EPL lovers but not by the owners of the big 5 who are in a state of panic over all the money the Chinese superleague are spending.Imagine all that Asian tv money going east literally.

EPL is competitive, but their best are not in the league of barca, bayern, real madrid yet. even their mid teams struggles to beat teams from la liga, bundesliga and serie a. The problem is epl is short sighted and are demands the result instantly, which in the longer run creates bad result for the team.

The biggest enemy of english football ( including BPL ) is....Your tradition. People who act as Technical Directors of FA, overseeing coaching and other training programmes at all levels of the game are responsible for that style of playing football . Not only them , they are only a part of system, part of the english football history. Most of english BPL teams look slightly archaic - " harder, better, faster, stronger "...and even a few very talented guys as Aguero, D.Silva, Hazard, Ozil, Sanchez, Coutinho...possibly Mahrez, D.Costa, Willian, Kante , Y. Toure or De Bruyne will not change it. Great proactive coaches with great success in Europe lost their minds in BPL , they couldn't change english mentality. That's a long tradition, 1-7 with Hungary on 1953 didn't change it in long term...This season is not such interesting as You are talking about, Man City, United, LFC, Chelsea ...all they are playing is a big s...t . That's why Leicester is no 1 in England. Arsenal or Tottenham are not so strong to beat a new cinderella ( btw - what a shame)..., however they will play in CL next season, i think so.

I completely agree. But furthermore, it should be also questioned a general spirit of the EPL. Buy buy buy! Managers, team executives but also fans, in 1st place. Rarely building of the team, development of coherent squad is priority. Mostly buying players they were playing excellent in continental clubs. Included in teams without really matching together. Like English women fashion taste, buying something that looks good on some celebrity... And put together with other pieces with disastrous result!

In recent years there's definitely been the sense that 'our' teams get Europe's rejects, particularly from Spain. Fabregas, Pedro, Djeko, Salah, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Yaya Toure, David Silva (arguably), while the really top, top players (to use a Lawrensonism) have gone the other way: Ronaldo, Suarez, Modric, Bale. Most players who arrive in the Prem come when they are past their peak or not quite good enough. There has been, to date, no Pogba, Varane, Verratti, Reus or Draxler – players approaching greatness, on the way up. We've ended up with the likes of Schweinsteiger and Dimechaelis, past their prime, and definitely on the way down. Or we've taken a punt on slightly troubled characters like Arnautovic, Suarez and Balotelli, with mixed success.

I don't watch all the games (who can?) but I do try to watch the highlights.1 - Barca, Real, Bayern are simply in a different class compared to any other team in their domestic league or European Competition.2 - Aside from this year, pretty much the same teams have finished in the top 4/5 in EPL3 - Liverpool hasn't won the EPL title - for a big team - nor have the Spurs4 - This season has highlighted the incompetence that Big Money breeds, from chelsea's player revolt against Jose to Man U collapse.5 - when I watch highlights (BL, EPL, La Liga) it doesn't look to me as if the small teams simply give up when they play Barca/Bayern.6 - Incompetence is not competitiveness.

Just to point out - that was only a joke. It would be great if more English players were playing at these clubs but the sad fact is they are not because they aren't good enough. But those who are there are obviously there on merit cause nothing else counts.
