Chelsea drop out of Europe’s elite – finding a way back will not be easy




DateTime::::2016-03-10T22:30:16+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t says much about the downsizing of expectations at Chelsea that there was no profound sense of shock at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/chelsea-psg-champions-league-match-report">elimination from Europe</a>. Guus Hiddink emerged post-match on Wednesday to acknowledge <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/09/chelsea-transition-guus-hiddink-psg-champions-league">a period of “transition” awaits</a>, one he will not oversee himself, while, out on the touchline, his stand-in captain was reflecting on the ramifications of life on the outside looking in.</p>

<p>It was as if all this had long been grudgingly anticipated. “It’s a huge competition, one of the reasons players come to this club,” Branislav Ivanovic said. “People dream about playing <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/championsleague">Champions League</a> football and this dream is over for the moment. We all hope we are going to be a strong team next season so we can fight to get back into this competition …” He did not follow that up with a “but”, largely because it went implied.</p>

<p>Roman Abramovich’s club are at a crossroads. For the first time in 14 seasons under the oligarch’s ownership they will begin a campaign outside Europe’s elite in August when, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/chelsea-antonio-conte-backroom-staff-talks">presumably, Antonio Conte</a> will survey the Premier League landscape from the home dugout at Stamford Bridge. The notion trotted out, usually when considering the potentially unique nature of the title challenges being mustered by Leicester City or Tottenham Hotspur, is that Chelsea will be back stronger than ever next term, eager to put this aberration of a season behind them; that theirs will be a fleeting period out of contention.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/10/chelsea-antonio-conte-backroom-staff-talks">Chelsea give Antonio Conte the green light to bring in his backroom staff</a> </p>

<p>It is a dangerous assumption to make, even if based on the notion Abramovich tends to throw money at any problem. Perhaps that will be the strategy again, turning a blind eye to the reality this is a club making plans for the outrageously expensive redevelopment of Stamford Bridge. Only last summer the Premier League winners had hoped, albeit belatedly and fleetingly, to lure Paul Pogba from Juventus for a British record £78m. Yet, while money tends to talk in football, there is understandable concern within both squad and hierarchy that a lack of Champions League football will dampen prospective recruits’ enthusiasm for moving to the club.</p>

<p>That would leave <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea">Chelsea</a> competing for lower pedigree players in a riskier market, for all that Conte is understood to be pressing the merits of Edinson Cavani, on the fringes at Paris Saint-Germain, and Roma’s Radja Nainggolan. Even at inflated prices, they would not necessarily be purchasing guaranteed quality. Outgoing transfers would normally part-fund an overhaul, with players such as Oscar, Nemanja Matic and Loïc Rémy likely to be available, if only on the quiet. Although there is no real appetite to sell either player, it is not outlandish to contemplate Diego Costa agitating for a return to Spain, or Eden Hazard pining for an opportunity in La Liga, though whether even Real Madrid would go as high as £50m for a player – on £200,000 a week and contracted to 2020 – whose form has spluttered all season is open to debate.</p>

<p>Even if funds are provided or generated to offer leeway, however, is there much evidence to suggest Chelsea would spend the money effectively to transform this team into contenders? If the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/17/jose-mourinho-chelsea-michael-emenalo-palpable-tensions">“palpable discord” of the latter days of José Mourinho’s tenure</a> drew the focus in December, then the deficiencies of the club’s scattergun recruitment policy, overseen by the technical director Michael Emenalo, must come under scrutiny now. In the summer of 2014, when Mourinho’s agent Jorge Mendes had facilitated Costa’s arrival from Atlético Madrid and negotiations with Darren Dein over Cesc Fàbregas had been so swiftly concluded, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/09/chelsea-jose-mourinho-transfer-market-premier-league-">Chelsea’s transfer policy had been their strength</a>. Now it feels confused, a muddle played out while players such as mich, Romelu Lukaku and Ryan Bertrand excel elsewhere.</p>

<p>Of the nine senior players signed in the past three windows, four were in the squad who lost to PSG, the home side’s lineup forced to include a young left winger, Kenedy, as an emergency full-back to counter Ángel Di María and Lucas Moura. Mendes and Mourinho were culpable for Radamel Falcao’s unproductive but always risky loan move. More prominent of late has been the influence of Kia Joorabchian, in securing a hefty fee for Ramires from Jiangsu Suning – he had previously helped secure Willian and Oscar – but also in the signing of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/30/chelsea-confirm-signing-matt-miazga">Matt Miazga from New York Red Bulls</a> and, more mystifyingly, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/29/chelsea-signing-alexandre-pato-guus-hiddink-no-gamble">Alexandre Pato from Corinthians</a>.</p>

<p>At a time when Chelsea are pinned to mid-table, where was the logic in recruiting a 26-year-old Brazilian who was always going to require six weeks of intensive “pre-season” fitness work even to make the bench? Moreover, what kind of message does that send out to Dominic Solanke, Isaiah Brown, Patrick Bamford, Victor Moses or any of the other forwards in exile, or even Tammy Abraham among the in-house junior ranks? That betrayed a lack of long-termism which hardly bodes well.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/09/diego-costa-chelsea-paris-saint-germain-zlatan-ibrahimovic-champions-league">Chelsea's Champions League exit against PSG feels like an ending | Barney Ronay</a> </p>

<p>This is a squad bloated with fringe players. There may be sound thinking to loaning out youngsters with bright futures so they gain first-team opportunities outside a poorly regarded under-21 development league, but Chelsea have not just brought in youth. Papy Djilobodji is 27 and was apparently purchased as a back-up but, by the time he was needed with John Terry and Kurt Zouma injured, he had been loaned out to Werder Bremen. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/01/chelsea-reading-defender-michael-hector">Michael Hector</a> is 23 and by no means a regular in Reading’s Championship squad. He anticipates linking up with Chelsea for their pre-season tour but is Conte really going to be leaning on him or Miazga at centre-half next term with Terry departed and Zouma still in rehab?</p>

<p>Perhaps, at relatively small fees, such purchases were considered no-risk. Fees of £4m or £2.7m could be considered small change in the money-flushed world of a club regularly competing in the Champions League. Yet, when around 60 “senior” players report back to Cobham in the summer, the squad through which Conte will sift will appear crammed with faded champions, underachievers, stopgaps, prospects and even journeymen. Pinpointing a clear strategy aimed at restoring the team to the pinnacle may be easier said than done.</p>

<p>“We have disappointed ourselves so this is a moment when everybody has to be really motivated,” said Ivanovic while victorious PSG players drifted past him towards the exit. “This motivation cannot be just for the next couple of months. It has to be for a long, long, long period.”</p>

<p>The fear is Chelsea’s route back will be that tortuous. It would certainly be easier for them to spiral further out of contention than clamber swiftly back to the top.</p>

Chelsea was incredibly lucky to win the European Cup in 2012 and the players didn't want to play for Mourinho in 2015, became complacent after winning the league.

I wish I had your blind optimism. You never know. Conte may turn out to be an amazing manager who squeezes the very best out of the existing players, brings the youngsters through, buys wisely and gets his tactics right for every game. I just can't see it though.

Agree totally about backing from the board. They had a choice in December to back the manager or the players and chose the players. But Mourinho is his own worst enemy. He just doesn't trust the young players. SAF gambled a fair bit with youngsters, sometimes losing games in the process, but he gave them playing time to see whether they could make it or not. Mourinho might give them a few minutes, but more often than not they are out on loan, never to return.

I don't see any manager being at Chelsea long term given Abramovich's itchy trigger finger, player power, and his expectations of constant silverware. Ranieri won nothing (sacked), Mourinho fell out with Roman for getting Shevchenko and ignoring his own requests (sacked), players don't like Scolari's methods (sacked), Ancelotti wins nothing in his 2nd year (sacked), players don't like AVB (sacked), Di Matteo (sacked), and Mourinho fell out with members of the team (sacked due to palpable discord).

As the Manchester poster above points out Chelsea are and were a big name. Chelsea and Liverpool shared some great exciting league and cup matches during their sixties peaks when both teams were top five material. Packed houses at the bridge for such games. Before Abramovich Chelsea still were placed 5th or 6th in the all time average attendance league table. Not bad cosidering they were as average as you claim, or maybe their supporters were made of sterner stuff , although of course that doesnt fit with your narrative.

You're correct about the groups of players but wrong about money not changing anything. If you have money you can buy more players of higher ability. And that changes everything.

You're not really disagreeing with me as such rather than justifying why they do it which is certainly valid as a financial model. But does it work? The prices they pay for young talent is hardly pin money and I suspect only a few go for more than they paid for them [although open to proof to the contrary].

All of which is correct but doesn't come close to successfully arguing against Gargoyle_Waiting.You have been able to find what, 5 players, who enjoyed playing for Chelsea, us that really the best you can do? How many of those players spent their peak years at the club? Best never played you you at all, Venables left to join Spurs, Wilkins jumped ship as soon as you were relegated, and Greaves didn't exactly come running back to Chelsea after he left Milan.It is absolutely true that before Abramovich Chelsea were never anything more than a mid-table first division (old speak) side. You won what? The top division once in 1954/55 and a couple of FA Cups. Oh and a Cup Winners' Cup.You attendances were not that great either, between 1987 and 1997 for example your attendance was between 15,000 and 27,000. Is that better than West Ham? I don't think so. Gargoyle is correct in his assertion. Upper mid-table.In a good season.

Bizarrely Mourinho would probably be the best manager to turn it around next season and get them back quickly to winning ways. However, he's never delivered on a long term plan. 2 years of instant success is what he brings, with no plan for the next 2. Pales into insignificance compared to SAF who managed to rebuild a winning Utd team several times over 26 years.

They came close but Chelsea never really quite made it as one of the European elite. Few people at any point would have put Chelsea in the same bracket as Bayern, Barca - or even a slightly misfiring Real Madrid. I mean, I know they clung on to scape a European Cup but so did Porto and nobody would describe them as one of Europe's elite.

Madrid would do that, but they have a transfer ban looming. And would Hazard risk dropping himself into a run of poor form he might not climb out of right before the Euros?

The very best players will go to Real Madrid or Barcelona due to the climate and bizarre low taxation rules for footballers, PSG for an easy life and whopping salary, or Man City for huge amounts of money, to work with Guardiola, prove themselves in the toughest league in the world and play CL (it would be interesting if City finished 5th). No-one decent will come to Chelsea to play in just the PL.

Back in the day when I used to watch Best, Law and Charlton, the match with Chelsea was always one of the big games of the season. You could have mentioned Chopper Harris, a great player we loved to hate. I've always thought of them as one of the top clubs.

... but your final comment gives the game away. If you benchmark your squad by comparing it to ManU's, you'll find yourself in perpetual mid-table. In the real world, the "Sky 5" no longer have an automatic right to lord it over the rest of the PL.
