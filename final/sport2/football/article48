USA and Alex Morgan on a roll: what we learned from the SheBelieves Cup




DateTime::::2016-03-10T14:08:54+0000



<p>It may have had an unusual name, but the US Soccer-hosted <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ussoccer.com/womens-national-team/tournaments/2016-shebelieves-cup">SheBelieves Cup</a> served as a massive test for the world’s top teams before the Rio Olympics and Euro 2017. USA topped the invitational tournament, beating out Germany, France and England, and while England will look ahead to the Euros, the others are prepping for this summer’s Olympics, where all three will be title contenders.<br/></p>

<p>Here’s what we learned from the first inaugural SheBelieves Cup:</p>

<p>It was the prevailing theme during the Women’s World Cup: the Americans weren’t actually playing that well for most of the tournament, but they just kept winning. In that sense, the SheBelieves Cup was a continuation of this past summer. For long stretches, it looked like the Americans wouldn’t get past their three opponents – and yet, somehow, late in the game, they always found a way on top. Three games, three wins and it all ended in a shiny new <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2016/03/09/23/29/160309-wnt-shebelieves-cup-trophy-gabrielle-rein">cup-shaped trophy</a>.</p>

<p>The fact that the Americans can’t stop winning – even despite huge roster turnover from the group that won the World Cup – is a testament to not just the team’s roster depth, but the ceiling on how well they are capable of performing. On the women’s side where the full senior team competes in both the World Cup and the Olympic Games, no team has ever won a World Cup and then turned around to win an Olympics. The US is on a hot streak that suggests coach Jill Ellis is out to make history.</p>

<p>No American player has been both simultaneously criticized and praised more in the past year than Morgan. She scored just once in this summer’s World Cup and some critics felt her status as an automatic starter for the US should be questioned for the first time in years. Even as she became the USA’s last remaining go-to striker due to retirements and pregnancies, her form paled in comparison to 2012, when she scored goals at a rate of about one per game. </p>

<p>Well – that is, until now. With eight goals in nine appearances over 2016, she is back on the same track as her 2012 levels of production, when she scored 28 goals in 31 appearances. Her standout SheBelieves Cup performance and apparent return to form should silence the wave of criticism that has been growing since injuries disrupted her previous two years with the national team.</p>

<p>It’s true that when given the opportunities, players like Christen Press and Crystal Dunn have stepped up and looked like dominant forces in the US attack. Throughout the SheBelieves Cup and Concacaf Olympic qualifiers, many of their goals were ones of individual brilliance. That, along with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/16/one-for-the-road-abby-wambachs-final-match-closes-book-on-unassailable-legacy">the retirement</a> of Morgan’s longtime striker partner Abby Wambach, had some critics suggesting Dunn and Press would make better lone target strikers than Morgan in coach Jill Ellis’ system.</p>

<p>But against Germany and France, the No 2 and No 3 in the world, Morgan produced fireworks, using her trademark explosive speed and finishing with superb precision. Against Germany in the tournament’s de facto title match, Morgan <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/PCarrESPN/status/707761564053540865">was the heart of the attack</a> in the final third and her goal was a stunning display of talent. That, and another splendid game-winner against France, was enough to earn her the Golden Boot and Golden Ball of the tournament. She belongs in the starting line-up and she’s not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Striker Jodie Taylor may have <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thefa.com/news/england/womens/2016/mar/jodie-taylor-shebelieves-cup-tampa-florida-usa">summed it up</a> best: “If this tournament had come this time last year, a few people might have thought we’d be a little bit out of our depth. But it shows how far we have come. To even be invited to a tournament like this shows what the rest of the world thinks of us.”</p>

<p>With the tournament all said and done, the Lionesses continued to prove that they can compete against the world’s top teams and their <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report">historic third-place finish</a> at the Women’s World Cup was far from a fluke. The Americans <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/03/united-states-see-off-stubborn-england-on-late-crystal-dunn-thunderbolt">slid past England</a> on a spectacular late strike from substitute Crystal Dunn, but the Lionesses largely held the Americans at bay and looked comfortable doing it. Mark Sampson at the helm of the squad has been something of a revelation and his side was difficult to break down all throughout the SheBelieves Cup. </p>

<p>Though Sampson has made the Lionesses difficult to beat, by the time the Euro Cup arrives next year, they’ll have to get better at doing what it takes to win. In every match of the SheBelieves Cup, England was out-shot and they ultimately finished third in the overall standings. They have plenty of time and a strong group of attacking options, so given their trajectory since Sampson took over in 2013, there’s no reason to believe they won’t start creating more chances.</p>

<p>After the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/07/were-the-us-womens-soccer-team-right-to-boycott-their-own-victory-tour">US players revolted</a> in December and US Soccer canceled a planned friendly over concerns about the poor field conditions, federation president Sunil Gulati partially blamed the dust-up on US Soccer’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/sports/soccer/sunil-gulati-apologizes-for-us-soccer-cancellation.html">failure to inspect</a> the field beforehand. The attorney for the players union declared the incident part of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/28/uswnt-collective-bargaining-agreement-artificial-turf">larger discrimination</a> the team faces from US Soccer.</p>

<p>But when goalkeeper Hope Solo <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://twitter.com/hopesolo/status/707372433335033856">tweeted complaints Tuesday about field conditions at FAU Stadium</a>, where the US beat Germany on Wednesday, it proved the issue is far more complicated than artificial turf versus natural grass or where the men’s national team plays versus where the women play. FAU’s field is natural grass and both the national teams have played there in the past two years, eliminating common complaints about how the women’s team is treated. But the grass also looked patchy and uneven, scattered all over with bumps and sandy plots that lacked grass. It wasn’t a nice pitch.</p>

<p>Given the team’s dug-in heels over contract negotiations and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/04/explained-why-us-soccer-is-suing-its-own-world-cup-winners">a lawsuit with US Soccer</a>, it seems even US Soccer’s promise that the team will play on grass this year won’t be enough to cool tensions between the two sides. A US Soccer spokesman did not respond to a request from the Guardian for comment on whether the field was inspected beforehand. In-court arguments for the US Soccer lawsuit are <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2d1f91d3a524400b90ed8a7ce03cc777/judge-considers-right-strike-us-womens-soccer-team">set for May 25</a> – and they ought to be interesting.</p>

"SheBelieves Cup" really needs a better name. Sounds like a sanitary product.

I too was wondering what is up with France a little bit. I know they were missing Amandine Henry and Wendie Renard but they looked a bit flat. Isn't that always the criticism of that team? So much talent and so much trouble stepping up when they need to? I was struck by how little I even noticed Louisa Necib, one of the best strikers in Europe, maybe even the world. She has just been invisible and the team doesn't seem very confident. I do think though that it was nice to see the coaches generally take the games seriously. Everyone held onto their subs and treated them like real games.

The US keeps finding ways to win because agree or not, Ellis has brought in enough of the best players to make it happen. Moments of individual brilliance are enabled by efforts all the players make to play a possession oriented, more technical, more strategic game. The creativity level from just a few short years ago is encouraging. Is it pretty yet? not always, but glimpses of what it can be are there.

The other positive development is the nice collection of 1v1 skills in Press, Dunn, Pugh, Heath, and Klingenberg to go with the injured Rapinoe. O'Hara is also a significant upgrade on Krieger.

Between Morgan, Press, and Dunn the U.S. scored some really nice goals in this tournament. That's certainly the best one I've ever seen from Alex.

Hopefully the sports nets provide better coverage of this in the future. U would think six matches between top teams, none separated by more than a goal would be worth putting on tv

I said this when the controversy came up about the USWNT complaining that about playing on artificial turf while the men never do, and I'll say it again: a quality artificial field is better than many of the "grass" fields the men have played on in recent years, especially the ones where the grass was just rolled out over a turf field.

The RIO Olympics are a couple of months away. Need to convince all that USWNT is gearing up for a very competitive tournament... The gold medal is not a given........

The Morgan goal is Henry-esque absolutely brilliant.

Alex Morgan's goal is the best goal I can recall seeing in a women's international match. It was an amazing touch and finish in traffic. That is indeed finding a way to win.

"It would be a Better Thing, though, if it were not held in the same season as the Algarve Cup". The Algarve Cup is an annual event, so by your logic this new tournament (with a ridiculous name) would never happen again. I'd also suggest that playing 3 games in a week against top-5 teams is more likely to make those teams better than romps against much lesser teams where the result is not in doubt after 10 minutes (see US's recent Concacaf qualifying "tournament").

The "Inaugural" She-Believes Cup.... Indicating future iterations. If that's so, it's a Good Thing. It would be a Better Thing, though, if it were not held in the same season as the Algarve Cup, a competition that gives more teams the rare opportunity for competitive matches. Womens' teams in general need more such, and a competition that annually steals away four of the top teams for what is, essentially, a fundraiser, will do more harm than good for the sport as a whole. And in the long run, those top teams will lose out as well. If you don't have real competition, you don't get better.

Meantime, in Asia, there was a REAL tournament... and the Aussies smashed 'em... watch out old world teams, the Matildas are on the prowl...
