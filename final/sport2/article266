R&A between rock and a hard place over Trump and Turnberry Open

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">E</span></span>ven months of shadowing his predecessor, Peter Dawson, cannot have prepared Martin Slumbers for the storm that engulfed him upon taking office <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/15/martin-slumbers-new-chief-executive-r-and-a-peter-dawson" title="">as the chief executive of the R&amp;A</a>. Sympathy for Slumbers, who had hitherto enjoyed a successful corporate life in blissful anonymity, is legitimate.</p>

<p>If Donald Trump’s 2014 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/29/donald-trump-turnberry-golf-course-resort" title="">purchase of Turnberry</a> was regarded as controversial because of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/10/donald-trump-scotland-golf-course" title="">rancour over the tycoon’s golf course development</a> in Aberdeenshire, such fears were overridden by hope. Turnberry had not worked under a series of previous owners, the Ailsa course was badly in need of adjustment and here was someone – as welcomed by Dawson – willing to put in necessary time and, most pertinently, cash. Few others have displayed a willingness to do likewise in recent times in the UK or Ireland.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/22/open-donald-trump-turnberry-2022">No Open for Donald Trump’s Turnberry until 2022 at the earliest, R&amp;A confirms</a> </p>

<p>One glance at Slumbers’ increasingly uncomfortable demeanour on Monday, however, illustrated <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/22/open-donald-trump-turnberry-2022" title="">the impact of the Trump/Turnberry union</a>. The issue here is straightforward; can the R&amp;A retain the Ailsa course as an Open venue while Trump – advocating <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-mexico-presidential-speech-latino-hispanic" title="">blocking Mexicans</a>, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting" title="">banning Muslims</a> and causing widespread offence as part of his campaign to become president of the United States – holds the keys? Surely the alliance is at best incongruous, at worst impossible?</p>

<p>Slumbers seemed somewhat taken aback by the level of scrutiny afforded to this topic, offering a continual willingness to “focus on the golf”. Good luck with that, as the world and its uncle offer opinion on what penalties or otherwise should be attached to Trump’s vociferously stated views. The chief executive slipped down the disappointing and cliched road of being unwilling to publicly mix sport and politics; not only is that crossover the very essence of this debate, it is ludicrous to insist the two never shall meet.</p>

<p>Just when the R&amp;A stepped into something approaching modernity with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/18/royal-ancient-women-golf" title="">the acceptance of female members</a>, another monumental narrative with far-reaching implications landed at the door.</p>

<p>Yet through no fault of his own, Slumbers finds himself in the impossible position of trying to maintain the status of one of Britain’s finest courses, placate a loose-cannon owner and being seen to uphold the reputation of a sport that has constantly suffered because of a discriminatory past. Regardless of how you break this scenario down, the R&amp;A cannot win.</p>

<p>On the face of it, the R&amp;A and its chief executive have two options. It could immediately insist all ties will be severed with Turnberry and no major will be held there until such a point as Trump vacates the premises. Via this stance, golf – while anxious to be as inclusive as possible – could for once claim the moral high ground.</p>

<p>The alternative? One as advocated by Dawson, who claimed it “absurd” that comments made on the political trail in the United States could influence where the R&amp;A chooses to host championships. Head down, plough on, continue to support Trump’s rehabilitation of Turnberry – the resort as well as the golf course – and simply handle all the flak that comes with it.</p>

<p>The trouble is, both of those approaches carry inherent dangers.</p>

<p>If the R&amp;A temporarily casts Turnberry aside, it would be to the detriment of the Open Championship and an area of Scotland that benefits enormously in economic terms from the rare appearance of the Claret Jug. Trump wouldn’t be the sole loser; golf would join him.</p>

<p>In the short term, Trump would inevitably get by with bravado and wave upon wave of big-spending American visitors but sooner or later the absence of the Open – or, presumably, a women’s or seniors’ equivalent – would bite. This wasn’t in the script when Trump took Turnberry on, meaning quite how he would react to a snub from golfing officialdom is probably not an appealing concept. He is a hard-nosed businessman who will play by hard-nosed rules.</p>

<p>In a wider context, there is debate to be had as to whether the political views of an owner – or membership – should in fact determine where golf tournaments are held. It is hardly a leap of faith to infer that a significant proportion of those who control some of the other venues that stage the Open would not differ largely from Trump in terms of political allegiance. You need not wander far at some of the UK’s top courses to meet with genuine cause for offence.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/18/royal-ancient-women-golf">R&amp;A decision to admit women is hailed as symbolic moment for sport</a> </p>

<p>Under plan B, the R&amp;A could shrug its shoulders and be as adamant as possible that Turnberry retains its status despite what Trump may or may not say. The public backlash for that would be as inevitable as it would be enormous. Golf’s governing body would appear arrogant and out of touch, disregarding sensitive issues in the name of feeding the corporate beast that is the third major of the year. Slumbers would be ridiculed for undermining talk of inclusiveness by contradictory behaviour.</p>

<p>The scale with which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/30/kim-hyo-joo-womens-british-open-donald-trump" title="">Trump upstaged</a> the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/02/women-british-open-golf-turnberry" title="">Women’s British Open last summer at Turnberry</a> was both appalling and an insult to the integrity of the tournament. One can only assume that an Open would be worse, with the R&amp;A thereby existing in a state of fear and panic over what this individual may say when it is trying to showcase all that is good about golf.</p>

<p>The willingness of Slumbers to kick this issue firmly into the tall grass until such a time as a Turnberry venue decision is absolutely necessary – and it won’t host the Open before 2022 – might be infuriating. But it is understandable. Where the chief executive probably did go wrong this week was by not explaining precisely the scale of his predicament.</p>

<p>Next week in Miami, Trump’s Blue Monster course at Doral will stage the WGC-Cadillac Championship. Noises have already been made about a fresh venue for the event, with the PGA Tour citing a disparity between Trump’s policies and a “welcoming environment for the game of golf”. There are other factors at play here; a number of leading professionals are far from sold on Doral, which must be offset against commercial value besides issues of reputation. That’s the simple basis on which golf works, it would be naive to think otherwise.</p>

<p>Recent months have altered the backdrop to that Miami competition, possibly for good. Turnberry is not yet in the same frame but this problem won’t go away; affording Slumbers a headache that can surely only intensify.</p>

IF the Donald wins the Presidency, the R&A will fall over themselves to make sure Turnberry gets the Open during his tenure, or, if he is kicked out after one term, as soon as possible after he leaves office - the blazers will be queuing-up to be photographed with him, and, if he is elected President , honorary R&A membership will quickly be offered.

Surely the best way is not to upset the possible next President of the United States (it's possible even if the most moronic thing that could ever happen) and wait until he either is or isnt before making pronouncements.

If Donald Trump’s 2014 purchase of Turnberry was regarded as controversial because of the rancour over the tycoon’s golf course development in Aberdeenshire, such fears were overridden by hope.

Aren't the R&A also going to be targeted for continuing to choose all-male golf clubs as Open hosts, such as Troon? One might have thought that the R&A belatedly putting their own house in order on this issue might have been the precursor to some sort of change.

The issue here is straightforward; can the R&A retain the Ailsa course as an Open venue while Trump – advocating blocking Mexicans, banning Muslims and causing widespread offence as part of his campaign to become president of the United States – holds the keys? Surely the alliance is at best incongruous, at worst impossible?
