Rory McIlroy misses cut at Honda Classic as Rickie Fowler sets the pace

<p>Rory McIlroy missed the cut at the Honda Classic for the second year in succession as <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rickie-fowler">Rickie Fowler</a> recorded another flawless 66 to set the clubhouse target at the PGA National course in Florida.</p>

<p>Fowler had four birdies and no bogeys for the second day running to reach the halfway mark at eight under par, one shot ahead of his fellow American Jimmy Walker, who finished birdie, eagle in his own 66.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/26/sergio-garcia-honda-classic-lead" title="">The overnight joint leader Sergio García</a> had three birdies and two bogeys in a 69 to lie six under, with the former world No1 Adam Scott a shot further back after a brilliant 65.</p>

<p>In contrast, the former champion McIlroy – who became world No1 for the first time following his win in 2012 – struggled to a 72 to finish four over par and miss the cut by a single shot.</p>

<p>McIlroy, who walked off the course in the defence of his title and also lost a play-off in 2014, did manage four birdies but also found water on two par-threes to run up a double bogey on the 15th and a triple bogey on the 5th. Fowler is yet to drop a single shot, although the 27-year-oldadmitted he was fortunate to escape with a wild drive on the 1st, his 10th hole of the day.</p>

<p>“I got a nice break on one to continue that [bogey-free run] but kept myself in it with some good up and downs, made some good putts and it was a little bit of a bonus with a birdie on the last,” the world No5 told PGA Tour Radio. “I’m definitely pleased with the way I’ve played the last two days.”</p>

<p>Fowler won on the European Tour in Abu Dhabi in January and was pleased to bounce back from letting another victory slip from his grasp three weeks ago in Phoenix, where he had been two shots clear with two to play before losing in a play-off to Hideki Matsuyama.</p>

<p>“Nice to put together a couple of good rounds after Phoenix,” Fowler added. “I played really well there, played well down the stretch, it just didn’t go my way. I’m excited to be back in contention here. With the way I’ve been playing and how I feel on this golf course, being comfortable here with some good rounds in the past, I’m looking forward to this weekend.”</p>

<p>García, who described his own play as “terrible” after missing the cut in the Northern Trust Open last week, was pleased with his 69 that could easily have been one better after finishing millimetres away from a hole-in-one on the seventh.</p>

<p>“When I saw it rolling up the hill I thought it had a great chance and unfortunately it didn’t go in,” Garcia told PGA Tour Radio. “Making two there was already a good thing, but a one would have been amazing.</p>

<p>“Overall I felt like I played quite well. Obviously the course is not getting any easier as the week goes on. The wind was not up as much as yesterday but it was still challenging. Tomorrow is going to be an important day. Rickie is playing really, really well so I am going to have to play extremely well to keep up with him and hopefully we’ll have a good chance on Sunday.”</p>

<p>Scott won the Masters in 2013 using a long putter but has successfully reverted to a conventional club in order to comply with the ban on anchored strokes which came into effect on 1 January.</p>

<p>“I think I have putted well with the short one since the Presidents Cup [in October last year],” Scott told Sky Sports 4. “Again today I didn’t make a lot, but I made the ones that you expect to make.”</p>

<p>The 35-year-old, who finished second in the Northern Trust Open last week after a closing 67, added: “The confidence is continuing to build and my goal is to be the best putter out here.”</p>

<p>The defending champion Padraig Harrington recovered from playing his first two holes in three over par to card a 68 and finish one over par, with his compatriot Shane Lowry a shot behind after adding a 75 to his opening 67.</p>

It's actually been showing for a few years. Remember the infamous tree root ball at the PGA in 2011? That shot could have ended his career. Everyone who was watching knew the shot was ridiculous. A decent caddie would have stopped him from taking such a huge gamble.

Anyone who plays golf wearing a pair of long johns instead of proper trousers does not deserve to win anything.

About time Rory get a half decent caddie. Rory missed this, that, and the other. Not a good idea to take on your best friend as a caddie. It's begining to show now.

Interesting turn of events - would be good to see Fowler win a major. Grounded and a like his playing style.
