<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bubba-watson">Bubba Watson</a> secured his first PGA Tour win of 2016 with a one-shot victory at the Northern Trust Open in California.</p>

<p>The two-times Masters winner, who held the overnight lead, shot back-to-back birdies on the 16th and 17th which put him ahead of the clubhouse leader, Adam Scott, and Jason Kokrak on 15 under.</p>

<p>Kokrak, who was playing in the final group with Watson, was within inches of sending it to a play-off when his birdie putt at 18th trickled wide, meaning Watson’s par sealed a second win at the Riviera Country Club following victory there in 2014.</p>

<p>“You never know when your last win is going to be, so for me to come back and pull one out and win in a tough way means a lot and is very special to me and my family,” Watson told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>Watson might have been expecting <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rory-mcilroy">Rory McIlroy</a> to provide his biggest threat, but the world No3 faltered badly in the final round and fell out of contention.</p>

<p>Starting two shots behind Watson, McIlroy enjoyed the dream start as he eagled the par-five 1st but his round went downhill after that. He hit seven bogeys in his four-over-par 75 which left him nine shots off the pace on six under.</p>

<p>Dustin Johnson finished fourth on 13 under while Scotland’s Martin Laird was the highest-placed European in tied 11th after a 69 meant he finished on eight under.</p>

<p>America’s Ryan Moore finished in the top 10 and had even more reason to cheer as he produced a superb hole in one on the 16th. Moore’s tee shot on the 166-yard par-three landed in the rough on the front of the green and took a kind bounce before rolling into the hole.</p>

Now on the the Florida tournaments where the courses all look the same. Ugh!

It was an excellent final round to watch, I thought. I loved the course lay out, and it was great to see Adam Scott back in contention with his new putter.
