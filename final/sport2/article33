Billy Vunipola and Taulupe Faletau’s paths cross again in Twickenham crunch




DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:11:48+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen Billy Vunipola was 11 years old he had it all figured out. “When I grow up, if I’m good I’ll play for Wales, if I’m very good I’ll play for Australia and if I’m not so good I’ll play for Tonga.” Twelve years on and his former under-11s coach Dawson Jones does not let him forget it, nor the last line of a letter he received when the Vunipolas moved from Pontypool to Bristol in 2004. “I promise Uncle Daws, I’ll never play for England.”</p>

<p>Judging by the England back-row’s recent performances perhaps they can feel more aggrieved in Perth than Pooler but Jones may well still wonder why Vunipola will lock horns with his childhood friend Taulupe Faletau when England take on Wales on Saturday having run riot together in his East Wales Under-11s side along with Billy’s elder brother, Mako. As Tongan tykes they were team-mates, as titans they clash at Twickenham.</p>

<p>Jones laments two unfulfilled Wales careers with tongue firmly in cheek. He named his two Jack Russells after the Vunipolas and when he received an MBE for services to school rugby in 2013, his conversation with the Queen inevitably turned to Mako and Taulupe’s imminent Lions tour. Having coached Billy for three years however – Mako and Taulupe are two years older – it is England’s No8 to whom he seems closest.</p>

<p>“I’d pick Billy up and take him to and from games, that’s how I got to know him,” Jones says. “Billy was a phenomenal player back then and not just because of his size. His skills, his handling – you just had to tell him once about a particular move and it was done. When they were all playing together Mako was the one that stood out and Toby [the name a young Faletau picked because his class-mates could not pronounce Taulupe] would have his moments but the final two years Billy came into his own. He was big, he was quick, he was intelligent. All you had to do was point him in the right direction. I texted him after the Ireland game and said: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/06/england-eddie-jones-billy-vunipola-scotland-vern-cotter">‘These Jones coaches are good for you</a>.’”</p>

<p>The move to Bristol – the Vunipolas’ first step towards representing England – came about because their mother, Singa, took a job with the Methodist church, but how and why they arrived in Pontypool is a story that begins with Jonah Lomu. It was his long-time agent, Phil Kingsley Jones, who, encouraged by the King of Tonga, arranged a tour of the UK in 1997 that in turn led to the captain and hooker Fe’ao Vunipola, turning out for Pontypool and putting down his roots.</p>

<p>“I was looking after Fe’ao initially, helping him settle in and the family came across from Australia [where Billy was born] after a few months,” says Dawson Jones, at the time the Pontypool manager. “We settled them into a bungalow and that was when I first met the youngsters. I took them along to the junior school, we signed Mako in, we signed Billy in but the headteacher realised he was too young and sent him to the infants. He was as big as the headteacher at the time.”</p>

<p>Kuli Faletau, a second row for Tonga, was another to head to Gwent, pitching up at Ebbw Vale where Phil Kingsley Jones’s son – Kingsley Jones – was captain.</p>

<p>“Kuli was very quiet but because I was captain I got to know him well,” says Kingsley Jones, now Taulupe’s head coach at Newport Gwent Dragons. “We put him up in the clubhouse and after about five or six months he brought his family across. I remember Toby climbing around on my car. He had the biggest playground in Wales because he had the run of the club.”</p>

<p>In his last season with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/09/bath-sign-taulupe-faleteau-newport-wales-rugby">Dragons before joining Bath</a>, Faletau will soon regularly be facing the Vunipolas in the Premiership and Saturday is not the first time the two back-rows will meet – doing so most recently at the World Cup when Wales came out on top.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/05/england-billy-vunipola-wales-six-nations-taulupe-faletau">England’s Billy Vunipola and all-important contact with wall of Wales | Eddie Butler</a> </p>

<p>Saturday’s match stands out in part because the winners will almost certainly lift the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations">Six Nations</a> trophy and because Vunipola and Faletau are the standout No8s in the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>Strange then that two players, not related but having lived together, having played together at junior level and endless games in the back garden and Pontypool parks, are so different both in style and personality.</p>

<p>“We didn’t miss Toby but we could have; we missed Mako and Billy,” says Paul Turner, who gave Faletau his Dragons debut in 2009 before coaching Vunipola at Wasps. “Tongans with Pontypool accents playing for England. You couldn’t make it up. We were made aware of Toby when he was 16 or 17 and he was at Filton College in Bristol. He was playing his club rugby at Cross Keys at the time and turning a few heads.</p>

<p>“He’s probably the first name on the Wales team sheet now. I don’t think Wales play the same type of game without Toby. Billy has got Toby’s skills but he’s got a completely different type of game. Billy has a bit more bulk. I think Saracens have changed him, they’ve taken him on to a different level.”</p>

<p>A man of few words who rarely puts a foot wrong, Faletau would be the straight man in any double act with the more outgoing Vunipola, who is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/08/billy-vunipola-england-eddie-jones-six-nations">flourishing under the freedom and flattery afforded to him by Eddie Jones</a>. His fitness is often questioned but whereas during last year’s Six Nations he was toiling in the last five minutes of matches, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/feb/27/billy-vunipola-england-ireland-johnny-sexton">against Ireland he assumed the captaincy.</a></p>

<p>“We never believed he showed internationally as well as we believed he could,” says his forwards coach at Saracens, Alex Sanderson. “But <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/28/england-billy-vunipola-eddie-jones-ireland-six-nations">Eddie seems to have really pushed his buttons</a>. He’s given him that responsibility and he’s just grown into the player that everyone knew he could be.</p>

<p>“He’s an emotional chap and that’s not to his detriment because emotion is something you can call on when your back is against the wall. He’s carrying a lot more so they clearly have developed ways of getting the ball to him. Eddie, and I know this from my time working with him, is very good at making subtle changes to the gameplan to suit his best players and he’s done that with Billy.”</p>

<p>Dawson Jones is similarly complimentary of the current England management. “Billy was like that when he was 11. One of our coaches got him so upset, but he’s that kind of player. You don’t go ranting and raving at Billy, you’ve got to praise him.”</p>

<p>Faletau, on the other hand, quietly goes about his business. He has made <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/26/wales-france-six-nations-five-talking-points">51 tackles in the tournament</a> but it is his dexterity that sets him apart and at 25 years old he already has 56 Test caps, including one for the Lions.</p>

<p>Kingsley Jones adds: “Taulupe’s consistency is incredible and the great thing about him is his footwork. I think he can sometimes get overlooked in Wales. There’s often a lot of debate about Tipuric and Warburton but I believe Taulupe could play at six, seven or eight internationally.</p>

<p>“I coached the Barbarians a few years ago and worked with George Smith and he really reminded me of Toby. Before training they’d both pick the ball up, practice skills, practice kicking, just love having the ball in their hands.”</p>

<p>Which brings us to back to Twickenham today where World Cup wounds are still raw on behalf of the hosts and winning at all costs is both side’s imperative with the destination of the Six Nations title on the line. “I think it’s fair to say that one of them will be man of the match; I expect them to be the best two players on the field,” says Kingsley Jones.</p>

<p>“I first saw Billy playing at under-11s. Toby’s skills stood out but I remember seeing Billy and thinking: ‘He’s running through everyone because he’s so much bigger but what happens when everyone catches up?’ Well he proved me wrong didn’t he? He’s been proving me wrong ever since.”</p>

No, we didn't. We went out in the QF in 1999, against Australia. Still have the mental scars. England is the first host to exit the tournament without playing a knock-out game, which isn't bad for the country with the most players in the world.

I'm not sure the Polynesian players are any more to blame than others countries in picking a different nation to play for?Maybe its exaggerated as they produce more class players per capita than other nations, and far more than their domestic, national teams can support? Also, considering the developmental difference between Polynesia and NH SH test playing nations I don't think they can be blamed for uprooting their family for a percieved better life elsewhere.

How the tables have turned - now it is Wales who have two slow lumpy centres with limited passing skills while England have ditched the dire Barritt and the ex-prop Burgess and picked running players. It will not be part 2 of the World Cup encounter it will be more like the 6N in Cardiff last year. England to win easily.

Not really. England have such a size, money, and resources advantage over everyone except maybe France. They should destroy the six nations every year. Walk it. Playing Wales should be a joke.

Yeah, I agree. I think Cotter is after a bit more grunt in the back-row. Strauss needs a good game. In my opinion, he has not performed as well in a Scotland jersey as he has for Glasgow. I also think Wilson is on the bench, as he can cover 6.

yeah i think that's it. they grew up together, their fathers are friends - they would think of each other as cousins (i think it's possibly part of the island heritage as well, similar to how billy called his coach "uncle" - a family-oriented way of looking at life).

billy gets the ball more within the england gameplan than toby does for wales - i'm not sure we can say that he's definitely a better ball carrier though. i think where billy runs over people, toby with similar opportunities might use speed and a bit of footwork and get very similar results.

It's obviously nothing like Sam Burgess, Nathan Hughes has been a professional rugby union player for 7 years and his given the kind of performances in union that would lead to an international call up on many occasions.
