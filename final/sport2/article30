<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/denver-broncos">Denver Broncos</a> have eased their quarterback crisis somewhat by acquiring Mark Sanchez from the Eagles in exchange for a conditional draft pick.</p>

<p>Broncos general manager John Elway described Sanchez as “the first step in our process” and said the QB would bring “veteran leadership”.</p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">Acquired QB Mark Sanchez for a conditional '17 pick. He brings veteran leadership &amp; will compete. This is the 1st step in our process.</p>

<p>The draft pick headed to Philadelphia is a seventh-round pick, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter and multiple reports.</p>

<p>The Broncos were left with only <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/2511109/trevor-siemian">Trevor Siemian</a> at quarterback after Peyton Manning retired and Brock Osweiler signed with the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans">Houston Texans</a>.</p>

<p>Sanchez, 29, appeared in four games for the Eagles in 2015, starting two. He threw for 616 yards, with four touchdowns and four interceptions.</p>

<p>After being a first-round pick for the Jets, earning the nickname “The Sanchize” with trips to the AFC Championship Game in both of his first two seasons, Sanchez injured his throwing shoulder during the 2013 preseason and was replaced by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith">Geno Smith</a>. He signed with the Eagles in 2014 after being released by the Jets, but only started two games last year.</p>

The is a bad choice. Granted, Denver didn't give up much to get Sanchez, but he's still awful. Better to take a chance on RGIII, who's shown he has talent that Sanchez lacks.

Sensible and a good move. We won the Superbowl with the equivalent of an OAP and a rookie. Sanchez is far from ideal, but as a potential backup he is a very good choice. As someone said, Elway is no mug.

Good business, end of. Elway's no mug and neither is Sanchez. Get him protected and give him class outs to throw to and he may just surprise and fulfill his so far underachieving potential. Good draft pick to complement and then, as JE says the building process begins. Allez Broncos!

Is no one considering Tim Tebow ? What a waste of talents.

Let's see. The Sanchez trade cost Denver a conditional 7th Round pick in 2017. The talk is that he'll be paid about $4.5M a season. That's not starter money. As an experienced back up available for a reasonable price, it seems a comparatively sensible trade.
