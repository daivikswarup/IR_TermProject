<p>In an entertaining game, the impressive Charlie Walker scored two tries for Quins with James Horwill and Harry Sloan one apiece. Ben Botica converted three and added three penalties.</p>

<p>A struggling <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bath">Bath</a> side were in contention for the first 35 minutes but a yellow card for the scrum-half Chris Cook turned the game as the visitors tamely crumbled to concede three tries in six minutes.</p>

<p>However, when Sam Twomey was sent to the sin-bin, they staged a remarkable rally, scoring late tries from Amanaki Mafi, Jeff Williams and Semesa Rokoduguni, two converted by Tom Homer to add to his three penalties to secure a bonus point.</p>

<p>Quins made a great start, going eight points up within the first five minutes. First Botica put them ahead with a third-minute penalty before Nick Easter intercepted Ollie Devoto’s pass to send Sloan away for the first try.</p>

<p>Within minutes Bath almost matched it when Matt Banahan made an excellent break but Horacio Agulla was hauled down a couple of metres short. However, the visitors maintained the pressure for Homer to put his side on the scoreboard with a simple penalty.</p>

<p>Botica kicked another penalty but this was nullified by one from Homer so Bath trailed 11-6 at the end of a frenetic opening quarter. Both teams moved the ball at almost every opportunity with Bath particularly impressive in attack. Kyle Eastmond, Banahan and Mafi all looked sharp as they regularly threatened the home defence but the concession of frequent penalties prevented them from capitalising.</p>

<p>Quins, in turn, showed their attacking qualities with strong runs from Kyle Sinckler and Mat Luamanu threatening to create the next score but some scrambled defence from the visitors kept their line intact and amazingly the second quarter remained scoreless until four minutes from the interval.</p>

<p>Then a superb touchline run from Walker gained Quins a platform in the visitors’ 22 and, when Cook deliberately knocked on, he was sent to the sin-bin and Botica kicked the resulting penalty.</p>

<p>With the last play of the half Quins scored their second try. A powerful burst from Mark Lambert put Bath on the back foot before Walker brushed aside a poor tackle from Banahan to score. Botica’s conversion gave the hosts a healthy 21-6 interval lead.</p>

<p>Within five minutes of the restart the game seemed over for Bath as first Walker seized on a fumble by Mafi to race 75 metres and score and then, before Cook could return, the home side secured their bonus point when Horwill crashed over. The two conversions from Botica put Quins out of sight.</p>

<p>Cook returned to stem the tide and, when the Quins replacement Twomey was shown a yellow card for dragging down a lineout with 15 minutes remaining, Bath took full advantage by scoring 19 points in his absence.</p>

<p>Twomey returned but with two minutes to go Horwill replaced him in the bin and Homer kicked his third penalty to gain Bath a point.</p>

I think he meant the Mafi attempt just after Agulla was short,I thought they checked with the TMO though? Entertaining game seeing as were both missing key players. Thought we'd steal a draw for a few minutes there!

That was a match that was Quins to a 'T', some scintillating attacking combined with the ability to snatch defeat from almost any position. Even at 35-6 I felt it would only need one Bath try to get them back into the match. Still, good to pick up some points with what looked on paper the weakest team fielded this season.

We certainly don't make it easy for ourselves, do we? Yet to watch back the TV recording of it, but it's nice to know that it's the last Friday night game of the season (unless we make the final of the Challenge Cup!).

An entertaining game. Both sides were ambitious, but fallible. Thought the referee had a good game. Don't know why Mike Ford was whinging that he did not go to the TMO when Bath were an inch or two short. Short is short and Richards was in a good position to make the decision.

Walkers finishing was great. But again we only played for 45 minutes. How we managed to almost throw away a 29 point lead
