County Cricket restructure is a step in the right direction by the ECB

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he subtext to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/county-championship-season-ecb-changes" title="">changes to the structure of the county cricket schedule</a> from 2017 is clear enough from the words of Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board. “We now have a great opportunity,” he said, “to take a detailed look at a range of options and find the best structure for the long-term health of the domestic and international game.”</p>

<p>In other words, the decision to cut the County Championship to 14 matches, with divisions of eight and 10 teams respectively, to play the T20 Blast as a midsummer block and to relegate – the appropriate word, however it is dressed up as some sort of preparation for the Champions Trophy that summer – the 50-over competition to April and May (except for a July final), has bought them time to thrash out what is really believed to be the best structure for the future of the domestic game.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/county-championship-season-ecb-changes">County Championship Division One to be cut to eight teams in 2017</a> </p>

<p>Agreeing on such changes is not as simple as many might believe – for example, those who thought it a no-brainer that there should be a franchised or city-based Twenty20 competition and that opportunities have been missed by the ECB. The stick and carrot spring to mind. Were Malcolm Tucker in charge of the ECB he would no doubt employ <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VReU7EgfPLc" title="">his own notorious version</a> in which you “take a carrot, you stick it up his fucking arse, followed by the stick, followed by an even bigger, rougher carrot”. But he isn’t.</p>

<p>Essentially, while the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ecb">ECB</a> has an executive it is still a cooperative, which means that while there is a management structure, there still has to be a corporate agreement.</p>

<p>Persuading all the counties that any changes are to their mutual benefit is the tricky bit. Softly is better. There are also broadcasting agreements to consider, the current ones <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/08/sky-sports-england-cricket-team-tv-deal" title="">lasting until the end of the 2019 season</a> and the future of which will already be under preliminary discussion.</p>

<p>The nature of broadcasting rights is changing all the time, particularly when it comes to the packaging of what they call “device rights”: the increasing prevalence of smartphones and tablets, and the demand for clips. To this end there is no one in the world more familiar than Harrison, whose previous work with the media distributor IMG involved overseeing media rights sales for Cricket Australia, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a> South Africa and the Indian Premier League, with work for ESPN Star Sports in Singapore before that.</p>

<p>In particular, the Indian TV market, hitherto considered a licence to print money by any country who played the India national team, has apparently become so parochial that not only are Indian viewers reluctant to watch any cricket that does not involve India, they are also averse to watching India matches staged abroad.</p>

<p>But like John Betjeman in The Planster’s Vision, “ I have a vision of the future, chum”, and while it involves an increase in the amount of T20 cricket played – and due attention paid to the needs of protecting and even enhancing the County Championship – it most certainly does not, at domestic level, include 50-over cricket.</p>

<p>The opportunity to ensure the first-class season starts later by moving the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/royal-london-cup">Royal London Cup</a> is a really sound one. The season had been bursting at the seams so the only way to incorporate all the cricket was to expand the season, with early-to-mid-April championship matches on sappy, damp pitches distorting the picture. To illustrate, in 13 seasons as a professional, I played only five championship matches that started in April, three of them on the last day of that month and none earlier than 28 April. The latest start to a championship season we had in that time was 10 May, in 1978. By that time this coming summer Middlesex will be in the middle of their fourth match, a quarter of their season.</p>

<p>In the future I believe County Championship cricket, which has always been a loss-leader although essential to the development of Test cricketers, will remain essentially niche, as will Test cricket around the world, despite the calls for its primacy. This is part of a democratic process in which it is blindingly obvious that the mass of spectators are demonstrating what it is they really want to watch.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/24/county-cricket-chiefs-twenty-20-split-in-two">County cricket chiefs meet to discuss splitting Twenty20 in two</a> </p>

<p>By 2020 (appropriately) we should see a city-based competition blocked into the middle of the summer, closer to the Australian Big Bash model in which Cricket Australia has overall control, rather than the Indian franchise system. This will not be straightforward: our grounds are not large enough to accommodate the sort of numbers that the Big Bash has seen, and in Australia the expansion has been from six state sides to eight, with Melbourne and Sydney sustaining two each. Here, it would be necessary to shrink it down, and almost forget the county divisions.</p>

<p>But herein comes the real problem. A city-based competition would preclude home games for those counties – Essex and Somerset in particular – who rely on a few days’ T20 a year for a large proportion of their income.</p>

<p>So, two things. First, an equable way has to be found for the city competition to benefit all the counties (and minor counties to an extent) and this might have to include ancillary income from merchandising, food and drink outlets and entertainment.</p>

<p>Second, the T20 Blast “appointment to view” could continue through the summer anyway apart from the period of the city competition. But it would mean jettisoning 50-over domestic cricket. Personally I am convinced that T20 cricket gives proper preparation for ODIs. It might even enhance it.</p>

I think you'll find people will go to the games just because they're 3ish hours long, it's summer, and if they have kids they'll get to bed at a reasonable time. The vibe in Australia with BBL (and I reckon with T20 in general) feels more attuned to entertainment than parochialism.

I agree with this. Bagsy Durham don't play Yorkshire twice this season.The T20 franchise thing is problematic, too. How does the loot get divided when Northants or Kent get swallowed up by a London-based side? There are 'county' sides who have more than one major population centre within their traditional borders, and others with none. I reckon pretty much every county could point to something (recent success, history, iconic ground) as a reason for not being shut out.

I think that your idea is exactly what some people are trying to do through the back door. But England is a tribal nation & as such these fake ( big bash style) pop teams will just kill the game in 75% of the country. I am from Kent, not London. I won't go 50 miles to watch a team who I have no connection to. We have 40 plus counties in England, we need more teams not less. Football in England is huge compared to cricket, why, because everybody has a team in the system big, medium, or small. The whole country is involved bigger is better.

Why does every plan for cricket have to provide fot the continued subsidisation of 18 first class counties? No other country tries to sustain a system that employs over 300 full time cricketers? Yes, the problem is that the EWCB is a co-operative, but the fact that the 18 counties have to agree to everything is a huge barrier to meaningful change. The traditionalists will bleat, but the counties should either stand on their own 2 feet or cease to exist as professional clubs. Even a theoretically strong county like Yorkshire are in dire financial straits.

A city-based franchise system will lead inevitably to the smaller counties going to the wall. There is no way the profits can be equitably shared as the big test match grounds hosting the games will want the lion's share of the profit for doing the work. The smaller counties will also lose out on the current T20 games that make them money especially the local derbies. Having said that there is no guarantee the city-based system will work anything like as well here as in Oz. In Australia most of the population is concentrated in cities. In the UK that is not the case. Vast areas of the cricket-loving countryside will be disenfranchised. There is a solution, not perfect, but workable - have 6 regional teams each made up of 3 counties each. These could be West: Somerset, Glos, Glam; South: Surrey, Sussex, Hants, South East: Kent, Essex, Middlesex; South Midlands: Worcs, Warwick, Northants; North Midlands: Leics, Derbys, Notts; North: Yorks, Lancs, Durham. You can call the teams what you like, but the principle would be that all the sides get games played on the county home grounds. I know some grounds are smaller so profits might be less and some apportioning of profits might be possible to offset that, and I know there will be some resistance to Yorks/Lancs for example being bedfellows, but at least this system would give a vested interest to all the counties and engage non-city based cricket lovers. Play this in a four week period July/August so you can still have some championship matches early July, late August. Finally keep the appointment to view county version of the NatWest Blast for Friday nights throughout the season - this was working reasonably well. One casualty of this might have to be the 50 over competition as Mr Selvey suggests, but I have a feeling that that format of the game is steadily dying - witness the declining crowds at the finals recently.

Indeed. Why there isn't a web feed subscription service from a fixed camera people could pay for to watch Championship cricket online baffles me. It wouldn't affect attendances because entry is so cheap, but it'd be an easy way for the counties to get a bit of extra cash and enhance the ability of those who can't get to the cricket but follow it from home/work.

‘City-based’ franchise is just code for ‘Test Match Ground-based’. The biggest reason for linking the franchises to cities is that otherwise it would just be a competition with half the counties removed. And the perception that the big counties had cut the smaller ones off could well be ‘toxic branding’ for a new competition.

Only the English cricket establishment would look at the fact that we have 18 permanent professional bases for cricket across the country with strong links into clubs, schools and communities driven by long standing emotional attachments and treat that as if it was a massive roadblock to progress. Instead it would want to replace it with a set of bland marketing slogans, cheerleaders, golden helmets, mussaq and all the nonsense that goes into replacing real atmosphere with marketised 'entertainment'.

Sure, but people say this, and then still don't go on Saturdays when the rare opportunity comes up. I suspect there would be more chance of champo cricket on saturdays when the Blast returns to a block, not just friday night. You simply cannot expect players to finish a game at 10.30pm on a Friday night and playing again at 11 or 12 on Saturday.

Because that reduces the feel of ownership from those cities and hence likely the audience. It will also only work if games are toured around the regions, see the criticism of the Welsh rugby "regions" like the Blues over the years to find otu what happens when you don't. Fans in their region are moer likely to support neighbours than their own.

To counter the parochial resistance to a city-based affiliation model why couldn't they increase the target areas and make it regional. So London, East, South East, West Country[inc Wales + Ireland], Midlands, North[inc Scotland]. Games would have to be played at football grounds with over 40,000 capacities and they would rent the space via an ECB subsidy. Gate receipts shared equally by all counties in the catchment area. ECB may need to take the hit whilst interest builds up, but we need to spend that additional 'Big 3' revenue somewhere don't we?

I take your point but temporary seating could be brought in to most smaller grounds. It's not ideal but might be sufficient carrot for the counties to vote through. Also I'd imagine there'd be a lot of overseas players coming in if its a condensed schedule so there'd be plenty of players left for a simultaneous county competition which would still hold appeal since it will be more readily available and possibly cheaper than heading to the franchise teams for many people.

The most sensible solution most of us have made so far, DP, is three divisions of six counties. Whether that's a straight six of three divisions of relegation and promotion, or three regional play off leagues with a play off to decide the County Champion, either would be preferable to what is proposed.

I know, promotion to Div One could well depend on who plays the weakest counties twice. There would be more integrity, and a bit of drama, to two northern / southern sections of five teams each - so eight games - followed by play-offs involving the top team, or two teams, from each. Too few games there unfortunately.

I'm of the belief that a franchise T20 competition will happen, it's just when - it's not something that I'm keen to see, just that it will be inevitable. It seems that there is still some County opposition to it so that's why it's not being rushed in for this season but when it does happen then the franchises will be paying a considerable amount of money and will need to maximise their ROI. The only grounds capable of attracting the sort of crowds - and would have private boxes for corporate entertaining etc are the big Test/City grounds. You can't expect say the South London franchise to decamp to Canterbury where the crowd capacity is much lower just to keep the Kent contingent happy.

Because three day matches, particularly if the weather intervened did not allow players to do things like build innings or bowl long spells. It also resulted in too many matches with contrived declarations which meant that runs and wickets were gifted in order to allow one team to set a target. The consequence being that it wasn't producing enough Test cricketers and certainly wasn't preparing them for five day matches. Another by-product was the increase in injuries and the lack of time outside of matches to practice and hone skills.

I think taking on a city rather than a county name could work in Birmingham, London and Cardiff, and it won't be much of a change for those counties with one big town/city like Notts, Derbys, Northants, Leics, Worcs or Sussex. Where it won't be so successful is in counties with two or more major cities with historic rivalries, often intensified by deep-rooted tribal football loyalties. Thinking here of Manchester/Liverpool, Southampton/Portsmouth, Leeds/everywhere else in Yorkshire.

Further to this, if some counties are going to play each other once, then teams whose fixtures involve playing counties less likely to go up twice are likely to have an advantage over counties who have to play the ‘stronger’ counties (and I apologise for that assumption) twice. What has not been made at all clear with this agreement is how the Division Two fixtures will be apportioned. We are completely in the dark about this.

With the almost insatiable demand for T20 and the shorter forms of the game I cannot understand for the life of me why the County Championship hasn't returned to it's original and vastly superior three day format. At a stroke this would free up 18 playing days per county allowing enough flexibility to organise the remainder of the programme to everyone's satisfaction.

I don't think Mike is terribly well served by the headline here. Upon a second reading at home (rather than my rushed reading earlier at work) it does appear quite reflective on the problems inherent in moving to a city-based T20 competition (on which there has been plenty of opinion) and the apparent sidelining of the 50 over competition (which, interestingly, pretty much no-one has objected to). Personally, I still remain to be convinced that change is actually needed for the T20, whose current predominantly Friday night format actually seems to be working quite well right now and pulling in the crowds. And I'd echo the sentiment that as a Lancashire supporter I wouldn't want to lend my support to a Manchester based franchise - anathema to someone with Liverpool roots.



Author::::adrianb1975

Surely it's possible to have T20 franchises that have two home grounds thus ensuring all the counties can profit. Ultimately it's the lure of seeing exciting international cricketers like Gayle or DeVilliers that pull in the crowds and not the name of a city. Most counties used to have 3 or 4 home grounds that they toured around so we've been there before and those that go aren't likely to be too bothered supporting a Sussex player in Canterbury, etc. Give them non city based names and give each county a minimum number of games and away you go. Could even play a domestic competition at the same time that is purely for those county players that miss out and emerging youngsters. The popularity of the former boosting attendances and income for the later. A friend recently took his son to watch Liverpool and now hooked on football he joins him to watch Dulwich every other week.

The re-brand to 'Yorkshire' was done explicitly for that reason., yes. The problem being that the Union hotbeds are in the rural areas of the county, not the cities, as I'm sure you know. Even at their height in 2004-5, the Tykes got pitiful crowds.
