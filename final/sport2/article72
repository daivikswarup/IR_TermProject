Martin Crowe: a batting master craftsman who was ahead of his time

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen the cancer that has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/03/new-zealand-cricket-legend-martin-crowe-dies-aged-53" title="">taken Martin Crowe from us far too early</a> had finally, inexorably, got its hooks into him, he exchanged emails with the Indian cricket writer Dileep Premachandran, and there is no apology for quoting from them now. It was late last September, the occasion of his 53rd birthday, and Crowe was making sense of his condition, about how he felt of facing the imminent prospect of death. “It’s a fine line mentally,” Crowe writes,” do I judge my life as a joy or as sitting in death row?” It is both philosophical and rhetorical: I don’t think I have ever come across someone who has faced their demise with more rational fortitude and acceptance.</p>

<p>It is just under a year, during the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a> World Cup, that last I saw him. 16 March was a beautiful day in Auckland: he collected me in his 4x4 from my hotel. Far from seeing someone ravaged by the disease, as I had expected, I was surprised how well he looked, tanned and full-faced. Even the total hair loss might have been put down to a family trait, if his brother Jeff is anything to go by. Certainly at one time, he had tinkered with a slightly absurd weave so it had been heading that way. We drove for lunch to Woodpecker Hill, a new restaurant in Parnell that he was keen on.</p>

<p>Besides we two there were three friends of his, one of them mutual. The food was excellent, the wine wonderful (one of our number was a wine merchant), the conversation stimulating and happy. And when it was over, we stood in the sun, said goodbye and hugged. There was the realisation that in all probability we would never again meet. It was he who comforted me.</p>

<p>That day, he had told me that he had been given a 5% chance of living for a further year. The odds were correct: he was 13 days shy of that 12 months when he passed away peacefully. He had been diagnosed with follicular lymphoma a couple of years previously but appeared to be in remission, cleared, until the cancer returned, in the virulent terminal form of double-hit lymphoma. The apparently hale nature of his condition was a camouflage. When he was awake, he said, he did indeed feel good, but rather than undergoing yet more chemotherapy he was by then self-medicating with liquid marijuana and sleeping 15 hours a day. Happy hours though, he said.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">Has there ever been a sharper cricket mind? Not in my experience. For all the orthodoxy of his play, he was an innovator</p>

<p>It is the best part of four decades since first I saw him. I was playing as professional in Auckland, and he, just 16, was beating out his hundreds relentlessly for Auckland Grammar, enchanting all who saw him bat in the verdant environs of the Cornwall club, and was on the verge of making the Auckland side itself. Clearly he was an exceptional talent, although that in itself does not necessarily transfer into achievement. But I saw him when he was on the MCC ground staff at Lord’s and, a few years later, when he was playing for Somerset, he became my penultimate first-class wicket. By then he was already established as a Test batsman, who at the Basin Reserve in Wellington had scored against England the first of what were to be 17 Test centuries.</p>

<p>A Test average of slightly more than 45 falls short of a generally accepted benchmark for greatness, but the figures, as often happens, do not tell the true story of a batsman of the very highest quality even at a time when the chronic knee condition that curtailed his career was incapacitating him. I have a contention (one with which he profoundly disagreed but which I still hold) that so good a technician was he that he devoted his energies not just to attempt to be the best batsman in the world, but to create the ultimate, definitive clinical batsman.</p>

<p>His preparations were never less than meticulous. At Lord’s, in 1994, virtually on one leg, he made 142 against England that was a masterpiece of technical excellence, and he followed it with 115 in the second innings of the match at Old Trafford, after New Zealand had followed on: either would serve as a masterclass in the construction and execution of a Test match innings. One day, when Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis were at the height of their reverse-swinging powers, he expounded to me the theory of playing it, by staying inside the line and looking to the offside: of many tributes, the one in which Wasim rates him the best batsmen to whom he bowled, rates very highly.</p>

<p>Has there ever been a sharper cricket mind? Not in my experience. For all the orthodoxy of his play, he was an innovator, someone ahead of his time by years. He denied it strongly (not wishing to appear skittish in his practice) but one day at Lord’s, when he was a groundstaff lad, I saw him switch-hitting. It was his thinking that came up with the idea of Cricket Max, a short form of the game that we can now see as a precursor to Twenty20 (one day, we might see his idea for straight hits clearing the boundary being worth double morphing into extra runs for the distance struck). Much is made of his impact on the 1992 World Cup (although he was always at pains to point out that his career lasted a good deal longer than the few weeks of that tournament). That he introduced the strategy of opening the bowling <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jan/14/joy-of-six-cricket-world-cup" title="">with an off-spinner</a>, Dipak Patel, and the batting with the whirling pinch-hitting blade of Mark Greatbatch, is almost cliche now, but what is rarely acknowledged is that this was something dreamed up on the hoof, after they had played three matches in more orthodox fashion.</p>

<p>New Zealand lost the semi-final to Pakistan that year, undone by the emerging genius of Inzamam-ul-Haq, but even then it is a match and possibly tournament New Zealand might well have won had their captain, who had made a brilliant 91 with the bat, not been forced from the field with injury and unable to shepherd them through.</p>

<p>Beyond a brief Indian Premier League stint, he never took to coaching, which is the game’s loss. For a period, he had even been shunned by the national team. But he became an outstanding writer and talker on the game, and a brilliant mentor to young players not least the “two sons I never had”, Ross Taylor, whom he helped through the difficult time following his sacking as New Zealand captain, and Martin Guptill. As much as anything, it is his ethos of fair play, responsible behaviour and enjoyment, that the Black Caps now buy into. That in itself is a legacy to treasure.</p>

It is perfectly reasonable to give some perspective on Crowe and McCullum. Particularly as McCullum voiced very unfavourable opinions on Crowe in the past.

Ken Rutherford was another NZ youngster thrown into the deep end too early, at 17yrs he was hit and hit and hit all over the body after opening the batting for New Zealand in their 1985 West Indies tour at a time when West Indies were at the height of their powers. Took him a while to recover but he went on to be a very good batsman, retired too early with an average of 39.2. He was a team mate of Martins late 80's, early 90's.

Later 80s debutant Andrew Jones had a fine career, Jeff Crowe a few good moments but not consistent. I would say the current side (if Taylor included) is slightly stronger. A "best of" 80s line up could have Turner and Jones and would probably shade the "best of" 2010s line up but it's a close call. I would go for the 80s thanks to Hadlee, Turner and Crowe, but it's a close run thing

Great tribute to Martin Crowe. For me growing up in New Zealand in the 1980's Crowe was a cricketing giant. His performances at the 92 World Cup really showcased his class, also his dominance against the West Indies side in 86/87, and performances against Waqar and Wasim really showed how technically good he was. His batting had an elegance and imperiousness that made him stand out.

I am glad that Martin Crowe is getting the accolades he deserves as I suspect that we didn't appreciate him enough in his pomp in NZ. He had such a rough start as a youngster but came out of it brilliantly and seems to have been a real Renaissance Man.

Thanks Tarbsy. I too had a tear in my eye when I saw Foxie break down on TV, the two were great mates and for a while when Martin's lymphoma was in remission all those who loved his technique and style of play, players and lovers of the game thought he would be ok, so sadly not so. I watched him captain NZ in the first CWC played here, we almost squeaked in but were undone by Pakistan and a certain Inzamam ul Huq excuse my spelling. I think for us playing cricket in England is the best, great wickets with the odd surprise and wonderful and appreciative crowds. Martin was a champion on and off the field and made many friends. R I P Martin Crowe. A brilliant batsman and a wonderful human being.

Wasim Akram tells a story asking about how Crowe worked him and Waqar out, just the clarity and simplicity of the explanation Crowe gave to him made so much sense it staggers the mind why no one else thought of it. Genius. I would have loved to sit there and listen to those two utter legends in that chat.

Saw Martin once make a masterly match winning hundred for Somerset against Lancashire at Old Trafford while Wasim cut through the rest of the Somerset batting like a knife through butter, so if Was says he was the best batsman he ever bowled to i'm not surprised.

I am not sure that there are too many other cricket players that been able to combine Martin Crowe's exceptional skills as player, captain and tactician whilst at the same time remaining a man of the people and a perfect gentleman on and off the field. The world has lost a great sportsman.

The current black caps team is awesome. They've made cricket cool again. As good a captain Fleming was and they had great players like Astle and Vettpori they just never stuck with the NZ public. This team has. And I bet many of their childhood heroes would have been Crowe.

I lived in New Zealand for a very brief time in the mid-80's. Was mad about cricket for that short time. My brother and I returned to the US and were likely one of the very few kids in Los Angeles with a full complement of cricket gear (parting gift from an uncle). Reading of Martin Crowe's death brought on tears. For his passing and for a childhood that seems so, so far away. Where does the time go? I didn't know it then but for the brief time I lived in NZ, I got to watch the best Kiwi cricketers ever--Martin Crowe and Richard Hadlee.



Author::::Tarbsy
DateTime::::2016-03-03T23:58:14Z
He's one of the best batsman I have seen play the game, and always conducted himself impeccably on and off the field. Along with Hadlee, New Zealand were always a threat. 53 is way too early for anyone. Condolences to his family and hang in there NZ cricket fans.

Sorry, but I don't think Crowe was anything like David Gower. The young Martin Crowe was very straight, very solid, playing long in the V before expanding an innings. He was rigorous in his technique, though as he aged he tended to hit the ball squarer than straighter. Gower was much more of an "eye" player, wafting at the ball, bat far from his body. But how he connected! The young Gower was glorious and you thought, how are we ever going to stop this man? As he aged he seemed to miss more than he connected, and batting became less a certainty than an adventure, ultimately less an adventure than a misadventure.
