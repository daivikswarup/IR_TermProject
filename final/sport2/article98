Warren Gatland’s critics must not rewrite history nor take Wales success as a given

<p>“Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were,” wrote Proust. As Wales <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/wales-name-unchanged-team-england-rugby-six-nations">prepare for Saturday’s visit</a> to Twickenham – where victory would set up a fourth Six Nations title in eight years – they have been defending their style of play, which has been attacked as a brutish and boorish trashing of tradition.</p>

<p>Wales are seen as holders of the game’s creative torch before Warren Gatland arrived at the end of 2007 and snuffed out the flame. The twinkle-toed backs they produced down the years are always cited in evidence, from Percy Bush and Cliff Jones to Barry John and Phil Bennett, but not so much the hard-nosed forwards who won the ball. Neath, Aberavon and Pontypool are just as much part of Wales’s heritage as Llanelli, Swansea and Cardiff.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/09/eddie-jones-warren-gatland-england-wales-six-nations-rugby-union">Eddie Jones v Warren Gatland – how do the two head coaches compare? | Michael Aylwin</a> </p>

<p>Back in 1914, Wales’s pack was known as The Terrible Eight, led by a man of the cloth, the Rev Alban Davies, who was not known for a tendency to heed the invocation to turn the other cheek. They fought their way to an 11-3 victory in Ireland 102 years ago, a Test match that has gone into the annals as the roughest ever, the tone set the night before the match when some of the home team invaded Wales’s hotel to lay out what was in store the following afternoon.</p>

<p>Wales bruised as much as they bewitched, but now it is mostly the former, armed as they are with a three-quarter line that even the Rev Davies would have blinked at. Gatland may not have cracked the southern hemisphere market, with one win over South Africa and Australia, and a string of defeats to New Zealand since he took over eight years ago, but it has been a case of success in Europe.</p>

<p>When Wales <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/26/wales-france-six-nations-match-report">defeated France in the last round</a>, they were <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/01/wales-baffled-reaction-six-nations-france">roundly criticised in victory</a>: Gatland needed to shake up his coaching team; the backs needed to go on a skills course; it was one of the worst matches ever seen. And so on. And it was not much of a spectacle, not for a lack of ambition on either side but because as mistakes and the referee’s whistle abounded, so the game stagnated. It was a modern Test match with defences on top throughout.</p>

<p>The Wales attack coach Rob Howley this week <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/wales-rob-howley-champagne-rugby-union-six-nations-england">expressed his belief</a> that Wales supporters have become spoiled by success under Gatland, that a victory which 10 and 20 years before would have been greeted rapturously has become assumed; the cake needs icing, and a sweeter filling. Who remembered Wales’s first match in the Six Nations, at home to France in 2000, when 39 points were scored and the home side supplied three? Or the previous ‘home’ encounter with <em>Les Bleus</em> at Wembley two years before, which finished 0-51?</p>

<p>Wales in those days were mocked for being unfit and unprofessional, the fact that they were adventurous when they did get the ball ignored. They lost 60-26 at Twickenham in 1998 (when the former Australia coach Bob Dwyer said their pack was made up of lard men rather than hard men), 46-12 in 2000, 50-10 in 2002, 31-21 in 2004 and 47-13 in 2006. Their last visit to the ground before Gatland’s arrival was a record 62-5 thrashing before the 2007 World Cup.</p>

<p>Howley played in the first three of those routs and it was easy to understand his incredulity this week: Wales were criticised all those years ago for being outmuscled and failing to last the course of matches, and now the very strength and conditioning that was lacking then is being held against them. A team used to losing – ‘slaughter of the incompetents’ shouted one headline in 1998, has, in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations">Six Nations</a> at least, become inured to winning; and even if their record against the major southern hemisphere teams has continued to be unimpressive under Gatland, they now tend to lose by one score, often in the final minutes, as opposed to a score or more.</p>

<p>As the now former South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer said after his side’s 2015 quarter-final victory against Gatland’s men, playing Wales is the ultimate test of endurance because they never wilt. That Gatland has achieved the turnaround while Wales have struggled at regional level in Europe, and while the game at the lower levels in the country has been crying out for investment, is remarkable. No longer do they go to Twickenham, or anywhere, dreading the outcome.</p>

<p>Wales are similar in their approach to New Zealand: both teams kick the ball a lot and prefer to attack off turnovers or from a poor kick. They are patient and methodical, and consistency in selection has allowed them to develop experience. There is, however, one major difference: the execution of skills under pressure.</p>

<p>One reason Wales struggle to beat the All Blacks, the Wallabies and the Springboks is that they score few tries against teams that can match them physically but have something extra in attack. They could not break down Australia’s defence in the seven minutes that it was reduced to 13 men in last year’s World Cup, and the following week against South Africa, they wasted chances.</p>

<p>There was a time when Wales produced in abundance players of instinct who, blessed with rugby brains, reacted quickly to changing circumstances. Barry John was their high priest, any number of defenders sacrificed at his altar, but as the game declined in schools to the point where mentors (think Bill Samuel and Gareth Edwards) all but disappeared and the education players got appearing for their local clubs against gnarled and streetwise opponents evaporated into the cloned and closeted world of academies, so the knack Welsh players had of living off their wits faded.</p>

<p>Gatland, and his management team, have enabled Wales to punch above their weight year after year, always well prepared and supremely conditioned. That they do not live up to the country’s romantic image is down to an appreciation of the grind European rugby at the highest level has become.</p>

<p>As <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/04/six-nations-rugby-union-change-health-future">Richard Williams argued</a> in the Guardian last Saturday, every aspect of strategy in the northern hemisphere seems to start with a negative, but Wales are a symptom, not the disease. Before Gatland, they were too often overpowered physically and had the life crushed out of them. They glowed in 2005 when, after beating England with a late, long Gavin Henson penalty, they ran their way to the grand slam, but otherwise they were largely an irrelevance.</p>

<p>Gatland has made them very much relevant again, and those supporters cursing after a comfortable, if thrill-lacking, victory over France should reflect whether they would prefer a return to the days when England put 62 points on their team, Ireland 54, South Africa 96, Australia 63, France 51 and New Zealand 55.</p>

<p>Yes, Wales should be making more of their firepower behind, and more’s the pity they cannot find a place for the play making James Hook, but the arm-wrestle professional rugby union has become, and how to free up space on the field, is something for the lawmakers to address. Gatland is living in a present where skill, in Europe at least, does not count for enough.</p>

Tes, I left it out for that reason. I did want to add that in the "glory years" there was an awful lot of ten man rugby played and settling for penalty kicks which people tend to forget now. That's why the extra point was added for tries and there were rule changes made to open up the game.

All theatre is ephemeral. Here today, gone tomorrow. Starts at 2pm finishes at 4pm. Rugby union at top class level is theater frequently and obviously so. You come, you go, and it becomes just a twinkle or a dark look in your eyes, and a score in the record books. Ephemera!!

What a poorly argued argument. The whole thing is predicated on an assumption that it is either the current 'warrenball' or a 62-5 thrashing. That is a false dichotomy.The criticism is coming because through all the years of physical dominance they have not even tried to add an element of creativity and flair. New Zealand (if that is who they are trying to match) would never have stagnated with the view that 'the physical game is winning us championships so we do not need to develop' - they would have said 'OK, we are the top NH side. Let's develop our game even further' and had they done that I think Wal would have been untouchable in the last 4 years.

Because when players arrive at an international training camp, they should be able to complete the basics like completing big overlaps. When someone goes to University, the lectures aren't expected to teach the students to read and write, that should already be a giving. Their job is to hone the skills already in place, and that's much of the way I see the national coaches.

patchell?! now he makes ROG look like brian lima in defence. I've lost count of the number of times he's resembled a small speed bump when defending at full-back, his lack of desire is pretty embarrassing. hence he runs off to the scarlets the minute his position at 10 comes under threat, rather than stay and fight for his shirt. he'll never make a test player (yes, he was capped on the joking japan tour) as long as he has a hole in his arse. oh and don't for one minute think that I'm advocating picking anscombe instead, he's no better and the way the WRU have parachuted him in ahead of home-grown players makes a mockery of their apparent desire to develop young players and the community game. I thought the days of Jason jones-hughes, hal luscombe etc were over

Not 'undoubtedly' better - no, only comparatively. But you are comparing an amateur ethos with a professional one.The change was when the southern hemisphere unions had to compete with SH rugby league. Don't lose the perspective - SANZAC rugby union was professional 20 yrs before the Ireland/Scotland/Wales and England were professional from the Courage league in the late 80's.The playing field is exactly not level. If golf-like handicaps were in play... hmm?

This is a fair summary, Wales have an obvious lack of decent forward carriers and, since Shane and Henson have gone, a lack of football outside 10. They gave Hook a fair few chances at centre and fullback but he never really took them. The most creative player in the squad now is probably Tipuric and it's difficult to shoehorn him in.



Author::::StueyapStuey
DateTime::::2016-03-10T22:09:36Z
Hang on - yes winning is the most important thing in sport. Track back - when Wales were playing SH teams in the 90's they were being annihillated. These were big time embarrassing scores. Since Graham Henry there has been an appreciation of the need for professionalism. A few blips along the way - but where Wales are now, with its player base and financial structure, is pretty great. Could do better? Maybe, yes - but will any team put 96 unanswered points on them?

Warrenball won the Lions series in Australia because the management were not hamstrung by the player injuries and/or strength in depth of the squad. Coaches can only play to the resources available. To blame the coach because a successful but not 'pretty' strategy is used seems pretty stupid.Go back to the 'up the jumper' English 90's/Jack Rowell days - don't care: we won!Campese: 'Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser!'So, nowadays winning isn't enough. Yeah, roll on football commentaries.

Over the years - 127 played: 57 wins vs 56... championship wins 53 vs 54... ie. for all the English blathe,r honours are pretty much even.For a country of the playing resources of England, the funding and the tv rights - they should be doing better, but, hey... charity to the neighbour!"Wales' 'ephemeral' abilities" Do you even understand the meaning of the words of your own (Germanic) language?

The angles of Cole and Marler are truly ridiculous. Square? Yeah - they are both pushing at the hooker from engagement. The French were slightly more subtle in the Ireland game, trying to force at the hooker from the second row....Against Scotland, Italy and Ireland it was a disgrace that reasons were found to penalize not-England.

Possible names are Allister Coetzee, former Stormers coach, Rassie Erasmus, highly-rated, and Johan Ackermann, who's getting his Lions team playing some very decent stuff in SuperRugby and in the Currie Cup.

Bravo Paul. I remember well those beatings we used to take, even allowing for vagaries such as the third-string team that played England pre-wc in 2007. I'll always take a dull Wales win over gallant defeat; a great game is always a bonus but that can’t be guaranteed (and isn't always down to how Wales play).

Who would be a ref? In what other sport does a ref or umpire get so much pressure put on them in the pre-match build up? Although Marler does scrummage illegally, the ref found him out in the Australian game in the WC. There was no need for McBride to say anything.Btw what happened to the vow of silence?

I don't mind Wales playing the game in any way they like - that's the beauty of rugby, that different teams can have different styles. What really grates is the way *some* Welsh fans still talk as if they and they alone play "proper" rugby, or (for example) criticise England for 10-man rugby, either now or in the Woodward era when (ironically) most of those thrashings were handed out - it doesn't matter, it's equally inaccurate in either case, as well as hypocritical.
