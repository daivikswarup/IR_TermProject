New Zealand not alone in being grateful for Brendon McCullum

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">S</span></span>ix and out. One day, long into the future, it might serve as an epitaph for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/brendon-mccullum">Brendon McCullum</a>. A short ball from Josh Hazlewood dispatched over the leg-side boundary for the 107th six of his Test career, more than one for every match he played; then, down the wicket to the next ball, swinging like a shithouse door in a gale, as cricketers like to say, and dragging the ball to midwicket where David Warner took an excellent catch.</p>

<p>As he lived his cricket life, so he perished by it, the McCullum ethos embraced in that two-ball vignette. His remarkable Test record first innings century off 54 balls at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch in the second and final match of the series against Australia was indication if ever there was that the finest captain of this and perhaps any generation still had plenty left in him.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/23/test-cricket-farewells-brendon-mccullum">Test cricket farewells: they didn't always do it their way like Brendon McCullum | The Spin</a> </p>

<p>When the Marx brothers split up, Groucho said that by “getting out now we are merely anticipating public demand”: McCullum wanted to leave international cricket and has deserved to do so at 34 when the crowd still cried out for more. Did anything define him more than this manner of his leaving, as Malcolm said of the Thane of Cawdor, albeit in somewhat different circumstances.</p>

<p>In the World Cup final almost a year ago, Australia’s Brad Haddin had asked McCullum if he was “ swinging today”. “Too right I am,” was the reply, and if it proved an outright failure that day at the MCG, then it showed no occasion was going to prevent him from being true to himself. And there is not a member of his team who would not have understood that it was this belief that got them to where they were in the first place.</p>

<p>McCullum has now signed off his international career with the fastest Test hundred of them all, as if predestined to do so with the most emphatic of punctuation marks. Almost 30 years ago, on his home ground in Antigua, Viv Richards had slaughtered England with a hundred from 56 balls. Not quite 16 months ago, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-australia-2014/content/story/795331.html">the mark was equalled by Misbah‑ul‑Haq against Australia</a>. If these were astonishing displays in their own right then they were conceived in different circumstances altogether. Richards told me he had complete licence, as he was setting up a declaration late on the fourth day of the fifth Test of the Blackwash series against a demoralised side.</p>

<p>Misbah’s came in a similar second innings situation. When McCullum arrived at the crease though, it was the first morning of the match, on a capriciously grassy pitch, with his side wobbling at 32 for three. So he did what his instinct, his whole cricketing philosophy, told him to do. He played and missed at his first ball, sent a top edge over the slips the next, rode his luck and never let up.</p>

<p>McCullum the batsman has helped redefine what is possible with bat against ball not only in the shorter forms of the game but also in Test match cricket. His first Test century, 143 in Dhaka, took him five and a half hours and 243 balls: his 12th and last, two runs more, occupied 260 fewer minutes and 119 fewer deliveries. In white-ball cricket, he pioneered the idea of walking down the pitch on off stump, creating his own line, and peppering the leg side. And when the world caught up, he went the other way, standing on uncharted parts of the pitch and belting the ball over the off side. The coaching manuals had been rewritten. But then he started to do it in Test matches, the game’s purest form. At Headingley last summer he strode to the middle and simply larruped his first delivery from Stuart Broad over extra-cover for six. It has been more than simply self‑belief, but leadership.</p>

<p>And this is where McCullum’s real legacy rests. His succession from Ross Taylor created a furore, mostly because it was seen as a coup and the demotion of a good man had been handled clumsily if not ruthlessly. But no one can now say it was not done with inspirational foresight. New Zealand had always played their cricket a certain almost generic way, cautiously, intelligently, maximising their limited resource.</p>

<p>In Martin Crowe, Jeremy Coney and Stephen Fleming – the last of them the finest Test captain of his time – they had supreme cricket brains but it was always self-deprecating “ little old New Zealand”, punching above their weight, the perennial underdog yapping at the heels. Second fiddle, too, in their own country to rugby union.</p>

<p>One day, in Cape Town, a little more than three years ago, it changed. In less than two hours of McCullum’s first game in charge New Zealand had been dismissed for 45 in fewer than 20 overs as prelude to an innings defeat. At a meeting the new captain asked his team to reevaluate not their performance as such, but why they played, what the perception of them was, and how they would like to be regarded in their land where, against rugby, they were an irrelevance. It was about their philosophy.</p>

<p>Led by McCullum, the outcome has been clear for all to see. Their achievements are now an adjunct to those of the All Blacks, to be celebrated, in a parochial country with no more than three degrees of separation. It has made fine players of journeymen and outstanding ones of some who were good. When he set his slips and gulleys in the World Cup, it actually brought very few direct results, but the manner in which it lifted the bowlers from those who sought protection to hunters wasinestimable.</p>

<p>It has had an effect beyond the Black Caps. When they toured England last summer they showed the game could be played aggressively, competitively, but with fun and without rancour. It was an ethos into which the England team, used to cloistered self-protection, bought. From it we see Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler. That tour by the New Zealanders, I maintained, and still do, is the most important ever to come to this country. McCullum has changed the perception of how the game can and should be played, not just within his own team but those elsewhere. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a> owes him a massive debt.</p>

It was great watching Bmac go in the last 2-3 years and the way that the other players seemed to be dragged along in his wake. The quick century was a nice touch but I think the high point must be the 300 against the Indians, not only because of the raw figures but also because it came at a point in the game when the wheels had come off.

I was meaning more the attacking fields at the start of the game with three slips. The cwc game against England is a good example. Sri Lanka definitely personified attacking batting at the start of an innings, I also enjoyed Syed Anwar going crazy for Pakistan.

Sorry, I very much disagree. I watched plenty of NZ cricket during the nineties and remember both Greatbatch and Latham. I also remember NZ opening the bowling with the spinner during the '92 World Cup, which was great.

Jonathan Milmow an ex county cricketer writing in New Zealand laid out the obvious case to bat second 48 hours before the match. Those that knew about cricket saw it was common sense.

didn't oz get smashed in england with the series being done and dusted with a test still to go? with oz curling up and whimpering the moment the ball moved in the air? and won't even mention how they got obliterated in the uae, where nz actually managed to "draw" again. so, wouldn't exactly scoff at nz's draws when oz have done much worse.

To state and believe he left New Zealand cricket in a better place is the best any player can hope for,all the other debatables fade by comparison.A lot of the rhetoric is just opinion,driven by personal reactions to his tenure and how he played.To my mind he certainly did leave the N Z team and N Z cricket supporters in a far better place than they were not all that long ago,farewell M Mac.

McCullum's achievements aren't just measurable in stats of course but since you've raised that first one let's look at it:



Author::::holdingahighline
DateTime::::2016-02-24T09:21:00Z
Substitute Worrell for Sobers on your list - and I'd add Ranatunga, Illingworth, Ian Chappell, Graeme Smith and Vaughan to that list. Probably Tony Greig as well.

Steve Smith has just led his team to a 4-0 win across two series against McCullum. The two teams, most people thought, were pretty evenly matched at the start. That wasn't just wishful-thinking - NZ had had better results than Australia in England and the UAE. Australia finished with their two best bowlers injured while NZ had their first choice bowling attack available. Smith finishes the series with a career average now over sixty.

Exactly. There is a growing realisation that behaviour on the field is a large part of the legacy that a team or a player leaves behind when they retire. In modern parlance it would be the 'brand'.

I think what people are appreciating about BMac is that he was instrumental in getting NZ to play an 'attacking' cricket. Now Aus also played that long before BMac even debuted, but Aussie version of attacking cricket is very different from what BMac and his team show cased. The only thing common between Aus & NZ brands of attacking cricket was the scoring rate.BMac definitely deserves credit for getting his team to believe and demonstrate that you can be nice and still bat, bowl & field attackingly, It helped NZ to excel in the field more often than not and was enjoyable to watch.

jeepers, to even compete against Australia is a feat in itself. Cricket in Australia is like rugby union back home.. comes as close to a state religion as you are going to get. Plus, cricket is not the sport of choice for most kids in NZ, for weather related reasons more than anything. So you are starting with a much smaller base and playing against a country with a much bigger population who follow it passionately. Remember how long it took for Australia to even deign to play New Zealand? I think what the Black Caps have achieved over their entire history is phenomenal and McCallum lifted the performance in his own particular way. I think that is what makes him so great. It's the ability to make so much out of so few resources. Other captains are undoubtedly better than him in the grander scheme of things but when you view what McCallum has done and where the Black Caps were when he took over, his captaincy was a real sterling performance. Speaking of which, what's the pound up to today? I have to settle a bill.

i think the part about mccullum that is admirable is that he realizes and owns upto mistakes in his past. and he aslo realized that he can change and was willing to ensure that he did. it's generally rather difficult to change entrenched modes of behavior, at least that is something that i've found, to my cost at times!



Author::::robbo956
DateTime::::2016-02-24T08:50:56Z
I agree.This is English writer in an English paper though.The behaviour of the English team certainly improved after the NZ tour last year. This may have coincided with the change of coaching staff also, but there is no doubt that the young English players could look at BMac and see a very competitive figure who played hard but fair cricket and didn't feel the need to personally abuse all and sundry in the name of 'passion' or 'wanting to win'.There is nothing more embarrassing as a sports supporter than when your team is both graceless and rubbish. This time last year England were both.

yes, lanka played a different brand of odi cricket with jayasuriya and kaluwitharana going blitzkrieg from the get go. but that wasn't in tests. and, if truth be told, the kiwis had already pioneered that approach about 5 years previously. i should have made it clear that it is tests that is being referred to.

You have absolutely no idea.He was like the master puppeteer vs England in England last tour, a big part of the reason why we almost won that series along with the home series previous to that in nz.He didn't have I'm form cattle in this series.Smith is naive and petulant by comparison.



Author::::Aucklander1
DateTime::::2016-02-24T08:15:02Z
Rubbish!Maccullum was the ultimate team man.His issue is that he didn't have a good defensive game vs quality test bowling so he tended to attack as he thought the next ball would have his number on it. Go watch his interview with Ian smith for an insight



Author::::Aucklander1
DateTime::::2016-02-24T08:11:37Z
He was the reason we got to the final on the first place and he played that way throughout the tournament I think if you asked his team if they saw him as self centred you would get a negative response.One of the best captains over the last 20 years without a doubt.
