Testing, testing: watch out for Ferrari, Red Bull and new kids on the F1 grid

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">Y</span></span>ou may not necessarily associate bobble hats and thermal underwear with <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a> but they will be out in force at the Circuit de Catalunya next week.</p>

<p>Even Barcelona is a bit chilly on an early morning in February, when most of us will be gathering for the start of the testing season. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jan/14/f1-new-track-driver-politics-bernie-ecclestone" title="">new team Haas</a> are launching their car at 7.50am, which will be a challenge, and not only for them.</p>

<p>There are only two testing sessions this year instead of three, which means eight days in all, four for each driver, and much less than that if there are teething problems.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/17/red-bull-christian-horner-f1-renault-engine">Red Bull’s Christian Horner hopes Renault reconciliation can revive team</a> </p>

<p>There are treats in store for the early birds. There will be cars with plumes of smoke coming out of the back and there will be prangs, the worst outcome for drivers and teams with time so short. Which is why the cars will, mostly, be driven at 80-90%, with perhaps a bit more ambition in the following week, also in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Testing has changed so much, as have the car launches, which are now mostly done online. Teams hit the track following a great deal of simulation work complete with all the data they have gathered from their wind tunnel and other work. But even then, no one can be certain what will happen on the track.</p>

<p>The strong teams – and Mercedes are clear favourites for the title following their swaggering domination of the past two years – will be looking to pound in the laps before finishing with some qualifying simulations with a low fuel load at the end of the week.</p>

<p>But I will be spending more time watching Ferrari, McLaren and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/red-bull">Red Bull</a> in an attempt to assess how much progress they have made. I will also be keen to see the first runs from Haas, who look like being the best prepared new team of recent years, which is not saying a great deal.</p>

<p>During testing a struggling team can fall further and hopelessly behind. Last year, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/mclaren">McLaren</a> put in less than a third of the miles clocked by Mercedes because of the awful problems they had with the Honda engine.</p>

<p>Red Bull, with their Renault engine, are still expected to have problems this year, at least in the first half of the season but the team principal, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/17/red-bull-christian-horner-f1-renault-engine" title="">Christian Horner</a>, is looking to football for inspiration.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/18/rio-haryanto-manor-racing-first-indonesian-f1-driver">Rio Haryanto joins Manor to become Indonesia’s first F1 driver</a> </p>

<p>“Who could have imagined that Leicester City would be winning the Premiership at the moment and that Chelsea would be in the position they are?” he said at the team’s livery launch in London on Wednesday. “Things change. That’s part of sporting cycles and I hope we’re coming out of a difficult cycle and about to re-emerge into a positive upward trend.”</p>

<p>“I’m a Coventry City man,” Horner added, as if to underline the resilience of his optimism.</p>

<p>Horner, like everyone else, surely, would like the drivers to become the stars of the show. “Formula One needs to be more about the drivers. The drivers need to be a bigger differential within the whole package,” he said. “And we have a great opportunity to address that for 2017.”</p>

<p>Horner agreed Lewis Hamilton is once again the driver to beat, despite coming <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/23/f1-2016-lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg-mercedes-ferrari" title="">second best to his team-mate Nico Rosberg</a> in the concluding races of last season: “How high was Lewis’s motivation in those last few races? He’s a multiple world champion. But he’s had a winter off to go away and reflect, recharge and goes into the season absolutely as the man to beat.”</p>

<p>Barcelona is unlikely to tell us anything new about Hamilton. But for the rookies, such as Renault’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/08/jolyon-palmer-renault-formula-one-debut-season" title="">Jolyon Palmer</a> and the Manor drivers, Pascal Wehrlein and the Indonesian <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/18/rio-haryanto-manor-racing-first-indonesian-f1-driver" title="">Rio Haryanto</a> – who was named on Thursday morning to complete the 22-man grid – there is much to learn.</p>

I see there is still no main sponsor on the McLaren. Interested to see how Haas get on. Don't think Ferrari are going to catch Mercedes.

You prefer one 24 hour race to 18 2 hour races? Well, it takes all sorts I suppose. But i have to say I'd rather watch the worlds finest drivers for a couple of hours every fortnight than watch has beens and never weres for a day.

Because that's Touring Cars not F1. Engineering advantage has been as much a part of F1 since day one as anything else.

I wonder if Haas will fare any better than most of the recent new entrants. Or will their cars do the following:1. Fail to emerge from the garage at all?2. Break down in the pit lane?3. Complete a handful of ludicrously slow laps?



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-19T16:55:09Z
You're missing the point. The car was aerodynamically sound, the engine was using something like two thirds of its power due to the ERS failing.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-19T15:31:18Z
I think in reality the power was there, they just could never use it without the thing blowing up.

Button and Alonso finished 16th and 17th, beating the Marussias and a single Sauber. That is not decent, that's diabolical by McLaren standards. Let's hope Honda have managed to produce a miracle this year.

You haven't provided a SHRED of proof that the Hondas design is revolutionary and has the potential to leave everyone standing . Provide detailed formal links otherwise this is merely your opinion.

I've heard rumours from somewhere that McLaren have found a significant amount of horsepower from somewhere. Have you heard anything about that?



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-19T12:59:05Z
The car was decent last year, sixth fastest in the slow parts of Abu Dhabi. The Honda's design is revolutionary and has the potential to leave everyone standing if they sort the reliability and then turn the ERS up full. Which one presumes they will solve over the winter.

Hamilton described his 2015 Mercedes as the best car he had ever driven after one of his wins this season.

Yes but not a lot about innovative engineering----just think about the huge power and aerodynamic changes since the end of WW2. And I saw Fangio drive, very different days.In reality, I prefer 'LE MANS'.

Never been sure why sports like rewarding failure. Like the NFL draft system, it seems a bit counter-productive. Don't reward them; make them up their game.



Author::::UrinalShuvinsky
DateTime::::2016-02-19T11:17:26Z
Yeah and while we're at it, let's make Rooney play for Aston Villa for a few games every season. That should even things up a bit.



Author::::UrinalShuvinsky
DateTime::::2016-02-19T11:15:01Z
It's boring watching the field stream by enjoying a 40kph advantage, unable to do anything about it. Strangely enough, you don't see Hamilton or Vettel making the same kind of comment.

Why not use a weight handicap as they do in BTCC - it works. Also reverse grids!

Equalise the cars all you want you will still get Hamilton, Vettel and Alonso dominating. They are the best, unless off course you suggest they be handicapped

I live in Bristol now.I know the service from Felixstowe to Ipswich is regularly suspended as Container freight takes priority.Last train from Liverpool Street to Ipswich is late evening with no connections at Ipswich after 10pm, so no change there but they have finished the electrification.But the A12 to London is still the same - Up and down, dual carriageway with loads of bends, rubbish surface, road crammed with container lorries.Suffolk, like Cornwall and Devon, has not one mile of motorway.

Vettel said F1 is boring because of mercs dominance. What an expletive hypocrite. At least Lewis had to earn his titles. Vettel was clearly the preferred driver at red bull.

I'm not entirely sure myself!Unfortunately the earliest I got to witness was the fag end of the Burley years. So brief Premier League football aside, all I know is the Championship! I know it's an F1 article, but general thought on Town is lack of investment means we'll probably scrap a respectable, upper-end mid-table finish, considering what others around us are spending.

Top trolling! Brilliant in its perversely selective use of last seasons stats. Rosberg beat Hamilton 5 times to the win- 3 of these wins came after Lewis had already beaten him 10 times and won the Championship!

It'll be interesting to see if NR can maintain the form he showed in the final third of last season or if his team-mate can re-establish the dominance that took him to the last two WDCs. My money is on the latter.

I love your confidence. But it wakes more than that for a Brit to hand victory to a German. It's national pride at stake here, not just the trophy. And let's put another thing in perspective: Lewis only started to come 2nd to Nico after he had won the championship and was busy hanging out with Rihanna. I'll leave it to you to have a guess where most of his energy was spent before he git the tracks.

To the three other Ipswich Town fans that read this article, Jolyon Palmer is a Town fan! Actually, that's a bit of trivia for y'all there.
