Ireland recall Jared Payne to midfield for Six Nations match with Italy




DateTime::::2016-03-10T14:18:27+0000



<p>Joe Schmidt has signalled Ireland’s desperation for victory against Italy on Saturday by restoring the fit-again Jared Payne back into his midfield rather than shifting the Ulsterman to full-back.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/21/ireland-win-six-nations-england-fall-short" title="">The 2015 Six Nations champions</a> are still chasing their first win of this year’s tournament at the fourth time of asking, leaving their head coach refusing to take any chances against the Azzurri in Dublin.</p>

<p>Rob Kearney has failed to overcome his hamstring strain, leading Schmidt to slot Simon Zebo into the full-back place. Schmidt could have shifted the 30-year-old Payne to the 15 shirt to allow Ulster’s Stuart McCloskey to continue at inside centre. However, the coach has resisted the temptation to build for the future and has decided against handing McCloskey another opportunity.</p>

<p>McCloskey won his Test debut in Ireland’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/27/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report" title="">21-10 defeat by England</a>, forming a bruising midfield partnership with Robbie Henshaw.</p>

<p>Payne missed the Twickenham match with hamstring trouble but has been brought straight back into the No13 role after finding full fitness at the start of the week. Schmidt has long staked much of his Ireland tenure around the New Zealand-born Payne’s defensive stability in midfield, and has duly reverted to type at the first given opportunity.</p>

<p>Leinster’s Josh van der Flier continues at openside flanker with Sean O’Brien ruled out for the tournament.</p>

<p>S Zebo (Munster); A Trimble, J Payne (both Ulster), R Henshaw (Connacht), K Earls (Munster); J Sexton (Leinster), C Murray (Munster); J McGrath (Leinster), R Best (Ulster, capt), M Ross (Leinster), D Ryan (Munster) D Toner (Leinster), CJ Stander (Munster), J Van der Flier, J Heaslip (both Leinster).</p>

It's not the selection - or at least it's not the players. It's the pathetic game plan. It's failed for a long time and it's so boring and predictable. Schmidt is the architect. He's no world class coach. Far from it, he's already yesterday's man - it's just that some people don;t see it yet. Failure to prepare a team worthy of playing for something in the RWC was one thing, but it's frankly embarrassing to see them come up so short in nous in what is a very mediocre 6 Nations. It's not the poor results either. It's thehway they're being told to play. Time to go, JS.

Bizarrely there is only 5 months in age between Billy Vunipola and Josh Van Der Flier.

I'd be a bit more complimentary of Schmidt but essentially I agree with you.

"Schmidt must go". Really? The man won us back to back titles ffs. I agree our line speed was awful and that for me was why Payne is so valuable at 13. Against Wales we were in there faces from the get go. Everyone complains about Payne being at 13 but without him leading the defensive line we are just standing off and passive. Payne may not give you as many line breaks as McCloskey for example. But I'd take his defensive qualities over that until McCloskey and Rubgrose develop further. The McFadden selection is frustrating as I also believe Gilroy deserved a chance. But saying JSs time is up is just ridiculous. We could easily have 2 wins from 3 but we don't. It takes time to develop attacking strategies. Look how long it took at Leinster? But JS is one of the best in the world. IMO Pat Lam could be a great test coach in the future and he's the one I'll be keeping an eye on when JS eventually calls time on his Irish career but he's earned the right to decide when. Let's also not forget we need to be as high in the rankings as possible before the next WC draw that's coming up soon or we will find ourselves in a pool of death so that's why we need to win our next two games and JS is still trying to blood new players. Everyone needs to calm down. In Joe I trust.

Schmidt is the real problem now for Ireland. McCloskey dropped even as he had a good first outing. This season he's made line-break after line break and run through the Saracens and Toulouse defences twice. Meanwhile Gilroy is still scoring solo tries from 70 metres out - beating five men on the way. But it's not just Schmidt's conservative selection - and incomprehensible failure to bring on badly needed new blood in the backs - but his futile tactics. Against England it was infuriating to watch the backs stand off and let the English team run at them making 40 metres every time. So much for the outdated drift defence. By contrast, the Irish backs were under immediate pressure every time from quick English line speed. Then we have the mindless forward impact play with no offloads - predictable, lacking skill and creativity. It's so easy to defend against. What are the bloody backs for if we don't use them in attacking situations?

And those same players and same tactics were seriously embarrassed against SH opposition. The World Cup showed that all NH teams need to change. We are a long way behind the SH already and simply repeating what we are doing is not going to close the gap. This match presented an opportunity for Ireland to try something new with new players in a test match environment prior to embarking on four away test matches and two at home against top class teams.

Yes we need to beat Italy and we will. To be fair that is not much of an achievement. Which is exactly why we should blooding the next generation right now. The tournament is gone and is money all that matters?

The only players that can come in, according to you, are Jackson, Gilroy and McCloskey, I think. We'll, I'm sorry, I disagree that they'll add something to the party. McCloskey has potential, I'm loathe to criticise a first capper, but clearly wasn't good enough at this level, yet. Jackson and Gilroy would only make the bench, anyway, so your argument is invalid.

neither McCloskey or Ringrose have done enough to be seen as permanent replacements yet.

Well, he hasn't "just gone 28", in 3 weeks he will be as close to his 29th birthday, though he is younger than people seem to think.

I think Trimble is finished at international level. All those injuries in a fairly long career have caught up with him now. He has lost every bit of pace he had.

Earls is just gone 28 and is by far the best back for ruck resourcing. He hits more rucks than some of the backrowers. Pity none of the centres he is operating outside can pass or offload and has to work with very limited ball supply. One of the first backs on Joe team sheet now since he has had most of his injuries sorted.

If we're picking Payne because of Italy's attacking threat then we're fecked when we meet the All Blacks.McFadden offers nothing from the bench. If we need someone to provide a spark against tired legs on the last 20 mins is McFadden really the best choice?



Author::::rhubarbsonofnectan
DateTime::::2016-03-10T21:28:41Z
I don't particularly fancy him myself but he's a solid enough pro and covers a few positions. My point was regarding McCloskey's lack of versatility - he either starts or he's not in the 23.

Each to their own. McFadden is pretty mediocre though.

Harsh on TOD, I was sure that Vunipola making VDF look like schoolboy would have got him back in running. (good prospect and all that he is)



Author::::John79LK
DateTime::::2016-03-10T20:23:06Z
Payne has to play 13. he IS Ireland's back line defence. McFadden tho, I can already hear the groans as he warms up. At least The Kearney's are injured.

"Schmidt, contrary to popular belief, has been given the roughest ride as Ireland coach compared to his predecessors. He has capped more players in the last 3 years than any Irish coach since Gatland. He's won the last 2 six nations .." - a big part of the anti-Schmidt brigade in Ireland is made up of one prominent blowhard, George Hook. Hook is regularly featured in print and broadcast decrying the tactics, coaching, selection of the Ireland team - attributing all of the shortcomings to one Joe Schmidt! Objectivity left the stable many years ago when it comes to Mr. Hook's opinions of the New Zelander - now if only the coach's record reflected those opinions accurately!

Believe it or not, Earls is still in his 20s. He's been around for yonks, but still plenty left in the tank.

I agree with you - far too many people 'slamming' the coach over his player selection. The ideal time for experimentation will be the Summer tour. There is also the issue of prize money determined by where a country finishes on the final day of the 6 Nations table.

We need to win this game and take the pressure off the players. I think Schmidt is right to reunite Payne and Henshaw at centre, they're a fairly new partnership after all. It's hard on McCloskey who's been excellent for Ulster and did well against England. Both he and Garry Ringrose are great prospects and should benefit from the summer tour. If we win well against Italy then the Scotland match may be a better game in which to experiment. If we'd been able to field our settled first team and failed to win in our first three matches then I could see the argument for wholesale changes but as we've been decimated by injury there's no need for a knee-jerk response.

As for Fergus McFadden covering wing and centre, McCloskey could be on the bench, Zebo covers wing and Payne goes to 15 - his best position anyway!

Its amazing how quickly people lose their faith in sport. All it requires is one or 2, "prominent", individuals to stoke the doubts in the disillusioned and their opinion becomes legitimate. There is nothing wrong with the selection, tactics or coaching. There is no over-conservatism. Ireland is not going backwards. People need to calm down.

Forgive a Welshman for commenting, but you have got some seriously good young backs and forwards coming through, e.g. Ringrose, McCloskey, Dillan, Henderson and Van de Flier. It shows how silly the comments were at the beginning of the season about an ageing Team with no brightness on the horizon. And similar comments about the provinces in the Pro12. Still I am surprised at Schmidt's selection for this match; never saw him as an over- cautious coach.

Mcfadden is not international standard. Handy player but that's it. Listened to the team election announcement and Schmidt was saying he was lookingfor stability and flexibility. Madigan can cover 10, 12 and 15. Zebo can play two positions whereas Jackson and McCloskey can only play one. This is his rationale.But surely, if payne can play 13 & 15, Henshaw can play 12, 13, and 15 then there is space for Mccloskey at 12. Moreover, Jackson is playing really well at the moment. Earls could be replaced by Gilroy easily as he can fill wing and fullback... Why not try and shift around the backline a bit for combinations for the last two games? Defies belief...

Oh yeah, and agree with you about Earls, very busy and quick but doesn't play for the team and isn't as good as he thinks he is. IMHO.

If he played a younger team and they lost, the public would understand. 



Author::::PeteTheBeat

In the back 5, I would have had Payne, Trimble, Henshaw, McCloskey and Zebo.

Guess JS believes they can't afford to lose, and if they defend as passively as they did against England and Argentina the Italian outside backs could do a lot of damage.
