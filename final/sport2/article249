<p>Mick Fanning’s year from hell could earn him two Laureus World Sports awards. The surfer and fellow Australian <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/jason-day">Jason Day</a> have been short-listed as finalists for the prestigious annual awards, with winners of the 17th edition to be announced on 18 April in Berlin.</p>

<p>Three-time world champion Fanning is nominated in the action sportsperson category, however it is the comeback of the year category that appears most likely to secure him an award.</p>

<p>The comeback category is usually the domain of those who have returned from retirement or significant injury. But Fanning’s return to competition after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/19/surfer-mick-fanning-battles-shark-attack-at-j-bay-open-im-just-tripping">fighting off a great white shark</a> in the final of the Jeffreys Bay event in South Africa last July garnered worldwide attention and could put him ahead of a field that includes swimming’s Michael Phelps, rugby’s Dan Carter and skiing’s Lyndsey Vonn.</p>

<p>Fanning returned to the world tour in the next event at Tahiti, and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/18/mick-fanning-narrowly-loses-world-surf-title-bid-to-adriano-de-souza-after-brother-peters-death">almost claimed the world title</a> in Hawaii last December, in the same week his brother Peter died.</p>

<p>Day will again go head to head with American world No1 golfer Jordan Spieth when the world breakthrough of the year award is decided. The 28-year-old Australian won his first major championship – the US PGA Championship – last August with a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/17/jason-day-jordan-spieth-us-pga-whistling-straits">record score of 20-under-par</a>.</p>

<p>He also won the Canadian Open, The Barclays and BMW Championship and bagged the world No1 ranking before losing it again to Spieth who bagged his first two majors –the Masters and US Open – among his wins last year.</p>

<p>The All Blacks will be favoured to win team of the year after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/01/new-zealand-hails-phenomenal-all-blacks-after-rugby-world-cup-victory">their World Cup triumph</a>, while Serena Williams could win a third world sportswoman award.</p>

Not fair to have Mick Fanning by himself. It should have been Mick Fanning and Shark.

What is the action sportsperson category? Most sport is action oriented, no? Maybe not bowls.
