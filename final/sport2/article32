The Joy of Six: great World Twenty20 cricket innings




DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:00:30+0000



<p>Given their track record of failure in short forms of the game both before and after 2010, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/09/england-won-2010-world-twenty20-cricket">England’s victory in the Caribbean</a> seems like it couldn’t possibly have happened. The time continuum must have been disrupted, creating a new temporal event sequence resulting in an alternate reality in which Biff is corrupt, powerful, and married to your mother, and England are World Twenty20 champions. But, with help from Grays Sports Almanac or not, it did happen. Kevin Pietersen was key, scoring 248 runs in his six games at a strike-rate close to 140: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/videos/media/id/df909c4a3b7f4195a855d85a1be9b93f/kevin-pietersens-73-v-pakistan-wt20-2010">73 from 52 balls</a> in the opening Super 8s game against Pakistan as England chased down 147 to win; 53 from 33 against South Africa in a victory that took them into the semi-finals; 42 from 26 in that semi-final against Sri Lanka as England again chased down victory.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/16/the-joy-of-six-sixes">The Joy of Six: sixes</a> </p>

<p>In the final Australia, who had <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/videos/media/id/386ee1a1bd924a5490032e38e9f22029/pakistan-v-australia-wt20-2010-semi-final">stunned Pakistan in their semi-final</a>, awaited. England were ebullient and the formula – bowl first, strangle with spin, aggressively chase manageable target – seemed to be working once more. After 12 overs Australia were 59 for four, after 16 they were 97 for five. The Hussey brothers and Cameron White, though, smashed 50 from the last four overs, a total that would have been higher had Stuart Broad not bowled a brilliant final over that went for seven. </p>

<p>At the innings break, Mike Atherton reckoned that England would win “at a canter”. Fate duly tempted, they had scored three runs from their first 10 balls when Shaun Tait removed Michael Lumb. “Here we go again …” groaned a nation. But Pietersen had other ideas, steadying the ship (while going at a run-a-ball) as Craig Kieswetter attacked, before joining the assault himself. </p>

<p>By the time Pietersen departed for 47 from 31, England needed only 30 more for victory with 41 balls to play with. They were all but home and hosed. Pietersen has played plenty more eye-catching innings, but few more important.</p>

<p>There was nothing particularly extraordinary about the result of this match – New Zealand beat Bangladesh by 59 runs in the opening Group D match in Pallekele. But the way the Black Caps got there was rather special. Brendon McCullum’s 123 from 58 balls remains the highest ever score in a <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldtwenty20">World Twenty20</a> game, and the third highest international Twenty20 score of all time.</p>

<p>It’s also one of only two World <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/twenty20">Twenty20</a> centuries not scored by an opener. The other came when Suresh Raina rattled off 101 against South Africa in 2010 from No3 – but in that match, the first Indian wicket had fallen from the second ball. Against Bangladesh, McCullum had walked out midway through the fourth over. It began in what was rather sedate fashion. For McCullum, at least. His first 36 runs came from 23 balls, the next 36 from 19. The final 51 runs came off just 15 deliveries.</p>

<p>The style – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/videos/media/id/14be9de1e2f940c698aa7f7a229df1cc">a blend of crunching pulls and clubbing drives</a> – would be familiar to anyone who has watched McCullum tee off in Twenty20. His seven sixes all came in a fat V between extra cover and cow corner. He’ll be sadly missed in this year’s tournament.</p>

<p>Twice in the inaugural World Twenty20, Pakistan’s Misbah-ul-Haq came within a whisker of pulling off the most unlikely of rescues against India. Twice he failed at the last – akin to Superman letting Lois Lane slip through his fingers from a great height, or John McClane getting to Hans Gruber’s detonators too late. In the group stage, Pakistan had been 47 for four, chasing India’s 141, when Misbah strolled out to the crease – 11 overs later, he smeared Sreesanth for runs that took him to 53 from 34 balls and Pakistan to 141. Two balls remained. One run was all that was required. He failed to make contact with the next delivery, was run out off the last, and India won the bowl-out.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/jan/15/the-joy-of-six-run-outs">The Joy of Six: run-outs</a> </p>

<p>Ten days later, the two teams met again in the final at the Wanderers. India rattled up 157; Pakistan limped to 64 for four midway through the ninth over. Again Misbah donned his cape. Around him, his team-mates crumbled under the pressure. By the end of the 16th over, Pakistan were seven down and needed 54 from 24 balls. Three clubbing Misbah sixes from one Harbhajan Singh over gave them hope. </p>

<p>It came to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwAt_4oK61c">the final over</a>. Nine down, 13 required. Joginder Sharma to bowl. He began with a wide – 12 needed – then went wide again, this time beating Misbah’s swipe. Next up was a full toss clubbed gleefully back over the bowler’s head for six, taking Misbah to 43 from 37 balls – and leaving Pakistan needing just six more from four balls. The rescue was almost complete. But from the next, Misbah shuffled outside off and attempted a pre-meditated ramp. It was a slower ball. The scoop floated up to Sreesanth, two-thirds of the way to the boundary at fine leg, and the catch was taken. Misbah had failed at the very last, and India were champions.</p>

<p>“This gentleman here, Michael Hussey, is just an absolute freak.” Michael Clarke wasn’t mincing his words after watching Mr <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a> pull his Australia side out of a hole in the most dramatic fashion in the 2010 semi-final against Pakistan.</p>

<p>Australia had marched into the semi-finals undefeated, with five wins from five, though Hussey had twice already dug them out of the sticky stuff, with 47 from 29 balls against Bangladesh when his team had been reduced to 57 for five after 11 overs, and 39 from 26 against Sri Lanka when another top order collapse had left Australia 67 for five at the same stage. </p>

<p>On those occasions they were batting first, striving to set competitive totals. Against Pakistan they were chasing – but making a pig’s ear of it all the same. Pakistan, thanks to the Akmal boys, had made 191 in St Lucia. Australia were 67 for four at the halfway stage in reply and by the time Hussey came to the crease, at the fall of the fifth wicket in the middle of the 13th over, they required an unlikely 85 from 42 balls. </p>

<p>Hussey, aided and abetted by Cameron White with 43 from 31, set about the rebuilding job but this time it appeared he was going to come up short. With three overs to go 48 were still needed and with six balls remaining Australia were 18 runs short. Pre action-reconstruction Saaed Ajmal skipped in to bowl the final over. Mitchell Johnson squirted away a single. And <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://youtu.be/lFDbMohiUCM?t=2m33s">Hussey went ballistic</a>.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/14/australia-pakistan-world-twenty20-live-scores">Six, six, four, six, game over</a>. “By the end there I was just swinging hard as I could every ball,” said a disbelieving Hussey after the celebrations had calmed down. “I can’t believe we have won the game. This is the best feeling of my career. I have hit the winning runs in an Ashes Test at Adelaide, but this was right up there.”</p>

<p>Perhaps <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/20/cricket.worldtwenty2020075">the most Yuvraj Singh innings of all time</a>. England were already out of the tournament and on their way to a hiding under the lights in Durban when Yuvraj sauntered to the crease after the fourth ball of the 16th over. Just 26 balls remained in the innings – plenty of time for Yuvraj to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/videos/media/id/95201bfe1dc348948feda3ede2175a94/yuvraj-singhs-six-sixes-v-england-wt20-2007">hit six sixes off an over</a>, score a 50, make a bit of history and get himself out.</p>

<p>Stuart Broad was the unfortunate victim. India were 171 for three at the start of the 19th over. By the end of it they were 207 for three. Ball No1: the front leg gets out of the way and the ball is heaved into the stands at cow corner. Ball No2: the feet don’t go anywhere but the ball whistles to cow corner once more. Ball No3: again the front foot gets out of Dodge, but this time he smears the ball high over the covers. Ball No4: Broad comes round the wicket. The ball is a rank full toss outside off that Yuvraj simply clips over backward point for six. Ball No5: again, front foot goes slightly to leg, but there’s a hint of slog sweep about this one. Ball No6: and the last is a carbon copy of the first.</p>

<p>That final maximum took him to 50 from 12 balls – the fastest ever in international Twenty20 and still the joint-quickest in any format:<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/18/chris-gayle-smashes-50-to-match-fastest-twenty20-half-century-crickety"> Chris Gayle matched the feat</a> for the Melbourne Renegades against the Adelaide Strikers earlier this year. And Yuvraj became the first man to hit six sixes in an over in Twenty20, and the fourth in all formats after Garry Sobers, Ravi Shastri and Herschelle Gibbs.</p>

<p>He still had time to be caught by Paul Collingwood off the bowling of Andrew Flintoff before the innings was over. Little did he know the most remarkable part of the evening was still to come – England got to within 18 runs of India’s 218.</p>

<p>Opening the batting in the opening game of the first ever World Twenty20 match against the host nation – this was a stage set for Chris Gayle, and he duly delivered. The first ball was blasted square for four and the tone was set. His 50 took 26 balls and by the mid-point of the 15th over <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/videos/media/id/22a22fc5c89445c98a5524d4ab965b0a/chris-gayles-117-v-sa-wt20-2007">Gayle had his century</a>, the first ever scored in a Twenty20 international and one that has been followed by only five more in the subsequent World Twenty20 tournaments.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/01/the-joy-of-six-world-twenty20">The Joy of Six: World Twenty20</a> </p>

<p>By the time Gayle edged Johan van der Wath behind to Mark Boucher, Gayle had made 117 from 57 balls, a high-score in the World Twenty20 that stood until McCullum surpassed him in 2012 with his 123. The rest of the West Indies team could not match Gayle’s assault, but 206 was a formidable target to set South Africa.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.icc-cricket.com/world-t20/videos/media/id/816459a7aed34676b748397cbf94634f/herschelle-gibbs-90-v-wi-at-wt20-2007">Step forward Herschelle Gibbs</a>, who would likely have become the second Twenty20 centurion had his team-mates not displayed more aptitude than Gayle’s. Gibbs crunched an unbeaten 90 from 55 balls and, thanks to useful support from Justin Kemp (46 from 22), Graeme Smith (28 from 21) and West Indies’ bowling attack (23 wides), South Africa cruised to their target with 14 balls to spare. </p>

<p>As for Gayle, a three-ball duck followed against Bangladesh, who chased down 164 – this time with 12 balls to spare – to send West Indies out at the first hurdle. </p>

Actually, I don't think they are in any order. I certainly don't think anyone would argue that KP scoring 47 in 31 balls was the greatest ever T20 innings. You assume it's first in the list because the author thinks it's the best. I don't assume that.To be honest, even if he does think that, one could disagree with it without saying 'what a load of crap.' Did somebody die and make you god of all things cricket?

That was a very poor attempt at humor. One presumes that the list has been made in order of the greatest T20 innings as the title of the article also states Great World T20 Cricket innings. In my post I also stated that Yuvraj Singh's innings is the greatest World T20 innings, even after reading all of that you come here and ask me an asinine question like that.

What a load of crap no other T20 innings outshines the one Yuvraj Singh played against England. Nothing can compare to hitting 6 sixes in an over. He almost single handedly took India to the Finals of the T20 World Cup back then. One can forget every other T20 innings but not the 6 sixes in an over by Yuvraj Singh, that over by Broad and the subsequent destruction of his bowling by Yuvraj has defined the T20 format.

Yuvraj was an animal in 2007 and his semi final innings vs Australia is the single most important limited overs innings he played since the iconic knock in the oft-replayed (on TV) Natwest final in 2002 (?).

Not a particularly eye catching innings out of context, but my favourite would have to be Admiral the Lord Collingwood's unbeaten however many, including the winning runs, in the 2010 final. I am English, so biased, but who doesn't love Collingwood? No one, that's who.



Author::::dressedtodepress
DateTime::::2016-03-11T12:21:49Z
yeah, I was going to say that, yuvraj's highlight of that year was the 70. which combined the ruthlessness of the previous innings but also required a stealier nerve and some classy, clever stroke play. for a brief 15 minutes he was cricket's superstar.



Author::::gluck
DateTime::::2016-03-11T11:37:53Z
Amazingly, Yuvraj played an even better innings in the semi, coming in at 60/2 or so in the 11th over I think, and plundering 70 (30) to take India to 188. That man certainly made a habit of getting into hot streaks during World Cups, happily for India. A true LOI all time great.

I followed that Hussey innings through the cricinfo app in a hotel room and was absolutely riveted. There was no way he should have been able to pull it off, and the manner in which he did made me think England were doomed in the final. I probably would have found a reason for that anyhow, but my paranoid delusions had merit that time.
