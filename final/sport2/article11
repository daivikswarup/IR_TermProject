Where England’s Six Nations battle with Wales will be won and lost




DateTime::::2016-03-11T19:44:00+0000



<p>Try-scoring chances will be at a premium on Saturday, with Wales having conceded just four in the tournament and England a very miserly one. Wales’s defence under Shaun Edwards is a well-established unit but particular praise should go to Paul Gustard for making England so tight in his first tournament as coach.</p>

<p>For England to make any sort of dent in the Welsh line they must learn from France’s failed attempt to power over the top of them last month. There has been a lot of talk about stopping Billy Vunipola but direct runners will not break down a Welsh unit that includes in its number 17st centres and a 6ft 2in fly-half.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2016/mar/02/shaun-edwards-interview-england-wales-union-league-six-nations" title="">Edwards runs a very flat defence</a> with shoulders square to opponents and both wings in the line to create a 14-man wall. To pull this out of shape England need a multi-point attack with a number of options open to the ball carrier. This instils doubt in defenders’ minds about who is getting the ball and turns their shoulders, opening up spaces. England will use the dual threat of George Ford and Owen Farrell, alongside two pods of ball-carrying forwards in midfield, to keep Wales guessing, which they did to some effect against Ireland.</p>

<p>Don’t expect Wales <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/wales-rob-howley-champagne-rugby-union-six-nations-england" title="">to change the attacking formula they have developed</a> under Warren Gatland, irrespective of the calls to entertain. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/wales-jamie-roberts-england-six-nations" title="">Jamie Roberts will target</a> the outside shoulder of Ford and the inside of Farrell. The aim will be to utilise the size advantage Roberts has over Ford but equally he will be looking to force Farrell to turn his shoulder in, which will isolate Jonathan Joseph at outside centre. Roberts’ value is not just in the holes he bashes for himself, but also in the space he creates for his outside backs.</p>

<p>As Eddie Jones will readily tell you, Wales are known for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/10/eddie-jones-wales-scrummaging-terribly-illegally-england-six-nations-rugby" title="">manipulating the scrum engage.</a> But much of this reputation comes from the heyday of Adam Jones and Gethin Jenkins as the starting props. Adam Jones appears long gone at international level and Jenkins, out injured for the England match, has started all three of this season’s Six Nations games on the bench.</p>

<p>While they are still very happy to mix things up, in Samson Lee they now have a genuinely powerful scrummaging tighthead but he is inconsistent. He is capable of putting the opposition loosehead under real pressure but he still has days when he struggles and he has had problems handling Joe Marler. Saturday will be a measure of how far he has matured.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/03/wales-warren-gatland-six-nations-england-rugby">Twickenham no place for Warren Gatland’s Wales to abandon principles | Dean Ryan</a> </p>

<p>Paul James has replaced the injured Jenkins on the bench and he is a powerful scrummager. The likely contest between him and England’s replacement tighthead, Kieran Brookes, in the final 10 minutes may prove critical in a tight game. Brookes is a promising player but with 15 caps and only one start he is inexperienced, especially compared with the 65-cap James.</p>

<p>Whoever gets the upper hand at scrum time, there will be plenty going on for the officials to try to fathom, so it is quite some game for the referee Craig Joubert to make his return to Twickenham, where he was last seen running off the pitch after awarding a deeply contentious penalty to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/18/australia-scotland-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">Australia to hand them victory over Scotland</a> in the World Cup quarter-final. Joubert’s management of the scrum will be crucial and, with Dylan Hartley and Dan Cole in the starting front row, England will feel they have the advantage but they will have to stay patient. If they get frustrated they will lose the empathy of the officials, which makes any match an uphill battle.</p>

<p>Games as tight as this are decided in the last 10 minutes. If you are trailing by a score you want the bench to inject dynamism, but if you are a score ahead you want your replacements to bring cool heads and the composure to close the game out.</p>

<p>With this in mind, Wales look to have the more balanced bench, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/wales-name-unchanged-team-england-rugby-six-nations" title="">particularly with the fit-again Rhys Webb to call on.</a> The scrum-half’s serious injury appeared a real dent to their World Cup hopes until the emergence of the livewire Gareth Davies and my bet is that Gatland will be happy he is back if the game needs closing out.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/04/english-welsh-rivalry-player-eligibility">England-Wales rivalry becomes less red and white as players trade places</a> </p>

<p>Davies may hold the upper hand in counterattack but there is no doubting the reassuring presence Webb provides for his forwards can be crucial. On the other hand, if Wales are chasing the game they have the luxury of swapping the hard-tackling Dan Lydiate for the more elusive Justin Tipuric and adding Rhys Priestland to move their game away from the predictable.</p>

<p>England’s bench appears more geared to chasing than consolidating, with real game changers in Danny Care, Elliot Daly and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/eddie-jones-manu-tuilagi-six-nations-wales" title="">the returning messiah Manu Tuilagi.</a> The rush to get Tuilagi back in an England shirt illustrates how important he is to the cause and his presence may be crucial in swinging momentum if it is needed.</p>

<p>Where England may be vulnerable is if they have a slender lead going into the final minutes when the composure of a number of their bench players may be tested. In Luke Cowan-Dickie, Brookes and Daly they have promising but inexperienced players and when they are asked to hit double top, hold a scrum or defend their line in the final minutes of a game of this magnitude, their Test credentials will be strenuously examined.</p>

An analogy is comparing two things which are similar. This is not the same as saying that two different things produce the same effect. To use an analogy, you're comparing apples and oranges. Epic fail on so many levels.

Should be a great game the best two teams currently in the NH which isnt saying that much. I take England by 10 to 14 points because I think they have a vastly superior front 5 and more guile behind the scrum as well as having Tuilagi in reserve. Wales will have to improve drastically on their performances to date to have a chance

Sky have some of these games and can be accessed on Now TV for £6.99 for a 24 hour view (no contract). Wales have a really strong team with standouts at 3,6,8 and 11. England are almost entirely under 19s and physically it showed in the collisions and scrum. And their defence is awful. Wales is in NZ's group but I think they have a decent chance to top the group.The England side will be bigger and better in the summer and benefit from the addition of Williams, Brophy Clewes and Mallinder though I expect Underhill to go to SA on the proposed Saxons tour and be fielded against the hosts to tie him into England permanently.Remember Keddy. He's a beast of an 8.

I've thrown the betfair kitty on England. Iook back to the w.cup game, England were well placed with with 15 to go and should really have wrapped it up, and would have if Barrett hadn't run out of the defensive line leading up to the welsh try. England need to keep a check on their penalty count though because this is their main issue at the moment, they loose so much momentum when in good attacking positions

You might have a valid point if everything happened in a single moment or if all the players just stood still after their bit of the play is over. But that's not how rugby works so you're wrong.

A lot has changed since last September, but in that game England had a 10 point lead going into the final 12 minutes, and yet had the following issues;A hooker who couldn't hook, or throwA scrum that was far less effective than this current pack.Robshaw at 7Robshaw as captain.Coaches who didn't have a game plan and didn't know their best XVCoaches who always weakened the team with their replacementsBurgess and Barritt as centresA back line who seemed clueless when they had the ball.

As Sir Clive says there is a really easy way to beat Wales, get quick ruck ball and there defence can easily be cracked, getting quick ruck ball is a different story entirely. Wales have been out of form and England are getting better and I just think the England front 5 will be too strong for Wales

I dont get all these experts who say Wales should win because they have the better players, the first 3 games of the Six Nations and more importantly the form of the players in the European cup doesnt show that. Everyone says Alwyn Jones is the best lock is the best player in Northern Hemisphere however the form book says Itoje and Kruise are light years ahead. Lets not also forget bar the last 15 minutes at twickenham England have had the better of Wales in the last two games. we shall see in 11 hours time who is right

The graphic is weak - maybe an add-on by someone else, or Dean Ryan's just not very good at drawing. However, I think the explanation is.fair enough. Obviously, the defence is no longer in position like in the graphic when the attack create space. They are pulled out of place by two rucks and two distributors, hopefully leaving Joseph facing Samson Lee with only Liam Williams after that, and Watson on his shoulder - or Wales move to prevent that and Farrell or Youngs run through the hole that creates.

It shouldn't be a worry that England won't win if they play poorly and give away a lot of territory cheaply. It's a worry that we have to worry about that and Welsh fans don't really, but England have a decent chance at this point in time, many hours before the match. Enjoy it. 



Author::::kimburu
DateTime::::2016-03-12T03:52:04Z
Not for defending a lead under pressure I think. It's a bench made to go on and push England forward, ball-in-hand. Not that it isn't a very good bench, but I think Dean Ryan has a point.



Author::::Peake1995

England have already shown more of a willingness to spread the ball than Wales, and more importantly more of a willingness to spread the ball wide than the teams that Wales have faced so far (with the possible exception of Scotland, but they're a rugby curiosity in their own right). This Welsh team is very settled, possibly the most settled team in the world right now, so their defence will be strong, as evidenced by their strong showings so far this 6N.
