<p>England have named an unchanged starting line-up to face Wales in Saturday’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations">Six Nations</a> match against Wales at Twickenham.</p>

<p>The second-row Maro Itoje keeps his place after excelling in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/27/england-ireland-six-nations-match-report" title="">21-10 victory over Ireland</a> with the fit-again Joe Launchbury among the replacements.</p>

<p>Joe Marler will start at loosehead prop ahead of Mako Vunipola while Ben Youngs has been selected at scrum-half.</p>

<p>The centre <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/manu-tuilagi">Manu Tuilagi</a> is named as a replacement having returned to fitness, along with Elliot Daly and Danny Care.</p>

<p>Eddie Jones said: “Manu Tuilagi’s selection to the matchday squad is based more on potential than his recent performances in the Premiership. He has trained well this week and I am pleased with what I’ve seen.”</p>

<p>Tuilagi has not played a Test since the 3-0 series whitewash by the All Blacks in June 2014. “Obviously being out for a long time is quite tough, especially when you’re told you’ll be out for a long time,” Tuilagi said.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to stay motivated and sometimes you feel a bit down. I rushed myself and was too eager to come back and play. With a groin injury it’s all about time, it needs time to heal. I had to take it one month at a time.</p>

<p>“Now I’m here and I’m enjoying every minute of training and playing. I feel ready. I’ve played six games and I feel good to go. This is Test rugby. If you get asked to play 40 minutes, you play 40 minutes. I’m ready for any amount of time that I’m asked to play.”</p>

<p>Luke Cowan-Dickie will be England’s replacement hooker following the injury to Jamie George, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/09/england-hooker-jamie-george-injured-wales-six-nations-rugby" title="">who was ruled out of the tournament on Wednesday</a>. The prop Kieran Brookes has also been promoted to the bench.</p>

<p>M Brown (Harlequins); A Watson (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), O Farrell (Saracens), J Nowell (Exeter); G Ford (Bath), B Youngs (Leicester); J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton, capt), D Cole (Leicester),M Itoje (Saracens), G Kruis (Saracens), C Robshaw (Harlequins), J Haskell (Wasps), B Vunipola (Saracens).</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong> L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter), M Vunipola (Saracens), K Brookes (Northampton), J Launchbury (Wasps), J Clifford (Harlequins), D Care (Harlequins), E Daly (Wasps), M Tuilagi (Leicester).</p>

Joubert officiating, look out England!!! Mark my words, at least 2 England sin-bins and quite possibly a sending off for what would normally be simple penalty decisions. England to be blamed for every scrum collapse and Joubert slowing the game so that England cannot play fluid game by releasing their backs (which is where they have vast superiority) scoff now guys and then come back to this comment at the end of the match!

No real surprises in the selection but I note that it is Goode that has gone to make room for Tualagi and Daly is preferred on the bench. A small but significant change for the good. At some point I would love to see him come on in place of Brown. He has everything needed to make a great 15 and I hope he is not on the bench purely as injury cover. Manu will for sure come on around 55 mins which makes it less likely Daly will get a chance until very late in the game.

No I don't think we can agree to that. Please explain how the Welsh management have been more imaginative in the battle of the mind games.

"Should have more than enough to defeat Wales" - again! This might be true, but there's not enough yet been shown for you to be able to say this with such a massive degree of certainty. Wales v England matches have virtually been 50/50 over the last 8 years or so, and I don't see this one being drastically different.

Look , I'm not saying that England are a great team - they are clearly some way off that and we'll find out how far they've come against Australia in the Summer.

My point is that the pressure is not on England this time. It's all on Wales.



Author::::mrlloydevans

"That's all changed now". It is FAR to early to be able to say that. Have you not learned from the sweeping statements Legs showed you above? If England beat Wales and France then you could start saying that Jones is making a big difference, but as it stands (beating Scotland and Italy away and Ireland at home) is exactly what Lancaster's England managed in 2012 and 2014.

England were down to 14 and in Ireland's half. He was running the clock down. You may recall that last year's 6N was won on points difference? Chucking the ball around and risking giving away points would not have been that smart.

I guess that forwards are coached to defend with small gaps between each other, especially when the game opens up and they are facing a sniping 9 like Gareth Davies.

Never claimed for one minute that the England scrum was invincible - or that it's been unfairly treated in this 6 nations. In fact, I'm looking forward to a close match this weekend and, for what it's worth, think it's too close to call.

Giteau has played a lot of top-level rugby at 12 and had Kefu outside him. I think you can play a smaller playmaker like Eastmond at 12 at test level if you're playing somebody like Tuilagi outside him. If we're playing speedsters like Joseph or Daly at 13, I think your 12 has to be either a powerhouse like Tuilagi or at least a footballer who can tackle firmly, like Slade, or indeed Farrell.

My bad, ej was responding. Bit off with his remarks about the ref not penalising Wales all the time as they'll be blamed for ruining the game. What did Barnes do? Penalise everything and ruin the game

Marler can't scrummage so bores in everytime, even when getting pinged he can't help himself! And Eddie the messiah Jones came out first about the scrum, Mcbride was later

Must have been a re-set unless the stats are wrong. Remarkably, according to those stats England have lost a few scrums as well. Must be all those Celts and Italians cheating eh ; )

According to the RBS 6Nations website: Wales - Scrums won 6; Scrums lost 3; France - Scrums won 8; Scrums lost 0. What game were you watching?

Watch him at work. He had Poite on his case and was protesting his innocence and was indeed crouching and binding straight. On engage he steps to his left every time. That's before any boring in and he cannot help it, it's the way he is built and you can ask any tailor how unbalanced he is.



Author::::greathands
DateTime::::2016-03-10T18:01:19Z
You keep convincing yourself fellah. I'm looking forward to the scrummaging battle and am very confident in the Welsh front row. More importantly should provide great ball for our backs to run at the 10,12,13 channel. Something Eddie is apparently concerned about ; )

England are positively ancient in comparison what with two player being 30 brown and Haskell being their oldest players

I'm certainly not confusing Marler with the Welsh front row. Maybe you'd like to review his performance in the Ireland game and make a comment on his legality there. After all ,he wasn't, as far as I can recollect, penalised - certainly not regularly. Who was the ref? Why, M. Poite, the same M. Poite who consistently penalised him against Australia. So either Marler is a reformed character, or the referee was conned by the Aussies in the WC match. Take your pick.



Author::::VladimirUlyanov
DateTime::::2016-03-10T17:54:23Z
I don't want to wish him ill but I think it's unrealistic to expect that Halfpenny will hit previous heights. He had a really serious injury. The same goes for Manu Tuilagi.

England has a history of high penalty counts, sometimes liberally sprinkled with a few yellows, which stretches back to Martin Johnson's time as coach.

The fact that you list 2 world cup winners in Regan and Gomarsall, along with the highly talented but injury unlucky Matthew Tait as examples of limited resources doesn't give you much credibility.

Wales pushed the French off their own ball. What game were you watching?



Author::::greathands

Wales are bedding in a young front row, a young scrum half a young full back and more youngsters on the bench. Should be England's turn to win something now. Wales have won four titles in the past few years and a evolving their style of play. As long as Wales play well during this transitional phase I'll be happy. This is England's big chance. Wales will be much better in a year or two when Halfpenny, Scott Williams Webb and a couple of new youngsters are added.
