England and Wales tantalisingly well matched for old-fashioned bout




DateTime::::2016-03-11T15:25:59+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">S</span></span>ometimes the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations">Six Nations</a> feels about as light and airy as a dessert trolley from the 1970s. Treacle sponge, knickerbocker glory, banana fritters: the championship comes similarly drenched in sweet nostalgia. There is little modern and fluffy about England versus Wales in March; these occasions tend to be as far removed from southern hemisphere Super Rugby as double cream is to a skinny flat white.</p>

<p>In terms of old-school satisfaction, nevertheless, Saturday’s Twickenham menu offers hefty quantities. England, annual gluttons for punishment, sit just two tantalising wins away from a first grand slam since 2003. Wales, in turn, will in effect clinch this year’sthe title if they repeat their World Cup victory at the same stadium only six months ago.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the championship could all be wrapped up with a round to spare should England win and France lose to Scotland in Edinburgh. That would buck the last-gasp trend of recent seasons, just as England are hoping to consign their <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">World Cup pool disaster to Room 101</a>. Given they have a fresh coaching team, the underfoot conditions will be softer and Wales are less injury strewn, the outcome of last autumn is not quite as relevant as it might be. That said, the 128th contest between these countries resembles all its predecessors in one familiar respect: the defeated team will be losing more than just a game of rugby football.</p>

<p>In recent years, particularly, the margins involved have been wafer thin. England were seven points up with 11 minutes to play last autumn and, infamously, could not hold on. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/06/wales-england-six-nations-2015-match-report" title="">In Cardiff the previous February</a> it was Jonathan Joseph’s nifty try-scoring shimmy that made the crucial difference. It took Scott Williams’s late turnover and a fractional TMO near miss for David Strettle to see <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/25/england-wales-six-nations" title="">Wales home 19-12 at Twickenham in 2012</a>. So much about these two sides, their respective coaches included, is tantalisingly well matched.</p>

<p>So what will be the deal-breakers this time? For all England’s early control in September, Wales were quicker-witted late on. Their scrum-half Gareth Davies, scorer of their all-important try, also revealed this week that he and his team-mates had seen some English forwards blowing and had taken encouragement from that. Gamesmanship or not, Warren Gatland’s Wales take some overcoming once they get in front. If the stirring lineout defence that denied England’s final kick‑to‑the‑corner gamble sticks in the memory so, too, does the impression that Dan Biggar, Alun Wyn Jones, Sam Warburton and Jamie Roberts think more clearly under pressure than most.</p>

<p>The challenge facing England, then, is as much mental as physical. Four successive second-place Six Nations finishes have been nagging at young and old. “The time is now to win something,” the captain, Dylan Hartley, emphasised this week, but when the stakes start to rise the home team will need to find additional match-winners to Billy Vunipola, who is likely to find Dan Lydiate attached to his ankles more often than not.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/11/billy-vunipola-taulupe-faletau-england-wales-six-nations-">Billy Vunipola and Taulupe Faletau’s paths cross again on grandest stage yet</a> </p>

<p>Is Vunipola, anyway, really a more effective Test No8 at this stage in his career than his best of foes, Taulupe Faletau? It is all very well England relying on their strong bench – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/01/manu-tuliagi-return-england-wales-six-nations-leicester" title="">not least the returning Manu Tuilagi</a> – to deliver again but Wales also have some decent operators in reserve. If Gatland’s side could still do without losing Roberts early, their talismanic lock Alun Wyn Jones never tires of defeating the English and the ebullient Scarlets’ loosehead Rob Evans has been among the tournament’s revelations. His early duel with Dan Cole, along with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/10/england-joe-marler-wales-scrummage-six-nations" title="">Joe Marler’s arm-wrestle with Samson Lee</a>, will soon tell England what sort of afternoon awaits them.</p>

<p>So will the first few peeps from the whistle of Craig Joubert, once the South African referee has jogged back on to the pitch he quit so abruptly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/18/australia-scotland-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">after Scotland’s World Cup quarter-final</a> defeat against the Wallabies.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Joubert has taken charge of 13 previous Six Nations games, with 11 being won by the home side. The exceptions, however, have been victories for Wales, against Scotland at Murrayfield in 2013 and England at Twickenham back in 2008.</p>

<p>As they showed against France, it also takes more than a litany of collapsed scrums and tiresome resets to distract this Welsh squad. Biggar, who kicked seven penalties and a conversion in the World Cup pool heist, will cause his hosts renewed problems if their penalty count again spirals into double figures and will look to hoist – and hopefully retrieve – the ball more consistently than Ireland were able to do. His big runners will hammer the gain-line relentlessly, while the pacy Davies at scrum-half is lethal if any holes do open up.</p>

<p>There may not be many of them. The squad conceding the fewest number of tries has won the past four Six Nations titles and England have leaked just one in three games, compared with Wales’s four. Everything points towards another tense potboiler with a late twist. History shows Gatland’s Wales relish those scenarios but glimpses of renewed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/10/england-eddie-jones-wales-warren-gatland-six-nations" title="">English self-belief under Eddie Jones are clearly visible</a>.</p>

<p>What price, either way, a late penalty to England with Wales ahead by three points? Might Hartley kick to the corner to try to maintain his side’s grand slam chances, or settle for a draw and hope to win in Paris to clinch the title? The 2016 championship has so far been stodgy but, on both sides of the Severn Bridge, lips are still being licked in anticipation.</p>

You say that, but I played rugby for 50 years (and I'm, far from convinced that I've played my last game) and in the time you learn something worth saying. We see these "fit young men" doing silly things with the ball we stopped doing twenty years ago, and have earned the right to say so...

Wales 19 England 12. I have a feeling it'll be really tight going into the second half with the Welsh defense keeping us out before grabbing a breakaway try and then burying us with a late penalty as we desperately try and claw our way back in to it.

See you back here tomorrow.Since 2000 in six nations games England have outscored wales 43 tries to 20. One reason for the ever growing dominance is the difference in class of the premier league compared to the mickey mouse 12 or what eve they call it these days?

I do not think it be close. The welsh front row are pants. They play most of their rugby at a level or two lower than that experienced by the English front row. That is why they are whinging.This welsh back line was pretty pathetic V England last February and I can't see it being any better one year on. In fact they will have got a little worse.The English bench is much more potent than the welsh bench.

"In recent years, particularly, the margins involved have been wafer thin"Only if you totally ignore the man shaming event in 2013. Which you seem to have done in order to write more bollocks.

Phew...At last...after three rounds of this year's Six Nations tournament and frankly, up till now rather mediocre match-ups, we finally have a game that will have a definite influence on the outcome of the competition, one that promises excitement, the prospect of bucket loads of athletic endeavour, from backlines to die for (bursting with thrilling finishers)and the anticipation of appetite-whetting confrontations 'up-front' between awesome, battle-hardened warriors. Experience against up-and-coming talent, proven legends facing future stars in the making...all the ingredients are there to deliver a pulsating contest. Not forgetting the atmosphere too ... with each sides supporters erupting into spine-tingling hymn singing or a passionate rendition of their favourite traditional song.....but that's enough about Ireland versus Italy. Did someone mention there are a couple of other games this weekend?

England and Wales were closely matched in the World Cup. So much so a kick for goal instead of for a line out would have given England a draw that ultimately would have let them progress to be knocked out in the next round.

I'm actually a big fan of Barritt, but I don't think his form is at its best and it doesn't fit this style of play. For Saracens, he's a really important part of the team.
