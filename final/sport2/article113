DateTime::::2016-03-08T11:23:47+0000



<p>Wales have named an unchanged team for the pivotal <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations">Six Nations</a> match against England at Twickenham on Saturday though there are three changes on the bench with Paul James, Luke Charteris and Rhys Webb coming into the matchday squad.</p>

<p>James replaces Gethin Jenkins who continues to recover from a calf injury but is back in training. Charteris has come through training and Webb, who was called into the squad earlier this week, is named as scrum-half cover.</p>

<p>“We’ve named a pretty experienced side, no changes in the starting team, I thought they did pretty well <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/26/wales-france-six-nations-match-report" title="">against France</a> and we are looking for them to do a job for us this weekend,” Warren Gatland said. “We have a couple of guys back from injury on the bench, Luke Charteris, Paul James and Rhys Webb and that is a bonus. There is a huge amount to play for on Saturday and it will go a long way to deciding the Six Nations.”</p>

<p>The Wales coach added: “We are happy with the blend of our side. We have a very experienced back five in the pack, blended with the youth up from and that balance is really pleasing. It’s great to have Rhys back in the squad. He has been training really hard and brings a lot of energy and experience to the team.”</p>

<p>Ken Owens and Tomas Francis join James as the front-row replacements. Charteris and Justin Tipuric complete the forward contingent. Webb, Rhys Priestland and Gareth Anscombe are cover for the backs.</p>

<p>L Williams (Scarlets); A Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), J Davies (Clermont), J Roberts (Harlequins), G North (Northampton); D Biggar (Ospreys), G Davies (Scarlets); R Evans (Scarlets), S Baldwin (Ospreys), S Lee (Scarlets), B Davies (Wasps), A Wyn Jones (Ospreys), D Lydiate (Ospreys), S Warburton (capt, Cardiff Blues), T Faletau (Newport).</p>

<p><strong>Replacements</strong> K Owens (Scarlets), P James (Ospreys), T Francis (Exeter), L Charteris (Racing), J Tipuric (Ospreys), R Webb (Ospreys), R Priestland (Bath), G Anscombe (Cardiff).</p>

A 11pt margin to England at Twickers is not massively optimistic for their fans. Wales are a different prospect to Ireland and Wales should not have coughed up that lead to them in round one. If we'd played them second or third match, we wouldn't have lost imho. Slow starts are becoming very annoying. But Wales will have to be at their very best to win this and a 11pt gap can accrue pretty quickly ~ it only needs Cuthbert to go to sleep once or twice :( Heart says Wales by a score, head says England by a similar margin, may be a bit more.

Are you serious, at his best he's a human scythe. But he's definitely a more defensive minded back row, but you need them too.

Because it's event or holiday-destination rugby where the quality hardly matters. It's all about corporate junkets at one end and ordinary blokes meeting up for a belly full of beer and weekend away at the other. And the 6N organisers want to keep it that way because it generates millions. They've had chances to inject changes (admitting Argentina for example) but have shunned them. They love the status quo. The teams themselves (primarily England, Ireland & Wales) view it as annual chance to play & beat immediate tier 1 rivals and boost their ranking ahead of the RWC seeding (avoid a group of death) so it leads to unadventurous, risk averse and often turgid rugby. Effectively there's 4 pot 1 spots for 5 teams.

If you can romp it in the dry but lose in the wet, then you wont romp it in the dry either. See? you're not the only one who can write nonsense.

England by 15, afraid to say. The welsh front row would not get a game for any premier team. Even worse, the bench would struggle to get a game for L Welsh.Now that England have, a coach, a front row, a back row and a brilliant bench, Wales will get buried.

That's what I said a little further up. I meant we had options. Not preferable options, mind you- Watson's international experience at FB isn't the best.

Although I'd prefer the 10 tries. My nerves couldn't handle 3-0 for 80 minutes.

Last time England played this fixture at Twickenham in the 6N, they won by 11 points.

But Lydiate can't tackle. He just throws himself on the floor in front of the ball carrier. He makes no attempt to use his arms.

But Wales don't have a "skillful best". Their passing game is non-existent.

If it gets more popular it will attract more scumbags. I like that International Rugby is still the pinnacle of sport. Unlike football, where the club game is all important.

All of the manager's you mention Oliver_ have a similar if not lower success rate than Gatland. Ashton and Johnson were fired because they failed to win any titles/Championships, which Gatland has done on many occasions since joining Wales. 



Author::::IMWright66
DateTime::::2016-03-09T16:12:36Z
Certainly Oliver_" A 50% win rate is simply not a good enough return on that squad. In the last ten years, England have sacked three coaches with better win rates. "

Wales will shamble about, knock on, concede scrum penalties and win by 50 points.

Maybe the Injury Plague is finally spent, and Wales can achieve some consistency and fluidity.Maybe the rehearsals are over.

A dirty match gets North nobbled. A skilful match gets North out of the traps. Welsh win by 8.

a scot played the ball in the offside position. What would have negated that to have made it only a knock-on was if an australian player played it first - Between knock on and 2nd player.

The Welsh backs have generally shown zero cohesion this campaign, Gareth Davies will grow he's a bit raw at international level, Biggars been poor. Wales are more dangerous with Priestland at 10. However Wales have a better backrow and the front row have improved since the world cup.

Its strange really. Lot of England fans didnt want Hartley as Captain because of his numerous on field misdemeanours. They all seem happy though to have someone who has been convicted for assault.

Fair point, but England can reach the stars - will they? I don't know but they seem to have a whip in charge as opposed to an anchor. A very similar squad yes, but heading in an entirely new direction. That's the difference from lancaster's squad.

I'd regretfully have to agree with your analogy, the welsh defence has been superficially impressive to date in the six nations but we've still leaked 4 tries to Englands one so far.If the English forwards impose themselves as I believe they are capable of then Wales may well implode in the ten minutes either side of half time, fingers crossed I'm wrong.

It's basically the same England team that lost in the world cup though! Same horse different jockey, Wales were close to beating Australia and South Africa, they did fall short again but it seems unfair to state they can't improve yet England can reach for the stars? Wales came close at the world cup without several key players yet they can't improve? Your entitled to your opinion but your logic seems flawed

England has to raise its game to SH standards which under Jones they can do. Wales can't under Garland.

Do you know anything about the two teams?Have you checked out which of the two teams have score the most try's rather than long range penalties from a dubstep dancing time wasting quality kicker?Wales have always been a second International team for me to support due to family history. But I feel that England have been the more creative and expansive team of the two this year, and without Biggar Wales would have little hope of a win.Two strong defences, one skillful/ creative attack.Looking forwards to seeing how it pans out, let's hope for some quality reffing as that has the potential of spoiling the day for both sides.
