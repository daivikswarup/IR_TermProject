F1 rules shake-up unveiled by FIA, featuring new qualifying format




DateTime::::2016-02-24T12:54:28+0000



<p>The FIA has confirmed an overhaul in qualifying which is likely to be introduced in time for the new <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a> season.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/23/fernando-alonso-mclaren-f1-test">Fernando Alonso reassures McLaren and F1 he is staying after marathon test</a> </p>

<p>Formula One’s Strategy Group, which consists of all the major players including Bernie Ecclestone and the FIA president Jean Todt, met in Switzerland on Tuesday to discuss ways to improve the sport.</p>

<p>The new qualifying format, set to be introduced at the season opener in Australia on 20 March, will see the slowest drivers eliminated every 90 seconds after a timed period – rather than at the end of the three sessions – in hope of providing greater unpredictability.</p>

<p>The FIA also announced a “Driver of the Day” award which will be voted for by fans, while discussions on the revamped technical regulations for 2017 have now been postponed until 30 April.</p>

<p>Improved cockpit protection is also due to be introduced in 2017 with the “Halo”, a concept first designed by Mercedes, being the FIA’s preferred option.</p>

<p>Formula One’s governing body has also revealed the new bodywork regulations which have been adopted to make the cars more exciting. These include wider tyres and bigger wings to create additional downforce and a greater challenge for the drivers.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s discussions in Geneva took place just days after Ecclestone, 85, described the state of the sport <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/22/vladimir-putin-europe-bernie-ecclestone">as the worst he has seen it</a>. But it is hoped that the revamped qualifying structure will lead to mixed-up grids and, as a consequence, more exciting races</p>

<p>Indeed Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team, who have won 32 of the last 38 races, started from pole at all but one of the grands prix last season.</p>

<p>The new format is still under evaluation, but after it was unanimously accepted by the Formula One commission, it will almost certainly be introduced for the first race of the season in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the format, the Renault driver Jolyon Palmer said: “It is a strange idea as I don’t see it will make a massive difference. I didn’t see qualifying as an issue. I didn’t even know there were talks. Obviously I hear about all the other things that may be going on, but I thought qualifying was all right as it is.”</p>

Anyone interested in sports documentaries, would recommend "Grand Prix: The Killer Years", an excellent watch, although it can prove tough viewing at times...

Back to the good old days of Senna/Prost or Schumacher/Hill please! Straight forward hour long and down to the driver with the most determination in the last 3 minutes. All this is revenue grabbing and desperation to keep fans who have no understanding of the sport.

It's easy. Half the field qualify and race clockwise. The other half qualify and race anti-clockwise. Thrills for everyone.

Please, F1, don't throw Australian audiences away by hiding F1 races on pay television again like last year. It will kill support for the sport in this country. Only a small percentage of Australians will pay Rupert's ransom, so you will go the way of Super Rugby where most people barely even know it exists any more.

Great idea, would love to see that. Also change their own tyres, maybe have the use of one mechanic (advise and any technical problems & to rehang up the refuel nozzle)(OH&S) and to help them back into their seat belt etc..

Anyone using the phrases "lift and coast" or "manage the tyres" should be given a 10-place penalty and a dead leg.

Daft idea - an early splurge each session with cars tripping all over each other, then a lull as you can't use two sets of tyres each session and still have a viable race strategy. F1 is dull at the moment because one team is streets ahead. In recent years, cars have been able to follow more closely, reduced downforce, greater power has meant better racing (potentially). Gimmick formats and the 2017 regs will only make things worse.

Yes. It's so simple, no one sees it. Just ground effect. The cars would be better looking too.

Typical. fix the one thing which wasn't broken. Qualifying. You want to make F1 exciting? Go watch a moto gp race. Then copy everything. No halos, no wings, no down force of any kind, tons of power. There, done, problem solved. ......Bigger wings??. Give me a break!

Absolutely agree, me and my brother are planning to attend a race this year. We're both huge fans obviously so will enjoy it, but we've decided to leave the wives at home... before, in the v-10, even v-8 era, I would absolutely bring the girls (not being sexist, i mean they are just very casual/new fans) along just to experience the amazing sound and I know they would not be disappointed. Now, I'd rather save the extra 200 quid - a huge part of the real trackside experience is gone now.

Get rid of aero altogether and the engine's won't have to shove a house through the air. Less component stress overall and less fuel used.

Get rid of the wings. Then mechanical grip will become a major factor.

Exiting? The word is exciting. And no, it wouldn't. All it would do would be to penalise the cars that qualified fastest, and therefore have far fewer chances to overtake anyone to earn extra points. Ridiculous suggestion.

Hardly "slightly different". 99% of people on a UK motorway haven't a clue.

You're up against 20 guys who (now Maldonado has gone) know what they're doing. Slightly different on the motorway.

Another common sense view!! Handicap, manufactured series are fine for providing entertainment - however, these gimmicks have no place in proper World Championship events. 



Author::::Alex Langheck
DateTime::::2016-02-24T20:30:44Z
Ah, good to see some common sense. Motorsport has problems with domination - so comes up of ways to 'even it up' as though this is acceptable. It's not. There are plenty of series with 'gimmicks', ballast, etc that's fine- but a World Championship should be best man/ team wins - in a straight, fair fight. If someone is too good - tough! Deal with it, work harder to catch up.

Read through some comments. Quite surprised to see people say put some risk back into it. It's risky enough on the motorway - going straight - doing 80. You want these guys to take more risks on a track whilst doing 200 and for what? Your viewing pleasure. Crazy.

That's ridiculous - I'd shut f1 down before I thought of risking a drivers life so that Bernie and the sponsors can make afew more quid. Just preposterous thinking. F1 isn't the modern day equivalent of chariots in the colloseum!

The problem is twofold: the fastest way to get a car around a circuit relative to everyone else is to manage engine, fuel, tyres. Going flat out will mean you have to carry more fuel so that will slow you down and you will need for tyre changes, and your engine will have to be more heavily built so it doesn't explode for the work you give it. Lift and coast was happening ing in mansell's era and before. What we have now is TMI, both as viewers in hearing this and knowing how much the drivers are being coached round the course.

Idea for Bernie; drivers should pull over and have a pillow fight and then push their cars for 100m before jumping back in.
