Murray Walker: still the masterly voice of F1 in a world that keeps him young




DateTime::::2016-03-10T15:24:03+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t was only when I bumped into Murray Walker the other day that I became aware of the fevered imminence of the new <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a> season. Walker will be 93 this year but there is still that excited urgency in his voice, the same fervour.</p>

<p>When a man ages his voice can become as thin as Oliver Twist’s gruel, or as croaky as a frog with laryngitis. With Walker, though, the exhilaration is still there. He has changed very little, and because in his broadcasting pomp he took the precaution of sprinkling his commentaries with some inimitable blunders he doesn’t sound old when he does so now. His is still the most famous voice in Formula One.</p>

<p>Walker will again be on our TV screens on race weekends, not commentating but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/08/f1-murray-walker-steve-jones-david-coulthard-channel-4" title="">doing interviews with drivers for Channel 4</a>. “Last year I watched every second of every race on both channels,” he said, eyes gleaming. “And practice too.</p>

<p>“It’s been my life all my life, because my father was a racer. I’m still working at my hobby. If you’re lucky enough to be part of this circus, you’re working with enormously talented, young and ambitious people who are the best at what they do, even if it’s the chap who blows up the tyres. And it’s a very challenging and satisfying environment to work in. And hopefully it keeps you young,” he added, pausing in the hope of a compliment.</p>

<p>He is bemused when other people are critical of the sport, including the F1 chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, a stripling of 85. “It’s very sad and unnecessary,” Walker said. “Bernie has some agenda of his own – maybe he’s trying to talk it down so he can buy the sport from CVC. It’s incumbent on people to be positive rather than negative about Formula One, especially when you realise what a colossal audience it has.</p>

<p>“I must be the only person in Britain who doesn’t follow football but how many football matches attract crowds of 100,000? Formula One gets that number many times a year. It’s a great sport, enormously spectacular and gigantically exciting. It is to me, anyway, and always has been.”</p>

<p>Murray forecasts another <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/02/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-f1-testing" title="">strong year for Mercedes</a>. “F1 last year wasn’t any more boring than it was in the early 1950s when Alfas were winning everything, or in the middle 1950s when Mercedes were winning once more. What about 2000-05, when you knew Michael Schumacher and Ferrari were going to win?</p>

<p>“Something will happen to stop Mercedes winning. I don’t know what it is and I don’t know when it will be. But they can’t go on winning for ever. I hope <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/feb/18/testing-f1-ferarri-red-bull-mercedes-lewis-hamilton-barcelona-haas" title="">Ferrari</a> are going to give them a run for their money this year.”</p>

<p>We are all hoping for that. At testing in Barcelona there were <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/22/sebastian-vettel-lewis-hamilton-f1-testing" title="">signs Ferrari may have closed the gap</a> on the German giants. OK, so Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen looked really quick when on the new ultra-soft tyres from Pirelli, while Mercedes were happy to pound away, lap after lap, on the harder compounds. But there is a real optimism within Ferrari that progress has been made, even though there were a few glitches at the beginning of the second testing session.</p>

<p>Vettel said: “All I can say is that the first impression was good and everything that we’ve built during these two weeks felt very positive. I am very happy with the feeling in the car. It is difficult speaking about performance and comparing it to the others. But in terms of our own performance we are very happy with the step we’ve made.”</p>

<p>Ferrari won the first of their 16 constructors’ championships in 1961, when Walker was a mere 37 years old. They may narrow the gap this season but the smart money is still on Mercedes to secure a hat-trick.</p>

I was very happy with the addition of Prost and he may draw me to watch a bit of the C4 coverage, but I prefer Brundle & co overall I think.

We've had this chat before. Watching old clips of ' classic races' it's generally clear that Murray talked it up. ' and Prost goes on his imperious way, leading the field by 7 minutes ' somehow he made it stick. And THAT is what the great commentators can do. suspend your disbelief.

I get your point completely. I thought it always weird as far back as the. 80s that manufacturers poured in millions and even only by the end of the 80s did they think to say do a Clio williams. I guess and hope it's because racing is in Renaults DNA. They were there at the start, perhaps they feel a duty to be there now. I'm a big fan, great engineers, rubbish PR men, good I say

Bigging up Murray on behalf of the Fordingbridge massive! Man's a legend. Once saw him coming out of a bookstore I was about to go in and cross the street to one of the 2 newsagents in town.

You're absolutely right, manufacturers only get into F1 to sell cars, no other reason.

My comment is about car manufacturing, marketing and using F1 to glamorize passenger cars. Renault engines managed to dominate F1 for years but achieved no raised profile for the company, witness their omission from Murray's list. How did Renault's engine manage to beat Ferrari and Mercedes? - it was fairly clear from their TV channel. Why else do big manufacturers get involved with F1 - is it for the prize money? What does Mercedes get for its £1bn for a few seasons? What did Renault get for their investment in the F1 engine? Having missed the opportunity to capitalize on success, they are returning as a team without, as yet, a competitive engine.

Sorry, Brundle is an amazing pundit, absolutely brilliant at his job and certainly doesn't mumble.

Their CVs as drivers is not disputed. However Damon Hill aside, the rest are too similar, lack charisma and are poor commentators.

To be fair they've already got quite a selection. Prost and Zanardi are pretty impressive coups.

Think it's fair to say that all BBC jobs back then went to public school boys, hardly unique to F1.

Yes, Murray would avidly watch all the practice, warm ups, everything. Hunt would stroll into the commnetary box as the cars were lining up on the grid & say "Hello Murray. What Grand Prix is it today?"

In that instance it was Arnoux, but it was for the opposite reason - he was so used to turbos he couldn't get used to the atmos. It was at Monaco where he had a queue of cars behind him trying to lap him.

Eddie is never afraid to shit on Bernie. He's had plenty of experience running a team and dealing with Ecclestone . And just for that should be on the show.

It was hard not to be caught up in Murray's unwavering, boyish enthusiasm for the sport he loves. Never, for a moment, did he give the impression that there was anywhere he'd rather be.

Formula One's problem with declining global audiences is not the fault of Murray Walker.



Author::::DavidoM
DateTime::::2016-03-10T19:36:05Z
The drivers don't help, once upon a time Nigel Mansell was mocked for being so dull... line him up against the current crop and he looks (with the exception of Lewis) like a hell raising party animal... well perhaps slightly less boring. The drivers have to be athletes, trained, fed properly, most could probably run a tri or marathon without much conversion time. The days of party, party, turn up race, back on the razzel, have been fading for years. Nico Rosberg is so dull he could replace mogadon, Seb Vettle... little different. Even Kimi seems to have dulled.

Poor old Murray. Remember his last hurrah at the British Grand Prix in atrocious weather when everything that could go wrong did go wrong?

I am not as old as Murray by about a decade or so, I lack his energy and my knowledge of F1 is somewhat less despite a life long interest in the sport. But I do sadly recognise there is a time to pass the batton to younger minds better in tune with current attitudes. So I am relieved that Murray will be interviewing rather than commentating. Will he be in tune with today's driving demands and techniques. Perhaps the human interest aspect will prevail. But will that make good enough TV?

Not nearly as boring as someone taking the time to comment on something they have no interest in.

Yes Hunt never forgave Patrese and slagged him off at every opportunity until his death. The crash of course wasn't Patrese's fault, but I guess Hunt was not someone to change his mind easily.

Countless times he just turned up late, Murray would just carry on as normal, the viewers had no idea.

A true legend of the sport. I've said this before, but Murray was as responsible as any driver for many of us falling in love with the sport.
