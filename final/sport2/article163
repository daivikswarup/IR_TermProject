Fiorano anniversary recalls F1 legend of Michael Schumacher and Ferrari




DateTime::::2016-02-12T12:48:27+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> winter sun was shining on the Fiorano test track as <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/michael-schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> helped pull the wraps off the Ferrari F310. Twenty years ago this coming Monday, a couple of hundred people applauded politely, unaware they were bearing witness to the first day of a new era in grand prix racing. On a bright but bone-freezing day, Schumacher’s smile radiated a warmth that seemed to reach even the local butchers, bakers and candlestick makers who had parked their vans and lorries on the low road bridge running alongside the circuit, hoping for a glimpse of their new hero at the wheel.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/04/michael-schumacher-ferrari-not-good">Michael Schumacher: news of F1 legend’s health not good, says former Ferrari boss</a> </p>

<p>These were still the old days of Formula One. The days before <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/23/f1-bernie-ecclestone-max-mosley" title="">cost-control limitations and gimmickry</a> aimed at improving “the show”. The days when a team with a test track could make unlimited use of their facilities. When manufacturers were not told how many cylinders their engines could have, or how many engines they could use during the course of a season. When the drivers could rev those engines as high as they would go. When mechanics could work long into the night while their No1 driver stayed with them, sharing the task of fettling a piece of equipment with which he could win the next day’s race.</p>

<p>Schumacher was one who habitually stayed late, and those <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/ferrari">Ferrari</a> mechanics – the heirs to a 40-year tradition – soon discovered if their labours made the car half a second quicker, then he would respond by digging into his own resources and finding another half-second to go with it. That ability to knit the team together and drive it forward was what Luca di Montezemolo was buying when he offered the 27-year-old German a king’s ransom and promised to build the team around him.</p>

<p>At the top table of the marquee erected for the press launch at Fiorano that day, Schumacher was flanked not only by his new team-mate Eddie Irvine and the F310’s English designer John Barnard but by the top brass. Alongside the legendary Gianni Agnelli, the president of Fiat, owners of 90% of Ferrari’s shares, sat Piero Ferrari, the founder’s son and owner of the other 10%, and Di Montezemolo, the former team manager who had returned to Maranello with a mission to revive the fortunes of an outfit whose long period in the doldrums had been punctuated by the death of Enzo Ferrari in 1988.</p>

<p>Agnelli had rescued Enzo and his company in the late 1960s, when a dire financial position almost led the founder to sell out to Ford. The thought of handing such a precious chunk of Italy’s patrimony to the barbarians in Detroit was more than Agnelli could bear, so he bought 50% of the shares, on the understanding that Fiat would take another 40% when Enzo died, leaving Piero with the 10% he still holds today.</p>

<p>Di Montezemolo had been Agnelli’s protege. Taking over the management of the racing team in 1974, he and Niki Lauda – both still in their mid-20s – had brought about a renaissance on the track before he left to run Juventus football club, Italy’s America’s Cup campaign and the hosting of the 1990 World Cup. But in 1996, five years after his return, there had been few signs of progress. The acquisition of Schumacher – already a champion with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 – was the big move. The sense of anticipation that day at Fiorano was palpable, although it was undercut by a realism built up through long seasons of underachievement.</p>

<p>Outside the tent, the F310’s voluptuous red bodywork glittered in the sunlight. Among those clustering around it was a group of old men in winter overcoats, whose presence went unnoticed by many but who represented precious links with the company’s traditions. They were Enzo Ferrari’s oldest surviving friends and associates, assembled for an annual ritual initiated soon after the first car had rolled out of the new factory in 1947.</p>

<p>Nello Ugolini, known as the Maestro, had been one of the Scuderia Ferrari’s most distinguished team managers before the war, when they operated as the official Alfa Romeo grand prix team, and the incomparable Tazio Nuvolari was among the drivers. Sergio Scaglietti, who had made bombs for the partisans to throw at the Nazis in the last days of the war, had gone on to create the aluminium bodywork that clothed the most beautiful Ferraris in the 1950s and 60s (including the 335S sports racing car auctioned for €32m in Paris last week, almost 60 years after it set a lap record at Le Mans). Don Sergio Mantovani was the parish priest from Modena who had blessed generations of Ferrari drivers (and had held masses for some after their deaths). Franco Gozzi was a former journalist who had become Ferrari’s trusted confidant, the equivalent of a papal consigliere.</p>

<p>Of that quartet, only Don Sergio survives today. At 90, he is still to be seen in the paddock at Monza, popping in and out of the Ferrari pit. The rest have taken their place in the gallery of historical figures who created the legend that gives the Scuderia Ferrari the right to claim a place as first among equals at the modern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a> table, enjoying enormous advantages, including vast financial bonuses and a veto on new technical regulations.</p>

<p>The light was fading and the old men had long since driven home by the time the mechanics made the F310 ready for Schumacher to fire it up before setting off on his maiden outing in a Formula One Ferrari. Those who had stayed on listened intently to the roar of the new V10 engine, a less striking sound than the soprano scream of its 12-cylinder predecessor. In the near-twilight they could see the flickering LED readout on the steering wheel and the red glow from the carbon brake discs as Schumacher slowed for the tight corners during the half-dozen laps before he brought it in and cut the engine.</p>

<p>There had been many speeches during the afternoon, including the one in which Di Montezemolo promised – rather rashly, some thought – three victories that season. But the only speech that really counted was Agnelli’s, laced with an elegant cynicism. “Let’s enjoy this car today,” he told the assembled company before helicoptering away to more serious business. “After all, it hasn’t lost a race yet.”</p>

<p>The F310 turned out to be one of Barnard’s less distinguished designs. It was, in fact, a bit of a dog. But, somehow, Schumacher managed to get those three wins. He was on his way.</p>

The FIA punished Benetton because they cheated at every opportunity.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-14T00:05:37Z
No I haven't contradicted myself. Even if he didn't know the Benetton was fatally damaged after Schumachet went off, he did know he had to finish and beat Michael. Therefore, to try at that corner was leaving himself open to Schumacher cutting across him.

Certainly wasn't Hill's fault, although you do question why he put himself at such a risk of an accident.....

Even then the names wouldn´t fit the picture, unless larini and di montezemolo suffered a body swap.

For the sake of a little Devil's advocacy let's get it out of the way then: Hill hit the rear of the Benetton (not the side) and was two wheels off the road (on the RHS) while doing it.

I was a patchy F1 fan at that point, so didn't see the race. It appears to have gone from history, passed into myth, and now has become legend. I might have a scrummage round on You Tube but because Great Uncle Ecclestone frowns on that kind of thing, I don't hold out much hope of finding it. From around that time I do have a recollection of Schumacher qualifying in pole in one race, going round on the parade lap, and the car suddenly spewing oil out of the back and retiring before it had even done a lap in anger.

Doesn't really matter in the whole scheme of things, especially when this was such a lovely article.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-13T11:33:21Z
Yeah I don't buy that. There's lots of examples where it's clear he worked harder, he certainly set the standard for others to follow.



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-13T11:29:23Z
Yes, it was phenomenal. I wasn't a particuarly big fan at that point, but I think that confirmed to everyone how good he was.

It was quite exciting when he was cheating his way to a world championship over Damon Hill... and even more exciting when Hill won

As another commenter said, Schumacher drove the 1995 Ferrari and famously declared that he could have won races in it (Alesi won his only race in it, Berger won nothing that year). Richard has written excellent books on F1 (The Death of Ayrton Senna and Racers) but here he has a fundamental fact incorrect.



Author::::DavdyP
DateTime::::2016-02-13T11:20:58Z
Sorry, actually I meant Schumacher's drive in 96 - was that the one in the wet in Spain, where he lapped almost everyone?



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-13T11:18:06Z
Senna's? Yes. Both were phenomenal drives, what swings it for me is that Spain '96 was simply about talent. Donington had the farce of over a hundred pit stops, which McLaren largely got right, but Williams ballsed up.

Well there will always be some doubt at Adelaide, I'm inclined to think it was on purpose, but no one, apart from Michael can be 100%.

We don'e hate winners we hate cheats and bad winners, and what Schumacher did to Hill in Adelaide in 1994 was terrible and shouldn't have gone unpunished.

He was a cheat at times. Questionable ethics and a dubious car in the Benetton days (traction control and the like in 1994). A tremendous driver yes, but overstepped the mark.

I'm not British and even less German or Italian, but I admired Micheal for his total dedication, complete mastery and next to none talent. He is and will remain the greatest.

I notice that Jean Todt has recently disparaged the notion that Schumacher was different from others in his work ethic and team building. His comments seem at odds with what I have read over the years: so, urban myth or reality???

The Japanese?



Author::::NarniScalo
DateTime::::2016-02-12T19:41:43Z
I used to work in Television production and I was in the pit lane in Suzuka when Schumacher crossed the line to confirm his first world championship with Ferrari. The light was fading in Japan and the entire stand of spectators stood and applauded as he screamed past, fist clenched. It was quite a moment.

No, 2000, 2001 and 2004 were incredibly dull. 1994- 1999 and then 2003 were largely cracking seasons.

Agreed. A lot of people are obsessed with telling everyone, at every opportunity, just how dull they find modern F1. In doing so they have a tendency to misremember the past. The Schumacher years were very dull for the most part.

Why do the British hate winners so much? Ok, Schumacher could be extremely competitive, but he was also a phenomenal talent. It was a fantastic relief when he came to Ferrari after the barren years in the middle of the grid, finally I started watching GPs again. The current team are trying but their car is no match for the Mercedes.

Nice article but there is a lot of rose-tinting going on above and below the line. The Schumacher era was phenomenally dull apart from a brief period when Mika Hakkinen challenged him, and until Alonso de-throned him. It was spectacular in its crushing efficiency but exciting it was not.

Pity the 95 car was so fragile, would have loved to see Alesi take (or fight for) the title in their last V12 car.
