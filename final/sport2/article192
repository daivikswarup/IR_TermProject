<p>Heather Watson followed up <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/heather-watson-kirsten-flipkens-third-wta-tour-singles-title" title="">winning the Monterrey Open</a> on Sunday by beating Galina Voskoboeva in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells.</p>

<p>Britain’s No2 overcame the Kazakh in three sets, prevailing 7-6, 4-6, 6-1 in front of her mother, Michelle.</p>

<p>Watson started strongly, taking a 2-0 lead in the first set. But her opponent fought back, leaving Watson to hold her serve and force a tie-break.</p>

<p>The tie-break followed a similar pattern, with Watson going 2-0 ahead only to be pegged back. She again held her nerve, though, to take the first set.</p>

<p>Next it was Voskoboeva’s turn to hold a 2-0 lead, and she turned that into a 6-4 win in the second set.</p>

<p>Watson responded in style, not only going 2-0 up in the deciding set but finding a fine passing shot to turn that into a three-game advantage. She soon wrapped up the match in just under two-and-a-half hours.</p>

<p>“When it was important I was able to bring out my best tennis,” Watson said. “Today I was a bit slow getting used to the court. It was a bit different [to the Monterrey Open].”</p>

True, Niculescu is a banana skin. Let's see how it pans out.

Niculescu next, too easy to look ahead Radwanska needs to win her round 2 game as well. Heather's defeat of Wozniaki last week was something she can draw from this week.

Heather v Serena at Wimbledon was the stand out match of the fortnight. Heather was fabulous.

No big weapons but I feel that she doesn't always get motivated when she plays low-key matches and slips up. Radwanska, and Hingis before her, has a varied game with all the shots and Heather W, at only 23, has time to develop her game. Some images of her show a very well honed musculature used for a double-handed power game but some added finesse, and a session with Konta's psychologist, might go a very long way.

It should be pointed out that Heather actually beat Radwanska last year at Indian Wells, in straight sets. Admittedly it was the period when Radwanska was in something of a slump, but still... she beat a top-20 player!

Spot on. Don't think so, not yet at any rate, or at least only 1 every 10-15 matches perhaps. She hasn't yet got the big weapons.

Great match which i caught live on Tennis TV. I understand Heather's opponent was back from a long time out of the sport, but she put up a big fight anyway.

Radwanska may lead the h2h 3-1 but Heather took their last meeting last year at Indian Wells in straight sets but that's looking too far ahead as Niculescu can be tricky; they had a long 3-setter in Hobart earlier this yeah which Heather squeaked through.

Come on Heather, keep it going. We're right behind you. :-)

I see. Pity. Of course she is on a high now. But Radwanska and a straight sets defeat may knock her back to inconsistent again. Can't be helped. Konta now has the ability to beat the best players but Heather isn't there yet.

We also know that she nearly beat Serena Williams at Wimbledon last year in one of the top three matches in that competition. Serena went on to take the title. It was pure bad luck that Watson let that one slip.

Niculescu up next. She can win that one. With Radwanska scheduled for the next though, she might be best enjoying the next round.
