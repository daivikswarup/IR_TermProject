European golf chief on US merger idea: ‘I believe we are already a global tour’

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">Y</span></span>ou have to flip back to Shanghai last November when seeking context for a fascinating dynamic between Keith Pelley, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/17/keith-pelley-george-ogrady-european-tour" title="">the chief executive of the European Tour</a>, and Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour’s commissioner. Notable juncture No2 arrived in Dubai a matter of weeks later; this time with regards to the impression Pelley made on those flag-bearing European golfers who ply their trade primarily in the United States.</p>

<p>In China, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/07/european-tour-membership-golf" title="">Pelley was clearly the outstanding performer</a> on a forum stage which included Finchem and the R&amp;A’s Martin Slumbers. The Canadian brings dynamism and energy to any environment, as witnessed by players, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose among them. They left Dubai breakfast meetings waxing lyrical about Pelley’s plans.</p>

<p>Pelley’s enthusiasm is highly infectious. Professionally, he has entered the world of golf with the aim of questioning all that has gone before and all that may happen in the future. “We haven’t done that in the past,” will never be an excuse against transition.</p>

<p>It is hardly a leap of faith to suggest the PGA Tour is not entirely sure how to handle, or respond to, fresh circumstances across the Atlantic. That much was evidenced again on Sunday as <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/07/pga-tour-tim-finchem-european-tour-golf" title="">Finchem raised the possibility of one all-encompassing brand</a> to control professional golf in both the US and Europe.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Finchem – who is not even expected to remain in office for much longer – does not have aspirations of watering down his own organisation; this looked an attempt to suggest the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/european-tour">European Tour</a> should stand aside. If it was a deliberate jab towards Pelley, suffice to say it has not worked. The message from Wentworth is one of full steam ahead.</p>

<p>“From my perspective, we are and will always be a members’ organisation,” Pelley told the Guardian. “Every decision we make, every thing we are involved in, we will always deal with the members first and foremost. If in fact there was a significant advantage to our members, to our players and this saw increased prize funds, increased playing opportunities, then I would imagine our members would want us to explore that. But I have not had a conversation with any of our members to date as such.</p>

<p>“I have only been in this job seven months, I am still listening and learning and what I have learnt is that we have a diversity that is very much our strength. We are golf’s global tour; we play in 26 countries in five continents of the world, including the United States. We have quite a bit of diversity right now and what we are currently trying to do is build our organisation and build our tour for our members. Obviously, Mr Finchem has been in the industry a lot longer than I have so he is probably better equipped to talk about it but every decision we make will always be with our members at the forefront.”</p>

<p>Pressed on whether or not a combined tour would automatically make commercial sense, as Finchem intimated, Pelley added: “I think golf is a little bit different to other sports, based on how many tours there are. We are obviously working with quite a few tours, we have sanctioned events with a number of organisations. Whether a consolidated tour is advantageous is something that would require significant exploration from all the tours and I’m not sure that is something that would happen overnight.</p>

<p>“Based on the fact you already have tours fully operational, I don’t think it is as simple as saying just: ‘Let’s all come together and it will be commercially viable.’ You have to look at it from every member’s perspective, that being the top-ranked player to the 200th. If there was a significant benefit to our members, it is something we would look at but it is not something we have explored to this point.”</p>

<p>He added: “I believe we are already a global tour, with the diversity, the number of countries, where our members play. For us, we are in the process of making our tour a viable alternative to the tour in the United States. To do that, we will have to be aggressive.</p>

<p>“I think the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/pga-tour">PGA Tour</a> have a very well-run, sophisticated business. I think they have done a terrific job. My focus is not on necessarily what transpires in the US but how we can provide significant playing benefits and opportunities, increased prize purses, for our members. Doing such and increasing the golf experience for our members is critical as we try to have our players play more on our tour.”</p>

<p>As Pelley will be acutely aware, talking the talk is one thing; delivering results is what will determine his European Tour legacy. For all he has breathed fresh life into an organisation which, being blunt, seemed guilty of laziness in the past, there will be onlookers who hope his grand plans are undermined by the harsh competition of this sponsorship world.</p>

<p>“Change is not going to happen overnight but it will happen,” he insisted. “This is kind of our transitional year. I believe our tour will look different in 2017 and 2018. In terms of coming together as a consolidated tour, I wouldn’t begin to entertain that without the players at the forefront of every single discussion.</p>

<p>“We have already seen the Italian Open [purse] change, it will go to €7m next year. If this is a transitional year, 2017 will be different in terms of our prize purses, 2018 will grow upon that. I believe we have tremendous opportunity to show growth to our players.”</p>

<p>That means delving into markets not traditionally encountered by European golf. “We are in the midst of rebuilding our commercial value for our potential and current partners,” Pelley said. “Golf provides some opportunities that other sports don’t. First and foremost, an ability to potentially play with guys in a pro-am or walk inside the ropes during the live rounds. That doesn’t happen elsewhere … you are not on the pitch, you are not on the court in other sports. Partners and players, bringing them together, is a critical strategy for us.”</p>

<p>Talk of mergers, takeovers and the like is not.</p>

As an aspiring young golfer, I intend to join the European tour next year, hopefully win a couple of tournaments, then go over to the PGA tour after that. I'll probably come back to play the big events such as the PGA at Wentworth and the Open. Maybe The Irish Open too because I'm told the craic is pretty good. Then again, the Chinese tour might be paying mega bucks by then so I might go there.

Finchem is 68 & has been in this job for over 20 years. He's only interested in preserving the status quo, whereby the US tour is the richest & therefore attracts most of the world's top players. Much of that, however, has been down to Tiger Woods. Fincham has had little interest in expansion in Asia or, indeed, anywhere outside the US. The European tour should maintain its own identilty & at least has had the sense to expand globally, sanctioning events in Asia, South Africa & the Middle East.

Seems to be the formalization of a combined Euraisian Tour is a prerequisite to the institution of any global regulatory body: as it stands, the PGA would be snior partners, in 10 years time, the Eurasian Tour could be a real commercial rival...

Without an equitable global tour, golf will remain a sport where you can be ranked world number one without having a passport, which puts it in danger of being regarded alongside snooker and darts.

Like it or not, the European tour has always been very much secondary to the US tour & will remain so unless economic forces change considerably. Golfers are free agents & will always follow the money. However, the US Tour has been very insular, especially in the way all the "World" Golf Championship events are played in the USA, save one event in China. Eventually, China may become the centre of the gold world, but that won't happen for many years. So, any "merger" between the Us & European tour would simply be a tacit admission of the Us's superior economic might.

There already is a solution in place for an all-encompassing brand to control the global golf game,tours, rule book and brand. No matter if it is the USA, Australasia, Asia, Europe or anywhere else. It is called The Royal and Ancient. In comparison, everything else fades away, just like my 5 irons...

To be honest, the Europeans have the more interesting players these days. Our guys all seem much-of-a-muchness.
