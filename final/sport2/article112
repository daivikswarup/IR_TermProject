<p>Glasgow Warriors have confirmed the signing of the Italy wing Leonardo Sarto for the 2016-17 season.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old has won 26 caps for his country, scoring six tries, and started every match in the 2016 Six Nations although he is yet to cross in this campaign. He also played all four of Italy’s matches at the 2015 World Cup, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/11/italy-romania-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">scoring a try against Romania in their final match</a>.</p>

<p>He will join the Pro12 champions from Zebre who despite lying 11th in the table, are poised to qualify for next season’s European Champions Cup ahead of their compatriots Treviso, who are bottom. Glasgow have struggled to recapture the form that saw them win the Pro12 title last season, with eight wins, six defeats and a draw from their 15 matches.</p>

<p>At 6ft 4in and almost 15 stone, Sarto is a powerful wing who will bring strength and directness to Glasgow’s skilled backline. This variety is likely to prove an asset despite his seemingly mediocre strike-rate – he has only five tries in 34 Zebre appearances.</p>

<p>“Glasgow Warriors are a massive club and play a great style of rugby,” Sarto told the Warriors website. “I’ve always known Glasgow is a great club and I know [Italy team-mate] Simone Favaro is enjoying it there. I hear the fans love him and I hope I will have a similarly good relationship with them when I move over.”</p>

<p>Gregor Townsend, the Glasgow head coach, spoke positively of Sarto. ““Leonardo has been one of the best wingers in the Pro12 over the past few seasons and has an ability to break tackles. He has also performed well at Test level and had <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/27/italy-scotland-six-nations-match-report" title="">an excellent all-round game against Scotland last month</a>. We believe that he will make further improvements in our environment and will add to the competition for places in our backline.”</p>

Good news! Although it's a shame he isn't a non-6N player, it's good to know there's still a window for development players to get a run out. Now, whyever hasn't Junior been anywhere hear the first team since the early season? Surely his conditioning can't be that far off?

Looks like Zanni in the picture?

Seems to be a solid enough signing, however DTH van der Merwe is still a massive loss for Glasgow; and with Naiyaravoro leaving at the end of the season, Glasgow need a strong fast winger.
