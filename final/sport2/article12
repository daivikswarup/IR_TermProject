Wales challenged to turn chances into tries against England in Six Nations

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen Wales sat down to review their World Cup campaign at the end of last year, one issue stood out, apart from a rash of injuries behind the scrum that led to a number of their backs finishing the tournament as extras in Casualty: a shockingly poor conversion rate of chances into tries in big matches.</p>

<p>Wales scored <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">one try against England</a>, one when they faced <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/17/south-africa-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">South Africa in the quarter-final</a> and none <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/11/australia-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">against Australia</a>, even though they spent 13 minutes of the second half with at least a one-man advantage. The message before the start of the Six Nations was that they were working on finishing and all the elements that made up a successful move – handling, passing, scanning and awareness. And yet as they prepare for Saturday’s potential title decider at Twickenham, they find themselves pretty much where they were when they last visited the ground five months ago.</p>

<p>Wales have scored five tries in their three matches this year: two from five‑metre scrums; one that was down to the opportunism of the scrum-half Gareth Davies; one that resulted from a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/26/wales-france-six-nations-match-report" title="">defensive howler by France</a>, and one in which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/13/wales-scotland-six-nations-match-report" title="">George North ran through or around five Scottish defenders</a>. On each occasion Wales have had a chance out wide they have blown it, long passes tending to find touch more than hands, unlike England who created three tries against Scotland and Ireland through their ability to draw in defenders and move the ball quickly.</p>

<p>“We are always talking about execution, but it is about delivering when the pressure is on so we can take the opportunities,” the Wales centre Jonathan Davies says.</p>

<p>“We are creating chances, which is positive, but the disappointment is that we are leaving them out there. I am not sure that it is about ruthlessness as much as being aware of space and letting the ball-carrier know. Awareness and accuracy under pressure are the big things for us this week.”</p>

<p>A striking example of Wales’s profligacy came in the first half of their victory against France in the last round. Gareth Davies made a break from near the halfway line and, when he reached the 22, had a number of players to his left. He chose not to pass and instead kicked the ball to the line where it was secured by a defender and the chance was lost. “I sat down with Gareth after the match and reviewed the play,” Rob Howley, the Wales attack coach, says.</p>

<p>“The first thing to be said is that not many scrum-halves in world rugby could make that break, but then it was about doing the right thing at the right time. In fairness, it was not just about his end product but down to the support lines of the players outside him which did not allow him to make a better choice.”</p>

<p>Try-scoring opportunities are likely to be limited at Twickenham, a ground where Wales have scored two in their past three matches against England, and there have been heated verbal exchanges between the coaching teams this week that should ensure a high temperature come kick-off. Wales were criticised after beating France for being negative, but it was not ambition that was lacking as much as composure under pressure.</p>

<p>“The most disappointing aspect [in the Six Nations] has been the catching and passing under pressure in the wide channels,” Howley said. “It was a dry evening when we played France but we were not accurate enough, failing to scan early. It is an area we have been working on for the last four years and the percentages are improving a little every week, but it is an area where we need to be more ruthless on Saturday.”</p>

<p>Wales have promised that the home outside-half George Ford can expect the likes of Jamie Roberts to come charging at him, but it was only when they went wide in the final 10 minutes of the World Cup match, out of necessity as they chased the game, that they caught out England defensively.</p>

<p>For all the exchange of scrummaging insults in the last couple of days, the lineout will be as great a focus for England, if not more because it is the set piece that produces more tries and Wales like to use ball off the top to get Roberts crashing over the gainline. “It would be nice to score a few more tries,” the flanker Dan Lydiate said before the squad left for London, but two is the most they have managed in a match against England in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations">Six Nations</a>. The last time they accumulated more was in 1998 when they managed four – and lost 60-26.</p>

Hell of a result. An away game too. Maybe protheroe will see the error of his ways and come home.

I've often thought the roof is a bit of a curse when playing away as we don't play at home under the same conditions.

I know - I think I was actually agreeing with you which is a bit disconcerting! For what it's worth I think England are a year out from getting over Lancaster's influence and at the moment Wales are better in some groups of positions the backs being an example. You have a red card specialist in the pack you need to lose and you have a good Ebbw Vale boy at 8

England 16 Wales 42. 7 converted tries to one and 11 of England's points scored by the boy from Swansea, Matthew Protheroe. The Baby Dragons take their first Triple Crown and get one hand on a championship with the Grand Slam in sight. If we have a game one fifth as good tomorrow we shall be lucky indeed.

Perhaps EJ was implying Wales are 'one-dimensional' by virtue of "pre-engaging all the time" regardless to the actual truth of the matter?

Well, it´s all a bit negative on here. Lets hope all the players from both sides really get going and we have an absolute belter of a match. In addition, no injuries, a fab referee, no controversy and edge of the seat stuff until the last minute. To the winner the spoils and to the vast majority of the planet who aren´t playing...lots of joy. Hopefully it will be close and decided by a prop forward spraying a glorious pass out wide to a speedy winger. His return pass is instantly offloaded to one of the locks who cheekily backheels a drop goal that leaves everyone guessing until it kisses the horizontal bar, dangles for a moment and then plops over for the win. You heard it here first....

Twickenham, the home of Welsh rugby. You would think that the least the RFU should have done was to put a roof on before handing it over...

Eddie actually answered the question "Are Wales one-dimensional" with "I'm quite upset about the way they scrummage. They scrummage illegally. They pre-engage all the time which is against the laws of the game."Now that is not responding but initiating a new topic and inventing a whole new scrum offence. Refs say, "Crouch, Bind, Set" then wait for stability before signalling the scrum half. To go early is an offence but since there is no "engage" it is impossible to "pre-engage". Sorry if you think asking for accuracy is one-eyed but I can live with it. Enjoy the match.

I'm not too worried. We won at Twickenham last year. I don't recall the English backline terrorising Wales in that match. :-)

You are become so one eyed mate it's worrying. To be honest I though you were better than all this. Obviously both sets of coaches were responding to journalists questions.

Don't think Ford, or Farrell, for that matter, will lose much sleep over Dr Roberts.

It will all depend on the scrums.....Penalties are there for the taking if you are the stronger side....I can't see Joubert letting Wales commit 7 professional fouls within their 5M line without awarding something and I can't see him letting England's forwards get away with much....

Heated verbal exchanges? McBryde answered a journalist question about Marler scrummaging illegally by saying that if he did it was down to Sam W to have a word with the ref. Since then Jones and Gustard have gone stupid and you reptiles have stirred the shit.
