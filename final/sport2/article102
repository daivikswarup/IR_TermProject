Eddie Jones v Warren Gatland – how do the two head coaches compare?




DateTime::::2016-03-09T13:43:31+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>t has been a quiet 10 days or so for those anxious for their Six Nations fix. The fallow weeks are always hard, but often leavened by a choice word from a wily coach hoping to gain a psychological edge somewhere. Unfortunately, Eddie Jones has not yet obliged since the last round and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/warren-gatland">Warren Gatland</a> was understated in his sole appearance of the England v Wales buildup on Tuesday.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/09/england-hooker-jamie-george-injured-wales-six-nations-rugby">England hooker Jamie George out of Six Nations match with Wales</a> </p>

<p>Gatland makes minimal media appearances these days. Meanwhile, Jones announced in dramatic style after the England-Ireland match that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/27/eddie-jones-grand-slam-england-wales" title="">he would not be talking to the press</a> in the build-up to the Wales match, his Ziggy Stardust-at-the-Hammersmith Odeon moment. More than a few looks were exchanged of the did-he-just-say-what-I-think-he-said variety. In fact, Jones will make an appearance on Thursday, back by popular demand, but his absence has merely highlighted the extent to which he has so quickly installed himself alongside Gatland as a much-cherished/derided piece of the Six Nations furniture. Saturday’s showdown between England and Wales will be the first between the two coaches who elicit more in the way of extreme reactions than any others, so how do they compare?</p>

<p>Hookers operate in the heart of the most brutal environment in the sport – the scrum – and yet they are usually smaller than the men around them. Gatland and Jones played their careers in the No2 jersey without ever winning a Test cap for New Zealand or Australia respectively. They will have needed a certain spikiness to survive and, dare we say it, a touch of the cerebral, not to mention the Zen-like ability to rise above the fearful poundings and perform the most high-precision task in rugby – the lineout throw. It forges a special breed, and they often go on to prove excellent coaches, both for results and provocative copy. Think Richard Cockerill and Steve Diamond, the northern equivalents.</p>

<p>Jones has one big gong over Gatland – a World Cup winners’ medal, picked up in 2007 when he was technical adviser to South Africa. He also has another World Cup final to his name, this time <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/23/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion5" title="">as head coach of Australia</a> in 2003, as well as a Tri Nations title with the same in 2001, his first season. His Brumbies team around the turn of the millennium were pretty special, too. And then there was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report" title="">the Miracle of Japan</a>.</p>

<p>Gatland’s record as head coach, however, is the more consistent. At least it is since 2002, when he joined a Wasps team rooted to the bottom of the Premiership. They were English champions for the next three seasons, and European in 2004. Then he joined Waikato and won the National Provincial Championship at the first attempt. Next, to Wales: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/mar/16/rugbyunion.sixnations1" title="">grand slam at the first attempt</a>. British &amp; Irish Lions: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/07/five-reasons-lions-warren-gatland-australia" title="">series winners at first attempt</a> (as head coach). He clearly has a knack for making a first impression. His critics will point to Wales’s record against the southern hemisphere, but, really, they are not alone in struggling against that lot. Some might say it is a mental block among the players that has prevented Wales turning more of their increasingly narrow and “heartbreaking” defeats into victories. Some of those matches looked harder to lose than win. Against each other, they have met once, although never as head coaches – Gatland was technical adviser to the Chiefs in 2007 when they beat Jones’s Reds in Brisbane by two points.</p>

<p>For immediate results, Gatland’s the man; for the longer term, then Jones. The latter is renowned for a brutal management style. The legend goes that he tries to crush his players, and those who do not break will become champions. He is also a talent-spotter of considerable perception. These qualities can take time to produce results. His first year in charge of the Brumbies was a disaster, as was the single year he spent in charge of the Reds in 2007. His spell in charge of Saracens was none too flash, either. All of them went on to be champion sides. The noises coming out of the England camp speak of a gentler approach than the above might suggest, which is not surprising given he was straight into a short, sharp championship he would do well to win. So far, so good. The man himself has said he is mellower now, following <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/29/japan-coach-jones-returns-from-stroke" title="">the stroke he suffered in 2013</a>.</p>

<p>Gatland does not have quite as fierce a reputation, but he is utterly ruthless when he perceives a means‑end decision that needs to be taken, regardless of emotion. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/08/lions-2013-brian-odriscoll-australia" title="">Brian O’Driscoll non-selection</a> on the 2013 Lions tour will remain the most famous example, but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/25/adams-jones-retires-wales-six-nations-omission" title="">Adam Jones</a> is among a host of others who will testify to a lack of sentimentality. Gatland’s strength lies in simplifying matters with special emphasis on fitness.</p>

<p>Warrenball, insofar as it exists, is little more than a summary of what the modern game has become – big men trying to get over the gainline. Admittedly, it has had some bad press of late, but if you have 17st three‑quarters who can run hard you let them do it. With Wasps, Gatland had a lighter back division and devised a different gameplan, which revolved around reassembling his three‑quarter line after multiple phases, so that they could strike against a mis-shapen defence.</p>

<p>Gatland and Jones, like all the best coaches, are masters of working with what they have. Jones’s Japan side at the World Cup were one of the most obviously well-coached teams that have ever played – technical excellence and players who all seemed to know exactly what they were supposed to do at any given moment, none of whom were stars. With England he has had less time and bigger personalities, but already a pattern is discernible somewhere between the Japanese and Welsh templates. If you have a Billy Vunipola you send him hurtling at the gainline; if you have George Ford and Owen Farrell in midfield you send out long passes when the opposition are narrow. It is not revolutionary, but it is the shrewd deployment of resources that marks out the best coaches.</p>

<p>What would happen if they met for a beer? People can be very different in such a scenario, but you sense that Jones would supply the fire, Gatland the ice. Both can hurt in their different ways. Over the microphones, Jones fixes his questioner from under angular eyebrows constantly on the move. “It’s a stupid question, mate” is one of his catchphrases, but a vulnerable side has been revealed by his self-imposed media ban. He is a straight-talker. They often find themselves in trouble, and he knows it, but he cannot do the boring thing either. “I can’t win,” he pleaded after Ireland, “so it’s easiest if I don’t come to the press conferences.”</p>

<p>Gatland, too, was poignant at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sixnations">Six Nations</a> launch when asked why he was less provocative in the media these days. Unlike Jones, his face barely moves when he talks, his words, provocative or not, falling softly from the side of his mouth. “It got to the point where it was so depressing, thinking, ‘that was a really good interview’. The journalist’s written a really good article, but someone picks one little piece out of it to turn it into a headline, and you spend the next 48 hours fire-fighting. It takes the enjoyment out of it completely.”</p>

<p>Love them or loathe them, Gatland and Jones are just two fiercely driven men trying to do their jobs in a very noisy world. It may have been quiet without them these past few days, but they are supplying us with a compelling narrative, which will reach its pitch when they go head to head for the first time on Saturday. Their world is about to get a whole lot noisier.</p>

Eddie Jones is coming across as a bit of an idiot at the moment, saying two top international refs are scared to give penalties to try and sway third is more of a schoolyard antic than that of an international coach. In Robin Mcbryodes comments about Marler he praises Joubert.

great post. the ABs are praised almost hysterically. if anyone thinks that their gameplan through the phases on their own ball goes much beyond "send nonu/read up the 10 channel, bust the gainline then move it wide" then they are deluded. the doctrine of "earn the right to go wide" is a cliche for a reason.

ryan was fishing and the wales camp didn't bite - simple as that. wales will feel they've got an edge in the front row, and cj has a rep for deciding early who's on top & giving them soft pens. on that basis it does wales no good to draw attention to any dubiously-informed pseudo-analysis from someone with an obvious pro-england bias.

In addition, if you really believe that England would have one player in a combined XV (and I might have Faletau over Vunipola anyway, he's a tremendous player), then it's a shocking indictment of Gatland & co's coaching that Wales have an identical 6 Nations match record to England over his period of coaching (albeit with 2 GSs and a championship to a championship).

It was an achievement for Australia to even reach that final in 2003, they were a about fourth in the world behind England, NZ and France respectively in terms of quality (world rankings they may have been 3, I have no idea, but in reality France were a better team). That they managed to push England so close was an even greater surprise (abetted by appalling refereeing of the scrum in particular).

There is no doubt that the end of his Wallaby tenure was a disaster, but by then the playing personnel were a shadow of the crew he inherited. He certainly inherited a fine squad, but Tim Horan had retired in 2000, and John Eales retired after the Lions series in 2001, just before Jones took over. That is two of the all-time great rugby players who left the camp, two players you simply do not replace. The Wallabies were always going to go down from that point, no matter who was in charge. Joe Roff and Matt Burke, two world-class players, were done by 2004 and 2003 respectively.

Yeah, Eddie Jones was really down-and-out before accepting the England job. Jeez, that appointment with Japan was a bloody disaster for his reputation, wasn't it? I mean, they only beat South Africa for goodness sake (something Wales, Scotland and Ireland have accomplished a combined total of 12 times in their history, and never on a neutral ground) and finished with 3 wins and a loss. Nobody wanted him after that did they? Well, except the Stormers, but who the heck are they and what crap league do they play in?

I think it didn't get more traction because I felt like Dean Ryan was actually being quite complimentary. When I read the piece I got the feeling he was saying "look at how Wales do these things, all teams try to do them, but Wales do them really well." I didn't feel like he was actually ripping Wales or saying it was a bad thing.

I believe it is too early to judge how Jones compares to Gatland I am optimistic however from what we have seen to date. Whether England win or lose against Wales we need to look at the bigger picture, ie "The next World Cup", okay it will be hard to swallow if we lose. If we do go down, it doesn't mean Gatland is any better or worse than Jones, as long as we are improving along our journey.

Speculating what tactics either side might choose to employ is generally unnecessary and sometimes also impossible. Unnecessary because at a basic level, we already know what both sides are about. Yet also impossible because any speculation of the finer details is pure guesswork. It can also be thankless because on the occasion a Guardian writer does such a piece, it gets loads of critical comments?



Author::::snotright
DateTime::::2016-03-09T23:36:32Z
How they compare is pretty obvious. It's too soon to form any opinion on Jones, and Gatland is very good but he needs to take Wales to the next level - the game of flair, high-invention, and open running cf New Zealand. Wales could go to this level now but only if Gatland has the vision.



Author::::oggaman
DateTime::::2016-03-09T23:34:52Z
Exactly. I don't think any individual apart from Billy Vunipola would be anywhere near selection for the Welsh XV. Though to be fair, the players who stepped up to cover the multiple levels of injury in the World Cup (some of them fourth or fifth choice) were immaculately drilled and motivated, which is surely to Gatland's credit.

Won 17, drew 1, lost 18, and Ireland were knocked out of the WC before the QF stage for the first time. He was sacked, which is a pretty miserable way for a coach to leave a job. But yes, they were a better team by the time he left.

I think the article above pretty much explains that both coaches for their own reasons are pissed off with the press so decided not to say anything. As a result nothing gets "blown up" out of proportion. It has to be led by the coaches scoring one upmanship and neither are at it......yet.

DateTime::::2016-03-09T22:00:26Z
Im no expert but i am almost certain that bookies dont have lower odds for the favourite because that person is more likely to win. They do it because a lot of people put money on the perceived favourite and they therefore need to protect themselves from a big payout.

I thought that all of the above put some good foundations in place and have since proven themselves as winning coaches, but I didn't have to live through it I suppose. I went to mccaw's first cap at landsdowne and Ireland played suberbly, getting a good lead before running out of juice in the final quarter.

I think most people are OK with Jones so far thank you, and it is a shame he is not speaking to the media as he usually has something interesting to say instead of the usual media talk say nothing tactic. Mmmm sausage rolls. Go on. Be a devil! They might even make you smile a bit. Xxx

How do Gatland and Jones compare? That's easy - one's shrewd the other's rude.And, while we're on the subject, of the upcoming England-Wales clash, lets have some realism.The honeymoon period continues for the boorish Australian windbag, who is still suffering an element of disbelief, given his sudden prosperity from almost down-and-out to being put in charge of the richest rugby union team in the world, with 250,000 players to choose from, and a seven-figure salary to boot. With three 'wins' out of three everything in the garden appears rosy. Or does it? Certainly Jones has come up smelling of roses so far, but if the truth be known, and it is, he has only really survived by the skin of his teeth (for example, fortuitous decisions on the part of the referee and TMO against Ireland).The 'marriage' has not yet been consummated - the fatuous grin that Jones wears is based on the fact that he continues to ride ( in a good way of course) Lady Luck. Sadly, though, his luck is about to run out. The bookies earn their living by getting it right, and have installed the Welsh as hot favourites for this weekend's encounter that will almost certainly determine the Six Nations championship. So, Bang goes the Triple Crown....the Grand Slam...and England's first Six Nations tournament success since 2011 ( under Martin Johnson) but there's good news, as England will secure second place again, assuming the French don't put the boot in in Paris. Old habits die hard.

Gatland has done fantastically with the talent that he has at his disposal. Wales have a team which is greater than the some of its parts.
