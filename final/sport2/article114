New Jersey rugby union experiment needs catalyst to get required reaction




DateTime::::2016-03-08T10:00:19+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>his is a big week for rugby union and the Six Nations is only a modest part of it. The first Premiership game to be staged outside Britain is taking place in New Jersey on Saturday, with an American audience being politely invited to come and see how <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/londonirish">London Irish</a> and Saracens compares with watching the New York Jets against the New England Patriots. To say a cultural collision looms is an understatement.</p>

<p>It is fair, too, to suggest the timing could have been better. It is not just that this historic occasion clashes with a moderately interesting fixture between England and Wales at Twickenham. The call last week by 70 “experts” for tackling to be outlawed in schools rugby attracted plenty of debate, none of it designed to encourage US soccer moms to steerBradley junior towards the muscular new sport on the block. “Where are your helmets, guys?’ will inevitably be the most-asked question Stateside this week.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/mar/07/rugby-union-talking-point-premiership">Rugby union: talking points from the weekend’s Premiership action</a> </p>

<p>Amid the usual rejoinders about American football tacklers leading with their heads and the resultant extra potential for concussions, though, rugby’s rulers would do well not to sound complacent.</p>

<p>Had Leicester’s game against Exeter been happening across the Atlantic rather than on a cold Mother’s Day in the east Midlands, the American reaction would have been widespread horror. Let us just say there are a few key areas rugby union needs to get right before it can hope to sell itself compellingly to a market already familiar with big blokes running into each other.</p>

<p>The most obvious are the types of high hit with which <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/manu-tuilagi">Manu Tuilagi</a> felled the Chiefs’ Phil Dollman at Welford Road. It should be stressed Tuilagi’s tackle did not result in a card or even a penalty but even Manu’s England team-mates, watching in Bagshot, admitted they winced when they saw it. James Haskell, musing aloud on the issue of what constitutes a dangerous tackle these days, put it perfectly. “The problem was he hit him so hard he went to wrap his arms around and the bloke had already folded like a deckchair on the floor. Why would you penalise a bloke for doing that? That’s an incredible shot.”</p>

<p>Incredible, yes. Good for the game’s image? Maybe not. In almost the same breath Haskell was rightly pointing out that teaching young kids the correct tackling technique at the right age is absolutely fundamental. “I think we are creating a game where it’s important young kids are taught to tackle properly and understand that rugby is a physical sport. Making rugby a non-contact sport … you might as well just forget it and disband it. I think we have to make a stand at some point. We are a contact sport and people are going to get hurt. As long as it’s not someone running around straight-arming people or blindsiding people trying to rip your head off, these things happen. We need to understand that.”</p>

<p>Squaring this particularly awkward circle is probably the key to rugby’s long‑term future, certainly as a 15-a-side sport with mass appeal and ahealthy reputation for safety. Haskell is particularly instructive on the subject as someone for whom tackling did not initially come easy. “I remember being taken down to Maidenhead RFC at five years old and not wanting to get wet, muddy and kicked in the face. I didn’t like tackling for a long time. When I got to Wasps at 17 I went straight to [the former back‑row] Joe Worsley and said: ‘Listen, I’m not being funny, I can’t tackle very well, you’ll have to teach me.’ We spent a lot of time working on it.”</p>

<p>As Haskell also pointed out, rugby league has recently adjusted its law on what constitutes a dangerous high shot; relatively speaking, it is still higher than in union but there has finally been recognition that heads and brains are not indestructible. In union, as Haskell confirms, the tackle height can vary depending on the desired outcome: go low and your openside may have a better chance to nip in for the kill; go high and you might just dislodge the ball or prevent the offload. Better the former safety-wise but most of the time there is insufficient time in which to make a choice.</p>

<p>So let us pray that, when Irish and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/saracens">Saracens</a> take to the Red Bull Arena, the body count is not too excessive, the spectacle is halfway decent and, additionally, the scrums mostly stay up. If not, north American patience may not extend much beyond the half-hour. It would also help greatly to hire a decisive TV match official; American sports are used to in-play breaks but some recent delays for TMO referrals in rugby have made the notoriously stop‑start Super Bowl feel like the Olympic 100 metres final. To reiterate, this is a big week. Mess it up and the American dream will remain precisely that.</p>

One of the main problems in the tackle area is the tackler often goes straight in for the ball with both arms. This is often a direct collision with both players running straight (or nearly so) at each other. Coaches encourage this as it can result in a quick turn over. This can result in a head on collision, not difficult to work out the physics. Both players running in opposite directions at 8 m/s Relative velocity 16 m/s ( or 35.5 mph). This has got to be the source of some serious headaches, not just for the players but also for parents, coaches, referees and the IRB.The answer is not obvious as banning players going for the ball and not the player with the ball could stop some head to head collisions but it is not the only answer. It requires research, and different answers for different age groups.Head gear for young players may help but it may deveope recklessness in the tackle area .Tackling below the waist may help

It might not be long before Jersey could go to New Jersey and play Saracens, now 5th in their division. Quite why anybody could want to export rugby union to the world of American football is beyond me.

They are planning on having one game a year for the next three years. With the aims to be 50% seats sold this year, 75% next, sell out in 2018. If London Irish avoid relegation, they'd be playing all of them.

Actually, I wonder if more than 50 people turn up whether London Irish will consider moving to the US permanently. They've been in Reading for over a decade now and still get some of the worst attendances in the Premiership. They should probably give up.

Perhaps it is but if you decided to take any premiership team there, Irish the weekend before st Patrick's day would be the one. I don't think the RFU were being patronising if that was at least part of their logic. But if you want to take offence on behalf of the Irish community in New England you're very welcome this is the guardian!There is also a strong Arab American community who will be attracted by the name Saracens. Probably.

It's probably only a matter of time before Super Rugby takes games to the US and other emerging rugby nations especially now with the Sunwolves and the Jaguares getting involved. They're used to silly travel distances in that competition so going to to the US isn't such a ridiculous extension of that. to drum up local interest, perhaps the Chiefs could play in Kansas City, the Blues in St. Louis, Reds in Cincinatti etc. I guess the Brumbies would have nowhere to go.

There's a lot of people in the New York area, who consider themselves Irish Americans and are much more likely to go and watch a team with Irish in their name rather than Wasps or Exeter. Of course London Irish are not Irish and not from London either but then neither is Notre Dame but they get good crowds regardless.

Rugby introduces itself to mummies and daddies through the two day party festival of the Rio 7's. Only just later introduce all the fat boys and gym monkeys, until such times as the IRUB takes all strength assets OUT of the game. Then the concept of rugby goes, a tight balance of strength and skill.

Great points, I agree with all of them. Getting your nuts squashed or fingers jammed into your ladyparts are not covered in the offensive rules of water polo either but from all accounts that is a vicious vicious sport. To take your point about repercussions, its the inability of water polo players to retaliate in the appropriate manner (I'd suggest breaking the offender's nose) which means the filthy play continues to go on unchecked.

Haha, yeah amazing how those same Super Rugby forwards have no trouble smashing the NH forwards every single year for their national teams. They must just forget how to play for their provinces.And all Super Rugby teams are the same right? South African and Argentinian teams play the same way as Aussie and NZ teams right?

Kitson clearly has no idea.NFL is far more dangerous than rugby. They hit in a much wilder, more dangerous way. They lead with their heads, for god's sake.High tackles are legal. Shoulder charges are not only legal, they are considered the orthodox, text book way to tackle. Rugby tackles are called 'arm tackles' and are usually disparaged as a much softer, less effective way to tackle.Tuilagi's hit on the weekend would be considered just a run of the mill tackle in NFL.

You overestimate the number of Americans who will watch this game in New Jersey. It's not exactly national news.You also overestimate how precious Americans are. Tuialagi's hit (which you found so abhorrent for some reason despite it being a perfectly legitimate tackle), would be considered a simple, run of the mill NFL hit. Not even particularly brutal in terms of NFL hits.Americans would hardly be horrified by it, NFL fans might wonder why there aren't more hits like it in rugby.

I don't know why you insult Americans. Think of the countless reasons people have supported English football teams over the years. If you bring a foreign game to a country then the name of the team is as good a means as any of generating appeal.

I thought Haskell's card was marginal and said as much after the game (on the other hand, he was lucky not to be carded when he lay on the tackled player under his posts). These things can appear worse, and intentional when they are not, in slow motion so I do sympathise. A penalty was fair, but the card was too much.

[American football in the UK] will go the same way as the fad of the 80s did because, deep down, we are not really interested in their sports and they aren't interested in ours because there is no history there.

And Ire vs NZ later this year too? The harm is that the fans of those teams are being denied access to the game, both the venue and through the huge time diff. The game is being marketed to Americans at the expense of the current fans.

Fair enough about the money but there will always be problems, whether you take the game abroad or, as you say, not and f*** them. I don't see anyone fretting, just trying to promote the game aboard.

Yes, it is important, especially if we want the world cup to become more competitive.America has a potentially huge playing pool and it already has a large number of players. If we can increase interest in the game in another country then that can only be a good thing, can't it?

And that is their concern as USA rugby employees. Why on earth should other rugby nations be fretting over the support base of rugby within the US!? We have our own internal problems to worry about, it is none of our concern and it is not our job to grow it there. There are plenty of more worthy nations than the US for receipt of support to grow the game. The pacific nations for a start. Countries like Namib, Kenya, Georgia, Romania, all have much higher support levels for rugby relative to their populations than the US but the big rugby nations do f-all for them because they don't have money.

I agree. Yes, it's a "regular season" match rather than a friendly, but of all the games to take over there, it's bottom-of-the-table strugglers London Irish against a half-strength Saracens side (albeit one with two or three USA internationals in it) going through a dodgy patch. Hardly the showpiece they need, and not of any great significance. It's probably of most benefit to Leicester, who get to play Sarries the week after.
