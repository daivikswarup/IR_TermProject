Adam Scott wins back-to-back titles after Rory McIlroy collapse at Doral




DateTime::::2016-03-07T00:31:57+0000



<p>It must be hoped that Rory McIlroy’s losing of the WGC-Cadillac Championship does not overshadow the wonderfully dramatic fashion in which <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-scott">Adam Scott</a> won it, recording a second victory in two weeks. Any more of this and golf will be in danger of gleaming plaudits for entertainment. Even the appearance of Donald Trump, who glad-handed on the driving range, could not detract from what transpired over the subsequent four hours. The tournament was all the better for that.</p>

<p>On a captivating afternoon on the outskirts of Miami Scott recorded two double bogeys, shanked a bunker shot, flirted with a water hazard on the 72nd hole but finally, crucially, converted from 6ft 8in to claim the trophy. Relief – and an element of shock – matched Scott’s delight after a classy back nine contributed to a 69 and a total of 12 under par. McIlroy had started the day on that mark.</p>

<p>With this, added to his <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/28/adam-scott-sergio-garcia-honda-classic" title="">Honda Classic success</a> seven days earlier, Scott has comprehensively dismissed fears over his enforced change from a long-handled putter. He holed out 18 times from 18 attempts within 10ft on day four.</p>

<p>Scott is expected to rise to No6 in the world, which at least almost resembles what his status in this sport should naturally be. Marriage and fatherhood may have shifted Scott’s priorities for a while but he remains an immense talent; as now replicated by 13 <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/pga-tour">PGA Tour</a> wins at the age of 35.</p>

<p>“I can’t really believe it. I haven’t processed what happened there,” said Scott. “It was ugly and good, all in 18 holes.</p>

<p>“I think you have this picture in your mind that you’ve got to play so beautifully to win all the time and sometimes, especially at a golf course like this, in windy conditions like this, it can’t be that pretty unless you play one of the rounds of your life.”</p>

<p>Something akin to an encyclopedia may be required to tell the full tale of how this all unfolded from the position where McIlroy seemed to hold an unassailable advantage. In seriously testing conditions he could score no better than 74.</p>

<p>“I didn’t take advantage of the holes I should have,” McIlroy said. “It’s frustrating because that’s two out of the last three weeks. I was leading the golf tournament with 16 holes to play at Riviera. I was leading here going into the back nine and to not get the job done in either two of those instances is very frustrating.</p>

<p>“So I’ve got two events left to try to get that win before going to Augusta and I’m hopefully going to get it.”</p>

<p>One thing McIlroy will not lack is motivation, by virtue of wounding experience. At its peak that lead was four with Scott, who had found water on the 3rd and 5th, seemingly well out of the equation. “I took a moment to think about gaining some traction on the round before it slips away and I shoot 80,” said Scott of his 6th tee thoughts.</p>

<p>McIlroy’s wobble was unforeseen but the level of bruising it inflicted was apparent even at first glance as he stepped from the course. The Northern Irishman had played 40 tournament holes without a bogey before missing a lengthy par putt at the 7th. Another trip arrived at the 9th, where McIlroy could not get up and down from a greenside bunker. Suddenly we had a four-way tie for the lead.</p>

<p>McIlroy was never to rediscover his mojo, with his first birdie of the final round not arriving until the 16th. And yet, in endorsing the madcap nature of this event, repeats on the closing two holes would have forced a play-off. McIlroy’s effort on the 17th slipped agonisingly past, at which point his race was run – barring a Scott aberration.</p>

<p>It almost arrived. The 2013 Masters champion watched his tee shot at the last land behind a tree. Shot two was within a bad bounce of the lake with the next a genuine example of brilliance in high pressure. Scott lobbed a chip from a treacherous, sloping lie to within makeable distance. His fresh putting style held firm.</p>

<p>Others had played their part. Bubba Watson, who finished second, led by one after a birdie at the 12th. It will not be lost on the charismatic left-hander that on the two previous occasions in which he was the runner-up here, in 2012 and 2014, he went on to win the Masters. “I have a lot of confidence but Augusta is still a long way away,” Watson said.</p>

<p>Phil Mickelson and Danny Willett had spells in a tie for the lead; the Englishman may be especially irked by the way matters played out, as he carved a tee shot on the 18th into water. Willett had to make do with a share of third with McIlroy at 10 under par, one ahead of Mickelson. “I think last year I hit that tee shot right, into the trees,” said Willett, who could at least smile.</p>

<p>This was Scott’s day. He might have illustrated just how difficult winning can be but it was winning all the same. His was a triumph that should linger long in golfing memory.</p>

Unbelievable hand-eye coordination, nerves of a Le Mans driver, concentration of a brain surgeon, abundance of fast-twitch muscles in hands and forearms under complete control, and other stuff. Miscalculate 2 or 3 attempts out of say, 270 attempts in total and a week's accumulated work is down the drain.

I totally agree that some diversity would be nice. As a lesbian golfer myself, I feel we are very much under represented in the world of professional golf.

Maybe Rory (who has set up home in Florida) was demotivated to win the tournament because of Trump’s political ambitions in ------- (fill in the seven letter space).

I watched the entire final round on sky tv and I didn't see Rory collapse once. Every time the cameras were on him he was firmly on his feet.

i've played melbourne's sandbelt courses, often 36 holes a day, for a couple of weeks holidays on several occasions and, while i was fit then, i am no 'great athlete'. cadel evans is a great athlete. usain bolt is a great athlete. javier gomez is a great athlete. adam scott is quite fit, but is a talented sportsman.

Trump does own Doral so he was, technically, the host.

He seems to be doing pretty well without the broomstick putter and Ana!

A wonderful tournament esp. for the casual fan like me. Though, some diversity would be nice...

I thought that was very unfair too - Trump coming over to the players in the middle of their warm up and being forced to shake hands with him.

i always find this something of a misnomer; sure, golf is a sport. but you don't have to a great athlete to excel, just [he says blithely] an immensely talented sportsperson. (but good comment)

Tiger's victory at the 1997 Masters changed the sport. The biggest tournaments are dominated by athletic golfers now; you need only look at the conditioning of guys like Rory, Spieth, Day, Scott, Fowler etc to see it. There are always outliers, sure, and guys can compete into theirn forties but golf is increasingly a younger and fitter mans game since Tiger

Rory was doing fine, warming up on the pracice tee - then catastrophe: Trump turned up for a photo call. He kept pawing McIlroy ... so how what the poor lad to react other than with horror.

A gizmo called Shotlink which is pretty accurate.

I really don't know how they figure those distances out, but you'll watch on tv (here in the US) and the commentators will tell you down to the inch how long a putt is. Love to know how they know??

Yep, no longer with Ana Ivanovic...splitting with her would've been harder than giving up the broomstick putter surely?

Adam Scott's last three starts from the oldest first are, tied for second, first and first again today. A cool $US 1.62 million for four days of competition. He now leads the FedEx cup and has winnings of $US 4.12 million from just six starts on the PGA Tour this season. Getting rid of the broom stick putter has not stopped Adam Scott. Golf is so lucky to have such great athletes as the face of their sport. Well done Adam Scott and good luck in the Masters.

Didn't even know that Scott was married and had become a father.
