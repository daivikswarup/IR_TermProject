Bubba Watson: the enigma still looking to smooth his rough edges

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>hen compiling any shortlist of candidates for this week’s WGC-Cadillac Championship, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bubba-watson">Bubba Watson</a> has to feature. He has been, after all, the top aggregate scorer in the two years since the redesign of Doral’s Blue Monster course.</p>

<p>For the forthcoming Masters? Again, it would be nonsensical not to include a player with such aptitude for Augusta National in permutations. He has already <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/14/bubba-watson-wins-masters-green-jacket" title="">donned the Green Jacket twice</a>. Placed in further context, Watson has matched the Masters success tally of Ben Hogan and Tom Watson. Number three would not only rank him alongside Sam Snead, Gary Player and Nick Faldo but within one of Tiger Woods and Arnold Palmer.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/01/matt-fitzpatrick-blue-monster-cadillac-championship-doral">Matt Fitzpatrick has stars and stripes in his eyes as he faces Blue Monster</a> </p>

<p>Watson has nine PGA Tour victories to his name and he smiles when insisting victory at the non-verified <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/06/bubba-watson-patrick-reed-hero-world-challenge" title="">Hero World Challenge at the end of last year </a>means he has already reached a stated goal of 10. On Tuesday, Watson was fitted up for the United States outfit he will surely don when golf returns to the Olympics this summer.</p>

<p>Comparing Watson’s credentials with Rickie Fowler, Jason Day, Adam Scott or Justin Rose – age differentials notwithstanding – you would have a player regarded firmly in the upper narrative of golf. And yet, continually, Watson does not seem to feature as part of that storyline. He is overlooked, or grudgingly included.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are two-fold. Firstly, it suits golf to have what has now been stretched to a youthful “Big Four” of Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Day and Fowler. The 37-year-old Watson, a relative veteran in comparison, would skew the picture.</p>

<p>Moreover, and probably more pertinently, Watson has never been regarded as the most likable or appealing player on tour. There has been a child-like perception which Watson himself has fuelled. His on-course conduct has been questionable, just as his sentiments off it – from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/golf/2013/4/30/4286364/bubba-watson-jason-collins-tweet" title="">comments relating to homosexuality</a> to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/jul/11/the-open-2011-bubba-watson" title="">ignorance regarding Paris landmarks</a> – have raised eyebrows. You wouldn’t be swamped on any given tournament week by those rooting for a Watson win.</p>

<p>However, perhaps the time has come to afford Watson’s existing achievements greater respect. In terms of his character, he routinely has the public backing of Spieth and Fowler; both brilliant guys, both apparently well capable of sussing out bluffers from those with substance.</p>

<p>Watson has his obvious flaws. This week in Miami, he insisted once again that the media are prone to “twisting” his words. He is strangely uncomfortable and nervous in that press scenario for one so high-profile and experienced. The obvious explanation is that Watson is shy. His continual raising of what he perceives as negative coverage shows him as more sensitive than given credit for.</p>

<p>Yet when he wants to make a point he is perfectly capable of forcibly doing so; recently at the Phoenix Open Watson conceded he had little care at all for the venue but was playing out of respect for his sponsors. One article subsequently labelled Watson “the most spoiled brat on the PGA Tour”. Fans booed him. Watson’s crime appeared no more than having the temerity to tell the truth.</p>

<p>He has again been blunt with his thoughts regarding the Open Championship, where he has historically made no impact at all; primarily because of a high ball-flight which is so susceptible to windy conditions. “I’m never changing my game for a certain tournament,” Watson said. “I love the game of golf over in Scotland, links golf, true links golf. I love it. But one week, going over for one week is hard for me to get where I need to be to perform at a high level.</p>

<p>“ I’ve had moments over there that I’ve played well in stretches but not good enough. The last two years, I think I missed the US Open and the Open cuts. But overall, I’m happy with all my years, so I’m not going to change my golf or my style just for those two events.”</p>

<p>In a broader golfing sense, Watson’s work admirably continues to defy convention. He has still never had a lesson, still has no sense of looking for one, and freewheels his way around golf courses in an unorthodox manner which can prove brilliantly entertaining.</p>

<p>Watson is one of few players upon whom youngsters can take inspiration as an enthralling, fast-paced, self-taught shot-maker. The left-hander speaks as routine about his goal of growing golf, rather than seeking ranking points, trophies and plaudits.</p>

<p>During pre-tournament media duties in Doral, Watson shuffled uncomfortably and explained the earlier angst of his management over a controversial response when posed with the Donald Trump question. The eventual answer wasn’t troublesome at all.</p>

<p>The Floridian explained the demons which plague his mind over crucial shots; not, as would be common, a fear over bunkers or water but the drifting towards what new films may be out or lines from old ones. “Things kind of pop in my head and I kind just of just run with them,” Watson said. “So I’m trying to get things to quit popping in my head.”</p>

<p>The added sentiment offered proper insight into Watson’s aspirations. “As I mature and get older and become a better husband and father, I’m slowing down on the golf course and realising that the bogey is not as bad as it used to be when I was just a single man fighting for my card,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have moments, I’m going to have bad days, even at home I’m going to have bad days. We all get sick or tired or something, or something’s bothering us. When you look at that, it means my attitude has got to change because my little man’s going to find out about YouTube one day and can see all the bad things dad does. By changing who I am or trying to be better, who I am off the golf course is going to add to the golf course and better play, because I think my mental side will get better.”</p>

<p>Self-awareness, self-deprecation. And if Watson’s performance really is to improve, it will be impossible to ignore his standing.</p>

Yeah, that's kind of my point. for any person to have gone through their entire academic and adult life thus far without reading another book would be pretty impossible and the statement only emphasises his arrogance and narrow mindedness. I try not to judge people on their intelligence, but on their understanding of their own views and opinions - Bubba seems to come across as very opinionated without much information on a subject.

I think he will win the Masters next month, if he plays well and the rest of the field don't play as well as him. He just needs to stay patient and play one shot at a time, and hole a few putts. And get a little bit of luck.

Haha, I've heard most of his antics, but didn't know the caddy one! That gross, man...

Achievement? More like a complete failure. Read some books Bubba, and then maybe you wouldn't be so ignorant about the rest of the world!

Correct , and you're already within 2 of him, you're also on the same number of Open wins. Top stuff.

He should try "The Pet Goat". Very useful in times of stress

If I win the upcoming Masters, I will be within one of Bubba

It is very interesting watching him hit a golf ball. I stood behind him on a tee at the Ryder Cup and watched him hit a 40 yard power fade (he's too freakishly skillful to call it a slice) which was pretty remarkable to an onlooker, but obviously totally normal to him.

He makes me nervous when he's interviewed in a Robin Williams sort of way.



Author::::SurfandNerf

Did he actually say he has never read a book apart from the bible? Crikey, that's some achievement if its true.

I agree, as I said, ANY player who doesn't shout it is a prick. Bubba is the one in the article and the only one I have noticed who never does it. Maybe there are others who do it from time-to-time but I certainly haven't noticed any who consistently don't, like Bubba.

He doesn't like the French or France very much, is probably far too stroppy for some and seems to cry more times than an Oscar's recipient. However, he won't be the first or last to put his Footjoy in his mouth, Nick Faldo in his day was prone to many bouts of extreme petulance. So for now, I'll watch and wonder how on earth his club makes contact with the ball, as he carves an 80 yard slice or draw, to land it just where he wanted. Unlike my game.

I think Watson is a breath of fresh air in a sport that has become dominated by players with no personality. His playing style is also exciting and great to watch. I'd love to see him win another Green jacket.

I never see any players on the US Tour shouting Fore. Seems to be the general accepted behaviour over there in tournaments - possibly they are hoping that the ball will bounce back in to play, or be blocked from going in to further trouble.I think it's a bit unfair to single out Watson for this though.

He needs to win one of the Opens to be considered a great player.



Author::::Flooch
DateTime::::2016-03-02T15:17:35Z
Yes. Some, like me, find his hick schtick of "I've never read a book apart from the Bible or had a golf lesson" grating. However, when he admits he's only playing a tournament to please his sponsor, he becomes more interesting than the typical USPGA Tour drone.



Author::::Melmouth

He's popular with fans but not so much with fellow pros.



Author::::Billypla

What I don't like is his propensity to cry at a moments notice.Jeez he is 37 not 7.But he is exciting to watch.

He's got a swing that amateurs should be copying as he has no coil and just gets his body out of the way of the arms , I'll bet he gets no injuries from golf unlike , tiger etc!

Whatever his personality, if you get the chance to watch Bubba live, take it. Follow him for 9 holes, maybe 18. You will not only see shots you can't play, you see will shots you never even imagined.

He's a real life Happy Gilmore - with all the good and bad that brings. Personally I love watching him play golf; if you get your politics etc from sportsmen, you're probably the one with the bigger problems...!

Unlikable as a person and as a golfer. Any player who does not shout Fore when one of his shots veers out is a prick. Either he is not willing to accept he has shot a duffer or he cares little for the ramifications of the paying spectators - whichever side he sits, it sums up why no-one likes to talk about him.
