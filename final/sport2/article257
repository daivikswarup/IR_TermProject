<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/adam-scott">Adam Scott</a> banished any doubts over how he would cope without the long putter that helped him become No1 in the world with victory in the Honda Classic on Sunday.</p>

<p>Scott recorded a closing 70 at PGA National at Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, to finish nine under par, one shot ahead of his playing partner <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sergio-garcia">Sergio García</a>, who was left to rue dropped shots on the 16th and 17th in his 71.</p>

<p>The American pair Blayne Barber and Justin Thomas shared third place on five under, with Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell a shot further back in fifth after a closing 69.</p>

<p>Scott <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/15/adam-scott-angel-cabrera-masters" title="">won the Masters in 2013</a> using a long putter and reached the top of the world rankings in May 2014, a week before his last victory, in the Crowne Plaza Invitational, but has successfully reverted to a conventional club to comply with the ban on anchored strokes which came into effect on 1 January.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old began the final round tied with García and moved two shots clear with birdies on the 1st and 5th as he looked to become the first player since Phil Mickelson in 2009 to win on the PGA Tour after making a quadruple bogey. The Australian had enjoyed a three-shot lead before finding water twice on the par-three 15th in the third round to run up a seven, although a birdie on the 17th helped repair some of the damage.</p>

<p>García had bogeyed the 17th before a birdie on the 18th took the two friends into the last day tied at the top of the leaderboard, but the Spaniard had to settle for nine straight pars on the front nine in the final round.</p>

<p>However, with Scott dropping a shot on the 9th after failing to get up and down from a greenside bunker and another on the 10th after a wayward drive, García was back on level terms before missing from two feet for par on the 11th after his approach cleared the water by only a few yards.</p>

<p>Scott restored his two-shot lead after a superb approach from a fairway bunker on the 12th left him with a tap-in birdie, only for García to reduce his deficit to a single shot with a birdie on the 14th.</p>

<p>Both players bogeyed the 16th and García’s chances of victory effectively disappeared with another bogey on the next, although he at least birdied the last before Scott calmly tapped in for par to secure the win.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky Sports after securing his 12th PGA Tour title, Scott said: “I’m so pleased. It’s been a long time between drinks on the PGA Tour, especially after I was in such good form the last time I won, but that’s the beauty of this game.</p>

<p>“It felt like hard work out there to get it in the clubhouse and Sergio stuck with me the whole way and did not give me an inch. Fortunately it was enough to win.</p>

<p>“The game was definitely there, although it was not as pinpoint as yesterday. It’s hard to do that two days in a row at PGA National but I hit some great shots at the right times and hit a lot of putts that hit edges today.”</p>

<p>Asked about reverting to the short putter, Scott added: “It was a tough change in some ways but I fully embraced it when I decided to make it at the Presidents Cup last year and I have enjoyed putting with the shorter putter since.</p>

<p>“I feel like I am getting better and better and today was a great test. I made some and missed some. I’m going to try and get better next week and it’s certainly validated making the move to the short putter.”</p>

<p>García was magnanimous in defeat, telling Sky Sports: “I think he deserved it. I am proud of the way I hung in there. I don’t feel like my swing was anywhere near where I wanted it to be but I scored nicely.</p>

<p>“I putted well and chipped well but he played great. He played better than me at the end of the day, it’s as simple as that.”</p>

<p>Garcia, who had described his own play as “terrible” after missing the cut in the Northern Trust Open, added: “There’s a lot of positive things from this week.</p>

<p>“I fought hard, I stayed quite calm. It’s never easy but I gave it my all and unfortunately [hit] a couple of bad shots on a couple of holes and it was just not enough.”</p>

You're right. When Nicklaus was asked about his outstanding record in majors, he said that the difference was that he could still play his to his normal, excellent standard in a major, while most others couldn't, especially on the last day. That's why winning multiple majors really sorts out the men from the boys (see Colin Montgomerie & Greg Norman as prime examples).

I hope Adam Scott sticks to his guns & doesn't show for the idiotic Olympic golf tournament.

There is much more pressure on the player in a Major. Jack Nicklaus told the bold but obvious truth recently when he described the Ryder Cup as largely a fun event.

Welcome back, Adam!

I think you're right. Still a brilliant ball striker, but Sergio has won only one proper tournament in the last 4 years. Always looks nervy under pressure, especially on the greens. Would love to see him to win a Major, but think it's very unlikely.

Was hoping that a win here would give Sergio the confidence and self belief to win a major.But fear he will continue to fail except in the Ryder Cup.Great pity but the truth is that the mental side of golf is as important as talent.

Sounds like he bottled it slightly less than Sergio.

Adam sent his long putter to Pete Dawson with a little note!

Well done to Scott, proving he can win without the long putter. It's not his fault that the golf authorities were so lax in allowing this method for so long. His long game is well suited to Augusta, but there will still be a nagging doubt about his putting under the unique pressure of Augusta's fast, slopey greens.

Agreed, after proving he can putt with the shorter putter Scott must be in with Speith, McIlroy etc as favorite for the Masters.

Banishes putter doubts? Don't you mean "putts well on this occasion"?

And yes, the incessant hooting and yeehaaing of American spectators is symptomatic of relevance-deficit look-at-moi-dom!

Jason Day & Adam Scott, you absolute legends! Purple patch for Aussie golf… Scott's swing and Day's tenacity and fearlessness are compelling to watch...

Shame that the American spectators feel they have to shout a load of crap every time a player tees off.

I am not sure why there are so many doubts about Scott's ability to putt with the short putter considering how good he was before he went for the anchored putter. That set-back of the quadruple bogey in the 3rd round was put to rest and I think Scott has a decent chance in the Masters with this current form.
