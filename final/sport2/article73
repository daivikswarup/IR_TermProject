Liam Plunkett: ‘Why can’t I go out and win games for England?’




DateTime::::2016-03-01T11:10:18+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span> long-distance relationship leads Liam Plunkett to spend much of his life away from cricket in Philadelphia and it was there, at 4.30am on Friday morning, where he received the text message that would see his winter plans change once again.</p>

<p>The national selector, James Whitaker, was asking for a call back, in which he would confirm that Plunkett’s fellow quick Steven Finn was to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/26/steven-finn-ruled-out-england-squad-world-twenty-20-india" title="">miss the upcoming World Twenty20</a> in India because of a left calf strain suffered on the road back from a left-side strain, and thus a seat on the plane was his.</p>

<p>Plunkett was up and about already, yet to shake off jet lag from a trip to South Africa on which he had worked on his own fitness with the England and Wales <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a> Board’s lead fast bowling coach, Kevin Shine, before staying on for another 10 days to join Yorkshire’s stable of seamers in their pre-season camp in Potchefstroom.</p>

<p>Air miles come with the territory for this 30-year-old, with his England career of late one of airports, suitcases, check-in times and boarding calls, often at the end of which he has found himself bowling in the nets, rather than the middle. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldtwenty20">World Twenty20</a>, he insists, will not be one of these occasions, believing his muscular brand of fast bowling to be potentially match-winning.</p>

<p>“I’m not going out there just to sit in the squad,” he . “I’m going out there to play and to bowl at my top pace. And why not? Why can’t I go out and win games for England?”</p>

<p>That Plunkett is straining at the leash is understandable, with the ever-changing opinion of him among the selectors and one ill-timed, niggly injury of his own meaning he has been in and out of all three squads since the end of last summer, with only two Twenty20 appearances against Pakistan in Dubai last November to show for months on the road.</p>

<p>Like his latest call-up, his chance only came through another’s misfortune when, following an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/05/mark-wood-injury-england-odi-twenty-20-series-pakistan" title="">ankle injury to Mark Wood</a>, he cancelled another trip to Philly to stay on in the United Arab Emirates, having already spent five weeks carrying drinks for the Test side.</p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">I'm at the stage now where if I don’t get picked, I will ask the question</p>

<p>But while the one-dayers came and went without a cap, the Twenty20 leg of the tour <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/27/england-pakistan-second-t20-international-match-report" title="">felt like a chance seized</a>, as he touched 93mph on the speed gun when claiming back-to-back three-wicket hauls that helped England wrap up the series with a game to spare. That his name was not inked in for India at this stage baffled many, as did his subsequent exclusion from all three squads for the tour to South Africa.</p>

<p>Plunkett would seek out the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, for answers as to why he was not part of the Test leg – the first squad named – having been leapfrogged by Chris Woakes, Mark Footitt and Chris Jordan. All three seamers had been behind him at the start of the United Arab Emirates trip, with no cricket played in the meantime to explain the rethink.</p>

<p>“He said that’s where they saw me in the pecking order; that Footitt offered variety as a left-armer, and I was behind the other two. I couldn’t really come back with anything, because that’s his opinion. Of course I feel like I’m better than them but that’s me saying it, isn’t it? They would say they are better than me. That’s cricket.</p>

<p>“So while it was frustrating, you can’t piss people off by reacting badly. With so much cricket coming up and injuries always possible, you don’t want to get on the wrong side of people. But I am at the stage now where if I don’t get picked, I will ask the question. In the past I might not have but now I’ll ask. As long as you get feedback, that’s all you want.”</p>

<p>Injury has played its part in his winter of waiting too, with Plunkett finally having been called up for the limited-overs series against South Africa at the start of the year when Finn suffered his first knock, only to pull up with a thigh strain while playing for England Lions in Dubai just days before his flight.</p>

<p>“I feel what makes me bowl quick is my work ethic. But while I train hard, it also can be my downfall in terms of injuries,” Plunkett explains. “It’s hard to judge sometimes. I wouldn’t take it away, though, because I feel like when I’m going well and it all clicks, I’m the quickest bowler in the country.”</p>

<p>Plunkett will touch down in India next week as not just the oldest member of the setup but also the most experienced in terms of years since debut, having first turned out for England in a Test in Lahore more than a decade ago, back when international cricket was still played in Pakistan and his team-mate Reece Topley was only 11.</p>

<p>Then a raw 20-year-old stepping up to replace that summer’s Ashes hero, Simon Jones, and fresh from claiming 51 wickets in Durham’s promotion campaign that summer, Plunkett has since made only 50 appearances across the three formats. It is hard to think of an England cricketer whose cap to squad ratio is lower.</p>

<p>“It can be frustrating; it would be nice to play more. There was a spell in there when I simply wasn’t good enough but in the past few years I feel I have been bowling well enough to not just get in the squads but in the side and winning games. But you won’t find me walking around with my bottom lip out.”</p>

<p>The fallow period he refers to came at the end of his time at Durham, when in the 2011 and 2012 seasons he slipped down to the second XI. A move to Yorkshire, working under Jason Gillespie, the head coach, and Martyn Moxon, the director of cricket, reinvigorated his game, bringing 42 first-class wickets at 25 runs apiece in his first season, which prompted a Test recall the following summer.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell you why I struggled; I guess I was confused about what type of bowler I was. Durham didn’t pick me because I couldn’t go at two runs an over but if someone asked me to do it now, I could, and still be hostile. But Yorkshire said they didn’t want four of the same seam bowlers anyway. It’s like the bullpen in baseball, with each of us having a different role.</p>

<p>“And I have full faith in Dizzy [Gillespie] and Frog [Moxon] and what they think I should do with my bowling. I remember one of my first sessions with them, I hit the side netting. Dizzy just turned to me and said: ‘I couldn’t give a shit mate, I just want you to bowl fast.’ That stuck with me.</p>

<p>“When I was younger I used to worry before a big game about bowling a wide first up, but now I’m thinking I can nick a bloke off. It’s just a different way of looking at things.”This positive approach at Yorkshire, which Plunkett compares to the current England set-up under Bayliss and his assistant, Paul Farbrace, during our chat, is why he shrugs off the recent T20 losses to South Africa that have, along with Finn’s injury, seen them turn from dark horses into outsiders in a number of the pre-tournament predictions.</p>

<p>“You probably learn more in defeat than victory anyway,” he adds. “We are not going to change how we’ve played over the past year, and it’s all about momentum in these tournaments, so there is no reason we can’t go all the way.”</p>

<p>This week’s Spin, a similarly late call-up because of the unavailability of the management’s first choice, hopes to see the likeable Plunkett play a central role in this.</p>

Ok - there was coverage. But it's semantics. It was wholly inadequate coverage. You and palfreyman win the debate but not the argument IMO. You guys are clued up. Most - who will take what the G cricket covers as gospel - will not. I suppose that was my point.

Whether there has been enough coverage of the film and the subject matter is something we can debate. But read Clive's post, specifically the bit that palfreyman quotes, and I think palfreyman refutes Clive's specific claim - "....The Guardian acknowledged, for the first time...." - pretty conclusively.

DaddyPig I've given up on the G occasionally pop in to test the waters. You are always entirely reasonable. Sadly I have to take exception to your comment the G has "covered it" as palfreyman says. That's utter bollocks. Read the links and you'll see how poor the coverage is. It's woeful. Selvey had the pop for an exclusive and chose not to run it. The stories the G did run were pathetic.

I've just read Geoffrey's statement to support his candidacy, and it actually has some sensible, member-friendly stuff. Relocating the members' area to the new football stand when it's built so we can sit in line with the pitch; learning from the design of The Point at another northern Test ground so that food and drink service can be quick. Building the membership so we can start working back to financial equilibrium.

Ongoing Asia Cup is exciting in that the bowlers have dominated the show. Many flat track bullies have been exposed. I thought Rohit Sharma and Shabbir Rehman played two very good knocks. Yuvraj's sixes against SL were heartwarming, though I still think he is struggling in picking up lengths early. He's a gun player and if he gets back in his groove, India has a fair chance of going the distance in world T20.

Jordan also likes the leg side. All they need is a slip fielder there. So is it to be Willey or Plunkett? One of them will miss out.

Plunkett has been treated badky by the England management for 10 years or so. But, he is now not so fast as he was and he has no other skills that would be useful in Inida. He is just one of many fairly quick, fairly accurate, English-style medium-pacers - and a very ordinary fielder and batsman. That simply isn't good enough for an international competition. There must be someon in County cricket who is about 23 or less, genuinely fast, and able to avoid bowling down the leg-side. He must also be a brilliant fielder. With those qualities all he needs to be able to do with the bat is glance a safe single to rotate the strike. A long Test career awaits such a person.

I'm very confused about this story. Last week, the Guardian acknowledged, for the very first time, the existence of a film called "Death of A Gentlemen", which had won a prestigious Sports Journalists Award. It was, the Guardian assured us, something to do with the impact of T20 on test cricket. But now it seems it's been viewed in a HOC Select Committee and ECB President Giles Clarke has been hauled in front of the committee to explain himself. Could it be that the film is about something more important than limited overs vs. test cricket after all?

My favourite sentence in the letter to members is, "Since Michael Vaughan stepped down from the biard in 2014 because of his media commitments, professional cricket experience on the board has been provided by Martyn Moxon". In other words, a strong hint that Geoffrey is already riding enough horses thank you all the same.

Wasting taxpayers money? They are paid MPs the cost of an enquiry is marginal - they aren't bringing management consultants. And the subsidy argument is daft. Spread the game rather than line greasy palms.

I'm not convinced they get it right, playing another batsman instead of five bowlers in the last t20 was a bqd decision that was questioned before we got thrashed...and think Bayliss is underrating Plunkett...and yes, his batting should be highlighted more as an asset....



Author::::Marcus Hoffman
DateTime::::2016-03-01T21:11:41Z
We need his pace badly, especially with Finn injured...and he is more than useful as a batsman, more so than Jordan certainly, on recent evidence.

Yep it is a shame that nothing has been made of the Asia Cup. Like elsewhere a lot of the teams seem to be in a bit of flux with India now looking the most experienced side. As you suggest, Bangladesh though might be the seriously emerging team it it would be nice to get a good Asian journalist to give the us the heads up.

Good point about the balance of different types of bowlers in the squad. I think Plunkett would bowl particularly well in tandem with Rashid in some of the middle overs . They may not trouble Kohli or De Villiers but together they may scramble the minds of some lesser lights. I suppose all of us have our favourites with regard who should and should not be in the squad. The thing that is hard for Plunkett is that he seems to go up and down the pecking order without actually getting a game.

India are playing on a different level, I don't see anyone beating them, only an implosion like they had against Lanka in the T20 World Cup final could stop them, they're even getting out of difficult situations and they're also probably the best fielding side in the world, they've got all their bases covered.

What gives the people's elected representatives the remit to ask a few questions of Giles Clarke? Maybe the British constitution that says parliament is sovereign and its committees can investigate whoever they like. Maybe the notion that cricket in this country belongs to the people and is not the personal property of the ECB.

While not quite mystified, Plunkett would have made my squad. But I doubt he'd have played. Woakes was always (rightly) going to replace Anderson for the first test, and had bowled well enough in that test - if unluckily - to earn a recall in the fourth when Finn was injured.



Author::::NonOxbridgeColumnist
DateTime::::2016-03-01T14:26:05Z
Pretty small price to pay for MPs allowing the ECB to remove home Test cricket from the list of free-to-air sporting events over a decade ago, laying the foundations for the gravy train he and the counties have been riding ever since, and helping create the very megalomania and sense of invulnerability that culminated in the Big Three stitch-up of 2014.

DateTime::::2016-03-01T14:01:52Z
Plunkett should never have ended up behind Woakes in the pecking order in any form of cricket. However, I would be surprised if he plays much in the T20s. The three front-line right arm seamers in the squad (him, Stokes and Jordan) are all much of a muchness in terms of their records in international limited overs cricket, but unfortunately for Plunkett the other two happen to be by miles the two best fielders in a mediocre fielding side - and hence must be selected.

I'm more interested in what gives the Commons Committee the remit to haul him in to their kangaroo court. Same goes for their feeble attempts to do the same with tennis, athletics and football.



Author::::anon_coward
DateTime::::2016-03-01T13:24:37Z
However, when Finn has been injured or Sakered, then in Tests I reckon that Plunkett or Wood should be/should have been the next in line, ahead of Jordan, Footitt or Woakes.
