Lewis Hamilton scorns F1 rule changes and wants bigger say for drivers

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> wants to see drivers consulted more over rule changes in Formula One after being unimpressed by the reshaping of the sport this week.</p>

<p>Wednesday’s testing session in Barcelona was overshadowed by talk of a new look to qualifying, which will be made this season, and more complicated technical changes that will come into effect in 2017.</p>

<p>None of the decision makers who met in Geneva on Tuesday, and who want to make the cars faster, spoke with Hamilton, who has been one of the most important figures in F1 for a decade and has won three world championships.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/23/fernando-alonso-mclaren-f1-test">Fernando Alonso reassures McLaren and F1 he is staying after marathon test</a> </p>

<p>Hamilton said: “I don’t agree with the changes that have been made over many years and I do think the drivers should be consulted more. We do know what doesn’t feel good and what to improve.</p>

<p>“Some of these drivers have been in the cars for 10-15 years and been through all these different rule changes and know which ones work and which ones don’t.</p>

<p>“In terms of regulation changes, it is something we are not really much part of but those that have been implemented just now are nothing to do with us.”</p>

<p>Nor did Hamilton seem much impressed by the change to qualifying, with drivers to be eliminated one by one. “I don’t feel like it is going to change much,” he said. “I hope it does, and surprises us, but generally the format is the same.”</p>

<p>Hamilton sounded as if he was more interested in making changes to testing as Mercedes once again dominated preparations for the season. He and Nico Rosberg, after agreeing to split the day between them, pounded out 162 laps, and Hamilton drove 88 of them in the afternoon session.</p>

<p>“They are long days,” he said. “It’s not that it’s boring but it’s tedious going round and round and round. It’s not like a race where you’re competing and you have strategy and you’re fighting against the clock. Testing is not the most exciting, for sure. It never has been.”</p>

<p>Ferrari produced the quickest times on the first two days of testing but on Wednesday it was the turn of Force India’s Nico Hülkenberg to top the time sheet.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernie-ecclestone">Bernie Ecclestone</a> has undergone a transformation a few days after describing F1 as the worst it had ever been, saying he would not buy tickets for his family to watch races.</p>

<p>Despite the fact the F1 commission and strategy group meetings in Geneva were largely a fudge, with a final decision on the most important changes postponed for another two months, Ecclestone, the F1 chief executive, said: “I think now I’m a bit more confident we are going to see some good racing.” Even Paul the Apostle did not change this quickly.</p>

<p>Referring to his earlier remarks, Ecclestone added: “What people needed was a bit of a shake-up. I seem to be the only person that has thought we should do something in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone">Formula One</a>, to wake everybody up a little bit. And maybe that’s what’s happened. I wasn’t talking down the sport at all, quite the opposite. I was trying to sort of explain that unless we did something that’s the way we’d be going.”</p>

<p>Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal who wanted more radical changes introduced, swallowed his disappointment: “We’ve made a step in the right direction. The worst of all things would have been no change but it would be a great shame if that was not fully realised through this regulation change.”</p>

<p>Horner is fully behind the change to qualifying. “It could create a bit more randomness for the grid on Sunday, without artificially inverting grids,” he said.</p>

Right, one more time. I actually mean the computers in the pit and the several dozen "engineers" back home working out strategy. Computers in the car are less of a problem. Im sure you have one in your Honda Civic ;)

No one stitched bbc they sold out to sky and then gave up the rights before the contract was up. Just like they are doing with most of their sports. You could probably count on the fingers of your hand the sports you could watch on bbc and to be fair, sky coverage is way better than bbc could ever hope to achieve

Utter rubbish. The rules for F1 were agreed between manufacturers and the governing body. The drivers were, and still should be, hired help.

And what do you expect them to do after years of supporting the sport whilst suffering a barrage of abuse for years, for having the temerity to charge a token licence fee. I think dealing with Sky was a betrayal of licence fee payers, Murdoch has been robbing the British public blind for donkeys, but there were few alternatives. I suppose Clarkson could have got involved and insisted Bernie introduce F1 caravan racing.

Because they have the ability to drive a car quickly at the top of their profession doesn't mark them out as necessarily intelligent nor mechanically able. Although you do make a good point about relevant intelligence.

Please what? F1 is a big boys' club purely there to make money for CVC. There is not even any pretence to suggest otherwise. I don't get that impression with MotoGP. It comes across as a serious sport.

Tilke is the German track designer responsible for the tedious, billiard-smooth tracks F1 is now racing on, with a few exceptions like Silverstone and Monza.

So just forget how much unrestricted technical innovation costs?



Author::::JimClark25
DateTime::::2016-02-25T15:39:16Z
I strongly disagree, it is likely that F1 drivers are in no way representative of the larger community. Like all people at the top of their professions they display skills and relevant intelligence that others don't, that's how they get to the top.

Too late mate, he helped Tilke design all his tracks.

Like a cross-section of the community, drivers come in all shapes and sizes, intellectually that is. Part of their job is to report to the engineer what's happening to the car at any given point. They barely need any mechanical knowledge as the engineer then responds to the driver's input and analysis it - cars oversteering here but understeering there etc. Then he decides what mechanical/electronic component needs adjusting.

Get rid of Bernie for a start. He has had all these years in charge and they are still going around in circles. Almost as bad as our government!

If you go to a foreign country, it's quite simple - learn the language of that country. There is absolutely no way they should provide an English commentary. There have been a lot of people recentlty banging on about if you want to come to this country, then learn English. Which is fair comment. But it works exactly the same the other way round too - if the British go abroad, then they should damn well learn the language of that country. Anything else smacks of hypocrisy .

It isn't a facile comparison, it perfectly demonstrates the absurdity of going to a foreign country and expecting to be spoken to in your native tongue.

'but' indicates he had 'some' say before. He should take some responsibility. Otherwise, Weaver should shut his trap about Hamilton being such an important figure. Why would he say that?

Whilst I agree with your sentiments the practicalities you mention are contradictions. The sport has to be cheaper to attract participants. Allowing unrestricted innovation suits no one but Ferrari and Mercedes who have the budgets to outstrip anyone.

Much prefer if different engine formats were encouraged so there was a mix of V12's, V8's and turbo's. But with tracks as they are now standardisation is the optimum.

But this situation is more like Sky and the Premier League having a meeting, and then announcing to the world that as of next season central defenders cant cross the halfway line and you can only be offside in the penalty box....or a boxing promoter and the two boxers unilaterally deciding that holding would be allowed in an IBF title bout,'because the fans like it'........ surely the FIA sould set the rules for competitions that they sanction rather than the (3 or 4 big) teams and the guy who works for the company that owns the right to show it on TV?

Ecclestone needs to pull the plug on the US, let them stick to ovals, and concentrate on his core market, the Europeans and Antipodeans.

Start the slowest cars at the front and Maldonado's antics will pale by comparison. Lots of inexperienced, young, heroic drivers determined to stop world champions passing them so they make a name for themselves.

F1 would be nowhere had it not been for the Max and Bernie show. They made it what it is, but Bernie is now so old he's living in the past. In the last 40 years there has been no change to the format other than tweaks like refuelling, tyre changing, qualy etc. It's still a bunch of cars running around a track.



Author::::DavdyP
DateTime::::2016-02-25T13:16:09Z
If Hamilton is one of the most important figures in F1, and yet we've all seen these horrible changes, is he a little responsible for that too?



Author::::RedHotScot
DateTime::::2016-02-25T13:07:13Z
OK, let them stick to road courses and ovals...........That wasn't my point. Bernie needs to stop grooming F1 for the US and concentrate on the European and Antipodean fans that have supported the sport for decades.
