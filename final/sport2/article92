Eddie Jones breaks silence to reinforce England’s win-at-all-costs mentality




DateTime::::2016-03-10T22:00:15+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">P</span></span>recisely what Eddie Jones does or not does not say is generally less important than the key messages he is trying to impart. On Thursday, released from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/03/eddie-jones-england-six-nations-wales-rugby-union" title="">his self-imposed Trappist silence</a>, was a prime example. While he did not utter the words “nasty” and “horrible”, he wants England to stop being too nice and be far more ruthless in big games such as Saturday’s match with Wales.</p>

<p>Every time he talked about “New England”, Jones’s wish to distance himself from the side who <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/oct/04/england-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster-10-reasons" title="">departed the Rugby World Cup in the pool stages</a> was obvious. For the past four consecutive years, England have finished second in the Six Nations. Making that small step on the scoreboard, in the coach’s view, requires a giant-sized mental leap.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/10/eddie-jones-wales-scrummaging-terribly-illegally-england-six-nations-rugby">England coach Eddie Jones stokes row over Wales’s ‘illegal scrummaging’</a> </p>

<p>Thus it is that an unchanged side containing several players <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/26/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-match-report" title="">who lost to Wales on the same ground</a> in the autumn disguises a significant change in attitude. “I’m not an Englishman but I reckon I understand what makes English sport tick and we need to be aggressive,” Jones said.</p>

<p>“You go back to the great Ashes cricket series. When have England won Test matches? When they’ve had two fast bowlers – or are least one – that wants to rip every Aussie batsman’s head off. To me that is English sport.”</p>

<p>Translated into oval ball language that means hitting Wales murderously hard around the gainline and breakdown and letting the devil take the hindmost. Taking a pop at the legality – or otherwise – of Wales’s scrum engagement is simply the cherry on top. England’s three wins have contained some encouraging moments but Jones believes it takes a different mindset to secure titles as opposed to finishing runners-up. “Greatness is defined by being able to do it on the big stage and Saturday is a big stage, isn’t it? I saw an article written by Brian Moore talking about Test animals. It’s true. The big players stand up and the players who are going to make it stand up. We know Maro Itoje is a Vauxhall Viva at the moment <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/feb/28/billy-vunipola-maro-itoje-england-" title="">but he can become a BMW</a> on Saturday.”</p>

<p>It is not just Itoje, preferred once again to Joe Launchbury in the second row, for whom this will be a massive 80 minutes. The bench, in some cases, looks more dynamic than some of the starting combinations but underestimating Jones selection-wise is rarely smart. Once again this looks a team equipped, in the words of the captain Dylan Hartley, “to ride the storm” before seeking to cut loose later.</p>

<p>During the World Cup it worked out slightly differently <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/eddie-jones-manu-tuilagi-six-nations-wales" title="">but the return of Manu Tuilagi</a> gives England the kind of impact replacement they lacked six months ago. Not that Jones is harking back even slightly to the World Cup.</p>

<p>“We haven’t spoken about it once because it is irrelevant to this group of players. This group trains differently, they think differently about the game. I’ve been scarred by games in the past as a coach but you don’t stay involved in high-level sport if you carry baggage around. If we need that to motivate us, I’ve done a bad job during the week.”</p>

<p>Far better, he feels, to focus on more uplifting memories, such as the hot day three years ago when his Japan side beat Wales 23-8 in Tokyo.</p>

<p>The Welsh did not have their Lions contingent but Dan Biggar did feature at fly-half. “You could see he was going to be a good player but he has exactly the same habits now he had then. Good players present threats but they also present opportunities. When you look at Wales there are massive opportunities to attack them. Every defence system has its flaws.”</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/10/england-wales-six-nations-unchanged">England name unchanged starting XV for Six Nations Wales match</a> </p>

<p>Two, in other words, can play at the game of unsettling the opposition’s playmaker and Jones had a further dry riposte to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/08/eddie-jones-manu-tuilagi-six-nations-wales" title="">Warren Gatland’s remark about “not disappointing” George Ford</a> in terms of physical runners down his channel. “Oh, so you’re allowed to target players now? Sorry, I didn’t think you were allowed to do that. Will someone speak to Warren for me, please? Ask him to be more polite.” Touche, as they say in the antipodes.</p>

<p>The truth is that Jones rates Gatland highly. “He hasn’t coached for that long and that successfully not to be smart …he uses his players well.” A throwaway line about Wales – “There’s this little country sitting next to a big country … it’s little brother, big brother” – was also tinged with genuine respect. Even the media, it seems, are not entirely scoundrels. “As I’ve always said, the media is a really important part of the game but there are times when you need to be quiet. Quietness can get you a result.”</p>

<p>In the leaner, meaner world of New England, nothing else matters.</p>

If the game is allowed to be played by Joubert and not constantly disrupted (which i believe it will be) England by 12 points at least

Sorry about the misidentification. But your analysis of the 6N teams is about 15 years out of date. We all realise there's work to do to take on the SH sides, Wales and Ireland are just as capable as England of answering the challenge, probably more so than France.

I'm not English or an England fan.It's not disrespectful.You know in your heart that the Welsh team have peaked, there's no way forward, Gatland has done all he can for you. To beat the English they'll have to do it for you, like they did in the world cup, don't worry they'll find a way.Then you can be second division champs again.

Good post, though your understandable enthusiasm for England missed out Tipuric and Owens (very good players) on the bench for Wales as well as Faletau and Gareth Davies threats in the first XV. The more I look at the respective 23s the more I fancy Wales to win.

I don't understand that reference. I do feel sorry for the Welsh, we all do. Rugby is the only sport they've ever been good at and even then they've never been quite good enough. Occasionally England and France rise close to the top, could be a population thing I suppose (but then how do we account for New Zealand, similar to Wales in that they don't do anything else, but they're successful).

Dream on - waiting for the Welsh to be out on their feet is a really dumb game plan - Hartley was kidding surely? Vunipola has responded well under Jones and is a threat - Tuilagi always overrated - Farrell, to echo other comments, has a shit temperament and will disappoint as ever - looking forward to seeing Joseph play again even though I'm Welsh!

That is interesting. Suggests to me that the teams will be fairly evenly matched over the next few years, not that all players will keep their places between now and 2019.

We all get a bit too carried away with what is basically the 2nd division championship. For England this should really just be considered training for the Australia tour. That's when we can tell if they're any good.There's too much emotional inbred rivalry in 6N, the others would rather beat England than win the world cup.It's fun but no big cigar.

OK so we lost to Wales in the WC. But the same as it ever was comment flies in the face of the facts. We have beaten you twice out of the last 3 games. Did we lack balls then? Or did we beat you with brains alone? Let Wales play with balls and let's hope we play also with our brains. The best possible outcome would be for both sides to grow until they can take on the SH sides with the very real prospect of winning (as for a short period England did - do yu remember our back to back home and away victories against all the SH sides?)

Don't think many people, if any, are saying England will become world champions. There is however, and why not, a certain optimism about the future and there's no point in aiming for mediocrity.. Wales aim to beat SH opposition and even if they rarely manage it they, like England (but a bit less frequently) scare them at times.Too many people are putting their personal prejudices into the mouths of England fans...

welshbloom - thanks for sensible response. you might be interested in the following which i have just researched ( i know i should get a life ). for the present game according to the players on the english RFU / welsh RFU websites - welsh player average of international games is 37 to england's 29 so obviously big advantage to wales. but for the future the average age of the england squad is 24 years , 10 months and wales is a smidgeon under 27 - so i guess an advantage to england at the next RWC.

Author::::Welshbloom

True, true. I was thinking more about the under 20s playing right now, and we'll see soon enough who has the upper hand there. But you make a good point, England are potentially best placed to benefit from new players coming in in the short term, if they bed in well with the experienced seniors.

welshbloom - also interesting comment if you are going to go down the IRB ' under 20's ' route. since 2008 as one would expect NZ have dominated but wales have been runners up once , 3rd place once and 4th place once. by contrast england have been champions twice , runners up 3 times , 4th place once. i'm not saying under 20's is the evidence of an improving 1st team , you are. but if you going to go down that route careful what you wish for.

I've got a lot of time for him. He's got a surprisingly wise head and a lot of experience on his shoulders. He was outstanding for Wales for a long time, always up for the crashing starts in the scrum, but he was never quite the same after the contact rules changed. I think he's just got a sense of perspective, and at international level when you've been through the hype and won & lost along the way you just see it all for what it is.
