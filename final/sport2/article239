Sergio García tames the Blue Monster at Doral with superb round of 67

<p>Sergio García’s Saturday began by taking aim at a leading television analyst. Later, he was to display the kind of pinpoint accuracy with golf clubs in hand which endorsed his enduring levels of ability.</p>

<p>There can be a frustration attached to watching García play. The Spaniard seems to take every bad break personally, with body language - even to amateur onlookers - frequently poor. It is beyond dispute that García’s talent should have been replicated by at least a single major championship victory by this stage of his career.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/06/rory-mcilroy-wgc-cadillac-championship-golf-three-shot-lead">Rory McIlroy has chance to trump the greats at WGC-Cadillac Championship</a> </p>

<p>During round one of the WGC-Cadillac Championship, an epic tantrum on his penultimate hole saw García throw a club at his golf bag and punch said bag before simmering down to a rant. The incident, which was captured on television, will inevitably lead to a fine from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/pga-tour">PGA Tour</a>.</p>

<p>It can at least be said that García cares. He did likewise towards a scathing assessment from Brandel Chamblee, the respected <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/golf">Golf</a> Channel pundit, who asserted that García’s “attitude” leaves plenty to be desired. Chamblee also suggested García doesn’t have the mental capacity to compete in back-to-back tournaments.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old’s retort came via social media. “You must be right Brendal [sic] Chamblee, Golf Channel. According to you my bad attitude has made me a top 17 player, 15 out of 17 years, sorry!”</p>

<p>And then the follow up. “He is so important in my life that I can’t even write his name right.”</p>

<p>Chamblee will care little about this incident, the like of which he has encountered a hundred times. It provides the latest insight, however, into how prickly García can be when subjected to criticism. Privately, it seems obvious that García will be hurt by that major drought.</p>

<p>The subsequent, deeper answer in Florida was a strong one; García carded a third round of 67 for a five-under-par aggregate which leaves him firmly inside the top 10 at Doral with 18 holes to play. He bogeyed just a single hole, the 14th, and played an otherwise stunning back nine in just 33 shots. In the context of the toughest scoring conditions of the week, this was striking stuff.</p>

<p>“That was a good day,” García said. “I can’t complain about it. I played solid. The course was playing different today, different wind. It’s not easy to get used to it. I thought I played nicely and I would have taken 67 on a tough course like Doral is right now. I hit a bad tee shot on 14 and that cost me a little bit. I could have got away with it with a good putt but I mis-read it a little bit. Other than that, I played really well.</p>

<p>“I’ve played a little bit better as the week went on, nothing has been that different. It’s just a couple putts that have dropped that have been lipping out the first couple of days. I’m giving myself a lot of good chances at birdies and eagles. So when you can manage to do that, usually you’re going to score fairly well.”</p>

<p>Last Sunday, and linked to Chamblee’s jibe, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/28/adam-scott-sergio-garcia-honda-classic">García was beaten into second place at the Honda Classic by Adam Scott</a>. And yet, don’t dare mention to García that falling short at West Palm Beach had some deep-rooted impact on his state of mind. “It probably took me to as soon as I shook hands with Adam, it was over,” he added. “It was fine. I mean, everybody – I don’t want to say everybody – but a lot of people want to take it the wrong way. I don’t. I was coming off a terrible week at Riviera, which is a place I really, really enjoy and I was very disappointed with that.</p>

<p>“I went to another week that I really enjoy with a great golf course and I played really well. I hung in there without feeling great with my swing and everything and I almost won. This week, I’ve been kind of getting a little bit better as the week went on. So obviously all those things are positives and that’s the way I’m always going to take it, win or lose; that’s all I can do.”</p>

<p>Barring something miraculous, Jordan Spieth won’t be adding this WGC title to his lengthy list of achievements. Still he had the pleasure of “victory” in the company of his friend Justin Thomas. Spieth signed for 73 as Thomas slipped to a 78, leaving the pair on two under and three over respectively.</p>

<p>Russell Knox, who won the WGC event in China last November, has matched Spieth’s 54 hole score after a Saturday 72; ruined only by a bogey on the 18th. Louis Oosthuizen is a shot better off following a 69.</p>

Brandy Shambles is right - Sergio's attitude is all wrong. The other day he said he was playing nicely but just needed to hole a few putts. But when I checked his stats, it turns out he holed 18 putts in every round he has played this year.

So I take it there are only these five players competing in this tournament?
