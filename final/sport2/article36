<p>1) <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kotWv4MCxNI">Cyclists chased by ostrich</a> proves as amusing to watch as it is to say. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://vimeo.com/157239808">DreamRide</a> is as dreamy as it sounds, too.</p>

<p>2) Should Accrington Stanley miss the League Two play-offs by the potential extra points they were denied when referee Trevor Kettle blew for half-time a split-second <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrzrzUwkU7Y">before Billy Kee scored</a> against Wimbledon on Saturday, they will feel justifiably miffed: at least they’re in good company, what with Brazil being denied their <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsZ2Qfuwc_Q">win over Sweden</a> in the 1978 World Cup.</p>

<p>3) <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psx5ysLjqdg">Nate Diaz’s win over Conor McGregor </a>in UFC 196 had been preceded by this <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqUIdJhjZZk">exceedingly sweary invitation</a> to the fight but outside the main event Erick Silva was given an object lesson in why it’s best <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbc58jH71iA">not to take a cheap shot</a> by Nordine Taleb.</p>

<p>4) After last week, when Hannover’s subs were on the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMHlgu0JZVA">receiving end of a flare</a> launched from the crowd during their game against Wolfsburg, Red Star Belgrade fans <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfDDiwOI0cg">go several steps further</a>. Further north, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpQnppsCIYI">Rosenborg players embark on a a bid to pull of the epic volley</a>.</p>

<p> 5) Rickie Fowler <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2016/mar/08/rickie-fowler-hole-in-one-1m-for-autism-charity-video">fires a hole in one</a> (and from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/14804553/pga-championship-winner-jason-day-talks-exclusively-espn-sam-bruce">another angle</a>) at a charity golf event to earn the Els for Autism Foundation $1m. Fowler has some form in this area: having drained this extraordinary ace from <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZtRPhlqB4Q">200 yards</a> at the Quicken Loans tournament in 2015 and hitting blind at a specially constructed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeLwDNo2tMg">urban hole at Washington Harbour</a> in 2010.</p>

<p>6) Sublime to ridiculous corner: mullet appreciation in this delightfully straight celebration of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmucWOLnAb4">the best ice hockey haircuts</a> in Minnesota, as once brilliantly chronicled <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djto0wzCefY">by the Super Furry Animals</a> and then: stretcher bearers <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGMzJifW7So">fail to bear stretcher</a>.</p>

<p>1) Can they do it? Can they? This<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx61PsHggLM"> Leicester fan has faith</a> and showed it to the tune of the Pogues’ <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9jbdgZidu8">Fairytale of New York</a> back when they were top at Christmas, to which only those with a heart of stone could fail to smile. Hang on, though: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/09/marcilo-agro-leicester-city-barney-ronay">did someone say “Fairytale”</a>?</p>

<p>2) “Riding without holding the handlebars is about as clever as giving a balloon to a hedgehog” – first: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgMYKNoCXFs">cycling sins</a> (1936) from Pathé and then some beautiful speed as Stirling Moss <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PGRn15taiA">breaks speed records</a> at Bonneville Flats in an MG in 1957. <br/></p>

<p>3) More glorious nostalgia this time from north America as the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExPF-hOzfg4">Detroit Red Wings went to overtime with the Montreal Canadiens</a> in the seventh game of the Stanley Cup in 1954; and some remarkably good footage of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSR8BtNtLw">the 1933 decider</a> between the New York Ranger and the Toronto Maple Leafs, which also went to overtime; then a labour of love as this baseball card-collecting fan <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cui6IT9XHEg">chooses his favourites</a> and lists the entertainingly quirky reasons why.</p>

<p>4) Laurie Lawrence coached Australia’s Duncan Armstrong to gold in the 200m freestyle at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, when he was ranked 46th in the world. His coach was excited during the race and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grpXuSAJ21k">only got more</a> so as the victory sunk in, including slapping the fact into an interviewer’s face …</p>

<p>5) Nice idea, well-executed: <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEzNGJRKd_g&amp;ebc=ANyPxKoE1WfClYajvErNd7pBW6E0cAvzKkXmateqYlze_oN0Sh1JZXRM2YAR4vLEZg_VSr3GLzCpEfxHOKjPSwDFpSdaQOR8KQ">the greatest rounds in boxing from one to 12</a>.</p>

<p>6) Silky skills upon arrival to enjoy a spot of apres-ski. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.dumpert.nl/mediabase/6730680/eb641cf0/even_wat_eten.html">Even better in slo-mo</a>.<br/></p>

I have read the book and it is an unusually accurate and non-non-sensationlist account of cave diving. Most documentaries even those by otherwise sensible bodies like Nat Geo and Discovery cannot resist the temptation to unrealistically portray the risks and concoct scenes showing divers kicking up silt and squeezing through places that make the vernal public's skin crawl.

Deep water cave diving fascinates me, in the same way as high altitude mountaineering. Have you read the book 'Raising the Dead' about David Shaw and his attempt to recover the body of a lost diver from Bushman's Hole in South Africa? A tragic tale but quite compelling all the same.

I was a junior regional squash champ in my late teens. Played hard it is the most lung busting sport ... The Vo2 max of the world class guys are off the charts. Also my chiropractor says his profession LOVES squash players as they hit early middle age ;) knees and backs mainly.

Not exactly a 'sport' per se ... but I guess no less relevant here than skydiving, bungee jumping, ostrich running or baseball card commentating ....

Squash doesn't often grace the YouTube archive ranks, but this string of extraordinarily tricky shots and almost "superman" style full-length dives from Paul Coll in his match against James Willstrop at the Canary Wharf Classic event in London (to win the point of course) is worth a look --

Oman’s first ever wicket at the World Twenty20 tournament, was a brilliant airborne/diving catch from Zeeshan Maqsood against Ireland.

I got through the first false start but those commentators are awful to listen to.

I'm not sure I understand the cheap shot jibe in the UFC clip. UFC is all about cheap shots.

The dreamride is dreamy but destructive. Was it really necessary to break the crust on those rock formations to make this film? Once you leave these marks in such fragile environments they take a loooong time to disappear. Fine if you're the first, but .....

I once attended the Red Star v Partizan Belgrade derby. Awesome in the true sense of the word. Three hours of flares & synchronised intimidation before a ball was even kicked. The support was incredible, the football was average considering Red Star were World Club Champions in '91.

Being chased by an Ostrich looks fucking terrifying
