<p>Feuding Davis Cup teammates <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bernard-tomic">Bernard Tomic</a> and Nick Kyrgios have been seeded into the same quarter of the draw at the Indian Wells Masters. It makes for an interesting clash if they should meet in the quarter-finals after Tomic declared he would lose some respect for Kyrgios if he played the tournament in California after missing Australia’s Davis Cup defeat by the United States last weekend due to illness.</p>

<p>Tomic is seeded 17th for the tournament and Kyrgios is seeded 24, meaning both get a bye through the first round. Action in the men’s main draw gets underway on Thursday (Friday AEDT).</p>

<p>Young guns Tomic and Kyrgios were involved in a long distance spat on Sunday after Tomic complained about Kyrgios’ absence midway through his reverse singles loss to John Isner in the World Group first round ties at Kooyong. “Two times Nick has faked it. Twice. While I’m here, Nick’s sitting down in Canberra. Bullshit he’s sick,” Tomic muttered to Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt Hewitt during a change of ends.</p>

<p>The Australian No1 later told reporters a similar situation happened last February when Kyrgios withdrew from the Davis Cup tie against the Czech Republic. “He didn’t come to Czech and had stress fractures and somehow played Indian Wells and felt good,” Tomic said. “He said he’s ‘still sick but I’m going to be better tomorrow’ - so it’s just weird for me. If he plays Indian Wells, then he’s definitely lost a little bit of my respect.”</p>

<p>In response Kyrgios taunted Tomic on Twitter, referencing the Queenslander’s 6-0 6-1 loss to Jarkko Nieminen in Miami two years ago. “Let’s not forget who holds the quickest loss on the ATP Tour lol,” Kyrgios posted. “#howmanyminutesagain”</p>

<p>Kyrgios followed up with: “Heat of the moment, not gonna take it personally. Indian wells a week away, plenty of time”. He then tweeted a more cutting: “Just don’t expect me to have your back anytime soon”.</p>

In Sydney not that long ago: Teymuraz Gabashvili has advanced to his first ever ATP singles semifinal after top seed Bernard Tomic retired from their match in the second set. - Tomic decided to withdraw, citing fatigue and dizziness - Did Kyrgios accuse Tomic of faking it then?
