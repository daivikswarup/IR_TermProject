<p>A mixed round from Rory McIlroy left him four shots off the lead at the halfway point of the Northern Trust Open in California. The Northern Irishman, who has dropped down to No3 behind <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/jordan-spieth">Jordan Spieth</a> and Jason Day in the world rankings, recorded a two-under-par 69 at the Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles to stand at six under par after two rounds. That left him in equal seventh place, four behind the leader – Jason Kokrak of the US.</p>

<p>McIlroy might have been hoping for better after three birdies in the opening nine holes but he struggled with his putter on the back nine and dropped shots at the 10th, 13th and 15th. However, birdies on the two par fives on the way back kept him in contention.</p>

<p>Kokrak gave himself a fine chance of earning a maiden PGA Tour title after an exemplary 64, which included eight birdies and just one bogey. He came home in five under after a scorching back nine to finish on 10 under.</p>

<p>He is one shot clear of his compatriot Chez Reavie, who went round in 67, with the US trio of Dustin Johnson, Troy Merritt and Bubba Watson a shot further back.</p>

<p>Justin Rose finished with three birdies to propel himself up the leaderboard to five under but it was a bad day for the first-round leader, Camilo Villegas. After starting the day on eight under after he opened with a scintillating 63, the Colombian needed an extra 11 shots during his second round.</p>

<p>Spieth, the world No1, enjoyed a better day than <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/feb/19/jordan-spieth-northern-trust-open-golf" title="">his opening round</a>, but still missed the cut. Spieth made his worst ever opening round with a 79 on Thursday and he responded with a three-under 68, which included eight birdies, but it was not enough to keep him in the tournament.</p>

Rory has just shot a disastrous +4 round. He has no chance now. If I were in his shoes I'd fly back to florida and start preparing for the maters. Not that he.s got a chance mind you.

"McIlroy might have been hoping for better after striking three birdies in the opening nine holes, but some struggles with his putter on the back nine saw him drop shots at the 10th, 13th and 15th." Now I've watched him play these 3 holes using my Konica Minolta Bizhub swing vision analyser and it was definitely NOT his putter that he struggled with. In fact it was his putter that got the ball into the hole each time. Surely it was the other clubs that were the problem.
