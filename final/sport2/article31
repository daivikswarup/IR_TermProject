Ireland’s World Twenty20 hopes dashed by Bangladesh abandonment




DateTime::::2016-03-11T18:31:27+0000



<p>Ireland are out of the ICC <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldtwenty20">World Twenty20</a> after heavy rain prevented a result in their match against Bangladesh in Dharamsala. The rain relented temporarily to allow William Porterfield’s team to start a contest already reduced to 12 overs per side.</p>

<p>But after Tamim Iqbal powered Bangladesh to 94 for two in only eight of those overs, rain and lightning returned.</p>

<p>Ireland paid a heavy price for the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/09/ireland-oman-world-twenty20-match-report" title="">shock defeat to Oman</a> and can no longer qualify for the Super 10 stage against Test-playing nations – irrespective of the outcome of their final Group A match against the Netherlands.</p>

<p>In what play was possible against Bangladesh, Ireland caught and fielded moderately in awkward conditions after Porterfield won the toss.</p>

<p>Following an opening stand of 61 in under five overs, Andy McBrine had Soumya Sarkar stumped with one that turned. Then Tamim, who hit four sixes and three fours in his 47 from 26 balls, chipped a simple catch to midwicket off George Dockrell.</p>

<p>Within seconds of his dismissal, the rain began falling again – and with no resumption this time, Ireland and the Netherlands will be playing only for pride at the same venue on Sunday. Bangladesh and Oman’s group decider will follow the match.</p>

They are responsible for scheduling the match at a ground in a month where the average monthly rainfall is 100mm and not even providing reserve days.

You clearly didn't read or hear what the Scotland player had to say, where he implored ICC to give them more international Cricket. They've played only 1 ODI since the last World Cup, and I'm well aware that the associates play a qualifying tournament to get to the World Cup which happens every 4 years, so are you telling me these teams only deserve a lone qualifying tournament.

They already had an incredible 51 games last summer to decide which of the associate teams got into this tournament, making the top teams from that marathon tournament then have to further qualify from this competition against full member nations is just crazy. None of the other nations ever had obstacles like this placed in their way from competing with the big teams.

Looks like the problem is that Nagpur were allowed to organize their own ticket sales which predictably ended up being a fiasco. I am not sure if they solid-line report into Manohar or only dotted line. If dotted line then he really can't fire them, can only prevent matches from being allotted to dummies who can't organize a kids' play date let alone a major international cricket match.

I hope Indian media are investigating the mess with scotland fans being locked out of an empty stadium - what a disgrace. Manohar should fire those responsible & fix this sort of bureaucratic incompetence before looking into all the glamorous, high-profile ICC stuff that probably can't be fixed in any case.

There is always the chance of rain in a cricket game. Generally there are no reserve days in large comps. So, if Ireland had not lost to Oman they would still have a chance of going through as this is a round robin comp.

It really is bad luck on Scotland and Ireland. I wonder if they could organize a T20 World Cup along the lines of (speaking as one who lives in the U.S. and follows college basketball) the Maui Invitational, where you start with 8 teams (it would work with 16) and there is a losers' bracket so that all teams at least get to play the same number of games and (I think) you have a chance to work you back in after losing just one game. I have to admit, I don't know exactly how the thing works, but at least you wouldn't have to go all the way to Dharamasala and only get to play a single game that matters. All teams would get 4 games, and at the end, all teams wind up ranked in order.

Yes. But there is this word "international" in his statement. As if associates don't play international cricket on a regular basis. That is nonsense. They have international competitions on their own associate level with first class cricket and one day cricket. In the Intercontinental cup the teams taking part are the Netherlands (my own country), Ireland, Scotland, Namibia, UEA, Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea and Hongkong. World Cricket League Championship same countries except Kenia replaces Ireland because Ireland has ODI status and plays their one day matches against the test nations (if they get a game that is) A week of international cricket normally consists of one first class match and two one day matches except in the case of a match against Ireland in the I-cup - no one day- and one day matches against Kenia in the WCLC (no I-cup).Looks pretty international to me. Sure, the calendar isn't as packed as the Test nations' but that is impossible any way. The vast majority of players at this level are amateurs so they can't tour the world around all year.

"ICC's idea of spreading Cricket is giving international Cricket to associate nations once in 2 years."That is not entirely true.There is the World Cricket League Championship (one day cricket), the top teams of which get a chance to qualify for the World Cup and the Intercontinental Cup (first class/4 day) the winner of which gets a chance to qualify for Test cricket.

What exactly do you expect? A roof to magically appear over the stadium? Matches get affected by rain all over the world. The rainy season in India normally starts in May or June, so this is nonseasonal. Bad luck, but give your random conspiracy theories a rest.

Can't really work out what you're complaining about, if it's no reserve days, then they would slow the comp down. If it's Associates only in preliminary stages then I disagree, all Associates in the main competition would make it too long & there'd be too many walkovers. This way they're in the tournament but you don't have the aforementioned problems.

This shows how ICC wants to keep the game exclusive for big boys giving lip service on expanding the game. The venue is rainy for March, so they sent "small" teams there. Bangladesh was given no time after Asia cup. I go on and on how they just play cronyism and want the game to few nations. Same ICC!

ICC's idea of spreading Cricket is giving international Cricket to associate nations once in 2 years. First it was Scotland and now Ireland go out after playing just one game. ICC are only doing lip service with talk of spreading Cricket, their idea is to only allow associate teams to make up the numbers and that's it. This is an absolute disgrace and a farce, surely these nations will only get better at the game the more they're allowed to compete.

'Ireland caught and fielded moderately' Ouch! I wonder if the journo is still smarting from a school report written by an Irish teacher?- ' Billy writes competently when he can be bothered , but he needs to try much harder if he is to achieve his dream of becoming a sports journalist.'
