<p>Rory McIlroy stayed in contention in the Northern Trust Open at California’s Riviera Country Club by scoring a third-round four-under-par 67 on Saturday and will start the final round just two strokes behind the 54-hole leader <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/bubba-watson">Bubba Watson</a>.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a bit of a shootout tomorrow. I’m happy I stayed at 10-under and didn’t drop to nine,” McIlroy said after posting a 10-under total of 203.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you can look too much at what the other guys are doing,” he said. “You’ve just got to go out and set yourself a number. If you go out and achieve that, and it’s not quite enough, then someone’s just played better than you that day.”</p>

<p>Making his tournament debut at Riviera after being tempted there by the recommendations of many of his peers, McIlroy has produced solid golf with three straight rounds in the 60s.</p>

<p>“Quality courses produce a quality leaderboard, and you just have to look at the names up there … Bubba, Dustin [Johnson], myself, Adam [Scott], all very, very good players,” the Northern Irishman commented.</p>

<p>Asked what he would need to do improve his title attempt on Sunday, the 26-year-old replied: “I need to hit more fairways. I didn’t hit my first fairway until the eighth hole today. Even though the rough isn’t that long, being in that kikuyu [grass] takes so much control out of your hands. Even though the greens are soft, it’s still very tricky to judge.</p>

<p>“I feel like my iron game is sharp. Short game has been pretty good. My putting was nice today. I holed out well, and I have to continue to do that.”</p>

The photo above has a caption saying Rory is 4 shots behind Jason Kokrak. Well I have just done some research on the internet and it says he is only 1 shot behind. That's the last time I believe anything I read in the guardian.
