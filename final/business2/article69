'Gathering storm' for global economy as markets lose faith




DateTime::::2016-03-07T05:37:22+0000



<p>A fragile calm in global financial markets has given way to all-out turbulence, the Bank of International Settlements has said, warning of a “gathering storm” which has long been brewing.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/is-the-world-economy-having-a-2008-moment-stock-markets-financial-crisis">Is the world economy having a 2008 moment?</a> </p>

<p>In its latest quarterly report, watched closely by investors, the BIS – which is known as the central bank of central banks – also warned that investors were concerned governments around the world were<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/global-stock-markets-face-rout-amid-fears-central-bankers-out-of-ammunition"> running out of policy options</a>.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1603a.htm">BIS chief Claudio Borio said</a> the “uneasy calm” of previous months had given way to turbulence and a “gathering storm”.</p>

<p>“The tension between the markets’ tranquillity and the underlying economic vulnerabilities had to be resolved at some point. In the recent quarter, we may have been witnessing the beginning of its resolution,” he added. </p>

<p>“We may not be seeing isolated bolts from the blue, but the signs of a gathering storm that has been building for a long time,” he warned.</p>

<p>Although Asian markets enjoyed another broadly positive day on Monday and continued to claw back <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/29/global-markets-end-tumultuous-month-on-a-high">the losses of January</a>, the report said said that investors were concerned about what central banks could do in the event of another crisis.</p>

<p>“Underlying some of the turbulence was market participants’ growing concern over the dwindling options for policy support in the face of the weakening growth outlook,” the report said. “With fiscal space tight and structural policies largely dormant, central bank measures were seen to be approaching their limits.”</p>

<p>Borio surveyed the major disruptions over the last three months, from the first post-crisis interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve in December, to accumulating signs of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/chinese-manufacturing-decline-sharp-global-downturn-factory-output-china-uk">China’s slowdown</a>.<br/></p>

<p>In what he termed the second phase of turbulence in the last quarter, Borio said <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/stock-markets-rally-at-the-end-of-a-traumatic-week">markets were plagued by fears about the health of global banks</a> and the Bank of Japan’s shock decision to impose negative policy rates. </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/26/world-bank-oil-prices-forecast-2016">Persistently weak oil prices</a> drove turbulence throughout the quarter, he said. </p>

<p>Seeking to find a common threat for the various global trends at play, Borio said “debt is what helps us understand apparently unrelated developments”.</p>

<p>“Against the backdrop of a long-term, crisis-exacerbated decline in productivity growth, the stock of global debt has continued to rise and the room for policy manoeuvre has continued to narrow,” he said. </p>

<p>Public sector debt has risen broadly, while private sector debt rises have been concentrated in emerging markets, he added. </p>

<p>He argued that debt also offered a “hint” on the continuing weakness of oil prices as “highly indebted oil-producing firms come under pressure to keep the spigots open to meet their service burdens.”</p>

I read the article to which you linked. While logical, I think it ignores what I call the big picture. In other words, it's just another way to manage the cognitive map. By speculating what should happen without examining the underlying facts, is obviously a gamble. Instead, why not gather as much information as possible and then speculate? He's saying , "don't worry about it" because the world doesn't owe anything to outer space. While that may be true, the real deal is that the devil doesn't live in outer space, but rather right here among us.

Let me hazard a guess - the rich bet it ALL again, they are losing it, so the working class people of the world have to bail them out, better known as "austerity".Better children starve to death or drink lead filled water than a Trump or a Romney have to forgo yet another new yacht.

What's the fuss about, the rate of growth of the markets since the middle of the financial crisis has far outstripped the rate of growth of the real economies which underpin them. This of course means that a part of that growth is of the nature of a speculative bubble. Like all bubbles as it grows larger the walls become thinner and at some point it will implode/explode the world markets (stock and financial) are approaching that point and we can expect price stutters and flutters until there is a real adjustment. If the collapse is large enough and sufficient large financial institutions are affect tax payers can again brace themselves to bear the brunt of the cost.

Ok, I'll do it. Money is created out of thin air (thoughts actually) by central banks dominated by the super rich and regulated by themselves. We could use it for good things but instead it's used to scam the plebeians and keep them poor and scared. It works very well for that. You're welcome.

Maybe "investors", aka gamblers, should worry about what they themselves should do (hint: invest in actual plant and equipment and growing real businesses instead of stock trading, stock buybacks and gambling for fake profits) instead of wondering what central banks will do. The credit-fueled bubble is madness, always has been and will not end well while soaring stock prices are lusted after instead of real investments. NO BAILOUTS of these lazy financial predators! NO, NO, NO!

one more thing. Many Americans who have "made it", are still only one serious illness away from financial ruin if the healthcare assistance they are banking on let's them down. Without medicare, life expectancy in America goes down, yet people who think like Cruz see the social programs as a millstone around the neck of the economy, and the economy needs to be "liberated" from government, so it can flourish; the rising tide will lift all boats, etc etc etc Steve Forbes all the way

We have enjoyed benefits and disadvantages with the global economy. For example clothing. As a teen girl, I remember when clothing was a lot more expensive. Remember the movie Pretty in Pink, where the girl could not afford a prom dress? Today she could just go to TJ Max and get something on sale. The prices have gone down a lot since then, when considered with inflation. I would have loved to be able to buy all the cute cheap outfits we have now, back then. That is the result of globalization.

But thats what our economic model requires them to do. If people dont receive a sufficient share of the wealth in the economy (through increasing wages) to purchase the goods and services in the economy, then they must borrow to spend. And if they dont the economy goes down the pan. Unfortunately the current crop of neoliberalism, is resulting in a trickle up wealth, rather than trickle down as we were promised, requiring people to borrow ever greater sums to fund spending.

Yes, I AM saying Congress is owned by banks, and fucked is exactly where that leaves us. I don't think tying our currency to a commodity with intrinsic value(and the other 3 properties of money), and which requires physical labor to create is at all disadvantageous to working class people. It's exactly that kind of money that truly values WORK. Fiat debt based currency, however, is the favored tool of the pampered elite to control and subjugate the actually-working class."Negative interest rates are pretty stupid"Well that's what your holy central banks are pursuing next across the board. That, and the bans on physical cash that will be required to maintain them. Central private banking is accepted as the norm today, but is historically a pretty radical idea. The Fed first met under extraordinary secrecy standards on Jekyll island to plan this cabal; people were wiser then and would not have openly tolerates the bullshit we do today.

Individuals have failed to learn too. Continue to see people spending beyond their means, buying things they don't need or can't afford (car leases being a great example) and racking up debt. We seem to be falling back into awful habits rather than cutting our cloth as households, companies and countries.

The public has done nothing ....The public continue to accept an agenda set for it , vopting for persons and parties , instead of setting their own POLICY to vote for and the voting facilitators only , of public policy.The next step would be to vote for universal basic income at approx.£ per 350 wk per household , at approx the same cost of welfare plus gov admin of petty income regulation and interference in private life.This policy would save £bn s , provide money circulating in the economy , benefitting ball businessses and provide the means for community generated enterprise , replacing the vast corporate unproductive " service sector " .This would cost zero ,and prevent the huge losses of taxpaye'rs money going out of the economy to property developers and mass landlord's offshore accounts.If the public want to stop the govs giving their money away , they have stopgiving their money to gov.s to give away.

Capitalism will eat itself. It's pretty obvious. The problem is that we are all in denial and still follow silly "reds under the bed" paranoia peddled by greedy right wing over lords. We need a global shift to equality and redistribution of wealth. The idea that wealth will filter down from the 1% greedy bastards who have 90 odd% of the worlds bounty is the most insulting mantra I can think of.
