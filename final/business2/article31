George Osborne gets mixed economic news in week before budget




DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:36:06+0000



<p>A modest narrowing of Britain’s trade gap coupled with a slight weakening in the construction sector has provided <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne">George Osborne</a> with mixed economic news before next week’s budget.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2016/mar/11/asian-markets-shrug-off-global-losses-and-rise-after-ecb-action-business-live">European stocks jump on ECB stimulus and higher oil prices – business live</a> </p>

<p>The Office for National Statistics said the UK’s trade deficit in goods and services with the rest of the world had eased back from an upwardly revised £3.7bn to £3.5bn between December 2015 and January 2016.</p>

<p>During the same period, the output of the construction industry fell by 0.2%, with the ONS also reporting that activity in the fourth quarter of 2015 was less weak than originally believed.</p>

<p>Official figures showed the UK ran a deficit of £10.3bn in goods in January, partly offset by a £6.8bn surplus in services.</p>

<p>The ONS said the improvement in January – the latest month for which figures are available – had been the result of oil and so-called “erratics”: items such as precious stones and aircraft for which there is no settled pattern for imports and exports.</p>

<p>Excluding oil and erratics, the ONS said the deficit had widened by 0.5% in January. Over the three months to January – a better guide to the underlying picture than one month’s data – the deficit on goods and services stood at £11.8bn, an increase of £3.5bn on the previous quarter.</p>

<p>Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon, said Britain’s economy remained unbalanced. “The overall trade deficit was £3.5bn in January, worse than the consensus, £3.0bn. December’s deficit was also revised much larger, to £3.7bn from £2.7bn.”<br/></p>

<p>For the construction sector, the ONS said there had been a decrease in new building work offset by an increase in repair and maintenance. Public sector housing and infrastructure saw the biggest falls in activity.</p>

<p>The ONS said new data showed that construction output in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.3% down on the third quarter. That compared with an earlier estimate of a 0.4% fall.</p>

<p>Chris Williamson, economist at Markit, said: “The UK construction sector suffered a disappointing start to the year, adding to a downbeat flow of data on the health of the economy so far this year. The data follow survey evidence showing growth slowing sharply in February amid heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook.”</p>

No, I was referring to the post I replied to, oddly enough.

It's okay to have a £3.5bn trade deficit so long as you have an economically literate government which understands that to mean that it represents a spending leakage in the domestic economy representing £3.5bn which should be made up by the government in order to replace the outgoing financial assets that were sent abroad.

PS if you're talking about this:"Total expenditure: £55.5 million [yes, million, not billion]. The largest item was interest, £28.5 million, then defence at £15.5m. That's 80% of govt spending. Doesn't leave much to splash around on anything else."Well, 28.5 + 15.5 = 44. 44 out of 55.5 is very close to 80%. No?

PS I liked your comment about 'Every UK government in the 19th Century', so I looked up government expenditure for 1850.Total expenditure: £55.5 million [yes, million, not billion]. The largest item was interest, £28.5 million, then defence at £15.5m. That's 80% of govt spending. Doesn't leave much to splash around on anything else.Source: http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/uk_year1850_0.html

New money is created as debt, reduce that debt and guess what happens. Household debt is different to government debt. If new government debt is taken on and is used to increase GDP through wisely investing, overall the burden is reduced. This is fairly basic stuff.

Osborne's `long term economic plan` bearing fruit. Make the majority so poor they can't afford to buy anything, thus reducing the trade deficit. The man's a fucking genius.

Some rise in income tax would do no harm at all.

He said he wants to reduce the "debt burden" which surely means reducing the debt? The burden being the interest on the debt.

Neither would succeed at their stated aim and Osborne has missed every major borrowing target by a country mile.

McDonnell says nothing at all about surplus or even reducing the National Debt directly.He wants greater investment to grow GDP and therefore reduce the National Debt as a percentage of GDP.That does not require a surplus at all.

So greater austerity is taxing the rich more and making corporations pay enough tax? LOL



Author::::lupara
DateTime::::2016-03-11T11:09:24Z
No, it has to be an overall surplus including both current and investment accounts, otherwise debt won't fall as promised. I assume that McDonnell understands the difference between deficit and debt

A current account surplus but an investment/capital account deficit?

"A future Labour government will be bound by its discipline to reduce the current deficit," he will say.



Author::::lupara
DateTime::::2016-03-11T10:38:10Z
We must stick with Osborne, because McDonnell is planning even tougher austerity. Whereas Osborne is targetting an overall surplus in the final year of this parliament, McDonnel is planning to reduce national debt over the lifetime of a Labour parliament, i.e. an overall surplus, on average, in every year.
