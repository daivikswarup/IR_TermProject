HSBC slips on dividend concerns

<p><strong>HSBC</strong> is on the slide on concerns about whether it can maintain its dividend in such a difficult trading environment.</p>

<p>In the wake of its recent results, analysts at Bernstein Research believe the payout to shareholders could be in danger, especially given its performance in Hong Kong. They said:</p>

<p>When <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/hsbcholdings">HSBC</a> struggles to grow its Hong Kong loan book, it’s bad news for the income line.</p>

<p>They added:</p>

<p>HSBC’s fourth quarter results (quite dreadful) are symptomatic of the macro headwinds that the global banking system faces this year – a lack of credit demand, a sharp drop in corporate activity and a low rate environment that can only get worse. In this environment, we find it impossible for the bank to sustain its progressive dividend policy and expect the bank to signal a cut anytime in the next 6 months. For a stock that is widely held as an income stock, we feel a cut would be painful and would reset valuation significantly downwards this year. Accordingly we downgrade the stock to underperform [from market perform] with a price target of 380p [from 550p].</p>

<p>HSBC has done as well as it could within the limitations of a low rate and growth environment. The reality remains that this bank is a deposit gathering machine that depends on rates to generate more than 60 basis points of RoTA. Now that we have had near zero rates for around 8 years and doesn’t look like changing any time soon, it is difficult to see any upside from here. Its key money spinner – Hong Kong – is sharply slowing down and we are actually moving more towards negative rates across the world. A dividend cut would just bring home these headwinds and spook investors.</p>

<p>HSBC shares are currently down 7.7p or 1.6% at 459.65p.</p>
