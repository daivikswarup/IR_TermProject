<p>Shares in the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/londonstockexchangegroup">London Stock Exchange</a> jumped nearly 9% after the owner of its New York rival said it was pondering an offer for the company, sparking the prospect of a bidding war.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/24/london-stock-exchange-deutsche-borse-continue-merger-talks-carsten-kengeter">The LSE is in talks with Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt</a> to seal a £20bn merger – their third attempt at a tie-up in 16 years. It would combine the LSE’s share trading operation with the German exchange’s Eurex derivatives business, creating the third largest exchange operator in the world in terms of stock market value. </p>

<p>However, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is based in Atlanta and owns the New York Stock Exchange, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.investegate.co.uk/intercontinental-exc/rns/statement-re--possible-offer/201603010809015825Q/">said</a> on Tuesday morning that it was considering making an offer for the LSE. It stressed that no approach had been made to the LSE’s board, and no decision had been made as to whether to pursue such an offer.</p>

<p>The news sent shares in the LSE up 8.8% to a record high of £29.14 in early trading. </p>

<p>The LSE confirmed that its board had not received a formal proposal from ICE, adding that discussions with Deutsche Börse was progressing.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-29/ice-said-to-explore-rival-bid-for-lse-to-thwart-deutsche-boerse">Bloomberg reported</a> late on Monday that ICE was preparing a counterbid with advisers including Morgan Stanley. Chicago-based CME Group is also assessing whether it wants to enter the fray, according to the news agency. </p>

<p>The world of exchanges has seen a flurry of dealmaking in recent years. ICE, run by Jeff Sprecher, took a big slice of the European derivatives market when it bought NYSE Euronext in 2013, which gave it the derivatives business Liffe.</p>

<p>Under UK takeover rules, ICE must make a formal offer for the LSE no later than 29 March, and Deutsche Börse must table an offer by 22 March.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://deutsche-boerse.com/INTERNET/MR/mr_presse.nsf/0/6EC1CF3FE4E79132C1257F650033EFE0/$File/160226_Pressrelease%20Disclosure%20of%20further%20terms%20EN.pdf?OpenElement">Deutsche Börse and the LSE are planning a “merger of equals”</a> in which both companies would share control of the boardroom, retain their separate brands and operate under a holding company structure. </p>

<p>The German exchange would own 54.4% of the merged holding company, compared with LSE’s 45.6%. The LSE’s chief executive, Xavier Rolet, would leave. Rolet has been on an acquisition spree since taking charge in 2009.</p>

<p>His Deutsche Börse counterpart, Carsten Kengeter, will take the same role at the combined company.</p>

We used to have anti-trust laws in the US - all swept away. Now we have corporations "too big to fail" so we have to bail them out. Now it's seems to have spread to multinational corporations who will be able to manipulate and control countries. And, all of the current world leaders do nothing to stop them.

How can a stock exchange buy a stock exchange? Can someone please explain?

It should stay independent or it should be the LSE that takes over the German one. We can't lose anymore industry to foreign rivals. New takeover rules are long overdue. Shareholders being the most important and coming before the good of the country and the workers is not acceptable.

So are we not even going to own our own stock exchange? We certainly are a 'Private Island' as James Meek put it, where a large percentage of our assets are owned by corporations and wealthy individuals, many foreign. Leaving the EU won't improve this sort of thing, that's for sure.

Why not sell off our Stock Exchange - we've sold everything else off.

Some interesting comments but so much nonesense about overseas companies not wanting to invest in the UK, Brexit or not.

A quick dividing up of the spoils pre-possible-Brexit - I wonder what else is going on?
