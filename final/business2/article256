Why Britain won't vote to leave the EU

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>mong the multiple existential challenges facing the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> this year – refugees, populist politics, German-inspired austerity, government bankruptcy in Greece and perhaps Portugal – one crisis is well on its way to resolution. Britain will not vote to leave the EU.</p>

<p>This confident prediction may seem to be contradicted by polls showing roughly 50% support for “Brexit” in the June referendum. And British public opinion may move even further in the “Out” direction for a while longer, as euroskeptics ridicule <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/20/cameron-set-to-name-eu-referendum-date-after-cabinet-meeting">the “new deal” for Britain agreed at the EU summit on 19 February</a>.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/20/eu-referendum-timetable-uk">EU referendum: a timetable for the UK</a> </p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is probably time for the world to stop worrying. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brexit-united-kingdom-collapse-by-harold-james-2016-01">politics and economics of the question</a> virtually guarantee that British voters will back EU membership, even though this may not become apparent in public opinion polls until a few weeks, or even days, before the vote.<br/></p>

<p>To understand the dynamics that strongly favor an “In” vote, start with the politics. Until this month’s deal, Britain’s leaders were not seriously making the case against Brexit. After all, prime minister David Cameron and his government had to pretend that they would contemplate a breakup if the EU rejected their demands.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it was impossible for either Labour politicians or business leaders to advocate an EU deal that Cameron himself was not yet ready to promote. The Out lobby therefore enjoyed a virtual monopoly of public attention. This situation may briefly persist, even though the EU deal has now been agreed, because Cameron has no wish to antagonise his party’s implacable eurosceptics until it is absolutely necessary; but as the referendum approaches, this political imbalance will abruptly reverse.</p>

<p>One reason is Cameron’s decision to release his ministers from party discipline during the referendum campaign. Initially viewed as a sign of weakness, Cameron’s move has turned out to be a masterstroke. Having been offered the freedom to “vote your conscience” on the EU deal, every significant Conservative politician has come round to support Cameron.</p>

<p>These newfound EU loyalists include two of the most potentially influential eurosceptics, London mayor Boris Johnson and home secretary Theresa May. As a result, the Out campaign has been left effectively leaderless and has already split into two rival factions – one driven mainly by anti-immigrant and protectionist sentiment, the other determined to concentrate on neoliberal economics and free trade.</p>

<p>As the political tide turns, it can be confidently predicted that the British media and business opinion will follow, mainly because of direct financial interests. For example, Rupert Murdoch, whose outlets dominate the media landscape, needs membership in the EU single market to consolidate his satellite TV businesses in Britain, Germany, and Italy. Another powerful motivator for Murdoch, as well as for other media proprietors and business leaders, is to be on the winning side and to maintain good relations with Cameron, unless they see overwhelming evidence that he will lose.</p>

<p>That brings us to the main reason for ignoring current opinion polls: only when Britain starts seriously debating the costs and benefits of leaving the EU – and this may not happen until a few weeks before the referendum – will voters realize that Brexit would mean <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/brexit-risky-for-uk-and-european-union-by-ian-buruma-2015-11">huge economic costs</a> for Britain and no political benefits whatsoever.</p>

<p>The economic challenges of Brexit would be overwhelming. The Out campaign’s main economic argument – that Britain’s huge trade deficit is a secret weapon, because the EU would have more to lose than Britain from a breakdown in trade relations – is flatly wrong. Britain would need to negotiate access to the European single market for its service industries, whereas EU manufacturers would automatically enjoy virtually unlimited rights to sell whatever they wanted in Britain under global World Trade Organization rules.</p>

<p>Margaret Thatcher was the first to realise that Britain’s specialisation in services – not only finance, but also law, accountancy, media, architecture, pharmaceutical research and so on – makes membership in the EU single market critical. It makes little economic difference to Germany, France, or Italy whether Britain is an EU member or simply in the WTO.</p>

<p>Britain would therefore need an EU association agreement, similar to those negotiated with Switzerland or Norway, the only two significant European economies outside the EU. From the EU’s perspective, the terms of any British deal would have to be at least as stringent as those in the existing association agreements. To grant easier terms would immediately force matching concessions to Switzerland and Norway. Worse still, any special favors for Britain would set a precedent and tempt other lukewarm EU members to make exit threats and demand renegotiation.</p>

<p>Among the conditions accepted by Norway and Switzerland that the EU would surely regard as non-negotiable are four that completely negate the political objectives of Brexit. Norway and Switzerland must abide by all EU single market standards and regulations, without any say in their formulation. They agree to translate all relevant EU laws into their domestic legislation without consulting domestic voters. They contribute substantially to the EU budget. And they must accept unlimited EU immigration, resulting in a higher share of EU immigrants in the Swiss and Norwegian populations than in the UK.</p>

<p>If Britain rejected these encroachments on national sovereignty, its service industries would be locked out of the single market. The French, German, and Irish governments would be particularly delighted to see UK-based banks and hedge funds shackled by EU regulations, and UK-based businesses involved in asset management, insurance, accountancy, law, and media forced to transfer their jobs, head offices, and tax payments to Paris, Frankfurt, or Dublin.</p>

<p>When confronted with this exodus of high-value service jobs and businesses, Britain would surely balk and accept the intrusive regulations entailed by Swiss and Norwegian-style EU association agreements. Ultimately, Brexit would not only force a disruptive renegotiation of economic relations; it would also lead to a loss of political sovereignty for Britain.</p>

<p>Or maybe just for England, given that Scotland would probably leave the UK and rejoin the EU, taking many of London’s service jobs to Edinburgh in the process. Once Britain’s political, business, and media leaders start drawing attention to these hard facts of life after Brexit, we can be confident that voters will decide to stay in the EU.</p>

Tell that to Norway and Switzerland, both of whom have had to make changes to their trading laws, methods, and restrictions to get the sort of access to the valuable EU markets they wished to trade with. To think it wouldn't apply to the UK outside of the EU is overly optimistic in my view.

Boris is "an EU loyalist"? Brilliant forecast. Allowing ministers off the leash is not a "political masterstroke" but rather a political necessity, a reversal of his previous position and in keeping with Labour's position on the 1975 vote.

The EU does not like the deal with Switzerland, especially after they had a populist referendum that voted against free movement of people. After the trauma of a Brexit, they would certainly not agree a betrer deal with the UK than the one just agreed with Cameron.

Most of the European countries are members of the world trade organision and therefore trade would carry on a per usual, all this scaremongering is just a way of trying to blackmail the electorate into voting to stay in the European Kingdom, which of course is run jointly by Germany and France, the rest of the countries are merely sheep wandering around clueless and more than happy to take a few hand outs now and again for their vote.

I think Cameron is a disaster, but live in your dreamworld if you must. If you think there won't be consequences of an exit you have a very strange concept of how the real world operates.

Voting to leave the EU will definitely mean renegotiating trade deals during which profits and tax receipts would likely be adversely affected, and my guess is this will result in even more severe austerity measures being put in place. Now who really believes the changes made in that scenario would be reversed within a few years? From an economic point of view I reckon most people would soon find themselves worse off, with years of long hard work to recover that lost ground. The optimistic view that the Brexit brigade have about renegiotiating trade deals just doesn't wash in my opinion, and owes more to the wearing of rose tinted specs than reality in my view.

What? You speak in meaningless riddles. An independent poll is valuable, multiple independent polls across a broad spectrum of users gives a true impression of what society thinks.On the other hand, a poll conducted by a mainstream media outlet is not to be trusted as it will be biased in one direction or the other, usually in favoring the EU or we could take the example of IPSOS Mori who are outright liars, top tier have worked directly for the cabinet office and so IPSOS are a total and utter waste of time and should never be taken seriously.

In contrast to the Eurosceptics you dismiss as "insular" if you're such an outward looking man what are you doing to reclaim the democratic rights the EZ citizens lost when the Germans unilaterally commandeered Eurozone policy making in 2011? To defend common values is the actions of a true European. Is that what you are doing? Or would that be "destabiling" too so best we don't say anything?

Was Anatole Kaletsky drunk when he filed this shambolic article? Nevermind the Cameron "masterstroke" of keeping Boris onside ( I mean, what the fuck? Did he actually write that sentence) but it presumes that Britain would be powerless if it were excluded from the service market. In fact we could tweak the tax system to negate any imbalance, while championing a democratic Europe across the EU, in the hope that the citizens of Europe can free themselves from a conceited bullying powermongering elite who have done even more damage to their lives and their societies than they have to the British. 40% of the French electorate want a Frexit from the Euro. Watch this space.

Throughout Great Britain's extraordinary history, there has always been a faction of insular self-destructive Little Englanders who couldn't see the forest for the trees. Thank God they were a minority, just as your very own self-destructive views are in the technical minority now.
