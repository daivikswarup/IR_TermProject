Bob Diamond may be considering bid for Barclays’ African assets




DateTime::::2016-03-04T13:02:05+0000



<p>Bob Diamond is expected to look at parts of the African business being put up for sale by Barclays – which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine">he ran before being forced out during the Libor-rigging crisis</a> – as he attempts to fulfil his ambition of developing a major banking presence on the continent.</p>

<p>The former chief executive of Barclays has already established a banking operation in Africa <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/17/bob-diamond-invest-african-banks-atlas-mara">through Atlas Mara</a>, which is listed on the stock exchange and has a stock market value of about £250m. He created the business with Ashish Thakkar, a British national now based in Dubai. </p>

<p>If Diamond were to make an offer for the Barclays operations through Atlas Mara he would need to raise hundreds of millions of pounds and also find a way to unravel the complex <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay">Barclays</a> operations in Africa, which could prove to be extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Speculation about Diamond’s interest in buying up some of the operations owned by his former employer have been rife after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/barclays-cuts-dividend-as-profits-fall-8-percent">Barclays confirmed this week that it intended to scale back on the continent</a> as a part of an effort by its new chief executive, Jes Staley, to simplify the business and preserve capital. </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/81c98d48-e16b-11e5-8d9b-e88a2a889797.html#axzz41w3KKZoW">The Financial Times reported</a> (£) that Diamond could seek backing from sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East or Asia to support any bid and calculated that the value of the Barclays operations outside South Africa that could fit with the Altas Mara business were valued at £1.5bn.</p>

<p>Staley wants to reduce Barclays’ 62.3% stake in its African business, which is listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange. Barclays made a big push back into South Africa 10 years ago when it bought a 60% stake in local bank Absa. The business has now become Barclays Africa Group Limited, which is listed on the stock market and holds most of the bank’s operations in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa">Africa</a>.</p>

<p>Barclays has admitted it could take two to three years to reduce its presence in Africa, which generates about 20% of the bank’s profits and is prepared to hold a smaller stake in the Johannesburg-listed business. It did not elaborate on its statement from Tuesday when it announced its profits had fallen 8% to £2.1bn in 2015 and warned it was more than halving its dividend for this year and next.</p>

<p>Altas Mara, which refused to comment, already has operations in Nigeria, Rwanda, Botswana and is focused on developing on the continent, but not in South Africa where the bulk of Barclays’ operations are based.</p>

This is a desperate, short term move by Staley. The growth he plans to extract from UK and US markets is nonexistent. He his also going to sell at a loss.

"Forced out" he should be serving a long sentence in a jail full of angry lifers...

Barclays in Kenya makes big profits, much more than their other African operations. However, it is run as a cash cow - little or no investment - large dividends - no impetus for growth. As a result other, local, banks have overtaken them.It is time that Barclays sold off their African operations to someone else who will at least try to develop them.

The name 'Diamond' says it all.
