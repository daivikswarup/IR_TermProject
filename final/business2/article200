Swiss 1,000-franc note here to stay, says national bank




DateTime::::2016-02-16T13:37:09+0000



<p>One of the world’s biggest banknotes – Switzerland’s SFr1,000 bill – is here to stay, the central bank has said, despite <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> moves to end its highest denomination note to keep it out of the hands of militants.</p>

<p> European finance ministers last week <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/criminal-links-of-500-euro-banknotes-demise">called on the European Central Bank to look at ways of tightening security around the use of the €500 bill</a>, over fears such a high-value note made it easier for terrorists and criminals to both launder and carry cash.</p>

<p> But the Swiss National Bank (SNB) said there were no plans to follow Europe’s lead over its SFr1,000 bill, worth more than £700 or $1,014. The biggest US denomination note is the $100 bill.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2016/feb/08/big-bucks-high-denomination-bank-notes-in-pictures">Big bucks: high denomination banknotes - in pictures</a> </p>

<p>The spokesman said the bank believed that the size of a banknote had no impact on efforts to combat crime.</p>

<p> Few Swiss have seen one of the violet SFr1,000, the latest version of which features the portrait of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Burckhardt">19th-century cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt</a>.</p>

<p> According to SNB figures, SFr38.3bn of them were in circulation in 2014, just under 10% of Swiss banknotes but 61% of the total value of cash in paper form.</p>

<p> “The high proportion of large denominations indicates that banknotes are used not only as a means of payment but also to a considerable degree as a store of value,” the SNB website explained.</p>

<p> One Swiss banking source said they had seen recent signs of people hoarding SFr1,000 notes as a reaction to negative Swiss interest rates, which make banks and large institutional investors pay for some deposits.</p>

<p> The SNB has said it has no data to confirm this.</p>

I live in Switzerland and when I bought my car, I paid using 10 x 1000 chf notes. So much easier than 100s of 20s, which is the largest usable denomination in the UK. Over here, you can buy a newspaper with a 200 chf note and no one will bat an eyelid.

When they start to limit the use of cash, forcing people to use a bank transaction each time your pay over a certain limit. When you leave a trace of every aspect of your life visible by unknown people "for your own good" !?!. When all your life leaves a digital slime trace, ...how free are you as citizen ?

Of course they're not. How do you think this foetid little country that was full of peasants a century ago got so rich? Selling cuckoo clocks and chocolate! Swiss wealth has always been built on taking the puss out of everyone else systems. From the Nazis to Russian Oligarchs, they've no scruples whatsoever. Switzerland banning 1000 notes would be like Barcelona selling Messi, Neymar, Suarez and Rakitic...

it doesn't coat to use a credit card. Often cheaper when travelling outside your own country. Really useful when visiting Switzerland, as you can make a brief visit without buying ANY Swiss Francs! We did it last year.

I had a strange experience in zermatt recently when I wothdrew some money. The atm machine asked if I wanted large or small notes. I opted for large. So out came a 1000 sf note. I then tried to hire my ski boots etc and tried paying with the 1000 sf. "Dont you have anything smaller" the assistant asked ? So I was basically stuck with this white elephant.Personally I find these large notes a pain. I dont want to use a credit card because of the cost involved and I dont like someone possibly hacking the card. Cash is number one as far as I am concerned. I dont think th swiss have a 500 sf note which would be ideal.

It is very surprising how many people are defending high value bank notes here. Switzerland may use cash more than other countries for cultural reasons, but this is neither here nor there. The fact is that money laundering and tax avoidance make up a significant part of the Swiss economy (and therefore Swiss prosperity), and the government, far from wanting to co-operate internationally, simply sees a competitive advantage.

The problem of high denomination paper currency notes can be solved by replacing them with high denomination coins made of silver or bronze than weight 140 plus grams each and five centimeters diameter.. The guy lugging a suitcase across the airport and huffing and puffing at it's weight, is the guy you stop. It would be easy to carry one or two for vacations but tough to use for money laundering.

ECB has a theory that says large denomination notes are used by money launderers, crooks and savers.-The proof of this theory.-Swiss banks are determined to retain large denomination notes.-QED.

I think you have to live and work in a country before you can really understand the local folk. Sure the Swiss are very careful with their money - but in my experience also very generous - and the friendships I made there are genuine and last a lifetime. In contrast Americans tend to be initially very friendly and easygoing - but also somewhat superficial - the next time you meet they will have forgotten who you are...

And as the majority of such income comes from cocaine and heroin. They should legalise them and other drugs such as cannabis. At least then there would be a degree of control over purity and distribution and profits would go to legitimate governments.

You should combat the criminals at the source of income, not at how they store it. The criminals will be just fine storing and moving money in 1,000SF notes. But if you hit at their source of income, that would be a different story.

And if you have a certain amount banked (including the 3rd Pillar), you don't even pay that.

Removing the higher denomination notes as a measure of combating terrorism financing is pointless. The government should combat it at a much earlier stage, at the source of income.

I once work in a greetings card department in a big store, and someone came in just after opening to buy a card. He paid with a £50 note. My float was £40, so I had to get it changed in the cash office. I didn't mind - the walk was nice, but I did think he was a bit of a prick. I don't think he was trying to pass a fake note, as I checked and the cashier did too.

Agreed, they are not that uncommon, and are often used to pay high value bills, also like you we have used them in shops and the teller thinks nothing of changing them, quite a contrast to when in the UK where pulling out a 50 and gets you treated like a master criminal.

Nobody bothers about fake bank notes in Switzerland because they're pretty much impossible to forge. Safety features for bank notes in other countries are developed here apparently, and the Swiss bank notes are printed with all available features incorporated, presumably to make it easy to show them off. Of course, nobody else can afford to have all those safety features combined in their notes, as each additional feature increases the cost of printing significantly, so Swiss bank notes become the world's most difficult to forge by default.

This story has been on going for years the main use for very high value notes is criminal activity of various kinds and money laundering .The lack of ability to draw legitimately held money if it ever occurred would be unaffected by this since very very few people would be holding very large funds in in cash .

They were in common usage when I lived in Switzerland - but then they were worth only about 50 pounds.... later, in around 1965, about 75 pounds.
