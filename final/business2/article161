Is the world economy having a 2008 moment?




DateTime::::2016-03-02T14:11:00+0000



<p>The question I am asked most often nowadays is this: are we back to 2008 and another global financial crisis and recession?</p>

<p>My answer is a straightforward no, but that the recent episode of global financial market turmoil is likely to be more serious than any period of volatility and risk-off behaviour since 2009. This is because there are now at least seven sources of global tail risk, as opposed to the single factors – the eurozone crisis, the Federal Reserve “taper tantrum,” a possible Greek exit from the eurozone, and a hard economic landing in China – that have fuelled volatility in recent years.</p>

<p>First, worries about a hard landing in China and its likely impact on the stock market and the value of the renminbi have returned with a vengeance. While China is more likely to have a bumpy landing than a hard one, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/uncertainty-about-china-economy-by-michael-spence-and-fred-hu-2016-02">investors’ concerns have yet to be laid to rest</a>, owing to the ongoing growth slowdown and continued capital flight.</p>

<p>Second, emerging markets are in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/emerging-economies-stability-necessary-by-anders-aslund-2016-02">serious trouble</a>. They face global headwinds (China’s slowdown, the end of the commodity super cycle, the Fed’s exit from zero policy rates). Many are running macro imbalances, such as twin current account and fiscal deficits, and confront rising inflation and slowing growth. Most have not implemented structural reforms to boost sagging potential growth. And currency weakness increases the real value of trillions of dollars of debt built up in the last decade.</p>

<p>Third, the Fed probably erred in exiting its zero-interest-rate policy in December. Weaker growth, lower inflation (owing to a further decline in oil prices), and tighter financial conditions (via a stronger dollar, a corrected stock market, and wider credit spreads) now threaten US growth and inflation expectations.</p>

<p>Fourth, many simmering geopolitical risks are coming to a boil. Perhaps the most immediate source of uncertainty is the prospect of a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/iran-saudi-arabia-strategic-regional-rivalry-by-bernard-haykel-2016-01">long-term cold war</a> – punctuated by proxy conflicts – between the Middle East’s regional powers, particularly Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shia Iran.</p>

<p>Fifth, the decline in oil prices is triggering falls in US and global equities and spikes in credit spreads. This may now signal weak global demand – rather than rising supply – as growth in China, emerging markets, and the US slows.</p>

<p>Weak oil prices also damage US energy producers, which comprise a large share of the US stock market, and impose credit losses and potential defaults on net energy exporting economies, their sovereigns, state-owned enterprises, and energy firms. As regulations restrict market makers from providing liquidity and absorbing market volatility, every fundamental shock becomes more severe in terms of risk-asset price corrections.</p>

<p>Sixth, global banks are challenged by lower returns, owing to the new regulations put in place since 2008, the rise of financial technology that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/blockchain-technology-end-big-banks-by-simon-johnson-2016-02">threatens to disrupt</a> their already-challenged business models, the growing use of negative policy rates, rising credit losses on bad assets (energy, commodities, emerging markets, fragile European corporate borrowers), and the movement in Europe to “bail in” banks’ creditors, rather than bail them out with now-restricted state aid.</p>

<p>Finally, the European Union and the eurozone could be <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/europe-disintegration-geopolitical-danger-by-nouriel-roubini-2016-01">ground zero of global financial turmoil</a> this year. European banks are challenged. The migration crisis could lead to the end of the Schengen Agreement, and (together with other domestic troubles) to the end of German chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.</p>

<p>Moreover, Britain’s exit from the EU is becoming more likely. With the Greek government and its creditors once again on a collision course, the risk of Greece’s exit may return. Populist parties of the right and the left are gaining strength throughout Europe. Thus, Europe increasingly risks disintegration. To top it all off, its neighborhood is unsafe, with wars raging not only in the Middle East, but also – despite repeated attempts by the EU to broker peace – in Ukraine, while Russia is becoming more aggressive on Europe’s borders, from the Baltics to the Balkans.</p>

<p>In the past, tail risks were more occasional, growth scares turned out to be just that, and the policy response was strong and effective, thereby keeping risk-off episodes brief and restoring asset prices to their previous highs (if not taking them even higher). Today, there are seven sources of potential global tail risk, and the global economy is moving from an anemic expansion (positive growth that accelerates) to a slowdown (positive growth that decelerates), which will lead to further reduction in the price of risky assets (equities, commodities, credit) worldwide.</p>

<p>At the same time, the policies that stopped and reversed the doom loop between the real economy and risk assets are running out of steam. The policy mix is suboptimal, owing to excessive reliance on monetary rather than fiscal policy. Indeed, monetary policies are becoming increasingly unconventional, reflected in the move by several central banks to negative real policy rates; and such unconventional policies risk doing more harm than good as they hurt the profitability of banks and other financial firms.</p>

<p>Two dismal months for financial markets may give way in March to a relief rally for assets such as global equities, as some key central banks (the People’s Bank of China, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan) ease more, while others (the Fed and the Bank of England) will remain on hold for longer. But repeated eruptions from some of the seven sources of global tail risk will make the rest of this year – unlike the previous seven – a bad one for risky assets and anaemic for global growth.</p>

Roubini criticizes the Fed for raising rates .25 percent and at the same time criticizes negative interest rates. How is a .25 percent rate of interest significantly different from a -.25 interest rate? The higher rate would seem to benefit savers to a tiny extent while the lower rate benefits spenders to a tiny extent. Can't blame rising rates and lowered rates at the same time. Savers have suffered for years and apparently all the spending did nothing to restore the economy.

This is a very depressing article. There's no balance however. There's winners and losers in every situation. Aren't all these ricks now priced into the markets since everyone knows about them. I'm sure the world arms industry is in rude health. BAE warplanes being used by Saudi etc. China in trouble, so maybe this means they slow down production of coal fired power stations, so slow down in CO2 production. Oil is cheaper so everyones got a few extra quid in their pocket to spend. The Ebola outbreak was brought under control. All of these things have positive economic knock on effects. Once you start looking there are reasons to be optimistic.

I'm not convinced that this is any more than nostalgia for the (relatively short) über-growth of 1990-2007, especially in the US financial sector.

Against that economic background, the UK makes its in or out choice for EU membership. With respect to the world economic ructions, it makes no difference if we're in or out, the bottom line is borderline bankruptcy for the EU and the UK. Wether we are in or out of Europe dosen't matter, things aren't going to change for the better for a very long time.

What if that downturn leads to a general glut in demand as workers are laid off and/or experience a fall in disposable income. The demand then doesn't exist to incentivise the start up of new businesses or the expansion of existing businesses which are needed to create the jobs and disposable income needed to boost demand. You're stuck in a catch 22 situation where businesses won't create the jobs needed to boost demand because there isn't the demand for goods and services to do so and workers won't demand more goods and services because there isn't the jobs and disposable income to do so. In this situation nobody is a winner and there is no macro net gain.

It's interesting to review the various forces acting upon the markets, but the proper response to the question of whether the global economy is going to tank in a big way is "Eventually, yeah." The proper response to the question of when is "Hell if I know."

War is the only hygiene of the world. Likewise, crises are the only hygiene of a free economy. As Andrew Mellon pithily put it, financial crises "purge the rottenness out of the system".

The markets in 2008 were genuinely spooked as there was awareness of the enormity of debt and that it was not sure whether governments would react in the way the did ie giving the financial sector everything it wanted plus more (Heaven forbid that Paulson bails out the banks, and this from a boss of Goldman Sachs). In 2016, they cry wolf at every turn and governments respond by giving them the medicine the financial sector wants. ie record low interest rates and the promise of more 'soma' or QE. Even China is hooked!

As I see it the crisis is only now making itself felt in industries that traditionally thought themselves impervious to market fluctuations. I provide ancillary services for scientists and academics, and I've seen order numbers drop across the board in recent months.

My personal opinion is: Not, I think global economy is not having a 2008 moment because we have a lot of emergent economies in good situation for example: India with a growth around 6.9% in 2016 and other... but is true China's with its currency devaluated or like economists names "slowdown" the growth not was the same that the shareholders, economists, etc are forecasting. In U.A the situation is not the same right now U.S have a strong dollar but the manufacturing sector is in a reccesion, even we don't have with security if FED is going to raise the interest rate on 2016... apparently will be not so.

We are facing the consequences of austerity which has aggravated all the economic ills of the global economy as well as unsettling democracies. No liberalist policies have to end and we need to return to growth.

Seems we are exasperating the situation instead of dealing with it, running for the hills and allowing some really ugly monsters to emerge out of the shadows. Could be much worse than 2008.

A hard landing in China would be regrettable but hardly globally affecting, China's GDP growth has gone parabolic since about 2003 and a few quarters of recession would probably be healthy.
