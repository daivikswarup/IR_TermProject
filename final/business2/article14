ECB can only buy time, not solve eurozone growth woes

<p>For most of its short life, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank">European Central Bank</a> fretted about inflation being too high. Now it has the opposite concern.</p>

<p>The fear of deflation explains the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/how-european-central-bank-ecb-trying-revive-eurozone">package of measures</a> announced by Mario Draghi on Thursday. Three months ago, the ECB president disappointed the markets by coming up with less stimulus than he had led them to expect. This time there were no half measures.</p>

<p>The ECB sets three interest rates and it cut all of them. The central bank has been buying bonds in return for cash at a rate of €60bn (£47bn) a month, but will now up the purchases to €80bn a month for at least a year, and probably longer. It launched a scheme on Thursday under which commercial banks would be paid for borrowing money provided they re-cycle the funds to the private sector in the form of loans to households and companies.</p>

<p>And still it wasn’t enough to slake the insatiable thirst of the financial markets for more and more stimulus. The euro initially fell on the foreign exchanges but then rose when Draghi said the ECB did not anticipate the need for any further cuts in interest rates.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/10/ecb-stimulus-measures-mario-draghi-negative-rates-qe-business-live">Markets volatile after ECB cuts interest rates and boosts QE - business live</a> </p>

<p>There is certainly a need for bolstering demand in the eurozone. Since December, the ECB has revised down its 2016 growth projection for thesingle currency bloc from 1.7% to 1.4%, but the really big change has been to its forecast for inflation. Three months ago, it was expecting the eurozone cost of living to go up by 1% this year: it is now pencilling in an increase of 0.1%.</p>

<p>Draghi’s plan is to make money plentiful and to make it cheap, yet the eurozone’s problem is not a lack of credit supply, which is at a five-year high, but the weakness of demand for loans even at historically low interest rates. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/11/golden-age-central-banks-end-time-tax-and-spend">There are limits to what central banks can do</a> and the ECB is rapidly approaching them.</p>

<p>Draghi knows that monetary policy – interest rates, quantitative easing and incentives to borrow – can only do so much. He would like his actions to be supported by structural reform and a more aggressive use of fiscal policy. Catherine Mann, chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, thinks the same. She believes the ECB is carrying too much of the burden for stimulating the eurozone economy – and she is absolutely right.</p>

<p>Higher government spending would help increase growth and persuade businesses and households to snap up the low-cost loans on offer. Until <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> has a more sensible approach to fiscal policy, all the pressure will fall on Draghi. But the ECB can’t solve all the eurozone’s problems. It can buy time but not much more.</p>

Until each and every (former) country within this 'burning building' concedes to Germany's demands to do as they are told, high unemployment and the hopeless lack of jobs and hope for the young people under 25 will not be , cannot be resolved. The teutonic mantra is 'Do as you are told' or all sink together....except us. Who wants that option of " partnership" ? Not difficult for so many Brits to say, better off out.

True, however absent those structures we see the result now. There will be an almighty rush for full union by the French, I expect the German people to object to the level of fiscal transfers required, the UK should also be aware of what is coming because it will be locked into transfers too.

Markets 'in search of more stimulus' WTF. When did it become the prime responsibility on Central Banks to make the rich ever richer. Since 2008 this has been Fantasy Economics. Alchemy couldn't work because base metal to gold was impossible, also even if you could do it the gold would become worthless. These digital alchemists will learn the lesson but bring about catastrophe in the process.

The fatal error is to assume that low or zero rates will do anything other than produce a house price or other forms of asset bubble. The reality is that most people woke up after 2008 and realised that getting into debt was a bad idea, unless they really had to (e.g to buy a house). The coupled with falling real wages in many countries (in the UK overall people are still worse off now than in 2007) means people are unwilling or unable to spend their way out of deflation. Also companies will not invest as other core indicators, e.g. shipping freight, oil and commodity prices are all following which points to real demand falling.

it is similar to the use of cortisone in an inflammation. It cures at the surface, but it not removes the cause.Then slowly the side effects come and you need a transplant of the kidney....The unbalanced debt and fiscal policies, the productivity gap counted as a whole competitive power of the different states involved, the cost effectiveness as when we count the whole of the State organisation ,is different between the Eurozone States and this gap is mirrored in the deficit of the each state.You know, deficit equals private net spending, but with the flaw of the badly organized system...So the simplest solution should be the helicopter money, giving cash directly to everyone. Giving cash directly avoids the QE smear and spread cortisone effect. But here we come to the strange paradox. Why are the German population, voters, the Germans , in majority opposed to get direct cash in their pockets? The proof is, they always vote and support the ruling politic class or tend to support subjects as AFD, which are the most opposed to such ideas.The Austerity law, embedded in the psyche...The strange embedded protestant ethics someone is using as a demagogic tool for the oligarchy interest, but the German voters have not yet been able to see through this tricks...And by taking cash from the Money God, the Germans will accomplish the famous economic goals and the exports and the cost of labor will not suffer minimally.strange world...Witchdoctor

The EU policy on the Euro does not make sense.The ECB is supposed to be a central bank, but policy is determined by the Commissars behind the scenes and the agenda not divulged, except in the execution of it.QE to stimulate demand is just bullshit.It is meant to give the privileged more money for nothing, while austerity and zero hour contracts ensure people keep cutting their spending, even if they have money to spare.This is obvious and they know full well.The entire monetary regime is designed to soak the lower three quintiles of the population.

It is interesting to hear him speak about the threat of deflation as if that is the end of the world.....no one asked him about the fact that oil is now up 30% in a month and how quickly he can reverse course....he said rates will stay low for longer....how does he know what is coming....his predictions are just guesses....inflation ticks up and this is all over.....the credibility of the italian printer meddler is low and falling.

Better articulated than my own effort, Germany has no need of more but will do so anyway!, hence the other countries locked with Germany in the Euro have no chance to achieve competitive parity, none, ever.

As per mine - what you describe is not exclusive to Italy, Britain, Germany, France... but it is pan-Europe. In Italy as you say 30 - 40 years - Germany I´d estimate 25 - 30 years - but yes it is a slow erosion - what I call seeping austerity - that simply goes under the radar until the place is flooded and hells bells too late!

The point is that Germany has austerity and there is more to come. It may not be the tsunami type we see battering some countries. But is the austerity that seaps from quietly up from the floorboards.

One should by now get the hint that the absurd house of cards can't continue to prop the 2nd currency, the €uro as it is; that all forced fiscal intervention that the ECB has tried to do has flopped; the least the editor could do is to present Draghi as a daguerreotype picture as his glory days are passed. Revert back to individual currencies ? Portugal, Italy etc will be at the wall as they won't get any central prop-up anymore. One can only visualize the adjustment phase on investment portfolios will be quite a fantastic jiggle.

It's all too clever for me to understand, but I get the idea that the Eurozone is like an old car with failing brakes that desperate attempts to keep safe by tightening this and that have so far proved unsuccessful.

The story of the EU and the ECB can only be understood if one accepts that the clique which controls the EU and the ECB are deliberately steering for a collapse of civil order so as to have an excuse to do away with democratic sovereign nation-states altogether.

It's inflation rate hovers around 0.0%. Would you push it in to deflation? It's perfect for Ireland. Heavily indebted mortgage holders, many in negative equity have easy repayment terms and can get on with their lives. House prices are being kept steady by a Central bank requirement to have a 20% deposit.
