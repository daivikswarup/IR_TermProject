Hinkley Point branded potentially risky for EDF by French auditor




DateTime::::2016-03-11T09:29:18+0000



<p>EDF’s £18bn project to build nuclear reactors in Britain is potentially risky for the state-owned utility, whose foreign investments in recent years have proved disappointing, France’s top public auditor has said. <br/></p>

<p> In a report on EDF’s international strategy, the Cour des Comptes – the French equivalent of the UK’s National Audit Office – said EDF and its 85% state shareholding should take a close look at the risks associated with the project to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset.</p>

<p> The report, which focuses on the 2009-2014 period – which includes EDF’s October 2013 agreement with the British government but not <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed">its deal in October 2015 with the Chinese utility CGN</a> to take a one-third stake – said the financing around the Hinkley Point deal was potentially risky for EDF.</p>

<p> The auditor said EDF’s cashflow and high debt limit its capacity to invest abroad, especially given the huge sums needed to upgrade its ageing French nuclear plants.</p>

<p> “Even though the [Hinkley Point] deal has not been finalised, the complexity of the deal and especially the way it could impact the responsibility of EDF suffice to raise serious questions,” the auditor said.</p>

<p> The warning comes days after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns">EDF’s chief financial officer resigned</a> over worries about the firm’s ability to finance the project and after unions warned that the project is a risk to EDF’s very survival.</p>

<p>However, there was some good news on Thursday for EDF’s Hinkley project, with EU anti-trust regulators clearing the French firm’s proposed partnership with CGN. </p>

<p>“The [European] Commission’s investigation found that competition in the wholesale supply of electricity in the UK will not be hindered by the transaction given the moderate market share of EDF, the very limited market shares of CGN in this market and the presence of other competitors,” the commission said in an email sent to AFP.</p>

<p> In 2013, EDF had planned to take a minority stake in the Hinkley Point project, but CGN only agreed to take a one-third stake.</p>

<p> This forced EDF to shoulder two-thirds of the project to build two Areva-designed European Pressurised Reactors (EPR) in Britain. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/no-legally-binding-contract-18bn-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-edf-china">Four other EPRs under construction in Finland, France, and China are years behind schedule and billions over budget.</a></p>

<p>“[These delays] make one wonder whether Hinkley Point can respect its deadlines,” the auditor said, adding that if the project runs over budget, EDF would be responsible for the cost.<br/></p>

<p> The auditor said the focus on nuclear in EDF’s foreign investments was a way to preserve its skill base at home, which it said was acceptable, as long as this was not more a defensive than an offensive stance.</p>

<p> EDF wants to renew its ageing nuclear plants in a decade from now, but needs to build reactors abroad to sustain the French nuclear industry at home.</p>

<p> The auditor also said the firm’s renewable energy unit EDF EN had a “marginal” and “peripheral” place within the firm and that EDF had been slow to invest in energy services.</p>

<p> It said EDF and its energy services unit Dalkia – which it acquired two years ago – had different corporate cultures and that synergies needed to be built.</p>

<p>The auditor said EDF’s rate of return (core earnings over revenue) on foreign projects was just 12% in 2014, compared with 30.6% in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a>, and had been falling since 2009.</p>

My fiesta hasn't broken down (yet) in 150k....The cost of a mobile crane with a triple extension and crew is not cheap to hire, compared to a vehicle that can be fixed with a screwdriver and spanner on the spot. The viability of having these towering windfarm structures, that are virtually inaccessible without resorting to heavy plant ? I doubt it very much..

In our previous discussion I could you in a lie. IN fact private nuclear companies are gifted a highly limited liability - with the UK taxpayer taking on Unlimited liability. That's the mother of all subsidies.

It was a rip off deal for the UK tax payer anyway, every single expert has said it would be cheaper to build the new plants ourself and much safer instead of having Chinese components in our nuclear plants.

Everybody is lying in the sector of energy anyway, nuclear and anti-nuclear as well as deniers, politicians, etcNobody knows the cost of extending the life of old nuclear plants and nobody knows the cost of dismantling them (and nobody wants the parts of dismantled nuclear plants to be stored near his home). Alternative power sources provide irregular supply and only work in a grid in conjunction with conventional plants which are obviously very expensive because they don't operate full time at nominal capacityAnd to add to the complexity power has to be bought to countries that use our money to destroy us, that is Saudi Arabia and RussiaIs it better to buy gas to Putin or to use nuclear power ?

Cleaning up a weapons programme that then provided us with a technology that has currently supplied us with low CO2 electricity for half a century is now costing £100 per household per annum to clean up? It's the bargain of the century.

The future is solar. Only the UK government now seems unaware of this. Perhaps industry will use the obscenely priced nuclear electricity, domestic users will not have to because home micro-power generation will be the norm within 20 years.

This country invented nuclear power and was a world leader until not that long ago. BE was sold off to the French and a bit went to BG I think. Its common practice. The British once lead on space rocket technology but err sold it to the French where their own system had failed....then there was the jet (the worlds first) engined Comet built in Britain but err had design faults and crashed and with it the program. And graphene...that wonder material discovered in Manchester but err has not registered much interest in UK Plc because there's so few companies in this field alive and well in UK today. This means that patent applications for graphene products total hundreds (even thousands) in South Korea but err in UK its a sorry couple of dozen.

In this context it's worth pointing out how much dealing with spent nuclear fuel is already costing the nation and will cost the nation in years to come: £2.5bn a year, of which £1.6bn is spent on cleaning up Sellafield. 2.5 billion pounds a year!
