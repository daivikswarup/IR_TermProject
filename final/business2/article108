John Lewis to shut canteens and introduce longer shifts for drivers

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis">John Lewis</a> is planning to shut staff canteens and introduce longer shifts for hundreds of delivery drivers as part of efforts to cut costs and modernise its business.</p>

<p>New contracts, which are currently under discussion, will also include a contractual requirement to work on Sundays and Bank Holidays if required. The John Lewis depots currently don’t operate on those days, and the company said there was no immediate plan to change that.</p>

<p>The changes emerged as the retail group is expected to reveal another cut in its staff bonus this year to around 9%, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonus-to-lowest-level-for-12-years">from 11% in 2015</a>, after a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/10/john-lewis-profits-fall-amid-higher-costs-and-competition">period of tough trading for its Waitrose supermarket chain and a hit from higher pension charges</a>. John Lewis staff, known as partners, receive a share of profits every year and own the company via a trust.<br/></p>

<p>Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said he expected annual pretax profits at the group to drop to about £300m from £343m last year. </p>

<p>The cuts will affect about 700 drivers, who deliver to homes from 20 delivery hubs around the country. </p>

<p>John Lewis is also reviewing the position of dozens of admin staff at the hub and once source said the company might consider centralising their role at head office.</p>

<p>Less than 40 staff who work in canteens at the hubs are already in consultation about job losses. The canteens will be replaced by vending machines and other self-service equipment.</p>

<p>The cut reflects a similar move by Asda, which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/20/asda-axe-morning-cuppa-free-toast-staff">is consulting on the closure of about 350 staff canteens in its stores and planning to axe free tea and toast for staff in a further 230 outlets</a>.</p>

<p>In a briefing document for drivers seen by the Guardian, John Lewis said the planned changes would create 50% more delivery slots on Mondays and Saturdays, and cut “unproductive time” for drivers, helping the retailer save £6m a year.</p>

<p>It said the introduction of seven-day contracts would mean John Lewis could deliver on Sundays in future and spread resources more evenly across the week.</p>

<p>One driver affected by the changes said: “I love my job but these changes could make it really difficult to pick up the kids from school. Someone sitting in a comfy office has said let’s change these hours. Customers will think this is not the John Lewis I know.”<br/></p>

<p>He said the rota changes also reduced the potential for earning overtime pay which many drivers currently use to top up their income . He said some delivery drivers were paid close to the minimum wage.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>A spokeswoman for John Lewis said: “Customers increasingly want flexible shopping and delivery times. As a result, we are talking to our driver partners about changing their working patterns to work fewer days in a week but more hours in a day. We believe the changes will meet the needs of our customers better. </p>

<p>“We do not take any decision to change our partners working practices lightly. We have engaged our partners through the Partnership’s democratic channels, and have had many positive responses.</p>

Well yes. It costs about £15 to pick, pack and deliver a home-delivered grocery order. The price customers are currently willing to pay for this fifteen quid's worth of primarily labour costs is £1-£2. Aldi and Lidl simply don't have the margins to make that pay. (Nor, actually, do the other grocers, but that's a different story.)

Actually it's in line with consumers vile refusal to pay delivery charges that reflect the actual delivery cost when they purchase online.

Your belief that thinness is a goal is mistaken - healthiness is something which we should all aspire to and good diet (including access to quality foods in a pleasant environment is part of this). Thinness, if anything, is a by-product - obesity is a killer and damages personal health and the economy.

This is in line with this vile government's long term plan for workers to be compelled to work seven days a week for next to nothing and with no workers' rights.

I don't disagree that a proper canteen is infinitely preferable to gobbling down a sandwich at your desk, but that's because it improves morale and makes employees feel valued, not because it will help them achieve the be-all and end-all goal that is being thin. Never mind that the sandwiches many of my colleagues eat seem to be insipid, uninspiring things with all the nutritional value of the cardboard packaging they came in, menu options at the canteens of which I have experience have tended toward the side of hearty portions and traditional fare - certainly not bits of lettuce and ryvita for the skinny minnie miserablists to pat one another on the back for not having eaten. When did being thin become of such overriding, overaching importance that it trumps all other considerations anyway?

Maybe John Lewis is too ethical for their own good. In other words, they're paying the tax they should when some main competitors fully exploit tax loopholes tantamount to robbery. Either these loopholes are closed and every corporation pays the tax they should, or John Lewis needs to get with the program.

They probably avoid paying tax too. Aldi is also famed for having up to 100% horsemeat in 'beef' products a few years ago. Don't recall waitrose being caught up in that scandal.

The Partnership was always held up as a fair employer who really looked after the staff. (Partner does not mean anything today, as they have no power. Democracy has all but disappeared) The Founder, Spedan Lewis, had a vision for his stores. This vision has died. Shame on you Charlie Mayfield and Andy Street!

Life is alot simpler than you think. A sandwich box with homemade sarnies. ...cheap and nutritious.....is not the death knell of workers health in my world. They do not swoon and faint without a canteen.

Supermarkets make huge sales on online home delivery but margins must be tight. It's all about market share and levels of productivity rather than profit.

Nope, you can't 'blame' the consumer.We ask for Fair Trade to mean just that.The company could turn the thermostat down a couple of C's inside its stores without damaging anyone's welfare. It could also eschew the terrible research treadmill which computers permit, deliberately selecting only those shelf goods appealing to high-end customers. The reasonably priced items gradually disappear, while those of us concerned about things like fair trade, value for money, traceable sourcing, and recyclable packaging get sidelined.

No, VSLVSL has a very good point. I'm old enough to remember when almost every workplace had it's own canteen or dining rooms. When the lunch hour really was an hour. Time enough to sit down with your colleagues, partake of a freshly cooked nutritious meal with knife and fork plus dessert and coffee and then take a walk outdoors before returning refreshed and nourished to your afternoon's work. So much more productive than drones gobbling sandwiches at their desks in a quick "break".

Fair point, though I somehow don't think this is coming from the people who will be affected by it... But my point was that saying the market (consumers) will protect us and unions won't is very naive, it just perpetuates the kind of culture and thinking that is taking away the canteens in the first place.

Well, homes are very expensive to deliver as they weigh many tons and the plastic bag charge would also be enormous.

Bollocks - frankly.Most of us have to work unsociable hours in this new world people seem to believe they can ignore. Should somebody in Australia wish to see me at 9am on a Monday, that's a 9am pickup from my house on a Saturday before 24 hours of scum-class travel.But then it all comes down to what you consider sociable hours to be - I personally am not a morning person, with a job - so have not bought anything from one before midday for maybe a decade or so.Maybe more specifically, wtf is the point of opening a shop Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm, when your potential customers are working?Any of my local shops would sell more to me if they opened 5-8pm so I could pop in on the way home (the alternative is clicking amazon from my desk, and getting it delivered free next day).Massively altering retail hours would be a boon for many - can drop your children at school and then pick them up, before I rock up wanting to buy anything.

Their minuscule margin model barely allows for it on a stand alone basis, but it helps that they're both privately owned by billionaires ie not shareholders, and in extremis could afford to if necessary.

Supermarkets are always going to struggle to make money out of home delivery. They're all locked in a race to the bottom and I'm sure there will be many more cuts and even some possible casualties, particularly now bottomless pocketed, 'annihilate the competition at all costs' Amazon is getting in on the act.
