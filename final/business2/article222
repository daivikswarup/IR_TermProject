No legally binding contract in £18bn Hinkley Point nuclear project




DateTime::::2016-03-09T19:32:53+0000



<p>The energy company behind the Hinkley Point nuclear project has still not signed off a contract with its Chinese partner that is needed for the £18bn plant to go ahead.</p>

<p>EDF Energy and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) reached an <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed">outline deal that was unveiled last October by David Cameron</a> during a state visit by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. But five months on the companies have not finalised the agreement, amid growing doubts over EDF’s commitment to the project.</p>

<p>When the outline deal was announced, the French state-owned power company said construction work could begin within weeks. However, it has now emerged that the delay in EDF taking the final investment decision on Hinkley is not just because of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edfs-hinkley-point-dilemma-adds-to-project-woes">well-publicised financing concerns in France</a>, but also because there is no legally binding contract with Beijing.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-what-you-need-to-know-nuclear-power-station">Hinkley Point C: what you need to know about the nuclear power project</a> </p>

<p>The French energy company has found it has taken longer than expected to do due diligence on state-owned CGNPC’s ability to make its £6bn contribution to the Somerset power scheme. </p>

<p>“The complexity of the issue is hard to imagine. There are dozens of different legal agreements and literally thousands of pages,” said one nuclear industry source. </p>

<p>The source added that the agreements also apply to projects at Sizewell and Bradwell. EDF has brought CGNPC into a post-Hinkley deal for a new reactor at Sizewell in Suffolk and plans to help the company construct its Chinese-designed reactors at Bradwell in Essex.</p>

<p>The delays are said to have been prolonged by breaks for Christmas and Chinese new year but sources said EDF was close to reaching a final legal deal that both sides can sign off on. EDF declined to comment.</p>

<p>However, the hold-up comes as EDF is still trying to convince the French government it has enough cash to meet the €1.8bn annual payments it needs for Hinkley – even with the Chinese taking a 33% stake.</p>

<p>Last week the EDF finance director, Thomas Piquemal, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/hinkley-investment-decision-soon-says-edf-chief-after-finance-director-resigns">resigned from the company</a> amid reports he could not support the project going ahead for at least three years until EDF’s finances were in better shape.</p>

<p>Despite the upheaval, and the firm opposition to Hinkley from trade union members of the EDF board, the company is attempting to deliver final approval at the start of April.</p>

<p>But a procession of deadlines for the scheme, which if built could provide 7% of Britain’s electricity, have come and gone. And many in the City of London believe the project will never happen because it is too expensive for the British consumer who will eventually end up paying back EDF via energy bills.</p>

<p>Hinkley Point is a flagship policy for the Conservative government at a time when other energy initiatives have been foundering and there are increasing concerns that the lights will go out. </p>

<p>Sir Ed Davey, the former energy secretary, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/09/hinkley-nuclear-power-project-good-deal-ed-davey">who negotiated a much-criticised subsidy regime</a> for the power generated by Hinkley, said the Conservatives would have been willing to pay even more than he agreed. The government will pay £92.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley electricity, which at the time of the CNGPC announcement was double the UK wholesale price. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/07/finally-someone-at-edf-sees-the-18bn-farce-that-is-hinkley-point">Finally, someone at EDF sees the £18bn farce that is Hinkley Point</a> </p>

<p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Davey said: “They [the Conservatives] were gagging for nuclear. George Osborne in particular was wanting to have Chinese investment, big infrastructure projects to show off to the Tory backbenchers. It was me saying ‘I’m going to walk away from this deal if we don’t do what we promised parliament’, and that meant we had to get the price down to below £90 per megawatt hour, which I did.”</p>

<p>The government disputes Davey’s account of events. A government source told the Times that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4708806.ece">Conservative ministers lost faith in Davey’s negotiating skills</a> and insisted on Treasury involvement in the deal.</p>

<p>But Davey pointed out that negotiations in 2013 were led by his permanent secretary at the energy department. He said: “My permanent secretary was the person I appointed to run it, and he worked with the Treasury because the Treasury were involved. But I was the one who was prepared to walk away.”</p>

I don't think you have a clue what you are talking about. My reference to RR and BAE was about us not having the capability. If government sets up a new Nuclear build agency then like other governments, you go to the experts across industry and universities. RR has experience with nuclear, they are researching small mobile nuclear power plants, BAE have top engineers. You put the best together and let them brain storm and design.

Of course £90 per megawatt is expensive, but then so was the £130 per megawatt quoted for the Swansea Bay project.

It's not as bad as coal, but yes, it needs to go. Get insulating and investing in nuclear. Renewables are OK but need to be deployed carefully or they just lock in more fossil fuel usage.

Wasn't referring the technology they use. the point i was making was the tories are against the state doing or owning anything yet they have to go to state owned EDF and chinese nuclear power and ask them to build our nuclear power stations and it will cost more than if we did it ourselves.

You can't be aware of the capabilities of Integral Fast Reactors (IFRs) in dealing with - what you call - nuclear waste.

Last night I was wondering whether, to save money, they would skimp on safety checks during the build phase and give us a real-life repeat of the unchecked/defective welds in 'The China Syndrome' which led to the (fictional) melt-down in that film. And then I read your comment. *Gulp*

Why does Ed Davey bang on about getting a price under £90 when the price quoted in the article is £92.50? It seems as though he is essentially saying that he went into the negotiations with one aim and completely failed to achieve it

Because it's index linked. When it was negotiated originally it was below £90

A good article on Areva's conduct at Flamanville was published by the Telegraph - which has long been supportive of Nuclear power, and whose journalists would not dare to write unsubstantiated assertions against it.

It's £92.50 if only Hinckley gets built, but if the other two (Sizewell & Bradwell) also get built the strike price drops to £89.50.

Hydro schemes are NOT intermittent, and wave wouldn't be either. Unfortunately this Government refuses to invest in supporting research into wav, and in the past nuclear industry successfully prevented wave research. There are also tidal schemes that if set at points around the UK coast would not be intermittent. But if you are totally pro nuclear and anti renewables your blinkers prevent you from understanding this.

After the discovery of the faults, Areva instructed its foundry to go ahead and produce the vessels and caps for two Chinese reactors, and for one in America, and for the two at Hinkley. This was done using exactly the same production techniques.

Time to dust off plans for a Severn barrage? The full Brean Down-Lavernock Point barrage has been costed at roughly the same as Hinkley C, but its projected life is 2-3 times as long, with none of the vast decommissioning costs associated with a nuclear reactor. And you could run a road and railway across it, ready for when the two existing crossings crumble. Maximum output would be over 8Mw, and average about a quarter of that. The output cycle is highly predictable, so it's easy to plan for complementary generation when peak output doesn't coincide with peak demand. Finally, the whole thing could be done using British technology, labour and materials.
