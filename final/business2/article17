Ikea billionaire Ingvar Kamprad buys second-hand clothes to save money

<p>Frugal billionaire Ingvar Kamprad, founder of the flatpack furniture chain <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/ikea">Ikea</a>, buys his clothes at flea markets to save money, he has said in a documentary to be broadcast on Swedish television.<br/></p>

<p>Kamprad, who turns 90 on 30 March, has a reputation for penny-pinching, which he claims helped Ikea to become one of the world’s top brand names. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/weve-hit-peak-home-furnishings-says-ikea-boss-consumerism">We've hit peak home furnishings, says Ikea boss</a> </p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m wearing anything that wasn’t bought at a flea market. It means that I want to set a good example,” he told Swedish channel TV4, according to business daily Dagens Industri which viewed the documentary. </p>

<p>“It’s in the nature of Smaland to be thrifty,” he said, referring to Sweden’s southern agricultural region where he comes from. </p>

<p>Kamprad is estimated to have an accumulated fortune of about 610bn kroner (about ‎€65.5bn), according to recent Swedish media reports.</p>

<p>But it is difficult to separate what belongs to him, what belongs to his children and what is held in a family foundation in one of Europe’s most infamous tax havens, Liechtenstein. </p>

<p>In 2006, the American business magazine Forbes listed him as the fourth richest person in the world.</p>

<p>Kamprad’s modest spending habits have made headlines over the years. In 2008, he told newspaper Sydsvenskan that a €22 bill in the Netherlands had broken his hair cut budget.</p>

<p>“Normally, I try to get my haircut when I’m in a developing country. Last time it was in Vietnam,” Kamprad explained.</p>

<p>In 1973, he fled Sweden’s higher tax structure for Denmark, before seeking even lower taxes in Switzerland.</p>

<p>From 2010 onward, Kamprad progressively retired from the family company to make way for his three sons, finally returning to live in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden">Sweden</a> in 2014.</p>

I'm not defending IKEA as such. Just saying that someone brought it into existence, and that someone wasn't you or I. People like you and I haven't harmed anyone but we haven't particularly benefited anyone either, except maybe our immediate employer through our work contribution. It's human nature to start believing that we owe everything only to ourselves - which is why all of us exploit loopholes of taxes or benefits wherever we can. I suppose billionaires aren't very different in that.As for small businesses being destroyed, yeah, that's terrible, but that's just the nature of commerce. Why are average consumers, average taxpayers all, queuing up at IKEA to buy cheap instead of paying more to support local craftsmen? IKEA simply presents an alternative; consumers are the ones who choose it over smaller businesses that put more effort into their products. And don't tell me this is to do with the present slowdown; this is nothing new. The world, unfortunately, is survival of the fittest. Fair or unfair doesn't come into it much. Humans kill millions of blameless animals because they can. Big businesses destroy small enterprises because they can. If enough number of people cared enough about these things, they'd get off their couch, start a movement, and force policy changes. But first they'd need to change themselves.

We all use tax loopholes, so we are just the same as IKEA, amazon, and sport direct eh?

They give away millions as a way direct the attention of people like you away from the fact that they net tens of billions in profits every year by destroying local small businesses and by employing workers on low wages(who each pay high income taxes) WHILE making deals with your government to ensure that only pay a very small percentage in taxes, like 2% or under.

Maybe he has to save to be able to pay the penalty taxes (wishful thinking).An Irony that IKEA's furniture are not made to be reused, because of the low quality in general.http://www.newsinenglish.no/2016/02/22/ikea-loses-tax-tricks-case-in-norway/

That was a glib comment which revealed an inability to understand that, whilst thrift is a virtue, miserliness or "being cheap" is not.

Wow. At this point in his life he could, just maybe, spread the wealth? Buy lots of cool hats for poor people; Begin a clothing factory to fairly employ people; be made into stew for hungry people.

What Ikea does is suck the profits from each country out in "Licensing fees" to a separate ikea entity in Netherlands/Lichtenstein etc, where intellectually property is taxed at like nothing.Example:http://www.publishwhatyoupay.no/en/piping-profitshttp://www.publishwhatyoupay.no/nb/node/16657 (use translation engine)
