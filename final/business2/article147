Burberry jumps 5% on takeover talk but FTSE falls after Chinese data




DateTime::::2016-03-08T09:48:22+0000



<p>As markets fall back after poor Chinese export figures, <strong>Burberry</strong> is bucking the trend following reports the luxury goods group is preparing defences against a possible bid.</p>

<p>A mystery investor was reported to have built up a near 5% stake in Burberry through HSBC. The Financial Times <strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/34b6aa28-e48f-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39.html#axzz42IkIztT1">said (£)</a></strong> the move had prompted the company to ask its advisors, Robey Warshaw and Morgan Stanley, to investigate and help it fight off any takeover attempt.</p>

<p>Possible holdes of the stake could be rivals LMVH and US group Coach, private equity or an activist investor. “Burberry is one of the few luxury brands without family interest and thus an easier target for acquisition,” said Macquarie analyst Daniele Gianera told the FT.</p>

<p>Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said:</p>

<p>It appears that Burberry’s challenging trading conditions in the Asia-Pacific region which have weighed on its top line for at least 18 months and pushed the stock down 40% last year (though the shares have since recouped some of that) have attracted opportunistic interest.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/burberrygroup">Burberry</a> could amount to a prize acquisition for what we would regard as its ‘ideal’ buyer: one with the longest possible horizon with respect to Burberry’s largest non-domestic markets.</p>

<p>The reports have sent Burberry shares nearly 5% higher to £14.35, but not everyone is convinced. Analyst Nick Bubb said:<br/></p>

<p>As the so-called “mystery” HSBC stake of around 5% in Burberry has been around for some time and includes their fund management holdings, it is not clear why Burberry<strong> </strong>are on takeover alert, but the City has taken no chances and pushed the share price up.</p>

<p>Overall though, a 25% slump in Chinese exports has prompted further worries about the state of the world’s second largest economy, notwithstanding the prospect of further stimulus measures from the country’s central bank. Investors are also nervous ahead of meetings from the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 46.13 points at 6136.27 as investors cash in after recent gains.</p>

<p>Mining shares are, inevitably perhaps after the Chinese disappointment, among the leading fallers. <strong>Anglo American</strong> is down 46.7p at 581.4p while<strong> BHP Billiton</strong> has fallen 45.8p to 852p.</p>

<p><strong>Worldpay</strong> is down 18.2p at 273.7p despite the payments processing group reporting an 8% rise in full year earnings, in line with expectations.</p>

<p>But <strong>Inmarsat</strong>, a weak market after last week’s results, is up 6.5p to 934.5p after the satellite communications group announced an air traffic management contract from the European Space Agency.</p>

<p><strong>Tesco</strong> has added 5.65p to 197.45p after the latest data from Kantar Worldpanel showed a fall in the rate of its sales decline. The supermarket’s sales slipped 0.8% in the 12 weeks to the end of February compared to a 1.6% fall the previous month.</p>
