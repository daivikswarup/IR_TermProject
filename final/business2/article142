Dutton's warning of economic Armageddon under Labor is embarrassingly wrong

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>f Labor wins the upcoming federal election, “I think the economy will <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-09/dutton-says-stock-market-will-crash-under-labor's-tax-policies/7233864">come to a shuddering halt</a> and I think the stock market will crash,” Peter Dutton has said.</p>

<p>It is a significant forecast for a senior cabinet minister to make and one, which if correct, would be a major concern for domestic and foreign investors alike.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/22/support-for-turnbull-slumps-as-labor-and-coalition-deadlocked-in-newspoll">Support for Turnbull slumps as Labor and Coalition deadlocked in Newspoll</a> </p>

<p>There are, fortunately, several straightforward ways to test the immigration minister’s extreme and extraordinary claims.</p>

<p>Importantly, there needs to be an assessment of any changes in the probability of a Labor win at the next election. That must then be benchmarked against what has happened to the stock market, interest rate futures and the value of the Australian dollar over the time the election probabilities have changed.</p>

<p>If Dutton’s warning has any credibility, if Labor is judged to be more likely to win the election, one would see, with certainty, share prices fall, expectations for future interest rate cuts increase and the value of the Australian dollar fall.</p>

<p>Let’s look first at recent trends in the probability of a Labor win in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>On 22 February, Newspoll showed Labor moving from six points behind the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/22/support-for-turnbull-slumps-as-labor-and-coalition-deadlocked-in-newspoll">break even at 50-50</a>. This line-ball reading for the major parties was confirmed in the next Newspoll and in recent Essential Research polls.</p>

<p>Coincidently, the election betting markets have also showed a move towards Labor in the last few weeks. Labor’s odds of winning the election are now $5.00, which is in from $6.50 just before the 50-50 Newspoll, while the Coalition’s election-winning odds have widened from $1.11 to $1.17.<br/></p>

<p class="pullquote-paragraph">With the polls and betting markets showing a clear move towards Labor in the past few weeks, stocks are up</p>

<p>While the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition">Coalition</a> is still favoured, the odds of a Labor election win and, if Dutton is correct, a stalled economy and a stock market crash have increased in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Making a mockery of Dutton’s claim is the fact that stocks are going up, the prospects for further interest rate cuts have receded and the Australian dollar has risen very strongly. This is the polar opposite of what one would see in the reaction of financial markets if a stalled economy and stock market crash was about to unfold.</p>

<p>Let’s look at stocks first. The ASX200 index has risen by more than 3% since the day before the initial 50-50 Newspoll was released. While many factors have influenced this solid upswing in stock prices, the greater likelihood of a Labor election victory has not driven investors away from the ASX.</p>

<p>At the same time, the implied yield on interest rate futures has risen by approximately 15 to 20 basis points (depending on which timeframe is placed on the market pricing), which means the market is now less convinced that interest rate cuts will be needed over the next six to 18 months. In other words, the market pricing is increasingly priced for a stronger economy over the medium term, even as Labor’s chances of winning the election have materially improved.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/19/labors-negative-gearing-reform-proposal-is-economically-responsible-and-fair">Labor's negative gearing reform proposal is economically responsible and fair</a> </p>

<p>Now for the Australian dollar. The AUD was trading around US$0.7150 prior to the first 50-50 poll and was 61.4 on a trade-weighted index (TWI). Now, at the time of writing, the AUD has risen to US$0.7500 and about 64 TWI.</p>

<p>With the polls and betting markets showing a clear and unarguable move towards Labor in the past few weeks, stocks are up strongly, the extent of future interest rate cuts has been scaled back and the Australian dollar has risen. These are the simple facts.</p>

<p>For many reasons, Dutton is embarrassingly wrong. But don’t take my word for it, look at the assessment of global investors and financial market trends, where hundreds of billions of Australian dollars’ worth of bonds, stocks and foreign exchange have traded in the last few weeks. Investors have been buying into Australian assets with gusto, which perhaps, coincidently, has occurred at the same time as Labor’s election prospects have improved.</p>

Sad that we have such moronic numbskulls (Dutton, Pyne, etc) running what is a complex organisation - Australia and its society and economy. It is even more galling that we pay these clowns only to watch them act as ignorant buffoons. Case in point is the governments mickey mouse and laughable innovation initiative.

Always the extreme with the L-NP. I think something is going on with the economy anyway, no matter who is or will be in government, but the ALP have experience with their handling of the GFC, and I trust them better to manage our country.

Not forgetting Labor's 'mess' during the GFC which was praised around the world, and saw every economic indicator higher than the LNP's recent economic 'success'. 'In the land of the LNP nong, where the cows go bong, and everything down is up, everything bad is good, and every lie is true.'Every time I hear a right-wing polly speak in recent years, my bs-ometer now goes psycho....

"the economy will come to a shuddering halt and I think the stock market will crash" could well happen but not because Labor might win. It might happen because the whole financial world is in a bit of a mess, no matter who wins the next election.

Peter Dutton is not known s the brainiest person in the Government. His concerns about Labor's competence with the economy, is nearly as good a recommendation for the Opposition as a criticism by Tony Abbott.

Several enquiries and several inquests have squarely laid the responsibilities for those deaths at the feet of the company directors, who inadequately tooled, neglected to train their staff, breached WHS, and sent staff into live roof spaces against standard safe practices. Each house has a main switch in the switch board, which would have isolated the house and made them safe. All these beaches of safety for a quick buck. We've aren't you complaining about them?

The reason that Turnbull did not get rid of this complete loser is because the LNP is infested with idiots and the bottom of the barrel is the best that they have. That and he sold is soul, whatever dignity and reputation he might have had and agreed to anything he had to to get the support of enough of the loonie rights to get the job of PM. In this case there never was a more true saying in "be careful what you wish for". I doubt even Turnbull could have expected it to go so pear shaped in such a short period of time. But that is what you get when you take integrity and honesty out of the equation to get power.

Not saying it's the same P Dutton, but a simarly named Sydney Uni student gained notoriety for attempting sex with an Alsation one drunken night on campus.Apparently, a number of hysterical students alerted a local priest, who strode barefoot onto the Uni's frosty sportsground and discharged a shotgun in an attempt to force a young Peter to reluctantly dismount the beast.

Steven Koukoulas. I hope your correct , lets hope the public have collective amnesia. You should have included a section whitewashing the pink batt saga 4 dead, $1000 cheques sent to dead people, & school halls, plus Australia,s cash rate of 2% is high by world standards,some overseas banks now charge up to- 5% to park your money with them This is bigger than labor Australia looks good which is more than i can say for the LNP who should come down hard on Clive Palmer.................john

I agree wholeheartedly. And you had a post in response to one of mine elsewhere, of which the forum has been closed, so couldn't reply, because I'm really slow, so here's my response:Naomi Klein's 'Shock Doctrine': Yes, a real eye-opener. Contemporary analysis getting a bit long in the tooth (though no less valid) but totally enlightening for the seminal Neoliberal experiments in Chile, etc. Picketty, ha, me neither read it. Have just ordered it and am looking forward to seeing whether it could be the fulcrum for some change. Plus have been browsing David Harvey. I'm going to chase down more of his writings. Cheers.
