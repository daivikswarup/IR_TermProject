Wall Street bonuses fell 9% in 2015 to average of $146,200 after profits decline

<p>Wall Street bonuses fell 9% to an average of $146,200 in 2015, driven down by a “challenging year in the financial markets” and new regulations, according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.</p>

<p>The decline in the banking bonuses was the result, in large part, of a 10.5% decline in profits on Wall Street to $14.3bn in 2015, according to the report from the watchdog.</p>

<p>The figures reflect <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/09/wall-street-bankers-year-end-bonuses-drop">a steady decline in bonuses</a> since the financial crisis in 2008 and the implementation of new controls on how bonuses are awarded. “This was the third consecutive year of lower profits,’’ DiNapoli said of the financial industry, a major driver of New York’s economy.</p>

<p>According to the DiNapoli, Wall Street’s total bonus pool for 2015 came to $25bn, down 6% from 2014 and 27% lower than the peak in 2006, when the average bonus hit $191,360.</p>

<p>The falls reflect the added number of employees banks have taken on related to compliance requirements and signal the costs of higher capital requirements and boosting returns to shareholders. </p>

<p>The entire financial sector is reporting tougher trading environments as the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/china-imports-slump-20-amid-falling-commodity-prices-and-weak-demand">slowdown in China and drop in commodity prices</a> take their toll. </p>

<p>“Because of the markets being down, we have to assume that some of those options being exercised now are of less value than they were a year or two ago,” DiNapoli said.</p>

<p>Last year, five of the six major Wall Street banks saw their stock prices sink – with Morgan Stanley <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/19/morgan-stanley-profits-fall-42">falling the furthest</a>, down 18%. Many banks are implementing deeper than usual culls on underperforming workers, and moving backroom jobs from metropolitan areas such as New York and New Jersey to regional cities such as Salt Lake City and Dallas, or offshore altogether. </p>

<p>The fall is bad news for New York. Some 17.5% of state revenue, or $12.5bn, comes from the financial industry<strong>, </strong>mostly through income taxes.</p>

<p>The real estate and luxury goods markets, which typically enjoy an uptick in business at bonus time, will also be nervously watching to see how the fall will impact their businesses. DiNapoli said he did not hold out much hope of improvement this year, given <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/gathering-storm-for-global-economy-as-markets-lose-faith">“ongoing weaknesses in the global economy and market volatility”</a>.</p>

Banking is the only job where you can crash the world economy and still get a six or seven figure bonus at the end of the year. Why aren't a few of these malefactors in jail?

jokes aside, a 9% cut in pay is painful, whether you are making $6/hr or $1000/hr

Their incomes fell from $1,000,000 to $910,000?That makes me feeeel soooooo good even though not one extra dime went into my pocket.But serves those blood suckers right! They'll have to drink a cheap $2,000 Bordeaux!

"Average" gives us some info. "Median" would give us more. Quartiles or quintiles even more. I guess that those that wrote the article either don't understand descriptive statistics or didn't have any addition information.

It's still ridiculous. Wall street produces nothing. They buy and sell securities using free money from the government (was 0% interest for years). When they screw the pooch by conducting illegal activities, we bail them out with taxpayer money.

The "average " bonus number tells us very little. The big boys get huge bonuses that can be many millions of dollars. Those at the bottom get far less than the $146K average.

Why compare a pre-tax bonus with a post-tax salary?$146k after supplemental tax is $109,500, the average take-home salary in the US is $42,433. So about 2.6X, not 4.5X.

146k that's about 4.5 time more than the average take home wage.. and that was just a bonus....no wonder the economy is this far out of wack

Yes, how right you are to call attention to the hierarchic range of this bonus scheme from "execs" down to the "support staff" peons. An article in Barron's or The Wall Street Journal (that is researched via something greater than two sources) could have a small table acknowledging the reduced bonus level down the payscale, or at least passing reference to the variable impact contingent on the employee positions in a banking corporation. This is a quick report on the internet, written by someone who uses "falls" where "decreases" would be a better word, and gave the average just as presented by comptroller DiNapoli.

For the love of God, and basic journalistic practice, please stop publishing 'averages'. Basically the real 'bankers' and execs had their bonuses reduces from $3m or $4m and the back office and support staff got theirs reduced from $10,000 to zero.

Hillary Clinton was paid 225,000 for one 2013 speech, or 1.37 x the average 164,530 bonus .
