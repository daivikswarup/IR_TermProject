Greece bailout: eurozone inspectors to review reforms




DateTime::::2016-03-07T19:08:12+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/eurozone">Eurozone</a> inspectors of Greece’s bailout have been cleared to return to Athens to complete a much-delayed review of the government’s adherence to its economic reform commitments.</p>

<p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the eurozone’s top official, said there was “enough common ground” between the two sides for the inspectors to return to the Greek capital as soon as Tuesday. <br/></p>

<p>However, he said the Greek government had more work to do if the review was to be favourable, notably on plugging a budget hole and deepening certain reforms.</p>

<p>A successful review of the reforms that were demanded <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/13/greece-bailout-agreement-key-points-grexit">in the country’s latest €80bn (£62bn) bailout programme</a> is needed to release more rescue loans and pave the way for discussions on how to reduce Greece’s debt burden. Dijsselbloem confirmed the debt discussions would be forthcoming.</p>

<p>Separately, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Monday that <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/cyprus">Cyprus</a> had ended the IMF-leg of a three-year rescue programme a week ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>Christine Lagarde hailed Cyprus for delivering “an impressive turnaround of the economy” in the past three years. She said the Cypriot economy grew again last year, the banking system was on a more solid footing, spending was in check and public debt was shrinking.</p>

<p>But she said Cyprus needed to stick to reforms in light of continued volatility in international markets.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/25/cyprus-bailout-deal-at-a-glance">Cyprus received €1bn from the IMF and another €9bn from its eurozone partners</a> in March 2013 in a rescue deal that forced a grab of uninsured savings in its two largest banks and led to the closure of the smaller lender.</p>

Are you another Greek dumwit abandoning the sinking ship? Geography has nothing to do with responsibility of being a EU member and living up to obligations under the Dublin agreement. The trouble with you demagogues is you look for excuses to beg for more money, not for ways to get results.

The last thing I need is a lecture from a dumwit. Statistics - you mean Greek statistics? Islands - maybe you should not have the islands if you cannot control them? On a serious note, once all migrants are locked in Greece, we will see if there is another response, and we will ask, why didn't you do so before, Eingrein.

The Eurozone has no deficit or surplus recycling mechanism. That is the problem. Imagine if UK London government did recycle money back to Wales. Wales would be in the same situation as Greece.

Corruption in greece pervades everyday life. Who can claim that poor or poorer people are not corrupt? Corruption is not the privilege of the rich.

Search for the 'why' first. A long diatribe doesn't explain the alleged and debatable poverty of greeks. Another example, corruption: three greek prime ministers (if I am not mistaken) called directly or indirectly their people corrupt. One of them 'to the bone' and the current one said something about 'money under the table' in that pitiful conversation with 'master' Clinton.

Inspectors will review greek reforms? What reforms? I understand when greeks talk about reforms they mean more taxes. They either do not wish to implement reforms or they do not know how to do the job. Or a bit of both. European institutions have had similar experience with the last Bulgarian government (a melee of socialists, communists, turkish, etc. ). Bulgaria had become more of a failed state, corruption etc. They know what to do with greece too. No doubt greeks will shout 'murder' and do nothing much again. Laziness of body follows laziness of mind.

Dont forget Turkish invasion, German-italian invasion. Dont forget that Germany still owes money to Greece for the loots they had. The destruction they caused in their last invasion. Oh yes and dont forget Britain that their museums are full of stolen Greek art and statues. All we got from the so called European union was to been stolen, raped financially and been humiliated. Its ok θα γυρίσει ο τροχός

Here we go again mostly all coments are a huge complaint about Greeks stealing pennies from UK and been lazy as we have been called from Germans , when most of them are living under job seekers allowance, housing benefits, child supports, and the foreigners in the end working for them. While Greeks can claim 0 benefits, have 0 health insurance coverage, at least 25% unemployment, no hope for the future...And we get insulted because all of your "respected" governments cooked with "our respected" government everything so we will be minus financially. And in the end we go rescue immigrants from the sea and all we asked is your support. Seriously do you really think we like how we live? Or facing death everyday? Do we like to swim with dead bodies in the summer? Stop been delusional. At least we help them. Full time job doesnt exist here but yet we give them some food and clothes. Our salaries ended up been like 240 euros per month and thats if you are lucky to even find a part time job after many months of job hunting. Where do you get the idea that we are superb? How much you could possibly steal from taxes when annually you get 4500 euros at most cases???? Do you really think we will let those poor people from Syria, Afghanistan, irak to die in a suicide mission? No.matter whats their religion or if he is economical refugee or war refugee..? By trying to keep children and family alive is the best thing you can do. No matter if he is from Eu or he is From middle east. He is a human being l. We are humans and the only thing that left for us to have is sympathy, respect and compassion for every human being. Do you believe we enjoy all this? Did we attacked their countries and because of us they coming on EU? I am ashamed that I am called European but before you guys could even say a word about Greece you better bleach your mouth first. All I see is misery... Not because we are poor... But because we are proud people and all of you insulting everything we do and evwrything we are. Try to come on our side as a civil Greek and stop talking nonsense regarding all of us just because for the last decade every politician stole money. Who ever comes to rule this country he will fail. Because the thiefs stole everything and from 5 milion people who work for 240 euros per month you cant pay billions. We pay rents, food, electricity, and doctors here. We dont earn them as a gift through benefit scheme like u ok?

Greece is being raped by the ECB and the IMF and her power elite politician traitors - and all she gets in the press is that she deserved this in the first place and that the Germans think the Greeks are lazy.

Greece could not service its debt long before austerity measures were taken, because the state was bankrupt. Many Greeks passionately complain about austerity measures, but you could have left the Euro and even the EU and go bankrupt for real instead of relying on the EU drip and being stuck in a system that obviously doesn't suit you. In the beginning of this crisis it would have been easier to save Greece with radical decisions. But Greece still hoped to fall on soft cushions with the help of their EU partners who are called your worst enemies very quickly if they do not sugar coat reality for you. Do the world a favour and stop lying to yourselves collectively.

Greece don't have any bargaining power like Turkey. Border is closed from Balkan side. Greece cannot thrown the people over the fence. They will be holding ground and they can do nothing about it. They can threaten to veto every decision in EU, that is all.

As usual you are missing the always neglected incentive to debt : corruption, and you condemn the EUGreece has been living under a clanic 2 party system during 40 years with a little judiciary independance and clientelism to keep voters happyIt's completely useless to dump billions in such a system as the money will immediately be sent abroad

As already said, why don't you post a comment after you learn more about the austerity measures imposed on Greece which have contracted the economy 30% thus not enabling the country to service it's debt.

What are you blathering on about? Greece has been a member of the EU since 1981 and membership has never been an issue for Greece with Turkey sitting next door. The contention and problems are the EZ and the structure of the euro, absolutely daft to conflate the two.

Well done to Cyprus. They seem to have managed a turnaround however the eye tells me that business closures are still happening? Whether the banks are really secure is another matter as they hold a lot of unfinished property and bad loans. Tourism numbers are up but display a subtle change in emphasis namely a switch to shorter stays and more all in packages resulting in the closure of some restaurants. The situation is much better than Greece and Cyprus still has the possible benefits of oil and gas offshore. Property prices seem to have bottomed and reveal some real bargains for those brave enough to step in as it is still a buyers market. Beautiful island and a great and easy place to retire.

The EU is going to use the threat of withholding loans to shaft Greece over the migrant crisis. 'Unless you agree to be an open prison, we'll say you haven't complied with the bailout terms. On the other hand, if you agree to act as Europe's buffer zone, we'll relax those terms'.

Greece needs to be more like Turkey, give us 3 billion and we'll stop the flow of migrants, 6 months later after numbers have DOUBLED, give us another 3 billion and membership, while we get busy putting down any journalists that dare take us on.With Turkey, Greece will get the last laugh, I'm loving that veto now, I love Greece.
