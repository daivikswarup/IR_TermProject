Mark Carney must hone diplomacy skills – but he's innocent of EU bias

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">M</span></span>ark Carney is not very skilled at sounding neutral. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/08/mark-carney-bank-of-england-brussels-eu-deal-supports-financial-stability">The governor of the Bank of England enraged Brexit-ers</a> in his testimony before the Treasury select committee on Tuesday. He called a transition out of the EU in the event of a leave vote “the biggest domestic risk to financial stability”.</p>

<p>He mused that UK assets could be perceived by foreign investors as more risky. And he added that some parts of the financial services industry could relocate.</p>

<p>All of this, admittedly, will be music to the ears of the remain camp. But, come on, the governor is paid to worry about financial stability. It would be odd if Carney didn’t have something to say about the potential consequences of leaving the EU.</p>

<p>If you listened to his words – as opposed to the reaction to them – the governor stayed well within neutral territory. The “biggest domestic risk” line may sound dramatic but isn’t. The UK is running a yawning deficit in its current account of 4%, which will not have gone unnoticed by the currency markets. It is quite possible that foreign lenders and investors – initially, at least – could demand a higher rate of return on their UK assets.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody really knows how the financial markets would react, but Carney’s broad-brush picture hardly counts as scaremongering. Even half the leave camp concedes that exit could be bumpy in the short term; its view is that the bumps will lead to greater long-term prosperity, which is a perfectly respectable argument. </p>

<p>As for Carney’s remarks on foreign banks and financial firms leaving the UK, well, that is just what some of them have said. It is not a revelation.</p>

<p>The only part where Carney’s neutrality could be questioned was in his remarks on the prime minister’s renegotiation settlement. The governor said the Bank’s concerns about protections for non-members of the eurozone had been addressed and the central bank would continue to have sufficient powers to do its job.</p>

<p>There are reasons to quibble with that analysis because we don’t exactly know what panicky measures the eurozone members would introduce in their next crisis. But Carney shouldn’t be damned for offering his opinion.</p>

<p>A cannier operator – such as predecessor Lord King, perhaps – would have found time for a robust passage on the inherent design flaws in the euro. That might have softened some of the Eurosceptics’ criticism. </p>

<p>But on the central allegation of loss of neutrality, the governor said nothing out of order. Carney is innocent.</p>

<p>If you call yourself the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking">Banking</a> Standards Board, surely you should have a few standards. And, one would hope, such an organisation would be able to form an opinion on whether the bankers are improving their behaviour or merely talking about it.</p>

<p>Do not read the BSB’s first annual review for insights. This curious document appears to be an exercise in stating the bleedin’ obvious and then offering inoffensive conclusions.</p>

<p>Take the passage on incentives and rewards, one of six areas where the BSB is supposedly having a good root around. It starts by telling us what we already know (“firms have been adapting to and implementing a wide range of national and global regulatory initiatives”) and finishes with the banal statement that “if a remuneration committee does not factor culture into its thinking, culture is unlikely to be intrinsic to the way that a firm pursues its business”.</p>

<p>What use is that? Does the BSB, and its chair Dame Colette Bowe, think parts of the banking industry are still polluted by a culture of personal greed? Indeed, did she ever think that? It’s impossible to tell.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/08/withhold-bankers-bonuses-for-a-decade-says-barclays-man">Withhold bankers' bonuses for a decade, says Barclays man</a> </p>

<p>Being overly generous, one could say these are still early days for the BSB, a body established last year on the recommendation of a parliamentary commission after the market-rigging scandals. The actual standards are promised to appear some time this year.</p>

<p>But the work of establishing credibility needs to start now. The BSB was set up by the big banks, has no statutory powers and membership is voluntary. As such, it will always be open to the charge that its thinking is infected by the banks themselves.</p>

<p>The only way to counter that perception, and advance the goal of restoring “trust”, is to avoid platitudes and cause some embarrassment where it is deserved. Bowe needs to acquire some arrows – and then fire them.</p>

<p>Here comes Volkswagen’s plea for mercy. Jobs will have to be cut – in the US as well as Europe – if the fines for manipulating diesel emissions tests are too heavy, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/08/volkswagen-may-cut-jobs-to-pay-for-emissions-scandal">say the carmaker’s executives</a>. </p>

<p>Such a script is very likely. The US Department for Justice is suing VW for up to $46bn (£32.3bn), which is serious money. Actual fines, of course, would probably be substantially lower but could still do “substantial and painful” damage, as chief executive Matthias Müeller put it.</p>

<p>But what are the US authorities supposed to do? Forget about the scandal and not apply the country’s environmental laws? </p>

<p>Sorry, but that route is paved with moral hazard. There is no point in ruining VW – but, equally, fines are meant to hurt when the offences are serious.</p>

Mark Carney frequently got himself in trouble in Canada for speaking on current affairs with little if anything to do with monetary policy. Such talk led to rumours of his leaving the Bank of Canada to run for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. He might have been successful if he had.

The governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney (image right) is a former Goldman Sachs official which is the World’s foremost “institutional speculator”. He spent thirteen years with Goldman before heading the Bank of Canada.

But he didn't support "totally the undemocratic EU", he merely said that there might be financial risks in leaving. For balance he might had added something about the euro zone issues, but he is not the BBC, but really I don't see how you can argue that he is in total support of the EU. Why is anyone who raises what they consider to be a legitimate concern about leaving the EU always blasted by those who support an exit? This debate is becoming a total farce as the story about the Queen demonstrates.

I think the issue was that Scotland could use the GBP (like Macedonia uses the EUR, or Zimbabwe uses the USD), but that the GBP would be RumpUK's currency, take no account of Scotland's needs when setting interest rates, and that Scotland would therefore have no lender of last resort.Whereas Salmond wanted a "shared currency" set up like the EZ.

Carney's "forward guidance" has been all over the shop the last few years, so his crystal ball is pretty ropey, to put it mildly.

You could also argue Carney was selected by `Unionphiles' viz. the Scottish referendum. The fact is, the status quo is more easily `measured' than the breakway leap with unknown negotiations.

Accusing Governor Carney of bias was not the best tack for Rees-Mogg to follow and does not help the Leave Campaign. Better to deal with the actual issue. Carney was really stating the obvious, that there would be some unknown risk on Brexit, how much compared with other scenarios, China, the US with President Trump or Clinton in charge, is another kettle of anchovies.

I would imagine that as a foreign national Carney is the one most likely to be unbiased in his opinion and I'm sure what he expressed was the considered view of the BoE policy committee.If there are all these emerging markets desperate to sign lucrative trade deals with a Brexited ( one for the language police )UK why does Turkey, it's self an emerging economy, want to join the EU block ? and why do Norway and Switzerland pay for access ?

Nils, I see that BHS is about to go bust with uncovered staff pension costs being dumped on state protected fund. Let's hear about former group owners taking out billion pound dividends rather than investing for long term and nasty plays by new owners with remaining assets. Absolutely no business standards evident here, so is it banks, retail and just business in general.....or what?

"The BSB was set up by the big banks, has no statutory powers and membership is voluntary. As such, it will always be open to the charge that its thinking is infected by the banks themselves." Say no more. No, on second thoughts, say a lot more. No doubt the cost of this is being set off against profits, giving banks yet another excuse to pay savers less and charge users more. Put another way, since bonus-grasping CEOs are unlikely to be paying for this, it is we, the users of banks, who are paying. We are paying to be conned into believing the banks are open to regulation and ethical improvements. While they make sure they need do nothing because this is a powerless, voluntary, gauze-thin fig leaf under their patronage. And we pay for this sleight of hand.

It doesn't matter that Carney was only pointing out the bleeding obvious - leaving the EU poses a short-term economic risk - the Tory anti-EU ideologues want to paint everyone who doesn't agree with them as being part of a conspiracy.

Perhaps that was a liberty. But why should Carney not have an opinion on the EU and its implications for the BoE? And therefore, by extension, the implications for the UK. It would be worrying if he didn't. And we should be allowed to hear that opinion. It is material fact; it matters in our trying to reach a sensible opinion on the matter. We need to know his view to help us make an informed decision in the referendum.

People want to know the future in order to feel secure. The future only exists in thought as does the idea of security. So that leaves now, this present moment in time. The EU is not functioning, the migrant crisis has pitted the political class and their media allies against the citizens of the EU. We are drip fed propaganda in articles that have to have references to impeccable morality, humanitarian obligations etc. The referendum is possibly the last chance to change a dysfunctional system, or be condemned to a German dominated EU, that seems to be falling apart as I write this. Merkel has alienated her countrymen, the liberal North Europeans, the Mediterranean region and even Austria and Holland. Turkey which contributed big time to this crisis, is to be rewarded, and the gap between the people and the establishment is widening. It is what is happening NOW that determine how people will vote, those who want answers about the future are unwilling to accept their experience of the EU in real time.  Very few predicted the crash, so those pivoting around possible outcomes are playing mind games, as Carney, Osbourne or anyone else cannot know the unknowable. There is only now, and now the EU is a corrupt, elitist organisation, not so different to FIFA.

He didn't say Scotland couldn't use GBP - Scotland could choose any currency it liked and use it - he pointed out that Scotland would have no control over GBP, and that rUK would have no reason to include independent Scotland when considering what to do with it.He was absolutely right to do this.*

Opinions are of themselves worth nothing. What we need is someone who can tell the difference between facts and instances, facts and evidence, facts and facts selected to fit an already held paradigm, and the difference between those three things and proof. When people can't distinguish between these things all they blether is opinions. That's all politicians and journalists do these days. I am 66 so I can remember when polticians talked some sense. I can also remember (in the early 1960s) when this nation had three newspapers that were each an education to read--viz., the Times, the Telegraph and the Guardian. Nowadays they are glorified comics full of opinions. And some people wonder why we've lost the Great in Britain.

Guess what, Carney is not the Queen. He leads an independent institution and has to be politically impartial, but in the end his job is assuring UK's financial stability and defending the pound. He cannot be expected to have no opinion on "stuff" like: the country breaking apart, or leaving a 50-year old alliance and it's largest market (the EU). Having no opinion or giving no signal would be irresponsible.
