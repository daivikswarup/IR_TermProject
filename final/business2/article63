Withhold bankers' bonuses for a decade, says Barclays man




DateTime::::2016-03-08T19:17:56+0000



<p>Bankers’ bonuses should be withheld for up to a decade to give managers a longer-term view of their business, the new deputy chairman of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay">Barclays</a> has said.</p>

<p>Sir Gerry Grimstone said he wanted to move “to a system where a large part of variable remuneration are shares that you hold in the organisation for five years or 10 years”.</p>

<p>“When you do that, management’s time horizon extends,” Grimstone added.</p>

<p>Banks are already required to defer bonuses for seven years under new rules and Grimstone, who was quoted by Bloomberg, was speaking at conference that coincided with the publication of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bankingstandardsboard.org.uk/annual-review-2015-2016/?ct=t(Test_The_Banking_Standards_Board_Annual_3_3_2016)">first annual review</a> of the industry issued by the Banking Standards Board.</p>

<p>The BSB – set up in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal and intended to bolster the reputation of the industry – came into being last April. </p>

<p>It has not published any industry-wide standards, but instead has spent its first nine months <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/29/uk-banks-receive-first-report-cards-from-banking-standards-board">reviewing the internal culture</a> of 10 founding members, and said it was not attempting to measure firms against a “one-size-fits all culture template”.</p>

<p>The BSB’s annual review – described as underwhelming by one critic – set out a number of ideas for banks to work on. </p>

<p>“In many retail banks, aggressive sales targets appear to have been removed or softened,” the review said. “This has produced a lack of certainty in some cases among staff and managers as to how performance is in practice now measured.” </p>

<p>It also said that “a broader concept of diversity and a more transparent approach to measuring success, and one more clearly rooted in the firm’s own purpose and business interests, would help many firms improve their effectiveness in fostering the culture that they are working hard in different ways to create”.</p>

<p>Alison Cottrell, the board’s chief executive, said that one of the areas she would be working on this year would be developing voluntary standards for the industry.</p>

<p>The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) acknowledged that it took time to create new organisations but said not enough was being done to restore public confidence in the sector. </p>

<p>“Overall progress is a little underwhelming,” said Iain Coke, head of ICAEW’s financial services faculty. </p>

<p>“The objective is to restore public trust. Useful as it may be to provide private feedback to banks on how they compare with their peers, this is unlikely to inspire public confidence.</p>

<p>“The BSB should have two priority objectives: to start the process of setting standards; and to demonstrate it is willing to properly hold banks to account for meeting these.”</p>

<p>James Bardrick, head of the UK operations of US banking group Citi, countered the critics and said the process had been useful for his bank, which was one of the 10 assessed. </p>

<p>Bardrick, who sits on the board of the BSB, said it had helped the management understand if their messages from the top were filtering through the organisation. </p>

<p>The founder members of the BSB are Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking">Banking</a> Group, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Standard Chartered. Three others – Citi, Morgan Stanley and high street bank Metro – have seats on the board.</p>

With the news of Deutsche Bank being told to repay tax dodging millions we learn that "Business Secretary Sajid Javid was a managing director at Deutsche Bank when the Dark Blue Investments scheme was in operation, having joined the bank in 2000." http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35761706

The only real payback is to restore the currency issuance to the people, free of money changer exploitation and usury.

We could fund the NHS, Social Services and Further Education Colleges with the money, which I'm sure they'd willingly contribute, being the socially minded creatures that they are.

Any chance that these fraudsters could pay back their losses, before bonuses are even considered?

One of the standards is all too obviously to successfully defer setting any standards, another to demonstrate by award of sinecures and consultancies the potential rewards of bank positions to politicians and thirdly, in case this doesn't work, to succeed in getting fierce regulators dismissed and BoE governors to scare us. It goes without saying that amassing the maximum personal loot is to be every bankers hypocratic oath. Easy.

We could withhold their bonuses for ten years, and then tell them with a sad face that their money's all gone because it's been eaten-up in investment charges.

Seven versus 10 years? Yawn. As a former banker (retired in 2000), I had seven years deferral since the early nineties. And having objected to my employer's wish to go all out in credit derivatives and CDOs, being proud enough and wealthy enough by then, I walked out. Well, I was walked out. It was me or the CEO; the result was never in much doubt.

Yes, I think they should be held for 10 years too. But I'm referring to their gonads, rather than their bonuses.......................
