Pro-Brexit Wetherspoon boss accuses PM of 'Paisleyite' scare tactics




DateTime::::2016-03-11T11:36:15+0000



<p>The pro-Brexit chairman of the pub chain <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/jdwetherspoon">JD Wetherspoon</a> has accused David Cameron of using “Paisleyite language” to describe the possible impact of the leaving the EU. <br/></p>

<p>Tim Martin, who grew up in Northern Ireland, criticised the prime minister for leading the remain campaign and using divisive, sectarian language reminiscent of the rhetoric of the late Ian Paisley, the former leader of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party.</p>

<p>Martin accused the pro-EU camp of using insults and scare tactics to belittle their opponents, and said Cameron should be a neutral figure instead of leading the remain campaign.</p>

<p>He also accused pro-EU business leaders of acting like sheep, peddling a line fed to them by Downing Street, and said they should be ashamed of their behaviour.</p>

<p>Martin said business executives and politicians in favour of staying in the EU were a group of highly educated men in late middle age who were prepared to sacrifice democracy to be part of an elite European club. <br/></p>

<p>“Cameron is a highly educated guy and he understands the various issues but he is arguing in a tribal way,” he said. “I grew up in Northern Ireland and it’s Paisleyite language being used to describe the effects of not being in the EU: ‘We will lose 3m jobs and the people who aren’t in it are little Englanders’ … It’s almost sectarian, the language. He is using personal insults, whereas to me he should be like a judge helping a jury to weigh up the evidence.”</p>

<p>Martin, who founded the FTSE 250 pub chain in 1979, said Britain would be better off out of the EU in the long run and dismissed fears of a short-term shock to the economy if there was a vote to leave. He argued for leaving the EU <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/news/2016/02/tims-viewpoint-eu">in an article in the most recent edition of Wetherspoon News</a>, available in the company’s pubs.<br/></p>

<p>Most business leaders who have expressed an opinion have said Britain should stay in the EU. Bosses of about a third of FTSE 100 companies <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/brexit-eu-referendum-top-firms-sign-letter-times-pro-eu-shell-easyjet-bae-systems-supermarkets-sainsbury-morrisons-tesco">wrote a letter last month </a>arguing that leaving the EU would threaten jobs, deter investment and endanger the economy.</p>

<p>Martin said: “I don’t think much of people being hauled into 10 Downing Street ... and then signing a letter. They should be ashamed of themselves. I haven’t seen one of them write an article themselves in the way I have.</p>

<p>“A lot of people on most boards are sheep and they stay there four or five years and they write their reports in business jargon and they aren’t independent business thinkers. Most of them are delicate orchids who won’t say anything.”</p>

<p>He said British businesses would benefit from leaving the EU in the long run through increased democratic accountability. As the world’s fifth biggest economy, the UK would not suffer any economic damage, he said.<br/></p>

He should do something about the state of the toilets in his pubs. And if he is going to bombard us with his tawdry propaganda I think I'll definitely become teetotal.

Just as the government is there to develop and execute policies, and to communicate those policies, it is the non-negotiable duty of civil servants to act, loyally - and, for the most part, unconditionally - in support of the policies of the government of the day.

no offence but you have shown that you have not got the facts to vote in this referendum and for your own good should leave the voting to others who do. You could drop the UK in the hot and sticky! At best I suggest you do a lot more independent research before you vote.

Rolls Royce Aero Engines is a British listed company, it is not german owned.Rolls Royce motor cars were purchased by BMW. So unless they plan on putting Mini engines on the Airbus I don't think there is too much need to panic.As to moving the manufacture of the wings to Italy I think you'll find there are contractual agreements in place regarding the building of these so it won't just be on the whim of Herr Junker as to where they are built.

It's a swings and roundabouts situation.Would there be difficulties in leaving? Yes.Is it beyond the wit of man to resolve those difficulties like adults ? No.Are there risks in remaining as the project increasingly centralises power? Yes.Does leaving offer significant financial savings? Yes.

Nato requires us to spend 2% of GDP on defence and fight wars to defend the other treaty members. The UN conventions trump UK laws for those areas we have signed up to - very similar to the EU.

Not a big fan of Wetherspoons; they happily take your money, let you get pissed, then chuck you out for singing, "I've Got a Brand New Combine Harvester" in a funny accent. I mean, you can't sing it without the funny accent can you, not if you want to do it justice.

The advantages/disadvantages of being in the EU are fairly well balanced. It's more of a 45%/55% argument than 0%/100%.

I'll have to reassess my fondness for Wetherspoons in light of Tim Martin's views on Europe. Anyone who thinks that Britain won't be damaged by leaving the EU is living in la-la land and by the time realisation dawns, it'll be too late.
