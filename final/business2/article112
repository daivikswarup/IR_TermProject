Trunki trumped by Kiddee in design battle of the suitcases




DateTime::::2016-03-09T11:56:06+0000



<p>The UK company behind Trunki ride-on suitcases for children has lost its battle in the supreme court in London, which dismissed its appeal over the design of Hong Kong rival Kiddee.</p>

<p>Lawyers and intellectual property experts said the ruling was a blow to small creative businesses in Britain that rely on design rights, and meant that designers would need to take great care when applying for protection for designs in future.</p>

<p>Jeremy Drew, head of retail at law firm RPC, said it would “send shockwaves through design-driven businesses”. He added: “It is highly likely that other businesses may now begin to see cheaper versions of their well-known original registered designs coming on to the market.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/03/trunki-v-kiddee-battle-over-childrens-luggage-reaches-supreme-court">In a long-running legal saga</a>, Magmatic, the Bristol-based company behind Trunki, argued that Kiddee suitcases infringe its registered design rights. They are made by the Hong Kong-based PMS International and, like Trunki cases, are decorated to look like animals.</p>

<p>Five supreme court justices unanimously ruled in favour of PMS on Wednesday. The case centred on the issue of whether surface decoration ought to be considered when deciding if design rights have been infringed.</p>

<p>Magmatic’s chief executive and founder, Rob Law, said the company was “devastated and bewildered” by this judgment. “We created an original product in Trunki and protected it by computer-generated registered design – a process used to protect a third of designs across Europe. In my honest opinion, the Trunki was wilfully ripped off.”</p>

<p>The legal battle has lasted several years and cost the firm more than £500,000. </p>

<p>Lord Neuberger, the court’s president, expressed “some regret” as the conception of the Trunki “seems to have been both original and clever”.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2014-0147.html">The judgment then said</a>: “It appears clear that Mr Beverley of PMS conceived the idea of manufacturing a Kiddee Case as a result of seeing a Trunki, and discovering that a discount model was not available. Unfortunately for Magmatic, however, this appeal is not concerned with an idea or an invention, but with a design.”</p>

<p>Paul Beverley, the managing director of PMS, has openly admitted that he came up with the idea for Kiddee Cases after seeing Trunki luggage. He hailed the court decision as a “victory for fair competition”. He said: “Today’s decision in PMS’s favour ensures that the Kiddee Case can continue to be sold to price-conscious UK families.”</p>

<p>Tania Clark, partner and trademark attorney at European intellectual property (IP) firm Withers &amp; Rogers, said: “What Magmatic was effectively trying to achieve in this case, on the basis of a single registered design, was the exclusion of a competitor’s design from the market. Given the differences in the designs, however, this was not enough.”</p>

<p>Clare Jackman, an IP lawyer at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said it was likely that designers would file a number of applications to protect products in future, rather than relying on just one.</p>

<p>Arty Rajendra, partner at law firm Rouse Legal, described the court ruling as an “undoubted blow for UK design and creative industries”. “The courts have to strike the right balance between incentivising innovation, while simultaneously promoting fair competition. Today’s ruling cements the growing perception that the pendulum swings too far in favour of the alleged infringer.” </p>

One way to beat the cheap imitations is to licence a company overseas to produce a cheaper version of the original product. Probably renaming it so as to reduce the impact on your original. Then you've got both ends of the market covered.

The contradiction that our esteemed Law Lords have created is to expect struggling innovative designers to pay for multiple iterations of their designs just when they have the least money - when starting a business. It is not an opportunity for price conscious parents, it's a train of bandwagons for lawyers and copyists to jump on. Sad day for Creative Britain - why bother if your own Law does not support you?

The picture of the Supreme Court judgement shows both cases. Perhaps they are so similar you didn't notice? If so that may show Trunki has been poorly served by the court.

As I recall, part of the reason they rejected it on Dragons' Den was a perception that anyone could come along and make a cheap knock-off. Which would appear to be somewhat vindicated now.

The design is clearly different but I agree the task is the same.The useful cases were very overpriced and the uk firm should expect this type of competition and get over it quickly and start to innovate. Lego had to live with this reality.

It looks like there's two of us have read the judgment, then. The pictures in the CRD were too detailed, in significant ways. The case is a warning against careless drafting of applications, especially ones which aren't fully examined.

Agreed. Neuberger could probably have saved himself if he had added to that sentence, ', or that it did not weigh heavily with him'.

Not sure it will. Gucci still sell (effing hideous) bags, despite the ubiquity and ready availability of obvious knock offs.

Just go to your local supermarket and look at shampoo copies of Head & Shoulders, lots of very similar looking packaging with the same swish on the front, or look at the Coke copies.This happens all the time.

I don't think British manufacture would count for much, and 'guaranteed trunki quality' would only work if people thought that it was some sort of premium brand. I'd imagine most people don't know the difference between both products.

If you'd designed something, you'd want to be able to copyright it yeah? You'd want to be able to push your own unique product into the common retail market right? As someone with an interest in design, it's a great concern wondering if my design work will be unravelled by people who can not only imitate it, but then potentially have freedom to make money of it in shops.
