<p>The annual bonus for John Lewis and Waitrose staff has fallen <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonus-to-lowest-level-for-12-years">for the third year in a row</a>, as profits at their parent group declined owing to higher pension charges.</p>

<p>The pool from which the bonuses are paid reduced from £156.2m to £145m, which worked out at an average payment of £1,585 for each of its 91,500 staff.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis">John Lewis</a> Partnership, whose corporate structure means staff own the company through a trust and take a share of its profits, said on Thursday the annual windfall would be 10% of salary.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonus-to-lowest-level-for-12-years">The payout is down from 11% last year</a>, itself a cut on the 15% in 2014. However, it was higher than expectations, with many analysts predicting 9%.</p>

<p>It follows a difficult year in which profits were hit by fierce competition among grocers and hefty pension costs.</p>

<p>John Lewis is expected to take action this year to cut overheads as it navigates a difficult trading environment. The firm is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/john-lewis-to-shut-canteens-and-introduce-longer-shifts-for-drivers">considering plans to close staff canteens and introduce longer shifts</a> for hundreds of delivery drivers.<br/></p>

<p>Underlying pre-tax profit for 2015 fell 10.9% to £305.5m on revenues that were 2.2% higher at £9.7bn. The chairman, Sir Charlie Mayfield, said the fall in profit was down to high pension charges and lower property earnings, without which profit was up 7%.</p>

<p>He added that the rise was actually 9% because last year’s results were for a 53-week period, rather than a standard 52-week year.</p>

<p>Pre-tax profit rose 24% to £434.8m when including £129.3m from the sale of a property.<br/></p>

<p>While operating profits for John Lewis department stores were unchanged at £250m, earnings at <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/waitrose">Waitrose</a> fell 2% to £232.6m as discount supermarkets forced down prices.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>But the comparison with last year was brighter when excluding one-off property profits from last year and the fact that last year’s figures included an extra week of trading.</p>

<p>Stripping out those effects, Waitrose’s operating profit was up 3.9% and John Lewis’s was 0.7% higher.</p>

<p>Despite the fall in their customary bonus, staff at John Lewis’s flagship store on Oxford Street, London, whooped and cheered when the windfall was announced on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Frances O’Neill, a kitchen planner who has worked at John Lewis for five years, said: “Bonuses are quite rare unless you work in finance and whatever we get is fantastic. How many other retailers do a profit share? </p>

<p>“It’s great if you have a credit card bill to pay or something. This year I’m saving for a holiday with the family.”</p>

<p>Most of the decline in the partnership’s profits was because of the operating cost of its pension scheme, which increased by £54m to £245.4m owing to a change in the rates used for accounting purposes.</p>

<p>The trading performance of Waitrose and John Lewis held up well, with both increasing their market share.<br/></p>

<p>Waitrose’s operating profit was £232.6m, down 0.8% when compared with the 52-week period last year but up 3.9% when excluding £10.5m of profit the supermarket chain made last year on its property portfolio.</p>

<p>The supermarket’s managing director, Mark Price, was presiding over his last set of results before leaving to become a trade minister at the Foreign Office, a position that will see him become a peer.</p>

<p>He said that despite Waitrose’s upmarket clientele, it had not been immune to the rise of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, owing to a “ripple effect” throughout the market caused by fierce competition.</p>

<p>He predicted that the supermarket would fare better than its rivals this year. “I expect this year that Waitrose will be one of the very few food retailers that will improve profitability,” he said. But the partnership warned that conditions this year were likely to be “challenging, especially in grocery”.</p>

<p>Overall sales across the John Lewis Partnership were up 4.2% in the first five weeks of the year.</p>

<p>Most of this growth has come from the department stores, where gross sales were 5.5% higher than last year, compared with 0.4% growth for Waitrose.</p>

<p>Price said customers can expect to see more in-store hospitality, such as its eat-in bakeries, sushi bars and wine bars, as Waitrose looks to burnish its high-end credentials.</p>

Unrecomend! I have worked in various retailers at management level and bonuses are fair a few between. The bonus is remarkable and every employee receives one for doing there daily job, which is already paid at a industry standard.

Yes they do. Just had my Annual review and have been rewarded well for my efforts. Based upon performance.

Yes, they do. Pay is directly linked to performance. Partners have a yearly performance review and, based on their scores, their pay is revised accordingly. If you don't meet performance expectations (set in the previous year's review) then your pay may not be increased. It's the same for all partners, shop floor, back room or office. What makes you say they don't?

It's the "BBC's favourite" because as it's a partnership and not a stockmarket listed company then it's spokespeople are not restricted by the rules over "market sensitive information" thus JLP is always available for a sound bite on last week's sales etc whereas the others have to abide by stock market regulations.

It's being developed for flats and the new much needed Marlborough Primary School. Yes he put money in - so what? He's adding to his portfolio not turning it into a mega trainer warehouse.

Indeed no tax is paid unless over that amount, so many will still benefit.

not after tax and national insurance. If i remember right though the partners don't have to pay tax on their bonus this year if the total is under £3600. I'm an ex partner so not sure if that still stands

I used to work at John Lewis and this bonus is very poor. Its one of the only companies i've ever worked for where you're not paid for your tea break. I understand that no where pays for Lunch breaks but tea break is normally paid. If you work it out the bonus is just your tea break money and then a little more.

Remember the bonus is, 10%of someone's earned salary as their payment. So each Partner will receive a different amount but is around 5 weeks pay.
