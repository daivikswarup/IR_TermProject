<p>Britain’s factories bounced back from a dismal 2015 to post a solid increase in output in the first month of the new year, official figures have shown.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics">Office for National Statistics</a> said manufacturing production rose by 0.7% between December and January, bringing to an end three successive months of decline.</p>

<p>Despite the pick-up, UK factories were producing 0.1% less in January than they were in the same month a year earlier and 6.4% less than during the period in early 2008 when the economy was about to plunge into recession.</p>

<p>Manufacturing output in the three months to January was 0.2% down on the three months ending in October. The ONS considers the quarterly comparison a better guide to the underlying trend than one month’s data.</p>

<p>Industrial production – which includes the North Sea, mining and energy sectors in addition to manufacturing – fared less well in January, posting a monthly rise of 0.3%.</p>

<p>With the slump in the price of crude having an impact on oil and gas extraction from the UK’s offshore fields, industrial production was 1.3% lower in the three months to January than in the previous quarter and 10.2% below its 2008 peak.</p>

<p>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “While ONS figures show manufacturing growth was better than expected in January, other evidence – including the BCC’s Quarterly Economic Survey – suggests that the sector is still struggling, and on an annual basis output remains in negative territory.</p>

<p>“The UK economy will have to continue to rely on its dynamic and flexible services sector for the next few years, which will continue to be the main driver of growth.”</p>

This Government has become so accustomed to telling that many lies, they simply can't remember what the truth is.

Only in manufacturing. In all other areas the economy surpassed the 2008 figure last year.

So we are still 6%+ less than we were before the crash in 2008- and 1% less than 2015.At PMQ the PM keeps telling us about our strong economy - so perhaps nobody has told him about this worrying stat. Engineering companies usually export a very large percentage of their output (50%+)so good news for exports this small increase in output.With employers keep busting their quoter for non-UK skilled workers l do wonder of UK plc manufacturing has the capacity to get back to the 2007/8 output levels. Skilled Engineering rates have not sky-rocketed so it might be more about keeping wages down. Time will tell!
