ECB cuts interest rates to zero amid fears of fresh economic crash

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank">European Central Bank</a> has cut interest rates across the eurozone to zero as it unveiled an unprecedented package of growth-boosting measures against the backdrop of a fragile global economy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Amid growing concerns of a fresh economic crash, the eurozone’s central bank surprised financial markets by cutting interest rates in the region to an all-time low, expanding its money printing programme and reducing a key bank deposit rate further into negative territory.</p>

<p>The ECB chief, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/mario-draghi">Mario Draghi</a>, implied interest rates would stay “very low” for at least another year and predicted the region would remain mired in negative inflation for months to come. But he played down speculation that interest rates could be cut even further.<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/ecb-interest-rate-hold-steadies-markets">ECB stimulus hint steadies markets</a> </p>

<p> “From today’s perspective and taking into account the support of our measures to growth and inflation, we don’t anticipate that it will be necessary to reduce rates further. Of course, new facts can change the situation and the outlook,” he told a news conference.</p>

<p>The Frankfurt-based institution hopes its latest barrage of measures will get money into the financial system by discouraging banks from holding on to deposits. The expectation is that financial institutions will instead lend out money as cheaply as possible to businesses and households.</p>

<p>In the UK, ministers campaigning for the country to stay in the EU will be hoping the latest package of ECB support will ward off a fresh crisis in the eurozone, because financial turmoil could undermine their case ahead of June’s referendum.</p>

<p>The measures went well beyond what investors had been expecting and led to wild swings on already febrile financial markets. The euro initially plunged as record low interest rates were announced, before bouncing back as Draghi implied this was the lowest the central bank would go on borrowing costs.</p>

<p>Going further than economists had expected, the ECB reduced the eurozone’s main interest rate from 0.05% to zero, also cut its two other interest rates, expanded its quantitative easing (QE) programme and announced new ultra-cheap, four-year loans to banks, allowing them to borrow from the ECB at negative interest rates.<br/></p>

<p>On stock markets, share prices were boosted when the rate cuts were announced but gains were cut as Draghi suggested there was no additional help to come.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/how-european-central-bank-ecb-trying-revive-eurozone">How the ECB is trying to revive the eurozone</a> </p>

<p>“The ECB attempted to exceed market expectations with a strong set of non-conventional monetary policy measures but then disappointed the market on forward guidance around further interest rate reductions – effectively suggesting that interest rates had reached their nadir,” said Marilyn Watson at fund manager BlackRock.<br/></p>

<p>As expected by markets, the ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points, further into negative territory to -0.4%. The latest cut in the deposit rate means the ECB will be charging banks more to hold their money overnight, with the aim of encouraging them to lend it to businesses. The marginal lending rate, paid by banks to borrow from the ECB overnight, was cut from 0.3% to to 0.25%.<br/></p>

<p>The ECB expanded its QE programme to €80bn (£61bn) a month, up from €60bn. Under QE, the central bank pumps money into the eurozone by buying bonds off financial institutions in the expectation that they will reinvest the proceeds elsewhere in the European economy. The QE programme will now include buying bonds issued by companies and not just by financial institutions.</p>

<p>Draghi and his fellow policymakers had come under growing pressure to increase support for the eurozone’s economy after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/feb/29/negative-inflation-ecb-under-pressure-eurozone-support">the single-currency bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February</a>. <br/></p>

<p>The ECB chief used a news conference to insist the region was not in full-on, Japan-style deflation and to rebuff growing fears that central banks have run out of ammunition to fight sluggish economic growth and revive price rises. Negative inflation is viewed as economically dangerous because falling prices can create a downward spiral of economic growth, by dissuading businesses and consumers from spending in the expectation that prices will fall further.<br/></p>

<p>Without Thursday’s measures, the eurozone would have faced “disastrous deflation”, Draghi added.</p>

<p>The ECB is predicting inflation in the eurozone will be just 0.1% this year, 1.3% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 – all under its target for inflation, close to but below 2%.</p>

<p>Economists are becoming increasingly sceptical of the power of monetary policy as central banks around the world resort to increasingly unconventional measures to shore up their economies.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/10/ecb-can-only-buy-time-not-solve-eurozone-growth-woes-draghi">ECB can only buy time, not solve eurozone growth woes</a> </p>

<p>“Having mislaid his bazooka in December, Mario Draghi has returned to the fray firing a blunderbuss,” said Simon Ward, chief economist at Henderson Global Investors. “While superficially impressive, this scattershot approach will probably have limited impact on monetary conditions and the economic outlook.”</p>

<p>For their part, central bankers have become increasingly frustrated with the failure of governments to push through economic reforms, eight years on from the global financial crisis. Draghi echoed recent comments by his UK counterpart, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/2016/feb/26/bank-of-england-chief-accuses-g20-of-failing-to-enact-reforms-to-boost-growth">ministers cannot leave central banks to do all the work on driving the economic recovery</a>. </p>

<p>Draghi said: “In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively.”<br/></p>

<p>The ECB chief cited a host of risks to economic growth from stumbling emerging economies, volatile financial markets and the slow pace of structural reforms.<br/></p>

<p>Draghi’s comments reflected evidence that “the effectiveness of monetary policy is clearly diminishing”, said Alasdair Cavalla at the consultancy the Centre for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/business/economics">Economics</a> and Business Research.<br/></p>

<p>“Draghi threw down the gauntlet to fiscal policymakers today, arguing for infrastructure spending while lowering the ECB’s own growth forecasts,” said Cavalla.</p>

<p>Some analysts welcomed the announcement of ultra-cheap loans to banks, hoping they could mitigate the impact of ultra-low interest rates, which create difficulties for commercial banks by making it harder for them to lend profitably. </p>

<p>“The icing on the cake was the announcement of a new, longer-term bank lending programme,” said Barbara Teixeira Araujo, an economist at Moody’s Analytics.</p>

<p>Negative rates on these new loans to banks would “partially compensate the extra costs related to the further cut in deposit rates, easing worries about negative interest rates cutting into banks’ profitability and potentially hurting the banking system”, she added.<br/></p>

<p>But analysts at the consultancy Capital <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics">Economics</a> were less sanguine about the overall ECB package: “There is no guarantee that its latest ‘bazooka’ will be any more effective than previous ones in securing the strong and sustained growth required to eliminate the threat of deflation in the currency union and allow the peripheral countries to tackle their debt problems. The ECB has belatedly delivered, but it can’t work miracles.”</p>

The Germans are mad about Draghi's latest measures; you should read the German press, all worrying about the thrifty German burgher loosing value on his cherished long term savings. But the Germans are right, the latest QE initiative by the ECB smacks of despair and looks reckless. The only news is that it will concern not only banks but also businesses. It will be interesting to see how this latest measure will be implemented and which firms are eligible.

So the banks can borrow at negative interest rates (i.e. the ECB will PAY them to borrow money) and then lend to consumers at 3-5%? This really is a licence for them to print money.

The EU is sliding into full-scale economic depression because it's trying to stimulate the economy with monetary policy (lowering interest rates) when it's stuck in a low demand deflationary spiral. Economists call it a "zero (interest rate) lower bound" contraction. It doesn't work. The brilliant (British) economist Sir John Maynard Keynes demonstrated the only way to get out is FISCAL policy- spending money to stimulate the economy, which has a multiplier effect and creates more jobs. When most people have more money, they spend it; when rich people have more money, they sit on it. Spending money creates jobs. The money for doing this comes from the same very rich people sitting on it, either as taxes (balanced budget, better) or as loans (Government debt, deficit spending, effective but costs more.)

Draghi cuts the rates to zero and unleases QE like there is no tomorrow, to then turn around and warn about rising inequality and turns around, warning of rising inequality. Right after the Bank of International Setlements (BIS) - of which Draghi is a board member - warned QE increases inequality.

So, I'm a bank and the Central bank(s) don't want me to deposit my cash with them. But I can borrow money really cheaply from the ECB. I can't really lend my cash to big business because they are already sitting on loads of cash and have surplus productive capacity - so what do I do with all this cheap money? Invest it in "assets" of course. But we don't want an asset bubble and we want banks to have stronger balance sheets and liquidity....

I seriously hope it's not only you. I can't see a single reason for Britain wanting to stay in and I say that as a Brit mainly living and working abroad since before Schengen. There are going to be a lot of angry pensioners in the Eurozone over the coming years, including those from richer countries. Longer hours, bracket creep, cold progression, call it what you will. Constant bailouts, never ending crises, a permanent feeling of fear, the seemingly wanted influx of terrorism, when's the next crash going to come? Which country will need bailing out next? It's a fucking shambles run by mad men and women! And now this Merkel marionette now really has no more cards to play.I'd like someone to explain the benefits of the EU. We are now seemingly incapable of profit with closed borders, or so many would have us believe. Therefore terrorism will be just something else we have to live with because it's not going to stop.Yes to Europe, no to the EU!

Because, base interest rates are added to loans. So if Bank A chagres 5% interest it will now chage 4.5% interest. If it goes negative it will have a similar affect.

The fact is that the EU as an economic "unit" is not profitable. It has too many zombie States that are a permanent drain. This merely confirms that it is a Transfer Union where votes are bought for membership. Now, the "prospect" of Turkey being admitted is waved as either a threat if members object to unlimited numbers of "refugees" or a promise to placate voters who are going to inflict damage to Merkel for her disastrous immigration policy - based entirely upon the premise that Germany needs a massive influx of cheap labour now. The policy of literally giving money away by the ECB is lunacy. How long can a "Bank" survive giving its stock away? Answer:- Not very long; even other people's money, like ours!Obviously, the ECB is not a Bank by definition. It is merely a tool, used by Germany to control EU members.

It won't work. EU QE1 failed because Eurozone countries such as France are unwilling to commit to the necessary structural reforms. The reforms needed are political anathema to the French. This EU QE2 will fail for the same reason. A shot of financial adrenaline to try and reanimate the Frankenstein corpse. Its temporary effect will pass but the EU will still remain structurally unreformed. EU QE3 will arrive around this time next year, bigger but third time around even less effective.

Draghi is an amateur and dangerous man. The free money will flow to emerging economies in Asia, but it will do nothing for the EU. The free money is not free either, the people who are bled dry by the ECB's policy are savers and pensioners whose pension funds rely for an substantial part on the interest rates. Draghi therefore is rewarding those countries with a pension system that is non existing as in France and Italy where current workers pay for pensioners and money is not really saved.

What is the point of trying to stimulate consumer demand in the EU only for consumers to spend their money on Far Eastern imports which are much cheaper.What does that do for Europena manufacturers?.And the reason they're much cheaper is because foreign competitors don't have to put up with the burden of regulation and red tape the EU imposes on business.Until the EU wake up to this nothing the ECB does will make any difference.
