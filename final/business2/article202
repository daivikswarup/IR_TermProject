Stock markets rally at the end of a traumatic week




DateTime::::2016-02-12T18:57:55+0000



<p>A recovery in US consumer spending revived battered stock markets in Europe and New York on Friday, despite <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/eurozone-recovery-falters-greece-recession">the latest eurozone GDP figures</a> showing a broad slowdown across the currency union and Greece slipping back into recession.<br/></p>

<p>The FTSE 100 soared 169 points to register the strongest daily increase since last August, before the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/dowjones">Dow Jones</a> index followed suit in New York, wiping out much of the losses from earlier in the week as January figures for US consumer spending beat expectations. The FTSE 100 still ended the week down 2.4%.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/eurozone-recovery-falters-greece-recession">Eurozone recovery falters as Greece slips back into recession</a> </p>

<p>Nine of the 10 major sectors in Wall Street’s Standard &amp; Poor’s index were higher, led by a 2.4% rise in the financial sector, which fought off concerns that low interest rates and risky lending had undermined the stability of some institutions.</p>

<p>Banks were helped by comments from Bill Dudley, deputy chairman of the US <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a>, who said they were well capitalised and able to withstand a global shock. JP Morgan jumped 5.6% to $56.05 a share after chief executive Jamie Dimon bought more than $25m (£17.24m) of the bank’s stock. <br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/08/uk-business-confidence-falls-global-recession-fears-markets-business-live">For much of the week, investors feared</a> that a contraction in US factory output, sluggish employment growth and persistently low inflation were signals that the US economy was heading for a recession.<br/></p>

<p>Plunging oil prices, which slumped below $27 a barrel in the US, falling commodity values and a rush by investors to safe haven assets added to the gloomy picture.</p>

<p>James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets, said resilient US employment, rising real incomes and a recovering housing market in a period of extreme volatility on global markets, were providing enough offsetting effects for now.</p>

<p>“However, equity markets don’t seem particularly interested unfortunately and the longer that this goes on the greater the risk that it feeds negatively into the real economy through weaker sentiment and tighter financial conditions,” he said.</p>

<p>Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said the health of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy">US economy</a> depended on how well it could weather the global risks in the long term, especially a devaluation of the Chinese currency that would make US exports more expensive.</p>

<p>“Clearly, the tentacles of the Chinese slowdown are spreading and the lack of a clear enough policy is a red flag to ongoing volatility,” she said.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/interest-rates-markets-janet-yellen-briefs-congress">Fed chief Janet Yellen</a> failed to calm markets during an appearance on Capitol Hill this week, when she said that it was possible the central bank would cut rates if the situation deteriorated.</p>

<p>Dudley waded into the debate on Friday, downplaying the likelihood of a rate cut: “To me, that’s not something that should be part of the conversation right now.”</p>

<p>The US economy has “quite a bit” of momentum that will help offset weakness from abroad, he said, even as he acknowledged he now expected inflation to take a bit longer to return to the Fed’s 2% target because of the drag from the falling price of oil. </p>

<p>The 19-member eurozone economy added another prop to market sentiment after figures showed it grew 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015 after German exports put in a strong performance.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/eurozone-crisis-back-on-boil">But analysts continued to worry</a> that the refugee crisis and the prospect of Greece defaulting on its loans, forcing it to seek further funds from Brussels and the International Monetary Fund, would halt the eurozone recovery.</p>

<p>France and Italy, which appeared to be recovering strongly last spring, showed that even the second and third largest economies in the currency zone were ailing.</p>

<p>France could only manage 0.2% growth in the final quarter while Italy registered 0.1% growth, despite benefiting from low energy costs, an export-boosting drop in the euro’s value and monetary stimulus from the central bank.</p>

<p>Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics">Economics</a>, said the downside risks had increased and as a result the European Central Bank will back “further decisive policy support” at its March meeting. <br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece">Greece</a>, which has seen its debt to GDP ratio soar past 190% in recent months, fell into recession after recording its second quarter of negative growth.</p>

<p>The Syriza government, led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, has struggled to maintain a recovery that followed an accord signed last summer for a third bailout.</p>

<p>Lenders are demanding that Greece scrap tax breaks for farmers and impose pension reforms that will lead to higher monthly contributions from the self-employed and salaried employees.<br/></p>

<p>Farmers carried their protest to Athens on Friday, driving tractors through the centre of the city and rioting when blocked by police from approaching government buildings.</p>

Funny how it is always the folks at the bottom who cause all of the problems. As in..it was the Greek farmers (?) who decided that the country needed to buy four nuclear submarines--with money the IMF cheerfully loaned them, knowing that the money could not be paid back, but that Greek assets could be grabbed to satisfy the debt.

Just realized something...world powers like Britain and the States are getting deeper into debt by fighting never-ending wars because of scare propaganda and false flags created by paid "robot" politicians...private banks are providing their currency and keeping them in the grips of debt...their politicians are bending over to them....corporations are treating their populace like work slaves...people are scared of losing their jobs and work away just making ends meet ... no time really to protest...sounds like "The New World Order" is already here!

What, you mean the Greek farmers who took the regeneration grants handed to them from the EU - which were intended for upgrading plant and machinery and putting more land into production - and spent it on on beach front holiday homes and Mercedes? That was back in the old days when you'd be hard pressed to find any Greek, not employed by the government, who paid any tax at all. Quadrupling conts. and tax would be more like it! The Greeks have had all the sympathy they can get. It's the Syrians' turn now.

Just Google it, as a % of the population I don't know if the number of deaths is significant, but not many of them are dying in their sleep. Some of the deaths are quite bizarre. Like the guy who shot himself eight times with a nail gun in his own garage...really!!

The rodents who run global finance don't invest in companies, they just gamble on them. Placing bets on shares and selling ASAP for profit generating volatility.But even that unethical greed is not enough so they invent ludicrous money generating schemes amongst themselves making bigger riskier bets that the taxpayer underwrites. This is not the fault of capitalism but human nature. You will always have scum like this who will do anything to steal other peoples money. Normal people aren't like this, hence the moral anger rising in the west.Until the bankers/traders/conmen/fraudsters/liars are punished financially and jailed it will continue. The system needs laws and they need to be enforced.

Come Monday it will be back to the hell hole where it belongs. You know things are bad when bankers are jumping to thier deaths off buildings every week. Maybe they fear the people? or maybe they have a mental health problems? which ever way we look at it, there is a major problem.

As I said on Monday, this stock market rout was largely the manipulation of speculators who were taking advantage of the long holidays for Chinese New Year, which shut down the markets in China, in Hong Kong, and in Singapore. With those participants out, it presents the ideal opportunity to make shorting plays, and drive the stock markets further down than they would go otherwise.

Personally I made sure to get out of any exposed equity positions over the weekend on my trading account, I cannot understand why markets ramped up so much today even into the close. Holding exposure to financial stocks, energy stocks and others over the weekend and into the mainland China index opens on Sunday is not wise in my opinion.
