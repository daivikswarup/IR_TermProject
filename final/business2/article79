New-look Barclays: the same, but worse

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>he referee is biased, the pitch is tilted against us and we’ve given up trying to predict our results. But, don’t worry, dear shareholders, we’re taking decisive action: we’re cutting your dividend by 54%. Please don’t grumble because it’s for your own good. Your patience will be rewarded – one of these years.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s new-look Barclays, under the dynamic new leadership of chairman John McFarlane and chief executive Jes Staley – “like me, a banking veteran,” says McFarlane, as if that were reassuring. It was certainly <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/barclays-cuts-dividend-as-profits-fall-8-percent">a veteran whinge that accompanied Barclays’ 8% fall in pre-tax profits to £2.1bn</a>.</p>

<p>“Outsized” fines and penalties for past misconduct “are not proportionate to our smaller size”, grumbled McFarlane, a plea of poverty that jars with the fact that Barclays still managed to dig deep and pay 323 employees more than £1m last year. Meanwhile, the 62% stake in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay">Barclays</a> Africa, previously advertised as a growth business for decades to come, will be sold down (at the bottom of the market, probably) because today’s regulators are strict about how they calculate liabilities.</p>

<p>At least Staley has jettisoned predecessor Antony Jenkins’ vacuous description of Barclays as the “go-to” bank. In its latest incarnation, Barclays wants to be a “transatlantic” bank, which is easier to understand. There will be a UK bit – which will sit within the new regulatory ringfence – and a corporate and international division, also housed in the UK.</p>

<p>Fine, but the new structure doesn’t answer the perennial question of whether Barclays can make consistent and stable returns in investment banking. Even after Jenkins’ tactical retreats from capital-heavy activities, Barclays isn’t remotely close to financial respectability. The 2015 return on tangible equity in investment banking was a miserable 6%. As ever, investors must give thanks for Barclaycard, which breezes along at 22%.</p>

<p>Staley is the latest chief executive to believe the investment bank requires just one last heave. Maybe he will confound the doubters eventually, but you can’t blame shareholders for feeling that the timing of Barclays’ promised revival has been massively delayed since the chief executive’s arrival in Canary Wharf.</p>

<p>As recently as last October, McFarlane mused that “a high and progressive dividend will in future need to make up a significant portion of our annual total shareholder return”. Now Staley has cut the dividend in half to give “unfettered ability to accelerate the wind-down of non-core assets”.</p>

<p>No wonder the share price is winding down too: it’s now halved since the point at which McFarlane reckoned it could be doubled within three years. And no wonder the chairman would rather talk about beastly regulators and governments.</p>

"The entire edifice is rotten to the core, and based on the lie that we need a third party parasite to 'lend' us our own money in the first place" - The most perfect summary of Fractional Reservr Banking I've yet come across: Why don't they emphasise this to children at scool? Standing back and looking logically, as Mr Spock might have perused, what is the purpose of FRB? We are not only infested with parasites, we've let them take over ruling us: it is absolutly incredible! The only way we will ever progress is to wrestle control from these needless parasites and take charge of our own money - be careful, though, Kennedy and Lincoln tried this...and we know what happened in both cases! Have a 1000 recommends!

Barclays make a profit because of low interest rates. ie Barclaycard! Talk about genius. And this is what the bosses deserve their bonuses for?

Indeed you do stand corrected.Your arithmetic is well wide of the mark. With only 1 or 2% margin, the days of banking mega-profits seem numbered.When I had a mortgage, back in the 1970s, we had interest rates of 15%apr. Investors received around 6%aer return on savings.That gave the banks 9% margin, less costs. There is a large difference between 9% and 2%.Where you are correct is that RBS does a lot of mortgage work. Around 90% of its business last year. Given that the UK is hardly building any new properties, this must be a Ponzi scheme. RBS lent £9 billion to mortgagees, to but existing properties at newly inflated prices.

I stand corrected re RBS being a building society; though since it does a lot of mortgage work, the actual import of my comment still stands. Now tell me, why do you need to embellish your comments with gratuitous insults? Do you not feel that that undermines your stance? Worse still when you turn out to be so wide of the mark.For your information, I am excellent at maths, usually quicker than computer/calculator/ check-out. And with top marks for undergrad statistics.

"ponzi scheme" no longer describes the fraud of a fund paying out to investors from the invested amounts of new joiners.

Sean, banks launder (steal) our promissory notes, and pretend lend them back to us...with interest. They give up no commensurable consideration, and charge compound interest for the privilege.

RBS is a bank, was a bank and probably will be a bank. It has never been a building society.RBS charges 3% to most of its fixed rate mortgage customers. It pays around 1% interest to fixed term savers.Simple arithmetic should tell you they only have 2% margin, less their costs.Wasn't arithmetic your strong point?

"Such a British thing to bale out for short term reasons now after all those years of investing and building."

Not sure you're right about the US market being "rigged", at least not overtly. But they do seem to have a tendency to pursue and fine non-US businesses rather more harshly than US businesses. Ah well, saves the inconvenience of negotiating trade agreements or equalising trading conditions.

What you're (apparently) describing is not a Ponzi scheme. As for a former building society having a lot of mortgage business on their books, well I never! who'd have expected it. Moreover, if the banks are lending so much they ought to be doing well. Just look at the difference between what they charge borrowers percentage-wise, and the derisory iterest they pay out to people who place their savings with them. As the saying goes: "nice money if you can get it".

What a big mistake about selling the Africa business. In about ten years, it will be a massive asset.Such a British thing to bale out for short term reasons now after all those years of investing and building.When will we learn?

The collective mind has been poisoned by the criminal intentions of unsound fiat money and global corporatism. Barclays is a leading player.

In this era of very low interest rates, it's difficult to see how banks can make any profits.The whole monetary system has become a joke.I saw RBS's annual reports today.They have lent £9.2 bn on domestic mortgages and £1.2Bn on commercial loans, showing that 90% of their business in now in the Ponzi scheme of domestic property.The same buildings are sold at inflated prices, since we hardly build any more these days.This bank is 79% owned by the taxpayer, so the government is complicit.

The only thing Barclays has now is a revolving workforce of "change project staff" - a decade of hundreds of millions of wasted money changing what they changed the year before... all spun by a marketing department who make any old rubbish look like something it isn't but marketing feel it should be positioned as. The company is a mess.
