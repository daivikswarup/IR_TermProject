OECD's calls for less austerity means common sense has prevailed

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">A</span></span>t last, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd">OECD</a> has converted to the teachings of John Maynard Keynes. The austerian non-believers, for so long the dominant force in the Paris-based thinktank, are banished to a distant land. Common sense has prevailed.</p>

<p>As revolutions go, it has taken a while. Five years ago ago, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/sep/08/oecd-support-for-uk-backs-both-osborne-and-balls-policy">the priority was public spending cuts</a>. George Osborne was lauded. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/06/oecd-george-osborne-uk-austerity">Then there was muted criticism</a>. Now the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion">austerity delusion, as the economist Paul Krugman</a> called it, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment">is no longer a central tenet of thinking</a> at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation &amp; Development, the club formed to provide advice to 34 wealthy countries.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/oecd-calls-for-less-austerity-and-more-public-investment">OECD calls for less austerity and more public investment</a> </p>

<p>Replacing calls for changes to the labour market (wages cuts) and reconfigurations of state provision (welfare cuts) is the belief that global economy lacks demand and only a coordinated effort by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/g20">G20</a> group of countries, taking the opportunity to borrow money at ultra-low interest rates, can bring it back.</p>

<p>An increase in demand, which is another way of saying an increase in household and business spending and investment, is needed since it became obvious that the backdoor stimulus orchestrated by central banks has long since run out of steam.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.oecd.org/economy/elusive-global-growth-outlook-requires-urgent-policy-response.htm">In its interim assessment of the global economy</a>, where it has downgraded growth this year and next, the OECD warned that only by acting together could Europe, the US, Asia and South America (there are no African members) drive up growth and with the extra tax receipts drive down debt.<br/></p>

<p>The coordination is needed because if one country goes for growth on its own, the extra spending can go on imports without a boost to exports, leading to a balance of payments deficit. The better growth story can also act as a magnet for economic migrants, causing social problems and – without strong labour market protections – help foster a low-wage, low-productivity economy. Oops, that’s a reasonably accurate picture of Britain today.</p>

<p>If all OECD countries adopted roughly the same plan, then all countries could grow without the attendant problems.</p>

<p>So it is ironic that Osborne fights to prevent any meaningful efforts at coordination. That’s not to say he would be dismayed if the world economy was growing more robustly. It’s just that his cavalier sensibilities make such agreements an anathema.</p>

<p>If the OECD sticks to its guns, next week’s G20 finance ministers meeting in Shanghai should see enough fireworks to rival Chinese new year. The austerians, led by the indefatigable German finance boss Wolfgang Schäuble, are still slugging for their cause. Schäuble is the driving force in Brussels, which makes for a fiery contest between some big beasts.</p>

May-be there is some misunderstanding. Personally I might be even more cynic -like nearly everybody seems to be nowadays. As I have been involved in (fiscal)policymaking I know by experience that it is always a matter of mice and cats and loopholes.But being cynic might lead to easy fatalism (in the way of: not caring and voting any more)or adoption of an all-covering belief like 'Brexit' being an antibioticum.So I do try to be critic and realistic,as life goes on with children etc.The British situation might be,like I indicated before, somewhat different from other countries. You have an one-party government in complete power for 5 years. Opposition does not count if the government-party is not divided.In some countries one has more parties and coalitions,who need over 50% of the votes of the people and parliaments.This structure enables some more control.The EU-Commission is in a similar situation: Juncker is not the boss who can do just like he wants it. Other commissioners (Scandinavian and French) are in charge concerning anti-trust and corporate tax avoidance policies.Everybody knows that f.i. Luxembourg and the Netherlands are more or less tax-havens.The European Parliament pressed the Commission to give it insight in relevant documents.Moreover other countries might be interested to get their part of the tax. And in general it is also a matter of fair competition- between companies and between countries having both their own interests.It is evident that Google did lobby and Republicans did try to influence: so everything will be regarded in a critic way.Alltogether it is still possible that loopholes will occur.The cats and mice-game will go on forever- that is inherent to taxes.I am writing this all because I experienced that persons from every country tend to project the structures and experiences towards other countries and the EU. In fact there are unexpected differences,which might make the matter more complicated.No way it is a matter of superiority: every system and every country has strong and weak sides and a mix of it. Policies concerning multinationals have already a long history: I remind international actions of trade unions in 1970.However their power accumulated.The OECD- and EU- measures might be a more or less small step,but justified.

Well, it worked, didn't it? We paid off that debt, but then came World War I debt and World War II debt. I was thinking more of a way of having a one-off tax with a fixed amount, because, like income tax, if you have a general tax it'll go on for ever.

"And what happens if you spend less on debt servicing, and more on "public services"? The pile of debt for our children to repay grows, meaning they or at the latest their children will eventually have to state reducing that pile - they'll not have the luxury of granting themselves perks at the expense of their grandchildren."

I hear you, I remain a cynic on this matter. "Loopholes" have never appeared in legislation by mistake, but rather as a deliberate result of lobbying and influence peddling. If one closes, I assume it is only because another one has been opened that the public will only discover or understand later.

Likely less than that, it compounds faster than they can service it. Interest payments WILL surpass our spending on healthcare, if you include private debt, its already many times larger than our GDP with interest payments exceeding £300 billion. We need Mathematically Perfected Economy

You've misunderstood austerity. It has nothing to do with how many taxes you charge. Austerity is about, whatever the size of the tax budget, spending less of it on public services and infrastructure, and spending more of it on paying down the debt. (Although all these "austerity" countries have so far sucked at paying off their debt).

Certainly I agree with you in many ways, also concerning the OECD-report you linked to above - it is clear and a shame that many countries did neglect what was going to happen and did happen.Anyway something is happening concerning the corporate tax avoidance.As I understood by an article in the Guardian about a week ago, many more than the34 OECD-countries did agree on the OECD-report concerning this issue.The EU -Commission did and does investigate multinationals already for years in the framework of their anti-trust legislation. Many multinationals have been obliged to pay fines in these cases, for instance (Microsoft v EU-Commission Wikipedia) had to pay over a billion. In this framework corporate tax avoidance can be regarded like state-support or subsidies. The EU-Commission investigates Google also.Returning to the OECD: the EU made use of their corporate tax avoidance measures-agreement for new measures (last week of January) and announced more to publish in april.Certainly one can mistrust Juncker. But he is not 'the leader' of the EU like Cameron is the leader of the UK. He can not block things: 28 memberstates,the other commissioners and the European Parliament do have power and influence.Of course the proof of the pudding is in the eating.That is: the European Parliament got -after some pressure- insight in tax-avoidance-documents, Spiegel-on-line.de reported (they have special reports on the EP).And you might have seen the report on Amazon in yesterday's Guardian.Surely, I am not to optimistic but something is happening and going to happen and it is interesting whether the UK-government is trying to escape this happening,while it also tries to protect the City and Hollande/France is protestant.

Redistribution is actually a fantastic way to get the economy moving as almost 100% of it gets spent in the real economy and a large proportion of it comes back to the government. Money for the wealthy tends to get squirreled away, moved abroad or bunged into ever inflating asset bubbles. Not saying that we should take everything from the rich but if you're looking for productive investment, give it to the poor.

Redistibution eh? sounds bad, eh? but like investment it means taking money and putting it somewhere, and could be done well or badly.

Ah, the multiplier. The effect is, of course, contingent upon the marginal propensity to save. Austerity reduces the capability to save and low interest rates discourage saving. The result is an economy which, over the full economic cycle, (trough to trough) may actually be inert, or in negative growth.

Hi Andy, you seem to have left our discussion on how the NHS is funded. You claimed that National Insurance contributions were not part of the funding mechanism and quoted the Annual Accounts of the National Insurance Fund as your evidence. I have checked your source and, sadly, you are very wrong. See below:

The OECD, along with the central banks is still supporting the lie of economy; i.e. allowing banks to steal our promissory notes and republish the money as a debt to themselves, plus charge compound interest. Until the issuing is restored to the people they are supporting a police of *keeping* people poorer than they should be in an economy subject to perpetual price inflation, volumetric deflation, and excess taxation to service the national debt to the very same banks.

now you're getting desperate. for household debt, see http://www.bbc.com/news/business-25152556, for example, and note that it is compared to income. my point was that the article is confused about what Osborne did after 2008, nothing more, although based on your last comment it seems you don't believe there has been any austerity, with the exception of 2011, quickly reversed? economics absolutely is a science, it's just harder than natural sciences because it deals with decision making by human beings. and while the eurozone is a catastrophe in the making, the uk is doing as well as it's ever done (note the complaint is that real wages aren't increasing, not that they've ever been consistently falling, etc). you mean it's not good enough for you - well, when was it ever?



Author::::TheSpidermonkey
DateTime::::2016-02-19T09:50:22Z
Or to try to address your point as succinctly as possible- Osborne did the right thing, reluctantly, late and while pretending he wasn't. Because of that it wasn't nearly as effective as it could have been.

I was only vaguely aware of the New Deal, thanks for pointing me to research it more. Seems like the smart moves there were - as you say - making it an extremely positive message, and also investing in infrastructure projects which would have a return (albeit one hard to quantify) once recovery had happened.

That's a very new labour spin on the situation. In 2007 our debt payments were about £28bn a year, 8 years later they are £60bn a year with far lower inflation and interest rates. In 2 years time they are projected to be £70bn. Wait till interest rates and inflation return to normal levels. I wonder what year debt interest payments will overtake spending on health??? I'd say 15 years time.

I was calling Osbornomics bullshit. But FWIW, I don't think economics is a "serious science". None of its theories are tested experimentally, and it's about as much use for predicting what's going to happen as a newspaper horoscope. It's a classic pseudoscience.

as a percentage of GDP, which is the number that matters, household debt has fallen since the recession. the trend in real wages is going to continue, obviously, because unemployment is now so low. and none of what you say is addressing my point, which was about Keynesian demand management. just bcz you don't like scientific ideas doesn't mean you can dismiss them as bullshit, anymore than a denier can dismiss global warming or a creationist can dismiss evolution - economics is a serious science whether you understand it or not

nonsense. household debt is falling, employment is at record highs, and real wages are rising at 2% per year. note however that the 'quality' if the recovery is not the point - even if your description was accurate, according to Keynes in a severe recession monetary policy will be ineffective ('liquidity trap') and the danger of a deflationary spiral (see: Greece) means the only way to recover the drop in aggregate demand is government deficit spending. according to this article, did the uk follow Keynes' prescription or not? If we did, you can't mock Osborne for not understanding Keynes (every Keynesian did btw, including Larry summers, Paul krugman etc); if we didn't, how come aggregate demand clearly has recovered?



Author::::TheSpidermonkey
DateTime::::2016-02-19T01:59:36Z
Because it's not a recovery, and the growth is unsustainable. What do you think's actually growing in the UK? Is it productivity? Nope. Manufacturing, balance of payments? Hell no. Is it house prices, personal debt and bullshit low wage non-jobs? Bingo! And because those non-jobs don't pay enough to live on, they're dependent on government handouts. Hence the fact that after 6 years of a vicious assault on the sick and disabled, they've hardly made a dent in "welfare", and the debt continues to rise. Is the UK supposed to keep importing cheap labour indefinitely to fuel growth? Are all countries supposed to grow by importing cheap labour from each other?

This is not a joke or a wise crack - our leaders, the leaders of Europe and the EZ are utter failures as regards the economy of the various countries and in particular at the EU level.
