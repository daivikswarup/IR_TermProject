EDF unions call for Hinkley Point project to be postponed




DateTime::::2016-03-07T14:36:23+0000



<p>Union leaders at the French energy company EDF have called for investment in Britain’s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to be delayed for at least two years, warning that it represents a threat to the company’s future.</p>

<p>Workers’ representatives say the sudden <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/hinkley-investment-decision-soon-says-edf-chief-after-finance-director-resigns">resignation of EDF finance director Thomas Piquemal</a> has revealed that doubts over the feasibility of the controversial project go right to the top.<br/></p>

<p>“The resignation of such a high-ranking executive is pretty spectacular and shows the disagreement even at the highest levels,” Serge Gianorsi, trade union secretary for the Force Ouvrière union at EDF, told the Guardian.</p>

<p>“Until now, managers have not expressed themselves publicly, but we have known for a long time that our position is shared by the majority of specialists inside and outside the company.”<br/></p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edfs-hinkley-point-dilemma-adds-to-project-woes">EDF's Hinkley Point nuclear nightmare adds to company's woes</a> </p>

<p>The union leader’s warning was backed up by Martin Young, an analyst with the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, who said proceeding with the Hinkley project would verge on “insanity”. </p>

<p>“The European electricity industry faces unprecedented challenges and change. EDF is not immune from these challenges, and we believe needs to act to a greater degree than has been proposed. Against that backdrop, to proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity. M Piquemal’s resignation arguably suggests exactly that,” wrote Young in a briefing on the company.</p>

<p>Gianorsi is the latest union leader to express deep misgivings about the Hinkley Point project, and to question the French government’s insistence that it go ahead.</p>

<p>He added that if the French state, which owns roughly 85% of EDF, did not step back from the deal “there will be very heavy consequences for the future of the company and staff”.</p>

<p>In January, EDF announced it was laying off 4,000 workers over the next two years. Last summer, the French government and EDF were forced to step in with a multibillion-euro package to rescue Areva, France’s designer and builder of nuclear reactors that had been hit by competition from foreign rivals and a plunge in demand for nuclear reactors following the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima">Fukushima</a> disaster.<br/></p>

<p>Marie-Claire Cailletaud, of the powerful CGT Energie union at EDF, agreed the UK project must be delayed.</p>

<p>“We have already said it is urgent that this project be postponed because we feel the current state of EDF’s nuclear branch and the company’s financial situation make it dangerous to launch this right now,” Cailletaud told Europe 1 radio.</p>

<p>“We know this view is shared at the top level of the company but that people don’t feel free to express themselves. So, I imagine this is a way for Mr Piquemal to show his disagreement.”<br/></p>

<p>On Monday, EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said he wants to reach a final decision soon on investing in Britain’s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant after Piquemal’s resignation cast further doubt on the French energy company’s ability to fund the £18bn project.</p>

<p>Levy said he regretted the “hastiness” of Piquemal’s departure. Piquemal resigned because he believed pursuing the world’s most expensive nuclear project could threaten the group, whose finances are already stretched by rising debt.</p>

<p>The finance chief’s departure increased the feeling of crisis surrounding the Hinkley project, which is seen as vital for Britain to keep the lights on. If the plan were to collapse, it would be a serious blow to the UK government, which has offered generous guarantees to build two reactors at the site in Somerset.<br/></p>

<p>When asked if she could guarantee that there would be no additional costs for UK taxpayers, David Cameron’s official spokesperson pointed to the discussions that were under way with the French government.</p>

<p>“I am not going to speculate about the resignation of one individual, that is a matter for EDF,” she said, and insisted that it was clear from François Hollande at the UK-France summit in Amiens last week that it had “the full support of the French government”. </p>

<p>EDF’s battered share price fell 6.5% on Monday after Piquemal’s resignation was revealed over the weekend. The company’s shares have more than halved from €22 to €10 in the past year as concerns have mounted about its finances.</p>

<p>In a deal supported strongly by the chancellor, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne">George Osborne</a>, EDF joined forces with the Chinese utility CGN in October to construct the reactors. But many industry figures now believe the project is on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>EDF <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed">said in October it expected to take a final decision and start deploying engineers at Hinkley Point in November</a>. But the company has still not signed a final contract as fears have mounted about its financial strength.<br/></p>

<p>In an emailed statement, Levy said: “With the support of its state shareholder, EDF confirms it is studying the investment in the two Hinkley Point reactors in the best financial conditions for the group, with the aim of announcing a final investment decision soon,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-edf-britain-nuclear-cfo-idUKKCN0W90SB">Reuters reported</a>.</p>

<p>On top of its large debts, EDF is grappling with a collapse in power prices, cost overruns on a nuclear project in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a> and upgrades costing tens of billions of euros on its domestic reactors. Piquemal’s resignation raises grave doubts about EDF’s ability to carry out the project, which the UK government is relying on to meet the country’s energy needs.</p>

<p>Levy <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/edf-extends-life-of-four-nuclear-reactors-hinkley-point-decision">said last month a decision on Hinkley Point was “coming closer”</a> as EDF reported a 68% plunge in annual profit and cut its dividend. The company said its net debt had increased by €3.2bn (£2.5bn) to €37.4bn.</p>

<p>EDF union leaders say the state and company should wait until France’s first European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) go online at Flamanville around 2018 – six years late – to evaluate their safety and efficiency before agreeing to build them in Britain.</p>

<p>“It will take at least two to three years to see how they work and to evaluate the technology and a minimum of security,” Gianorsi said.</p>

<p>“We consider that EDF is not in a position, financially or industrially, to launch the Hinkley Point project.”<br/></p>

Much as I love the Chinese I don't want them building a dirty bomb in the middle of Britain. In fact I don't want any nuclear shit here. Any nation that is prepared to take the risk however small of rendering its territory uninhabitable for centuries deserves to perish.

EDF has nothing to worry about. George Osborne would lose face if Hinkley was abandoned and however much the shortfall, however many tens of billions are needed to prop this white elephant up, they will be found. Nothing is more important than saving the face of such an important man in the Conservative hierarchy.

Urmmm. The evidence is staring you in the face but you are too fixated on free market, privately owned utilities to see what is happening.Indeed the whole article above is addressing a situation where the UK has not invested in future energy needs whilst profits and prices have soared.Evidence aplenty.

How much of our money does EDF get to walk away with, even in the event of a cancelled contract? The sort of deals this government signs up to (such as multi-million pound - but never actually eventuating - IT projects), I wouldn't be surprised if there's a clause offering its directors a 'disappointment' payout. And this is the 'party of business' . . .

It wasn't just the destruction of our coal mining industry though was it? Since the privatisation of the energy sector, profits & shareholder dividends have been the priority over and above investing in the future, which is now becoming obvious, even to folk like Huzar.For the fifth largest economy this is an unbelievable situation.

It looks like the choice for Her Majesty's Government will be between effectively nationalising this project, in a doubtless very expensive attempt to recreate a domestic nuclear industry, hoping that the Chinese will step in to lead the project, or abandoning civil nuclear power in the UK and looking for alternative source of electricity.

The cost per megawatt hour (MWh) generated is often quoted at £92.50. However, this is in 2012 prices. The price inflates at a rate equivalent to CPI. If the CPI returns to 2% over the period as most analysts expect then the cost per MWh in 2025 will be £120/MWh.

Britain built the first commercial viable nuclear power station the world in the 1950's Windscale this was just after the war when we were still on Rationing and the country was broke we existed on the marshall plan which meant we had money coming into the UK from America .we are the 5/6 largest economy in the world and very wealthy this government can find billions for crossrail and HS2 why doesn't the UK fianance and build this power satation ourselves I am sure this government can find the 18 billion to build it we could even borrow the 18 billion we would not have to pay double the price for the electricity it produces and be in hock to China and France

Can we know call the whole farce off and promise the same terms for electricity prices (3 x current wholesale prices for the next 35 years) to renewable energy projects up to a cap of 3.2 GW? With those levels of guaranteed return we would soon have committed renewable energy power stations filling the gap.

Whilst sharing your disgust and dismay on the broad point Ron, I'd ask why the British government isn't continuing to support the world leading Carbon Capture and Storage research which the UK (to say nothing of the planet!) desperately needs...and which would, if successful, allow us to dig up the hundreds of years worth of fuel under our feet and remain self sufficient in energy until our great great grandchildren are under that very same turf!?
