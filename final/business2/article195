ECB under mounting pressure to step up eurozone support

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank">European Central Bank</a> is under growing pressure to step up support for the eurozone’s flagging economy after the bloc slipped back into negative inflation in February.</p>

<p>The surprise drop in prices marked the third time in a year that inflation has turned negative, fanning fears that the eurozone is headed for all-out deflation – a sustained period of falling prices. The news cemented market expectations that the ECB would use its meeting next week to inject fresh cash into the single currency bloc and to cut a key interest rate further into <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/negative-interest-rates-what-you-need-to-know">negative territory</a>.</p>

<p>Headline inflation dropped to -0.2% in February, down from 0.3% in January, according to an early estimate from statistics office Eurostat. That contrasted with forecasts for a reading of zero in a Reuters poll of economists. </p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/oil-price-dips-below-28-to-13-year-low-as-markets-brace-for-iranian-supply">Low energy prices</a> were the main factor behind the drop, but price pressures in other areas of the economy played a part. There was also a drop in core inflation – taken as a guide to underlying price – adding to signs that low inflation was becoming more entrenched as eurozone economies battled with sluggish global demand from a fresh slowdown and the lingering impact of the last financial crisis. </p>

<p>Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices of unprocessed food and energy, fell more than expected to 0.8% from 1% in January and was its lowest since April last year.</p>

<p>Economists said the inflation numbers raised questions over the firepower of central banks to revive growth and prices. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/deflation">Deflation</a> concerns central bank policymakers because it can lead to consumers delaying spending in the anticipation of good becoming cheaper, creating a cycle of diminishing demand that hits economic growth.</p>

<p>This year will be the fourth year of inflation undershooting the ECB’s target of close to 2%, said Anatoli Annenkov, economist at French banking group Société Générale. There were no limits to the ECB’s willingness “but clear limits to its effectiveness”, he said. “Despite its best efforts, the ECB’s challenge to break the backbone of lowflation remains a tall order. Looking set to miss its target for a fourth year this year, we expect it to miss it for another four years, at least, without the help of more substantial economic reform. That won’t stop the ECB from doing what it must according to its self-imposed target, but with markets increasingly unconvinced, we are approaching the ‘effective’ limit of the ECB’s tools.”</p>

<p>The inflation figures follow warnings from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf">IMF</a> and the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/oecd">OECD</a> that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/24/imf-urges-uk-to-ease-austerity-should-economy-slow-further">governments cannot rely</a> on low interest rates and money-printing programmes to shore up growth. A weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the G20 group of countries ended with a similar statement that “monetary policy alone cannot lead to balanced growth”. But the policymakers failed to come up with a concrete plan of how they might revive a sluggish world economy.</p>

<p>The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, used his speech at the Shanghai meeting to insist <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/bank-of-england-chief-accuses-g20-of-failing-to-enact-reforms-to-boost-growth">central bankers still had ammunition left</a> to boost growth. But he too argued for more help from governments. <br/></p>

<p>This week marks seven years of UK interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and Carney has hinted that he is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/23/bank-of-england-could-cut-interest-rates-to-zero-but-not-below-says-mark-carney">prepared to cut the base rate further</a> but has ruled out following the trend seen in other countries for negative rates, where depositors are effectively charged for parking their money. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/bank-of-japan-shocks-markets-by-adopting-negative-interest-rates">Bank of Japan</a> recently joined the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession.</p>

<p>The US <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> raised interest rates <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike-close-call-minutes">in December</a>, amid signs of a strongly growing US economy. But a string of poor economic figures since then raised doubts about any future rate-rises and even prompted some economists to speculate the move could be reversed.</p>

<p>The ECB meets again next week to decide its next move and its chief, Mario Draghi, has already indicated the central bank will announce moves to inject <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/ecb-interest-rate-hold-steadies-markets">fresh stimulus into the eurozone</a>. Economists expect the Frankfurt-based body to expand its <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/22/what-is-quantitative-easing">quantitative easing</a> programme – where it pumps money into the economy by buying up assets from financial institutions – and to further cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.4%. Another reduction in the deposit rate means it would be charging banks more to hold their money overnight.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>The weak core inflation figure “pretty much seals the deal on additional monetary easing” at next week’s meeting, said Teunis Brosens at ING bank. “The weakening of core inflation shows the real and present danger that cheap oil will cause low inflation to become ingrained in eurozone price and wage dynamics. This is especially bad for debt-laden households, businesses and governments in Southern <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a>, which will have little scope to ‘inflate away’ their debt burden by increasing nominal wages,” Brosens said.</p>

Draghi will put the 'red' before the Bull market to keep holding it up...but with lander debt worse than 2007 crisis levels, the risk of a total run-out is very high. The problem is the markets have gotton to frenzied sharks, who won't accept Draghi, the EZB meister from not doing anything other than keep giving bait. It's a shocking ponzi system.

Central bankers *WANT* everyone to get cheeper stuff, because deflation makes assets more valuble, as opposed to inflation that eats away at the value of assets.

The problem does not lie with central banks. It lies with the neoliberals you elect into government who refuse to enact appropriate fiscal policy.

Ahem no...that is not true. In the 50s the countries used financial repression to get rid of their wartime debts...That meant high taxes on capital and high incomes and capital controls...and with the corresponding boom the rest was inflated away.There was no printed money brings prosperity then...So no, I'm not invoking Weimar...but QE and printing money to pay for the deficit isn't the holy grail...if it were, somebody would use it to greater effect...

To my eyes the problem with servicing debts is that it doesn't lead to any long-term changes. What happens if private debt rises again? More helicoper money?

Wow, that's one hell of a drop, the euro-skeptics never mentioned that. I guess it'll make the UK more attractive for expat Brits visiting like me (if I can remain one after losing EU residency rights). Though custom controls would mean that it probably wouldn't be worth buying stuff online from the UK. I guess it'll make property cheaper for foreigners to start buying up the UK for a change.

Actually, I think servicing ones debts is probably a perfect idea..... The problem is that if people actually went and bought stuff straight away, then the huge amount of demand this would create would be a massive shock and prices would sky rocket - there would be nothing on the shop shelves.

This view is of course complete and utter crap that fiscal stimulus from the public sector will in itself right a broken economy the only thing that is certain is an increase in sovereign debt and we've been there already. Government records in identifying meaningful projects is notoriously poor, look at Spain and Greece. Construction and infrastructure project of earlier fiscal experiments have been a useful way of pumping demand into an economy by building confidence and employment, that won't happen today.

If nobody buys the stuff then prices decreases until they can decrease no more (as the company goes unprofitable), which leads to the company often making efficiency gains to get back into profitability, therefore making more stuff cheaper. This is deflation - our central bankers are dead set against everyone getting more stuff cheaper, because despite the fact every arsehole in the world can't wait until later to put stuff on their credit card, they think the lure of getting something 1% cheaper next year will put people off buying it now.
