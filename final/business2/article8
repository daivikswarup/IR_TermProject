British winemakers urge George Osborne to do his duty




DateTime::::2016-03-11T16:58:18+0000



<p>Anyone looking for an excuse to spend big on a bottle of wine should offer a silent prayer to the UK tax system.</p>

<p>Whether it’s Blue Nun or Romanée-Conti, £2.05 of every bottle of still wine sold in the UK – and £2.63 for sparkling wine – goes to the exchequer in excise duty. For comparison, French wine-lovers pay just tuppence a bottle and Italians pay nothing at all. Indeed, the tax on wine is so high in the UK relative to the rest of Europe that British drinkers fork out about two thirds of all duty levied across the continent.</p>

<p>Another way of expressing this is that the wine in a £5 bottle bought in Britain costs only 47p. The rest of the price tag is excise duty, VAT, packaging and logistics and, of course, profit for the retailers. A very small proportion of your money actually goes towards pleasing your palate. The only way for true oenophiles to get more bang for their Burgundy, it follows, is to splash out on the good stuff.</p>

<p>But what is good news for anyone looking to justify expensive tastes is bad news for Britain’s small but <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/16/english-wine-industry-vineyards-sales-6m-bottles">fast-growing clutch of winemakers</a>. Now, with wine duty projected to break through the £4bn this year for the first time, Britain’s vintners are calling for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne">chancellor George Osborne</a> to give them a shot in the arm.</p>

<p>At <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.chapeldown.com/">Chapel Down</a> winery in Kent, they are blending the 2015 vintage for bottling and pruning ahead of the summer, all the time with one eye on next week’s budget. This is the biggest winery in the UK, with an output of about 1m bottles a year. Chapel Down has thrived here in verdant Kent, dubbed the Garden of England, where relatively mild weather and helpful topography – south-facing slopes – combine to present one of the few opportunities for viticulture in the country.</p>

<p>Half-year profits were up this year, albeit to a relatively meagre £84,000, while Chapel Down wines have won gold medals at several international awards. But chief executive Frazer Thompson thinks the company and its peers could be forging even further ahead were it not for the harsh duty regime.</p>

<p> “It [high wine duty] does stifle innovation and put up barriers,” he says. “Wine has been seen as something that is easy to tax because it was for wealthy people. But wine is for everybody now. The danger we face is that people drive straight past our vineyard on their way to France to buy cheap bottles.”</p>

<p>Thompson believes that if UK winemakers could convince people to buy English sparkling wine instead of champagne, £200m in sales could be repatriated. The opportunity is even greater when still wine is added to the mix. He is throwing his weight behind a call from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wine">Wine</a> and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) for a 2% cut to excise duty on wine when George Osborne delivers his budget next week.</p>

<p>The trade body says a freeze on the duty imposed last year has encouraged more sales and garnered an extra £118m in tax revenue within 10 months. A cut, it believes would ease the burden on wine growers and boost the Treasury’s coffers at a stroke by boosting wine consumption further.</p>

<p>Michael Saunders, chief executive of the independent drinks distributor Bibendum PLB, agrees that the chancellor has an opportunity to take the shackles off.</p>

<p>“Wine duty is holding back the UK drinks industry in a big way,” he said. “The wine industry supports 300,000 jobs in this country and the production of wine in the UK is exploding – creating even more investment, jobs and potential for export. As wine lovers and consumers ourselves, we want to see people being able to go out and enjoy wine at a reasonable price.”</p>

<p> But according to Chapel Down boss Frazer Thompson, the problem goes far beyond duty. While the environment secretary, Liz Truss, has <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/07/english-wine-exports-100m-farming-growth-elizabeth-truss">showered the UK’s fast-growing wine industry with praise</a>, other parts of the establishment are not as supportive.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing more embarrassing than being served Peroni and Italian wine at a British embassy but it happens,” says Thompson.</p>

<p>As well as amending the wine list at British embassies, Thompson would like to see the government put some money behind research and development, to build on the existing expertise in fruit growing and horticulture in Kent.</p>

<p>Cool climate wines are in fashion at the moment and Thompson feels that with support from politicians, the UK could take a leading role among wine-producing nations where the sun does not always shine.</p>

<p>He would also like to see wine duty collected at the point of sale, like VAT. That would transfer the costly administrative burden of collecting the tax from small companies such as Chapel Down to supermarket giants with a greater capacity to absorb such costs.</p>

<p>Measures such as these, he believes, would help build on the rapid progress that is being made in English and Welsh winemaking. British vintners produced 6.3m bottles in 2014 and hope to double that to around 12m in 2020. Over the same period, they are aiming for a tenfold increase in exports to £30m. In theory, there is no reason why these producers can’t defy expectation by producing award-winning wines regularly.</p>

<p>First and foremost though, this industry wants to see the chancellor extend an olive branch. Without that support, the risk is that the UK’s nascent wine boom could wither on the vine.</p>

PM Cameron must go. He is a puppet of the EU and its crazy concept. The billions of pounds of government tax revenues that are paid in fees to the EU, will when the Brexit occurs allow for reduced tax on such items as the 5 pound bottle of British wine.

Most English and Welsh wine does not come into the cheapest categories in the supermarkets. Some are quite expensive so it could be argued that it is the producers of cheap foreign wines which are the losers here and the consumers of those wines.In any case, the wine sellers and producers are likely to be on a hiding to nothing because the last thing the government will want at the moment would be the bad publicity which would ensue if they reduced the price of any of the cheaper types of alcoholic drink.Cider is an example of alcohol pricing which goes back a long way. Cider, mostly produced in England, used to be the cheapest way of consuming alcohol and the government altered the taxation banding many years ago with the deliberate intention of making the alcohol more expensive so that the alcohol price in cider would be roughly equivalent to beer. Of course, the industry responded by producing cheaper ciders so the unit alcohol price of cheap cider is still low.No point in complaining. The moral is that, if you want to support the exchequer, buy lots of cheap booze but if you want to support the industry, buy a smaller quantity of expensive booze. Of course, if you are rich, you can buy a large quantity of expensive booze and support both.

Having said that, in old Roman legends Bacchus himself is supposed to be born nearby my Grandmothers winery....also in the 80'ies I drove trough the Dao Valley and it was common there to send children to school with a bottle of wine as it was cheaper then milk...'the truth lies in the wine' what old legends say :-))))

Is it the case that sugar in some form or other (susswine?) is added to get the fermentation to occur, like they do with some German wines, because the grapes don't contain enough sugar on their own?

LIDL do pint bottles of very quaffable Woodgates cider and Perry for 89p and their cloudy (scrumpy, basically) version, 7.5% alcohol, at £1.35 is bloody brilliant.

Whilst living in Britain I just fermented supermarket fruit juices and produced a bottle of Rose type wine for about 50p, which was of a similar quality to the cheap crap you get for £5 in a supermarket.

Unlikely as British Wine is the blended stuff that tramps in bus stops drink, English and Welsh Wine is grown in the UK using recognised ways no different to other quality wines.

The first elephant in the room is English & Welch wine can’t keep up with demand, there’s no wine lake because they are undercut by other producers. If the tax was cut it would just translate into higher profits so asking the government to fund additional research is taking the piss. Also you can’t just say only E&W wines benefit from the tax reduction, all EU wines would have to (and probably most others), so E&W still ends up expensive relative to other wines.

You bet! Sacramental wine produced by religious brothers is often fortified with spirits up to 18% by volume ‘to avoid spoiling during transportation from the producer to the consumer’ – they know what’s good (for them).

Live in Spain now, visited East Anglia, went to buy a bottle of wine. The cheapest was £4 ...was shocked. Then it went way up from there. I can pay £2.50 here and get a very nice bottle of wine.

When I last looked, food in the UK was zero-rated for VAT. It's supposed to be positively rated, according to the Treaty of Rome, but Thatcher went in there, handbag flying, and insisted 0 was a positive number until the rest gave up.

That's right. Because 'British Wine' is made from imported concentrate, carried around the country in great big oil tankers, and then fermented and bottled to be sold dirt cheap and revolting.

Binge drinking is caused by high prices not low ones. People who don't normally drink get tipsy easier, tipsy means control and inhibition go, resulting in an "ah fuck just this one time" attitude.

See my comment about how each country can choose to spread its tax collection (and tax rates) across different goods. There are winners and losers across the spread of goods and services depending on which country you live in. E.g. Scandinavian income taxes.
