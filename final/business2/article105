Morrisons returns to profit as sales rise

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons">Morrisons</a> has bounced back into profit after finally returning to sales growth in the final quarter of its financial year.</p>

<p>The Bradford-based supermarket chain revealed a pre-tax profit of £217m for the year to 31 January after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/12/morrisons-losses-soar-to-800m">a £792m loss in the previous 12 months</a>, when it was forced to close stores as sales slumped in the face of heavy competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl.</p>

<p>Sales for the year to 31 January fell 4.1% to £16.1bn after the group closed a net total of 20 stores. When the impact of store closures is stripped out, sales were still down 2% for the year, as Morrisons was forced to cut prices to become more competitive.<br/></p>

<p>But sales at stores open for more than 12 months rose 0.1% in the final quarter of the year, Morrisons first quarterly growth in four years. The chain enjoyed a strong Christmas bolstered by discounts on alcohol and a near-doubling of online sales via a partnership with Ocado. Morrisons said the sales rise had come from an increased number of customer visits and shoppers putting more in their baskets as it cut prices by an average of 3%.</p>

<p>David Potts, its chief executive, said: “By improving the shopping trip for customers, we have started the journey to turn around the business and make our supermarkets strong.”</p>

<p>He added that there were double-digit rises in sales of the supermarket’s Nutmeg clothing line, takeaway food, international specialities and gluten free foods, and that it was these areas that were helping to bring back shoppers. However, he warned that turning around Morrisons would take time and require more investment.</p>

<p>The chain invested £373m in price cuts and improving its products last year. Potts declined to say whether Morrisons would spend more or less this year, but he said more significant cuts were on the way.</p>

<p>Shares in Morrisons fell by 4.5% to 193p as investors realised profits would continue to be affected by price cuts and the company said it was ditching a promise to pay an annual dividend of at least 5p.</p>

<p>Underlying annual profits – which strip out the impact of one-off writedowns, restructuring costs and profits from the sale of unwanted properties – decreased almost 27% to £302m, slightly lower than the £308m analysts had expected.</p>

<p>Potts also gave a gloomy prognosis for the year ahead, saying: “Despite improving consumer confidence and the return of real wage increases and higher disposable income we are not assuming shopping habits will reverse. Deflation will persist.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/morrisons-sales-rise-over-christmas-trading-period">In January, Morrisons announced plans to close seven stores with the potential loss of almost 700 jobs</a> despite the surprise increase in sales over Christmas. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/01/morrisons-cuts-cost-supermarket-price-war">Last month it also cut prices on 1,000 products</a>, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>“There is a great deal more to do but the improvements we have made in quite a short time give me confidence in the future,” Potts said, adding that future investment was not all about price cuts. “We are pushing harder. We are not a one-club golfer and there are plenty of reasons to visit Morrisons.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/29/amazon-is-to-start-selling-fresh-and-frozen-morrisons-food">Morrisons announced last week it would make fresh and frozen food available on Amazon</a> within the next few months. This be through the online retailer’s Prime Now and Pantry services. Potts said Morrisons could sell its own label foods via Amazon or through its tie-up with petrol station operator Motor Fuel Group.</p>

<p>He also wants to expand services available at its stores by bringing in shoe menders Timpsons and exploring putting coffee shops or car mechanics into units within Morrisons’ car parks. The supermarket chain will also be putting more staff on tills to cut queues. </p>

<p>Simon Johnstone, senior analyst at Kantar Retail, said: “Morrisons’ biggest investment, both in terms of money and energy, continues to be the aggressive cutting of prices. This has allowed it to shore up falling sales and momentum looks likely to continue.</p>

<p>“With discounters Aldi and Lidl rapidly improving their fresh credentials and its supermarket peers continuing to cut prices on fresh and chilled foods, the onus is on Morrisons to supplement this new found price advantage with added service.”</p>

"Wrong"

Wrong, it's hammering the suppliers for price reductions, commercial income etc. You're right that it's not an 'investment' by Morrisons though.

By reputation Morrison's do have some poor older stores. However the more recently built or refurbished stores can more than compete with the other large chains. But you wouldn't pass a couple of Sainsbury's say to get to a Morrison's, and fundamentally they suffer from being behind the likes of Tesco in property dealings over the past 20 years.

Morrisons never made a loss they wrote off the profit against building that are not as valuable as they thought they where.

I still think that for the majority of people, supermarket loyalty means nothing more than "the nearest supermarket", or the one you pass.

I heard the CEO speaking on the radio about smiling staff but he's obviously not seen the sour-faced old trolls at our south coast store.

Have a look at the BBC article - are they talking about the same company?? Headlines seem exactly opposite. [BBC headline is "Morrison's profits hit ...]

They are still struggling to hold back the Aldi/Lidl horde in Bradford which is probably something to do with people not having as much money to spend so they go where they can afford to shop. Not sure that booze offers are anything to crow about. Shop at Morrisons- get cirrhosis. Backs up Tim Martin's arguments though - booze sold at below cost subsidised by expensive turkeys.

Made money on drink deals? Wow if that's the case why don't they have the same deals on butcher meat, vegetables and fruit?It really says something about the country if its only drink that makes people shop at this supermarket
