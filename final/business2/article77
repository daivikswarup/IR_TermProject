Virgin Money attempts to ease anxiety over buy-to-let mortgages

<p>Virgin Money has pushed back its expectations for a rise in UK interest rates by two years until 2018 and begun a feasibility study on launching current accounts.</p>

<p>As the bank reported a rise in profits for its first full year as a stock-market-listed company, the chief executive, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, also attempted to quell anxiety about its exposure to buy-to-let mortgages, which comprise 17% of its lending.</p>

<p>Its shares, which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/13/virgin-money-float-85m-richard-branson">were priced at 283p in the November 2014 float</a>, rose 6% to 361p in early trading after investors focused on a 53% rise in underlying profits to £160m and a dividend of 4.5p per share.</p>

<p>The underlying figure strips out £10.5m of share-based payments to staff from the flotation, £8m of strategic investments and £3.7m of share awards to departing senior staff, largely associated with the departure of finance director Lee Rochford.<br/></p>

<p>If those items are included statutory profits were £138m, a 306% rise from £34m a year earlier, when profits were dented by the £28m share-based payouts to staff from the stock market flotation and the extra £38m associated <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/nov/17/northern-rock-virgin-money-taxpayer">with taking over the “good part” of Northern Rock</a> in 2012.</p>

<p> Gadhia, who was paid £1.6m for 2015, said the bank had originally been operating on the basis that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/23/bank-of-england-could-cut-interest-rates-to-zero-but-not-below-says-mark-carney">base rates would have risen</a> by now, off the 0.5% historic low where they would have been for seven years by the end of this week. “We don’t expect base rates to go up in 2016 or 17,” she said. </p>

<p>She also said the bank was going to rely on wholesale funding to fuel its loan growth to enable Virgin to lend out more than it has in deposits. It intends to increase its loan to deposit ratio from 107% now to 115% during the year.</p>

<p>The bank launched a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/dec/16/virgin-money-current-account-market">basic current account</a> last year – one without an overdraft – and attracted 6,000 customers, and has begun a feasibility of study to look at offering a full services account. Gadhia advocates the end of “free in-credit banking” – where no fees are paid unless customers go overdrawn – because she said it made it more difficult to compete with the big banks.</p>

<p>The Competition and Markets Authority is investigating the industry and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/high-street-banks-survive-competition-inquiry">its preliminary findings last year</a> did not rule out the end of “free banking”. Gadhia said: “Our potential to grow profitably at scale in current accounts is currently limited by the structure of the UK current account market, including the low level of switching and the predominance of free-if-in-credit banking.”</p>

<p>She said Virgin’s buy-to-let lending was not to landlords with large numbers of properties and said the new<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-unveils-his-bold-plan-to-tackle-housing-crisis"> 3% stamp duty on buy-to-let </a>properties would not have a material impact on profits. Analysts are also watching for the impact of new rules being introduced by international banking regulators amid warnings it could reduce the profitability of such lending. </p>

<p>The bank also faces a higher tax bill because of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/biggest-banks-welcome-budget-reduction-in-bank-levy">8% surcharge on corporation tax also being introduced.</a> </p>

<p>“The year has seen the introduction of a new bank tax surcharge, the timetable for UK rate rises continues to be pushed back and we have seen regulatory concerns in the buy-to-let mortgage market,” Ghadia said. She has already expressed concern about the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/20/cameron-set-to-name-eu-referendum-date-after-cabinet-meeting">23 June referendum on the UK’s EU membership</a>. </p>

Buy some northern rock assets for a song off the govt, raise 500 million on floatation as a supposed challenger banking brand, be no different to any other high street bank, bar a supposed trendy brand, then cash out. Nice work.

Is this a demonstration of how a business can be made profitable if the loss making bits are taken away?
