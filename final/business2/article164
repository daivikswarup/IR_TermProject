Australian economy grew 3% in 2015 to defy end of mining boom

<p>Australia’s economy has weathered the end of the mining boom more strongly than expected after official figures showed that it grew by 3% in 2015.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/feb/29/australias-investment-figures-stink-but-one-area-smells-a-bit-sweeter">Australia's investment figures stink, but one area smells a bit sweeter | Greg Jericho</a> </p>

<p>Output rose 0.6% in the December quarter, boosted by a higher household and government spending, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5206.0">the Australian Bureau of Statistics said</a> on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The strong annual figure of 3% compared with forecasts of 2.6% made amid disappointing data for trade, building approvals and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/24/australias-wages-growth-slips-to-22-the-slowest-in-19-years-study-finds">wage growth</a> and after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/10/australian-share-market-enters-bear-territory-as-billions-wiped-off-value">weeks of turmoil on the local share market</a>.</p>

<p>The news helped boost the Australian dollar to US72.29c while the ASX/S&amp;P200 soared back through the 5,000-point barrier to finish up more than 2% at 5,021 points.</p>

<p>The data will be welcome news for the Turnbull government as it heads towards a federal election and will mean be less pressure on <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/01/reserve-bank-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-at-2-for-10th-straight-month">Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens</a> to reduce interest rates again despite suggestions that the bank’s next move would be a further cut.</p>

<p>Many economists had expected Australia’s economy to slow in 2015 as the mining boom finally ended and a once in a century level of business investment tailed off.</p>

<p>But the better than expected final quarter provided a robust end to the year and featured strong growth from the telecoms sector (up 2.7%), retail (1%) and arts and recreation (2.2%).</p>

<p>“The major contribution to economic growth this quarter came from household final consumption expenditure, which contributed 0.4 percentage points, and public gross fixed capital formation, which contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth,” the ABS said.</p>

<p>This growth helped offset a slump in private business investment (-3.3%), driven by a fall in new engineering construction (-12.3%). <br/></p>

<p>CommSec economist Craig James said Australia’s economy was now one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world.</p>

<p>“The latest result has provided a major confidence boost for Aussie families and businesses. Despite some perceptions to the contrary, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/australia-economy">Australian economy</a> is doing well. Not only was the September quarter result revised up to show growth of 1.1% in the quarter but the annual growth rate is now showing the fastest expansion in almost two years.”</p>

<p>JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy said lower petrol prices, rising house prices and falling saving rates were encouraging consumers to spend.</p>

<p>He said the impressive 3% annual growth rate was also due to a stronger-than-expected third quarter, when consumer spending was even higher than first thought. </p>

<p>“The thing that got revised higher there again was household consumption, which lifted to 0.9%,” he said.</p>

<p>RBA governor Glenn Stevens<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/01/reserve-bank-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-at-2-for-10th-straight-month"> said on holding the cash rate at 2.0% on Tuesday </a>that Australia had “reasonable prospects for continued growth”.<br/>James said the GDP figures supported Stevens’ comments and said the central bank was now less likely to ease monetary policy this year.<br/>“We expect the Australian economy to continue to pick up in 2016,” he said. “The chance of any rate cuts in the coming months is now highly diminished.”<br/></p>

Just wondering how much of this so called growth is selling houses to each other and laundering Chinese money through the Australian housing market before it finally goes belly up.Or maybe it is actual growth in production of local goods and services....not.

Noggie, if federal tax is lowered someone still has to pick up the tab for services YOU take for granted, and because most of these have been flogged off to profit gouging private enterprise, prices can only be expected to rise.You will pay one way or the other.

There is no evidence we are heading towards recession. And spending on health and education is at record high levels. Sure we have an ageing population and that is a challenge for any government. But the majority of Australians have done well in recent years as our economy has been envied across the rich world.

I don't think the ABS "considers" the average wage to be $80kpa. That IS the average wage as generated from the data it has at hand. It is an entirely different number to the median wage, or any other figure you may consider to be more representative of the "average" or "typical" working stiff.

Not only are the 3 bears fully employed, they live in a $3m hut in Manly just a 10 minute walk to the beach. They have to walk because their large paws mean they can't operate the friggin parkmobile app on their smartphones, and even those that can get ripped off for parking when the car was in the drive, and you should try complaining.....you have more chance of getting a sympathetic hearing with Kim Jong-un.

OK. Well, I dont mean to be over-critical, and I wouldn't like readers criticising me, but think I can see what is going on here, and it isn't good news. There are good headline numbers for all the wrong reasons. These points I have made elsewhere in this thread. They make this rise in the $ a mystery to me. The economy is not in a very good place, and having a rising $ is not a good thing.

When ABS considers that the average wage is over $80,000 then these statisticians are certainly not living in the world inhabited by the majority of us on Award wages or the basic wage!

Hi - The spike in the dollar was a significant market response to the data so I included it in the piece. Because it's a straight news article it's not really the place to start discussing the pros and cons of the rising dollar, fascinating though that is. But that's where you readers can come in and can debate yourselves. It's a great thread so thanks for reading.

In last year’s May budget, and in the mid-year fiscal and economic outlook released last December, the government estimated wages growth in 2015-16 would be 2.5%.

In the December quarter, wages in the private sector grew by just 0.49% – the second lowest amount ever – bested only in the deep dark days of the global financial crisis in September 2009 And this low wages growth rather diminishes the government’s argument that it must urgently reduce spending in order to pay for income tax cuts to ameliorate the effects of bracket creep.

In the USA and Ireland the entire financial systems came close to collapse because of over exposure and lack of liquidity. Since Costello set up APRA here that couldn't happen because our banks are heavily regulated in these areas, which is why for example at the height of the global crisis our big four banks were among only 12 in the world to retain their AAA credit ratings. Deposits flooded in. Westpac went from being the 50th biggest bank in the world to the 9th in about a month. CBA started acquiring distressed assets. They had a ball. And since then the regs have been tightened even further. The comparison is completely spurious.

Sorry, but it isn't, and here's why...To have a collapse in house prices the market has to be flooded with properties for sale so that supply way outstrips demand. That can only come from a huge surge in defaults, repos, and people looking to bail because they can't pay the mortgage. That in turn can only happen under two circumstances; sky high interest rates, or sky high unemployment - without at least one of those, where will the defaults and bail outs to cause the massive over supply come from? And in Australia, neither is remotely likely in the next 3-5 years at least.I don't work in property, I have a small mortgage, and a drop in prices would in many ways be good for me because I have kids that I'm going to have to help to get on the ladder. But I've lived through a real collapse, and lost money, and I know what it looks and feels like, and it's not 3% growth, low interest rates, low inflation, low unemployment.

The growth is based on December figures and is a pathetic 0.6%. The terms of trade have fallen by 12% which basically means Australia is getting 12% less for its exports. If this trend of 0.6 or lower continues, we are looking at annual growth of around 2.5% for 2016. Now that the project construction phase of the mining boom is finished the Australian economy will be more subdued, particularly in terms of household consumption.

Intriguing figures appear regarding the fringe benefits tax (FBT) collected. Despite business profits suffering badly over the year — the worst annual decline in the 22 years for which data is available — expenditure on perks that incur FBT continued apace. The rise in 2014-15 in FBT was $270 million, for a total of $4.35 billion. That’s a healthy increase of 6.6%, compared with 4.0% the year before and 5.1% in 2012-13.

Total tax revenue the ATO collected in 2014-15 increased $15.2 billion to $337.3 billion, a rise of 4.7%. The greatest increase came from income tax on “total individuals”, up a whopping $14.3 billion from $163.6 billion to $177.9 billion. That’s a rise of 8.7%. The goods and services tax generated an extra 6.3% or $3.2 billion, up to $54.6 billion. So consumers are paying their share.
