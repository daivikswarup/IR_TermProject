Draghi has financial markets hoping bad news is really good news

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/15/japans-economy-shrinks-again-as-shinzo-abe-kickstart-plan-is-blown-off-course">Japan’s growth figures were bad.</a> The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.yahoo.com/china-jan-exports-slump-6-6-y-o-025148513.html">data for Chinese exports</a> was even worse. A signal for the financial markets to have another dose of the heebie-jeebies? Not a bit of it. This was one of those days when bad news was good news.</p>

<p>The thinking goes as follows. If the Japanese economy shrank by 0.4% in the final three months of 2015 and Chinese exports fell by more than 11%, policymakers will sit up and take notice. Central banks will stimulate activity by cutting interest rates, even when they are already negative, and by expanding their quantitative easing (QE) programmes.</p>

<p>Right on cue, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/15/market-turmoil-asian-stocks-soar-despite-japan-shrinking-14-live">Mario Draghi popped up before the European parliament </a>to administer a bit of his own soothing balm. Yes, of course, the European Central Bank (ECB) is abreast of what has been going on in the markets, and “will not hesitate to act” if necessary.</p>

<p>Markets took this as a promise from the ECB president that he will come up with more stimulus next month. More stimulus equals more growth equals higher corporate profits equals higher share prices.</p>

<p>A moment’s thought suggests this is a far from watertight thesis. For a start, financial markets should wait and see what Draghi does rather than get too excited about what he says. The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/03/ecb-stimulus-qe-negative-rates-mario-draghi-live">ECB disappointed in December </a>by not delivering as much extra stimulus as expected, in large part because Draghi ran into resistance from Germany.</p>

<p>Even if the ECB does come up with the goods and this is accompanied by more action from the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China, there is no guarantee that it will have any material effect. There has been no shortage of action from central banks these past seven years and, let’s be honest, the outcome has been disappointing.</p>

<p>Andrew Lapthorne, analyst at Société Générale, notes that one of the ploys being used by central banks – negative interest rates– is subject to the law of unintended consequences. Negative interest rates make holding government bonds attractive even when they are yielding next to nothing. Yet one of the rationales for QE is that it discourages investors from holding government bonds and encourages them to dabble in riskier assets.</p>

<p>All this prompts the conclusion that bad economic news really is bad news. In the current climate, there are really only two groups of people. Those who admit they don’t really have a clue what’s going on and those that don’t have a clue but pretend that they do. Central banks fall into the latter category.</p>

All news is good to the margin takers.

In short: The first world (particularly US, EU and Japan) play out an end-game of monopoly to please its major shareholders (the 1%) rather than consumers.

Our Goverments are in love with the financial markets and the major corporations because we live under a corporatist model. This is the Washington consensus and the global economic and trade framework which states have to sign.

I take it that we're on the cusp of another financial crash. Anyone with large deposits in any bank should be aware that the bail in is going to be used this time. Why are our Governments still in love with these financial markets? They have all morphed into quagmires of complex derivatives of "Pass The Parcel" Debt. They've contrived so much debt now that it will never be paid back. As long as the Central Banks keep printing money for these Debt Junkies then things will skitter along in this haphazard way until the wheels fall off. Meanwhile in the real world of people's lives these financial markets no longer serve any useful purpose. We'd be better shutting the whole thing down and organising our own money for the exchange of goods and commerce. The Bristol Pound is a useful template for local people to set up their own currency. We really don't need these Financial Markets, they'd be best moved to Las Vegas where they can gamble away to their hearts desire.

"Those who admit they don’t really have a clue what’s going on and those that don’t have a clue but pretend that they do. Central banks fall into the latter category."And the latter group seem to include all economists .

I wish this were addiction. But it's class war, an even more intractable problem.

The problem with addicts is that they rarely change their behaviour as long they can go away with it.

Doesn't that face just exude calmness, confidence and health in the financial markets?

Draghi should be more concerned with the euro zone and the effect of the UK referendum. The machinations of Cast Iron Cameron and his Cast Iron Guarantees may prove to really be all smoke and mirrors.http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/644346/Cameron-EU-deal-blocked-by-Brussels-Downing-Street-admits
