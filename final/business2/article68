Bank customers' overdraft fees could be capped, say regulators

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators">Regulators</a> have warned banks they could cap charges they levy on customers who dip into an unauthorised overdraft.</p>

<p>The warning from the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/competition-commission">Competition and Markets Authority</a> (CMA) came as it extended its investigation into the retail and small business banking sectors.</p>

<p>The inquiry was due to end in May but has now been pushed back to 12 August, after the publication in October <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/high-street-banks-survive-competition-inquiry">of a provisional report</a> that was criticised as an inadequate response to the dominance of the so-called big four.</p>

<p>Lloyds <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking">Banking</a> Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC have a 70% share of current accounts. Their dominance has not been cracked by challenger banks, which have taken only a 5% market share in 10 years.</p>

<p>As the CMA announced the three-month extension, it highlighted possible additional measures to make overdrafts fairer for customers. </p>

<p>“These include measures to help customers better understand and manage their use of overdrafts, requiring banks to offer grace periods during which customers can take action to avoid unarranged overdraft charges, requiring banks to give PCA [personal current account] customers a choice on whether to have an unarranged overdraft facility or not, and measures to limit maximum unarranged overdraft charges each month,” <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/56dd7b6040f0b6037900000e/Updates_on_the_retail_banking_investigation_-_March_2016.p">the CMA said</a>. </p>

<p>It said it needed the extra time after taking into consideration “the further work required to develop the analyses, and the further work required to develop a suitable package of remedies that is reasonable and comprehensive in addressing any findings of adverse effects on competition in the retail banking markets for PCA customers and SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises]”.</p>

<p>This was not enough to placate Which?, the consumer group that has been calling for radical changes to the sector. Its chief executive, Richard Lloyd, said: “This inquiry is now looking like a lost opportunity to deliver better banking for consumers.”</p>

<p>Comparing accounts offered by different current account providers is notoriously difficult because of the complex charges linked to overdrafts and other facilities. The CMA has been looking at ways for a price comparison service to be set up for small business customers. It said it favoured a move by Nesta, a charity backed by the National Lottery, to set up a fund to encourage the creation of a price comparison service for small businesses.</p>

<p>The investigation was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/18/banking-sector-review-watchdog-finance-competition">announced in July 2014</a> at a time of heightened political scrutiny of the sector and when the Labour party was calling for two new challenger banks to be set up. </p>

what get you in overdraft are the fees. ltb would apply them no matter of the date! Rather then take them when account is back in balance they apply charges when they are due.

It would be very simple for the banks to simply reject / refuse a payment that took a customer into "unauthorised" overdraft. But..... I seem to remember that they made something like £3 BILLION in charges one year? Sounds like 'unjust enrichment' to me. They have changed the way they charge, charging by the day, rather than a single charge, but then they inform by 2nd class post - 5 to 7 days, so they still get the same money. Life was simpler with cash.

OF all the problems with banks the regulator thinks that it is important they cap unauthorized overdraft charges. How about forcing them to spend much more money making their systems secure, or getting them to clear funds in a day.
