Seven-and-a-half years on, this is a distressingly fragile recovery




DateTime::::2016-02-13T14:59:21+0000



<p>Stock markets in turmoil. Nervous investors <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/turbulent-week-stock-markets-investors-safe-havens-gold-yen" title="">seeking out safe havens for their money</a>. Rumours swirling about <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/banking-shares-under-pressure-as-investors-fear-effects-of-global-downturn" title="">the vulnerability of some of the world’s biggest banks</a>. February 2016 is starting to smell suspiciously like early September 2008 and the days before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p>

<p>To be sure, the comparison between now and that September seven-and-a-half years ago, when the global financial crisis came to a head, is not exact. The big banks say they are better equipped to withstand losses now, a view supported by their official regulators. Rising energy prices were squeezing real incomes in the summer of 2008, but today consumers and businesses are getting quite a windfall from the drop in the price of crude.</p>

<p>But there have now been six weeks of unrelenting turmoil in the financial markets since the start of 2016 and the argument that this represents a fleeting spasm of panic before life returns to normal is wearing thin. The sell-off in shares, the collapse in commodity prices and the flight to gold have forced a long overdue reassessment of the sustainability of the uneven recovery that has been under way since spring 2009.</p>

<p>One lesson from those dark days of crisis is that the time to start worrying is when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/deutsche-boss-tells-staff-the-bank-is-rock-solid" title="">bank bosses feel obliged to insist publicly that their institutions are rock solid</a>.</p>

<p>The story starts with China and the fear that the problems of the world’s second biggest economy mark the third iteration of the global crisis that began in the US in 2007, and subsequently moved to the eurozone in 2010. Like the US, and some peripheral eurozone countries, China pumped up its economic growth using cheap credit and is now finding that many of the loans are going sour. The economy is clearly slowing, with debate over whether China is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/china-economy-grows-at-slowest-pace-in-25-years-latest-gdp-figures-show" title="">expanding at close to 7% a year, as the official figures suggest</a>, or a much lower rate. Danny Gabay, who runs the Fathom consultancy, thinks the real rate of growth could be 3% or lower.</p>

<p>Countries that supply commodities – from Angola to Australia – did well out of China’s industrial boom. They could sell all the oil, aluminium, iron ore and copper they could produce at premium prices. Many of these countries – especially the ones that spent and borrowed freely in the expectation that high commodity prices would last forever – now look vulnerable.</p>

<p>So <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/china-economy-global-stock-markets-share-prices" title="">when the sell-off in the markets started in January</a>, the main concern was that the slowdown in China and the crash in commodity prices would have a domino effect on some of the weaker emerging-market economies. That source of anxiety remains, but has now been pushed slightly into the background by speculation about the health of the big European banks.</p>

<p>Four separate factors have come together. Firstly, eurozone banks still have a lot of non-performing loans on their books from the last crisis. Secondly, the belief is that they have lent money for shale oil exploration and high-end property deals that will make losses. Thirdly, weaker growth prospects are hurting profitability. Finally, the increased use of negative interest rates is adding to financial pressures, because it now costs the banks to deposit cash at central banks.</p>

<p>In past economic cycles, central banks had no need for recourse to unconventional tools such as negative interest rates and quantitative easing. The fact that they are still being used seven years after recovery worries investors – and rightly so.</p>

<p>Central banks feel obliged to take action to prevent the deflation caused by China’s slowdown and the big fall in oil prices from becoming entrenched. But some of the unpleasant side effects of QE and ultra-low interest rates are now becoming obvious: QE pumps up asset-price bubbles through its encouragement of reckless lending, while low and negative interest rates add to financial pressures on commercial banks.</p>

<p>To sum up, the past seven-and-a-half years have seen the most colossal use of monetary stimulus in recorded history, yet recovery has been weak by past standards and has been accompanied by a drift towards deflation. As policy becomes ever more unconventional, markets are starting to think central banks have lost control of the situation. The fundamental problems of the pre-crash economy – rising income inequality, over-reliance on debt, weak effective demand – have not been solved: merely papered over.</p>

The crisis started with junk debt, american sub-prime mortgage bonds and it will end with junk debt, otherwise known as Eurozone sovereign debt bonds. Sovereign debt bonds used to be known as gilts but this terminology is now only used ironically.

It did work well for them. Watch "The super rich and us" on the BBC. The super rich tightened their purse strings for about two months after the 2007/08 world economic crash before realising it wasn't going to touch them, and it hasn't.

Not really surprising: the fools dont understand that worldwide austerity could never work ... but the extreme rich and the wanna be's are so blinded by greed they thought it would work well for them. Of course, up to now it has but it could never last.

And the Tories got in by blaming it all on Labour----now after nearly six years of the Tories are we any better off , well after seeing Osbornes nice little dividend , we know what part of the community are---no wonder the Tories want us out of Europe---because under new EU laws emerging, there precious companies will have to start their fair share of taxes. aGood reason for staying in. For the rest of us, apart Osbornes advisors of course who had a 60%plus pay rise, are left a banking system still cheating on us, our NHS in tatters through lack of funding, oh also of course Hunts bumbling efforts( perhaps David will offer him a place in the House of Lords), an education system that is sink because of Govism, not taking into account the increasing shortage of qualified teachers, our roads are in dire condition, need I go on.

Monetary stimulus has run its course, and as rthe article says, the end result has been inflation of asset prices and growing inequality within western societies.What is need now is fiscal stimulation, through the expansion of government spending and borrowing, at very low interest rates, on infrastructure projects that will both expand consumer spending through the multiplier effect, and enhance future productivity.

Fools are killing the Goose that lays ALL the golden eggs. The big business class are so stupid that they think that you can sequestrate the income of the 99% and still maintain a world market. The 99% is the world market! All the easy money borrowed cheaply via QE has flooded into the stock markets inflating the numbers. Some of it has been parked in central banks. The negative interrest rates will take care of the parking issue. But we all know where most of QE will go: Bubble bubble toil & trouble. The truth is as stupid as the money men are they are not going to invest in productive enterprises when the world is saturated in commodities of all kinds that cannot be sold: why because people are in debt up to the rooftops. This over production will have to be cut back drastically: 10'S perhaps 100's of millions of workers are about to become migrants in their "own" countries. Ok! So it appears that the rich have, ironically, inherrited the world. But what they have really inherrited is a rotting corpse that is about to unleash a Pandora's box of social, political & economic disease. Capitalism is dead and no amount of life support can bring it back from its rigor mortis. What happens to the flea's & parasites feeding on a Corpse? They die! The 99% will have to creat something new without these parasites. Its called socialism. And all the talk & babbling thats attemts to give the impression of: " Business as usual" is precisely that. The world has changed. A revolutionary change is on its way: across the entire planet. And not before time. The stench of rotting corpses penetrates even the pinched noses of the blind.

 The global economy has risen an order of magnitude in its complexity...and, as">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter">as Trainter pointed out nearly 30 Years ago in The Collapse of Complex Societies, maintaining complexities when the circumstances that they were invented and designed to deal with have altered has, historically, been at the root of the gradual disintegration of civilizations.

The economy cannot recover under austerity, it makes poor people poorer. By giving big increases in the minimum wage money is given to the poorest, who SPEND IT, the economy grows, as it did when the minimum wage was introduced. It's not rocket science, is it?

Recovery speaks more of desire and expectation and I would also say entitlement. It also implies that future outcomes are predictable from past outcomes regardless of external variances. There's been a fundamental change in the nature of markets. They are much more interlinked and global than ever before which I believe will mean constant volatility and crisis for a much longer period than previous troughs. It's China today, expect something similar when India's growth normalizes.

He means exactly what he says. Take a look at debt:GDP ratios for most countries, including Britain and America, and they have ballooned massively since 2008. (Admittedly, bailing out banks was the origin of a lot of the new public debt).Multi national corporations on the other hand have been behaving like squirrels- holding vast amounts of cash unused and uninvested against some future rainy day. That fact has caused investment to be much lower than expected, which is one of the reasons we are getting all this unconventional monetary policy like QE.

It's not for nothing the banks were bailed out in the last crisis. If banks go under thousands of businesses go with them, as do jobs, mortgages and homes, in other words everything that makes an economy work. If you can't bring yourself to cry for the banks, perhaps you can try and visualise the misery of millions who will suffer as a result or has your hatred made you so blind and callous that you no longer care?
