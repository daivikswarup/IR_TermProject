We've hit peak home furnishings, says Ikea boss




DateTime::::2016-01-18T08:55:41+0000



<p>The appetite of western consumers for home furnishings has reached its peak – according to <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/ikea">Ikea</a>, the world’s largest furniture retailer.</p>

<p>The Swedish company’s head of sustainability <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/jan/15/katherine-garrett-cox-ceo-major-corporations-denying-climate-change">told a Guardian conference</a> that consumption of many familiar goods was at its limit.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/10/ikea-profits-grow-empire-expands-new-territories">Tack! Ikea profits grow as empire expands in new territories</a> </p>

<p>“If we look on a global basis, in the west we have probably hit peak stuff. We talk about peak oil. I’d say we’ve hit peak red meat, peak sugar, peak stuff … peak home furnishings,” Steve Howard said at a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/membership/audio/2016/jan/14/is-business-action-on-climate-change-believable-guardian-live-event">Guardian Sustainable Business debate</a>. He said the new state of affairs could be called “peak curtains”.<br/></p>

<p>Howard’s comment looks like an example of a “Ratner moment”, named after Gerald Ratner’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/27/marketingandpr">description of goods at his jewellery stores as “crap”</a> in 1991. Matt Barrett, the former chief executive of Barclays, was similarly loose-tongued in 2003 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/oct/17/uk.creditcards">when he said borrowing on credit cards was too expensive</a>.</p>

<p>But Howard said his comments did not contradict Ikea’s target of almost doubling sales by 2020, and that changes in consumption were an opportunity for companies to rethink the way they did business. Ikea was trying to help customers live in a more environmentally friendly way, he added.</p>

<p>“We will be increasingly building a circular Ikea where you can repair and recycle products,” Howard said.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/10/ikea-marches-on-as-sales-rise-to-32bn">Ikea marches on as sales rise to €32bn</a> </p>

<p>Ikea has introduced a series of environmental policies in the last year. It has pledged to <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/04/ikea-pledges-1bn-on-renewable-energy-and-climate-change-efforts">invest €1bn (£755m) in renewable energy</a> and measures to help poorer communities deal with the impacts of climate change. It has also pledged that all the energy used to power its shops and factories will come from clean sources by 2020 and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/aug/10/ikea-ditches-conventional-lightbulbs-for-energy-saving-led-lighting">phased out non-LED lightbulbs</a> from its stores.<br/></p>

<p>Howard said: “If you look on a global basis, most people are still poor and most people actually haven’t got to sufficiency yet. There is a global growth opportunity ... but it’s a distribution issue.”<br/></p>

<p>He said it was possible for business to have carbon-free growth but that he loses sleep over whether it can be achieved in time.</p>

Exactly!What are the implications of using partcleboard? It appears to me that it is not necessary to grow trees greater than a few inches diameter to satisfy IKEA needs.So, guess what? IKEA, perhaps unwittingly, supports forest mgt that entails clearing young forests long before they are mature, and thus less valuable as wildlife habitat.Such juvenile trees are far cheaper compared to large mature trees. That also takes away the incentive for forest owners to grow mature forests, which helps landowners pay the cost of owning the forest land.Casual observers don't realize this, but corporations and enviros do. That is one of the few points the two agree on - try to starve the forest owners to death, or at least until they must relinquish ownership of their land.Want to help sustainable forestry? Use SOLID WOOD - NOT THE PARTICLEBOARD JUNK.

I don't understand the need to keep buying new things when so much is out there for free/cheaper and often better quality. So much furniture and household goods are thrown away in house clearances but would be of use to others. I stopped shopping at ikea when I realised second hand solid wood furniture was cheaper and looked much nicer. I live in a student area and every year new students are out buying plastic washing up bowls, pans and kettles which are in abundance on freecycle. When we have so much stuff available we don't need to keep producing more in the shops as where does it all go? Household waste to the tip in our city has doubled in 3 years apparently and that's unrecyclable items!

I think you're describing the properties of solid wood/ plywood vs chipboard here, rather than the properties of Ikea stuff.

Sounds counter-intuitive, but I'd say putting a man into space or developing a nuclear weapon is logistically less difficult that ensuring - in a centralised economy - that everyone has a decent par of shoes. Space and bombs are sexy and would attract the cream of the talented and motivated, and you're also organising a relatively small group of people in a limited area. I wonder how many would leap at the opportunity to organise the design, manufacture and distribution of shoes to the entire Soviet Union? Capitalism solves this problem by making it possible to get rich in the shoe business. Marxism doesn't.

While I'm a brand fan. I cannot think of a less "repairable" line of furniture. Recycling may have potential considering that most products are made from particle board.

Sorry, but if I have had the suite for '12 years', and likely to have it for another 8 years at least, totalling 20 years, then the £100 suite has cost £5 per year. You said you'd 'stretch to calling a fiver for a big household item 'next to nothing'.

I partially agree. Capitalism cannot survive if the only way in which people are able to participate in society is to work 40 hours per week in exchange for cash. The ability of capitalism to provide full time work for all is clearly a thing of the past.

Peak retail probably. No one tries to tell you that you are have a "shopping experience" anymore. Life's too short to spend it drudging around shops trying to fill your life with inanimate objects.

I'm with you here. Better to pay double for a vintage or expensive item that's cut price second hand. E-bay is my friend except things I really like seem to go for a lot, and I often get outbid. I then feel relief that I didn't pay an idiotic sum for them, so it works out well in the end!

No, it's called "planned obsolence", which is far more sinister.I think there should be a massive popular reaction against that... but do I think it will happen any time soon? No. Because too many people are too addicted to "convenience" over quality.I try to resist as much as I can myself, by buying artisanal things (even custom-made computers made to last). If I cannot buy something of quality, I'd rather not have it. It doesn't work all the time, but I certainly do my best.

I used to love IKEA about 10-15 years ago. Then I started travelling a little bit more and discovered that it's everywhere, and I mean everywhere. I don't like that sort of style homogenisation (especially if it's all white and drab "natural" dishwater brown).I can understand its attraction, but I don't think I could bear to have it in my home anymore.

I think this is where IKEA comes in. It is not luxurious but it will "do" in most people's homes. Better to buy an IKEA sofa and bank the difference between that and the department-store number the middle classes may once have gone for.

I guess for some, the neverending recession still means that home furnishings and electrical items are not being replaced unless absolutely neccessary. Plenty of old cars around as well that otherwise might have ended up in the scrapyards. Wasteful consumerism thus slows down - maybe something to be welcomed, as is the deterrent that credit card borrowing is still ludicrously expensive.

I too have loads of IKEA furniture all of which has been taken apart, moved and reassembled several times. Table and chairs date from mid 70's, much of the rest is 80's vintage - all still standing and functional. Only problem ever has been with sofas. Don't see what people have such a problem with: if you don't like the stuff, don't go and don't buy it!

In the west the the middle classes are in a transition from enough money to buy things to enough money to buy financial security. Concern is less about immediate needs and more about being able o survive in a long period of economic shocks at th personal level.

I've never bought anything at IKEA that didn't last for years and years. My home office is completely fitted out with desks and bookcases that I bought in the mid-90s and it's all in perfect condition. You just have to tighten the screws from time to time.

Ikea could kelp the situation by producing furniture that doesn't have to be replaced after 2-3 years of normal use.
