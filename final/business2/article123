Did you hear the one about Paddy Power Betfair?




DateTime::::2016-03-06T09:00:30+0000



<p>Comedian Paul Kaye’s alter ego Dennis Pennis once memorably accosted Hollywood’s Steve Martin on a red carpet and asked: “How come you’re not funny any more?”</p>

<p>It was a cruel – if incisive – question which Kaye later said he regretted, only to snap out of it and muse: “Anyone who thinks they can improve on Bilko and Inspector Clouseau needs a slap, don’t they?”</p>

<p>Anyway, in a similar vein, Tuesday marks the results of Paddy Power <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/betfair">Betfair</a>, the combination of the cheeky Irish bookmaker and the online betting pioneer, whose promotion to the FTSE 100 was confirmed last week.</p>

<p>Paddy was once very funny indeed, pulling stunts like offering 100,000-1 on Pope John Paul II being the next signing at (typically Protestant) Glasgow Rangers, and then refunding punters when the pontiff picked up a niggle after slipping in the shower.</p>

<p>However, the merger now means that the combined betting business is worth more than £8bn – so probably a bit grown-up for stunts like that.</p>

<p>It may also be timely to appear more serious, seeing as Paddy seems to have misplaced its sense of humour of late, Betfair never had one in the first place, and rivals trying to emulate the old Paddy-style jokes look very tired. Kaye knows all about that: he was notably not funny any more in the tiresome ads run by Paddy’s rival, BetVictor.</p>

<p>This page has long been in awe of the ability of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/g4s">G4S</a> to turn security work into farce – particularly just before it makes announcements to the City.</p>

<p>Few in the Square Mile tire of hearing about pre-results gaffes that have included a guard routinely taking a break after parking his security van outside a customer’s store before venturing inside to collect the takings, a pattern that allowed an impostor to don a G4S uniform and make off with £14,000 from the store’s tills; and (best of all) a prisoner tricking his G4S guards into tagging his prosthetic leg, thereby allowing him to skip his curfew by detaching the limb.</p>

<p>Still, last autumn G4S reckoned it had retired from vaudeville and dispatched a smart new PR team around London to tell critics all about its newfound professionalism. It was a convincing pitch – not least because maintaining such high-quality comedy over several years is a challenge for anybody. But when you employ more than 623,000 people, disaster is often lurking. So rather than an incident-free run-up to its 2015 results this week, there’s controversy (though not of the amusing kind) at Medway secure training centre and a spat with the SNP.</p>

<p>Apparently, there might be the odd cynic who doesn’t believe all the stories we’re told about Easter.</p>

<p>Some might question the resurrection, others wonder if the Easter bunny really exists, but surely we can all agree that one tale is so obviously true that nobody need ever doubt it. It is, of course, the annual shortage of Easter eggs.</p>

<p>On Friday the hunt for these precious treats kicked off again – with a yarn explaining how this year’s production might be disrupted by 200 striking <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/cadburyschweppes">Cadbury</a> workers. Expect follow-ups this week about other factors set to contribute to a dearth this year, including tales of cocoa shortages, production blips and, probably, something about the Easter bunny being so frustrated by EU red tape that he’s relocating to Switzerland.</p>

<p>That would hardly be farther-fetched than previous years’ headlines, including: “Easter egg prices jump by up to 200% in just a year” (<em>Daily Mail</em>, 2013); “Easter egg shortage at the supermarkets” (<em>Daily Telegraph</em>, 2014); and “Enjoy today’s Easter eggs: they could soon become a luxury” (the er, <em>Observer</em>, 2015). It may be that supplying Easter eggs is so complex that it’s impossible to learn from previous errors. Or it could – just possibly – all be a marketing wheeze.</p>

A successful business with the scale to take on all markets worldwide. We should be applauding them and not worrying about their marketing.

Rascist much. Britain is hardly absent of its own very gambling companies. Ladbrokes are just as guilty for making gambling seem "cool", it just so happens that Paddy Power have a more imaginative marketing department.

Ask all those who have suffered due to Paddy Power's use of betting schemes that allow a vunerable punter to lose 1,000, even their home.

Paddy Power is a dirty protest in the face of free and fair markets open for competition. The business is now a monstrosity, like a lazy all seeing eye. As the central banks have proved unlimited power results in rigged markets. Only when the light is shone upon them will they reflect on their misdeeds. Something needs to be done as the monopoly commission is asleep on the job.
