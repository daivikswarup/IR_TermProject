Asic examines claims CommInsure avoiding payouts to sick and dying




DateTime::::2016-03-08T03:13:46+0000



<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) will urgently examine whether allegations CommInsure may be routinely denying legitimate claims from sick and dying customers point to a systemic practice in the insurance industry.</p>

<p>On Monday <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2016/03/07/4417757.htm">a joint Fairfax-ABC investigation revealed</a> that claims managers at CommInsure, the insurance arm of the Commonwealth Bank, were reportedly delaying claims to dying customers or rejecting them based on outdated, sometimes unobtainable, criteria. </p>

<p>CommInsure’s former chief medical officer, Dr Benjamin Koh, told the ABC the insurer would allegedly “blatantly” ask doctors to “please change it or delete [assessments] so that we can go to someone else to provide another opinion that’s more favourable”. </p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/05/commonwealth-bank-admits-failing-customers-over-heart-attack-claims">Commonwealth bank admits failing customers over heart attack claims</a> </p>

<p>The assistant treasurer, Kelly O’Dwyer, said on Tuesday the stories of jilted customers were “very troubling and shocking” and would be examined by the corporate watchdog.</p>

<p>She said: “Asic has advised the government they are looking into the cases that have been raised and we have asked Asic for an urgent report to look at whether the practices that have been raised in the story overnight are more systemic than simply just related to CommInsure.”</p>

<p>A Senate inquiry into the financial advice industry, headed by the Nationals senator John Williams, was extended last week to include the $44bn life insurance industry and whether companies “are engaging in unethical practices to avoid meeting claims”. O’Dwyer said it would scrutinise the cases raised on Monday’s Four Corners episode.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Bank’s chief executive, Ian Narev, said he was “very saddened and very disappointed by the experiences of those customers”.</p>

<p>He blamed the conduct that, in one instance, saw payments repeatedly delayed to a customer with terminal leukaemia on “excessive attention paid to the detail of specific process and policies versus taking the bigger picture”. </p>

<p>“That has been rectified,” he said. </p>

<p>“But this business has 4 million customers, it pays out 22,000 claims a year … The high-level statistics of this business are that it’s doing its job.”</p>

<p>But he conceded: “That doesn’t help the individuals whose cases were talked about last night.”</p>

<p>Labor’s spokesman for financial services, Jim Chalmers, said the alleged misconduct at CommInsure demanded a royal commission into the industry.</p>

<p>“This is a government very quick to pull the trigger on royal commissions when it relates to the union movement,” he said. “This will be a test of whether they’re prepared to take the same kind of action when it comes to the disgraceful practices that [have been] highlighted.”</p>

<p>Parliament is currently considering a bill to bolster regulation of the life insurance industry, including by scaling back upfront and continuing commission payments.</p>

<p>The reforms are the result of an Asic review that found 37% of life insurance advice “failed to comply with the law”. With upfront commissions the rate rose to 45%.</p>

<p>The chief executive of Industry Super Australia, David Whiteley, told the ABC commissions created “an incentive for the adviser to make a particular sale rather than providing advice that is just in the client’s best interest”.</p>

<p>Calling the Senate inquiry “an important first step”, Whiteley said CommInsure’s conduct was the product of a culture that prioritised “selling product to consumers rather than looking at products which are in the interest of those consumers”.</p>

<p>The Commonwealth Bank<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/03/commonwealth-bank-boss-apologises-customers-financial-scandal"> apologised in July 2014</a> to customers who lost savings as a result of fraudulent and misleading behaviour by its financial advisers.</p>

<p>A parliamentary inquiry at the time said the conduct of the bank, and the failure of the regulator to rein it in, were so serious <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/27/financial-advisers-must-lift-game-after-commonwealth-bank-scandal-says-asic">as to warrant a royal commission</a>. </p>

<p>In February the bank announced a record half-year profit of $4.62bn.</p>

The silence we are hearing from the Superannuation Industry (who contract Comminsure to handle their insurance side of things) is deafening. As collectively Comminsure largest customer, they would have an enormous amount of influence on Comminsure. They also have a huge responsibility to their superannuation clients. So the question has to be asked, "Why is the Superannuation Council", or whatever their peak body is called, so quiet on this. One can only surmise that they are happy with Comminsure and their business model. I would have thought that they would by now have had a team of insurance lawyers going through Comminsure's policies with a fine tooth comb. I urge everyone who has an insurance policy tied to their superannuation get onto their super fund and get a written confirmation from them that in the event of a claim, they will not be treated as those poor Comminsure clients we saw on 4 Corners. Pressure your super fund to pressure Comminsure, and you will make a diffence. Do nothing and nothing will change.

The Mexican drug lord El Capo supports about 100,000 people through his drug dealing. At the same time hundreds if not thousands are dying of the way he does business, i.e. selling drugs. So does that make him a great benefactor or a crook? Based on your skewed idea of a great company like CBA, I guess you will choose him to be a great benefactor. May I suggest you open your eyes and ears and start seeing what CBA are really like. El Capo would be proud of them.

Summed up pretty well ! .. corporate culture of 'performance' & 'targets'. This seems to be the pervading business attitude with many others also. For example, the Coles fiascoes wit their suppliers. The list goes on. All this shit must be taught when gaining business degrees at Aussie universities ?! It can't be accidental surely.

I have been retired for 2 years , so, things may well have changed .....however, I found OnePath (ex ING) to have the best wording for Trauma covers , and Zurich to have the best Income Protection policy on the market.Both were excellent to deal with (a lot had to do with them having very good Business Development Managers who helped 'iron out' any minor problems with the Companies concerned).

Insurance is just a form of gambling. You pay your premium betting that, eg your house will burn down or you may die and they, the insurance company is taking your bet that the odds say it won't happen.

So we won't be bailing these bums out when they get caught holding the mortgage debt baby will we? They deserve to cop it sweet and stand ( or fall) on their own without government support as the economy tanks due to our world leading personal debt and idiotic, unsustainable and unfair tax and superannuation policies.

Hands up all those who will now desert and blacklist Commbank. In my book , continuing to deal with corporate psychopaths such as these is akin to continuing sending the kids to a known paedophile for after school care. Mind you, the insurance industry is all pretty much the same. No real surprises here.

Ian Narev should fall on his sword. That would be the decent thing to do after the CBA stumbles from one scandal to another and I refuse to believe that all insurers are as bad as CommInsure refusing to pay out to terminally ill people and permanently incapacitated people. CommInsure's chief Medical Officer was sacked for raising concerns about the amount of claims being refused in cases where the claimant should have been paid without a doubt. Doctor shopping seems rife. Simply appalling. But like the financial planning industry, the insurance industry needs a permanent makeover.

http://www.theage.com.au/business/intelligent-investor/comminsure-is-cba-an-unethical-stock-20160308-gndfje.html"... CBA has taken out its own insurance policy, donating almost $100,000 to the Coalition in the 2014-15 year. Nor is CBA alone. Since 2010, the finance sector has donated over $5 million to the major political parties, a trifling cost if it helps them avoid a royal commission. Over the coming months we'll find out whether our politicians will pay out on that policy and rebut such calls, as they did over the advice scandal, or succumb to public pressure by saying enough is enough ..."

They'd want to be making lots of money. Creating money out of thin air and charging interest on it in a 4 way monopoly backed by the state is not rocket science. A trained monkey would have a hard time running a loss at that gig. Why I bet even your average MBA could manage it without sending the joint bankrupt!

Why bother with insurance, people know they will struggle to get a pay out. Insurance is one biggest rorts. They only people who benefit from insurance are the wealthy and big companies. It surprises me people do not notice that. Name one claimant that has not struggled to get a pay out when it counts?

Well if lefties are wound up by it that's fine, but the reality is an extraordinarily minimal amount of concerns raised given the scale of the business and access to a very senior whistleblower. And even a couple of the issues they raised bear out the prudence of the insurer.

What a terrible company. The reality is its only nickel and dime stuff. They are on the front foot every quarter to tell us they made $6 billion profit. But the first thing they do is restructure and send jobs off shore. When you'd think they'd have some moral obligation to create a few jobs!! What I am really trying to say is it's not all about the bottom line.
