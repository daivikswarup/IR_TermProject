FTSE 100: third week of gains leaves investors scratching their heads




DateTime::::2016-03-04T19:23:45+0000



<p>Was that it? The year began with warnings to sell up and hunker down for <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/20/investors-run-cover-repeat-of-2008-financial-crash-davos-bear-markets">another financial crisis</a>. But now investors have been left scratching their heads after the FTSE 100 enjoyed its third week of gains to soar back to where it started 2016.</p>

<p>The index rallied 1% on Friday to close at 6,199.43, just shy of the 6,242.32 level at which it opened the year and above the 6,093 where it closed on the first trading day of the year.</p>

<p>It marks a 12% turnaround from a three-year low hit in February as the London blue-chip index slumped along with stock markets around the world. Investors had dumped shares amid a commodities rout and on worries about the global economic outlook and China’s economy in particular. As the sell-off deepened, economists at the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> warned clients: “<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/sell-everything-ahead-of-stock-market-crash-say-rbs-economists">Sell everything except high quality bonds</a>.”</p>

<p>Now the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse">FTSE</a> 100 is rallying again, stock market experts warn it still has some choppy months ahead. But at the same time a mood of cautious optimism is spreading in the City.</p>

<p>“It’s not to say we are out of the woods but things are looking a bit better than they were at the beginning of February when the bottom was falling out of the market,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at financial spreadbetting firm CMC Markets UK.</p>

<p>The fortunes of miners in particular, a hefty chunk of the FTSE 100, have turned around in recent weeks. Rallying metals prices have helped boost the share prices of companies such as Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.</p>

<p>But there were still signs that investors remain jittery, notably the soaring price of gold, long seen as a safe-haven, added Hewson. The precious metal is up almost 20% since the start of the year.</p>

<p>“You have to be choosy about where you put your money,” he said. “I am cautious about this [stock market] rally. Gold prices have rallied alongside it and that could mean investors don’t trust this rally.”</p>

<p>Analysts say <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/24/why-is-global-economy-suffering-turbulence">a combination of factors</a> got stocks off to a bad start in 2016: signs of industrial sector weakness in the US, China’s slowdown and its currency devaluation, sharp falls in the oil price and other commodities, and expectations that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates four times this year. Bank and commodity stocks were among the hardest hit.</p>

<p>Against that backdrop the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/china-economy-global-stock-markets-share-prices">FTSE 100 suffered its worst opening week</a> to a year since 2000 and continued to tumble until 11 February.</p>

<p>Since then, nerves have been calmed by three factors, according to Nick Nelson, head of European equity strategy at Swiss bank UBS. Firstly, slightly brighter economic news out of China and the US; secondly, a pick-up in energy and mining stocks; and finally, a weaker pound, which helps the FTSE 100’s many exporters.<br/></p>

<p>Nelson warned that financial markets will remain jittery given the wounds of the last crash are still raw. “We all anchor to our most recent experiences and if you have been in investment and markets for 10 years or so, what you will remember is 2008-9,” he said.</p>

<p>Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, echoed that. </p>

<p>“There is a sense that everyone is perhaps poised for the music to stop and they don’t want to be left without a chair. That explains the stop-start nature of the run we have had,” says Khalaf.</p>

<p>That “jumpiness” reinforces a long-standing pattern for markets to be a lot louder on the way down than on the way up – as seen in recent weeks, he says. But investors should beware of the doom-mongers. </p>

<p>“If you hear people shrieking like that, it’s time to buy in,” says Khalaf.</p>

<p>“The market is irrational ... It’s not something investors should get bogged down in. You shouldn’t focus on where the market is going to be in a month but in 10 years or whenever you need to draw down your money.”</p>

<p>George Osborne’s take on the global jitters has been to flag up what he sees as a strong domestic economy prone to risks from overseas. The chancellor <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/07/george-osborne-warns-uk-economy-faces-cocktail-of-threats">warned of a “dangerous cocktail of new threats”</a> and said <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/26/george-osborne-further-cuts-storm-clouds-economic-budget">“the storm clouds are clearly gathering in the world economy”</a>. </p>

<p>The latest economic signals from the UK have been soft, cementing expectations that the Bank of England will hold off raising interest rates from the 0.5% record low to which they were cut seven years ago.</p>

<p>But Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the bank Berenberg, said that many of the factors weighing on business confidence in the UK should prove transitory, not least the EU referendum effect. The underlying picture was one of low unemployment, tailwinds from cheap oil, low borrowing costs and rising house prices.</p>

<p>“There are some risks heading into the middle of the year when we have the EU referendum, which will cause consumers to postpone some discretionary spending and businesses to pause investment, but that will pick up again,” he said.<br/></p>

<p>But that was not to say markets will have a steady ride. The kind of herd behaviour seen at the start of the year can overshadow any positive economic factors, added Pickering. So while cheap oil boosts household incomes, if it also sparks a stock market rout people get spooked.</p>

<p>“People don’t look so objectively at things. When financial markets are panicking they think: ‘I don’t care about having cheap petrol in my car, my stocks are losing value, I need to get rid of them’.”</p>

Oh, if owners can fix horse races, why does the Guardian insist on forcing its readers to be simpletons? These fluctuations in the global markets were twanged, if not orchestrated, for the opportunistic profits they provide.

How much of this is due to:a) the annual using-up of ISA allowances?b) higher-rate tax-payers bunging extra money into their pension funds just in case the tax relief rules change (albeit seemingly postponed from the headlines today)?

Relating Guardian world and the wider public is folly. It was almost certainly a long overdue correction and vital investment opportunity. Expect all time highs by year end and gold rising to meet inflation fears.

If. And if, and if. One of the problems is with short-termism. Yes, we need to have stock market reports giving current trends, and yes, we need to keep tabs on investments. But one of the problems with the stock market, business and the economy is the now almost universal focus on short-term gains. At the expense of wiser long-term decisions. We are told it is unwise to buy stocks with a short-term view in mind, yet that is what the industry itself too often does. And that is what reporting does almost exclusively. My point is this: You analyse the change in certain (arbitrary) years. You conclude there is a bubble waiting to burst. But look at it this way: Over the long term stocks rise in value. Yet the FTSE now is still over 10% lower than it was at the millennium. So your same assessment, if applied to those figures, would argue that stocks are a good investment because they still have a long way to rise. So which is it?

This article is the most deranged piece of lala land thinking I have seen for a while equating more credit and money printing with an "upturn". It jut makes the eventualy collapse even worse. 2008 has not remotely been overcome or solved (ask Greece). Look as China dropping further today officially. I think the universal scepticism in the comments says it all - and in most of them with sound analysis and evidence to back them up.
