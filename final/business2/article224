Competition regulator's energy market plan 'will lead to junk mail deluge'




DateTime::::2016-03-10T19:33:33+0000



<p>The competition watchdog has been warned that proposals to give energy suppliers access to a new industry-wide database of customers could unleash a junk mail deluge.</p>

<p>The plan was one of several remedies proposed by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/competition-commission">Competition and Markets Authority</a> to reform an energy market in which households are overcharged £1.7bn a year.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/10/big-six-hearts-warmed-watchdog-as-standard-tariff-payers-left-out-in-cold">Big six's hearts warmed by watchdog as standard tariff payers left out in cold</a> </p>

<p>Martin Lewis, founder of website MoneySavingExpert, said: “The great worry is that people will be bombarded with what feels like spam from so many companies, the [switch to a cheaper provider] message will be drowned out by shouting.”<br/></p>

<p>Other measures outlined by the CMA on Thursday included the introduction of a price cap for four million customers on pre-payment meters, as well as removing a tariff cap that restricts suppliers to offering four price rates.</p>

<p>However, the most eye-catching proposal was the creation of a database that would be controlled by the industry regulator, Ofgem. Under the plan, if a customer has been on a standard variable tariff – the more expensive default rate – for three years or more they will receive a letter from Ofgem informing them that they will be put on this open database, unless they opt out. The other 36 suppliers in the market can then contact the customer directly to offer better deals, potentially leading to a raft of marketing letters. </p>

<p>Paul Hunt, an energy consultant, said: “Ofgem will have control of this database of disengaged customers to which all competing suppliers will have access. I’m not looking forward to being bombarded with loads of junk email and snail mail from the competing suppliers.”</p>

<p>Roger Witcomb, head of the CMA investigation, insisted the “coherent and comprehensive package of reforms” would transform the energy sector.</p>

<p>He added: “In those parts of the retail markets where competition is working, customers are benefiting to the tune of hundreds of pounds a year by switching. We’re proposing a wide range of bold, innovative measures to enable competition to grow further across the market so that millions more households will benefit.”<br/></p>

<p>The proposals in the CMA report will be followed by a final verdict before 25 June. Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, and a host of business organisations also welcomed the planned changes. But some opposition MPs, independent energy companies and fuel poverty groups have expressed scepticism.</p>

<p>Ovo Energy, one of the new breed of suppliers, said the lengthy investigation by the CMA had been “a complete waste of time and taxpayers’ money”, while Lisa Nandy, the shadow energy secretary, said the latest remedies represented a missed opportunity.</p>

<p>“This investigation has confirmed that millions of families and businesses have been overcharged for their energy bills to the tune of billions of pounds yet energy companies are still being let off the hook,” she said. “This was a critical chance to shake up a broken energy market and make sure savings from falling wholesale prices are passed on to customers. Only more transparency and competition can deliver this.”</p>

<p>Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said the competition watchdog’s remedies would not prevent UK consumers being unnecessarily subjected to some of the highest energy bills in the EU.</p>

<p>“The CMA report has failed to tackle what really concerns consumers: the UK is supplied by a cosy group of six companies who know very well without the need to collude that the last thing they need is the price war that real competition would lead to. The CMA measures will do little to change this,” he said.</p>

<p>Laura Hill, for campaign group Fuel <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/poverty">Poverty</a> Action, said: “Today’s announcement is a testimony to the stranglehold of the ‘big six’ over this investigation. Extensive lobbying has resulted in these pathetic watered-down recommendations which will have little impact on the majority of hard-pressed households who have spent the winter shivering in their home.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-sets-out-energy-market-changes">The CMA inquiry</a>, launched in June 2014, was intended to clear up once and for all whether the so-called big six suppliers - SSE, Scottish Power, British Gas, npower, E.ON and EDF Energy – were abusing their dominance of the market.<br/></p>

<p>However, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/04/energy-bills-cap-uk-households-competition-markets-authority-watchdog">the regulator has retreated</a> from more radical proposals amid ferocious lobbying from the energy sector.</p>

<p>Shares in British Gas’s owner, Centrica, rose slightly on Thursday as the City realised the proposed changes would not have a severe impact.</p>

<p>Iain Conn, the chief executive of Centrica, said: “We believe that, provided they [the CMA remedies] are implemented thoughtfully, the majority will benefit our customers. We will work through the full report once we have it and submit a formal response in line with the required timetable.”</p>

<p>The big six have always argued the market is highly competitive and the profits are proportionate to the risks they take.<br/></p>

<p>Rudd described the CMA proposals as “a wakeup call to the big six.” She added: “Energy customers should get a fair deal from a market that works for them. That’s why we called for the biggest ever investigation into the energy market and won’t hesitate to take forward its recommendations.</p>

<p>“This report goes hand ­in ­glove with everything this government is doing to deliver a fair, competitive energy market that puts the families and businesses paying the bills first and the power back in their hands.”</p>

You need to be a sad specimen if you describe yourself as bombarded with junk e-mail. One click on the spam filter and a company is blocked. Six seconds to block the big six companies who might contact you. Is that hard?

What happens if (when?) Cheap Gas Co gets into financial difficulties which could be quite likely if their business outgrows their contracted supply volumes and/or wholesale gas prices rise or supplies decrease. Are the big 6 expected to take over the customer base (after all the gas won't stop flowing) and if so will they be able to charge a surcharge above their standard rate for having provided this safety net. Has there been any such risk assessment carried out?

Switch, switch, switch, switch.....switch yourself bluddy silly! Switching is only tinkering with the bigger, main problem of greedy energy suppliers. The propaganda on switching appears to give control to the customer but is, in fact, purely a PR exercise by the Greedy Six. In reality, it is putting the onus on the customer to source a cheaper tarriff - as opposed to the supplier giving a cheaper, competitive deal - and thereby transferring all fault & guilt to the customer, ie: "well if you're too damn lazy to bother switching then you can't blame us for ripping you off!"

I think you are very wrong. Standard tariffs where customers end up are undoubtedly more expensive than introductory offers of cheap prices on a short term fix. You need to keep switching to stay on cheapest tariffs. The companies take a reduced margin on new customers and expect that due to their inertia customers simply stick around to be milked on the standard tariff which they move to when the introductory offer expires

The Mad Bat's privatization programs had one objective only: to switch the costs of infrastructure from the treasury to the consumer, all the rest was the corporate state in action.

Indeed, I worked for NOSHEB from 1975 to 2000. An industry whilst nationalised that built a transmission grid, a distribution system and connected the whole of rural Scotland up. Provided the same tariff, if you were in the most remote part of the Highlands as in a city. An industry that carried out long term planning coordinated throughout the UK. More importantly an industry run by engineers, not accountants.I remember our finance director saying it would be cheaper to give the commercial element (not the generation, transmission, distribution and metering costs) electricity away for free rather than have the enormous bureaucracy created to produce a so called market. Now we have an energy system in the UK on the point of collapse, no energy security and desperately prostituting ourselves to get a ludcrous expensive french nuclear power station.Westminster, as in so many areas, is not fit for purpose, regardless of which cheek of the arse is in control.

This is all about "marketing", by which I mean confusing the customer who then gets to pay more for a unit of electricity.

I think the clue with respect to "the mad bat" is in the "mad" bit - a key feature of any policy the t-vermins come out with - rail? NHS? and energy? - village idiots could make a better fist of it than the t-vermins.

My property does not require gas. Only electricity and it's only occupied for about half of the year. Energy firms bugger up my bills with wrong estimates, strange direct debit figures and cause me trouble. Finally I've found one, Scottish Power, where I can submit readings as often as I like and from wherever I am and pay via App/Website. The trouble is that it's costly per unit. However energy firms talk about saving this or that per year. I need a selection of competitive prices based on pence per KWh or unit and if I must a few pence daily standing charge and with an easy ability to read my meter and pay up every 3/4 weeks. No Dd's and no estimates. If anyone can offer that then they can write to me. If not bugger off until you can.

Far, far simpler solution, and one that wouldn't involve junk mail..... was the Attlee/Churchill/..../Callaghan (1945 to 1997) Governments' decision to have energy supply systems owned by the people.

My mother is 95. She has poor eyesight and gets anxious when she gets official looking mail. She has never switched supplier and never will. It is too much bother and she doesn't believe in all this, but just wants electricity.

And what for those of us who have decided to sign up with the Mail Preference Service? Are our stated preferences against junk mail to be over-ridden? If I wanted junk mail then I'd ask for it, but I object to have to put myself on a second register to confirm what I said on the first one.

Far simpler to abolish the standing charge, as suggested by another poster.

I remember about a decade or so ago the energy companies were complaining that too many people were switching, and this was increasing their costs, because every time someone switches supplier it costs money in paperwork.

I've been trying to change electricity provider for months, but the computer of my current provider keeps on objecting and preventing the transfer, and no-one employed by the company appears to know why.

Now here's a radical idea that would totally simplify the energy market for consumers. Why not fix a reasonable price for energy and let the energy companies compete for the right to supply the consumer? That way, the consumer's choice would be based on things like the service provided, source sustainability and security, reliability, and so on.

I've got better things to do with my life than endlessly swap energy providers to save myself £40 a year. And has been already pointed out, the dozens of tariffs on offer doesn't make choosing an option a simple task anyway.

The Energy market illustrates that there is no such thing as a completely free market. If there is a perfect market, there is perfect knowledge, so the sellers in the market will combine to maximise their prices to the level which will keep them all in business even if they do not actually conspire together although they probably will. So the market is perfect no longer unless some authority intervenes which also means that it is perfect no longer.

The illusion of competition, and the illusion CMA actually do anything useful. Just reduce all suppliers to a single quoted rate, no confusion with fixed to x months or this one with a standing charge, that without, no exit charges, no change of tariff at end of arbitrary period.

Bonkers. This is where the illusion of competition and choice has got us. And how much are these dozens of companies going to spend on marketing? The CMA could just set a sensible price per unit and per therm and the companies could then - if they so wished - compete on customer service rather than price.

It's all an illusion to delude customers into thinking the gov has solved the energy rip off, thwen most of us now know you change to better deals, only four months in they hike the price and you have signed up for a year, with no way of getting out of the rip off.....market forces rip off rules...

Pettifogging nonsense designed as smokescreen to protect energy companies' inefficiency. When I fuel up my vehicles the sales clerk at the filling station doesn't ask me for a standing charge just for being there. I just pay per unit price. Should be same with household energy. Abolition of standing charges would also encourage householders to insulate and be more energy saving conscious.
