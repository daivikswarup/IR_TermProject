RBS pays share bonuses worth £17.4m to top management team

<p>Royal Bank of Scotland – the bailed-out bank which <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/rbs-chief-executive-ross-mcewan-pay-2bn-loss-results-royal-bank-of-scotland">recently reported its eighth consecutive year of annual losses</a> – has handed its top management team future bonuses in shares worth £17.4m.</p>

<p>The bank, 73% owned by the taxpayer, also released bonuses already earned worth more than £5m to the top management team, including the chief executive, Ross McEwan, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/01/ross-mcewan-first-day-rbs-chief-executive">who took the helm in October 2013</a>.</p>

<p>The £17.4m of share awards were<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.investegate.co.uk/royal-bk-scot-grp---rbs-/rns/director-pdmr-shareholding/201603081414094276R/"> announced to the stock market</a> less than a fortnight after RBS reported a £2bn loss for 2015 – taking the total losses to more than £50bn since its 2008 bailout when taxpayers pumped £45bn into the bank.</p>

<p>McEwan, who was promoted from running the retail arm of RBS t<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/12/rbs-ceo-stephen-hester-quits">o replace Stephen Hester</a>, has attempted to defuse rows over pay by ending the practice of handing annual bonuses to his top management team.</p>

<p>Even so, members of the team are still receiving bonuses handed out in previous years and being awarded shares through three-year performance plans. The £17.4m of shares awarded to McEwan and his 10-strong management team are based on performance over three years and will not be released until 2020 and 2021, when the executives will find out if they are paid in full.</p>

<p>McEwan, who was paid £3.8m in 2015, was handed shares worth £2.6m as part of this long-term share plan.</p>

<p>The London Stock Exchange announcement shows that two executives – Mark Bailie and Chris Marks – each received almost £1m of shares through annual bonuses handed to them in previous years when they worked in the investment banking arm of RBS. They were both awarded £2m of shares under the long-term bonus plan.</p>

<p>Shares in RBS are trading at 229p, well below the 502p at which taxpayers break even on their stake and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/04/rbs-sell-off-george-osborne-defends-1bn-loss">below the 330p at which George Osborne sold off the first tranche in August </a>at a £1bn loss.</p>

<p>Campaigners for a tax on financial services at the Robin Hood Tax campaign compared the RBS bonuses with the 1% pay rise for NHS workers.</p>

<p>“Once again different rules seem to apply to the banking sector who, eight years on, have yet to pay the price for their part in the financial crisis. The government must step up and stop this special treatment for the City,” David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign said. </p>

<p>RBS notified the stock market of the share awards on Tuesday just 10 minutes after rival bailed-out bank Lloyds Banking Group <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.investegate.co.uk/lloyds-banking-group--lloy-/rns/director-pdmr-shareholding/201603081404004267R/">confirmed the scale of payouts to its management team</a>. Lloyds, in which taxpayers continue to have a stake of just under 10%, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/lloyds-hands-chief-executive-85m-pay-package">revealed last month</a> that its chief executive, António Horta-Osório, and his 10 top managers were receiving awards of shares worth £20m.</p>

<p>The chancellor wants to sell off much of the remaining stake in Lloyds to the public but was forced to postpone the sale because of the slump in shares during January’s stock-market rout. However, the shares have recovered some of their losses but are trading at about 71p – still below the 73.6p at which taxpayers break even.</p>

<p>In Lloyds’ <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/Investors/annual-reports/">annual report</a> it said there could be market volatility before and after the EU referendum on 23 June. </p>

Over-resourcing is the word, RBS are 'exiting' many countries at the moment and are still fretting at why their costs are not going down as those revenue streams fall away, there is still a heavy lucrative London contractor presence which won't be helped by the fact that they have to make the Williams & GLYn divestment a reality and appear incapable of doing that without flapping about and flinging handfuls of money at just about anyone who they think can fix it. Its still probably one of the best contractor gigs in town.

You couldn't make this shite up, could you? How about a new scheme -- if banks make a loss they get negative bonuses...

The UK regulator is not there to apply regulation, rather it's there to "maintain market confidence", which they do by squashing news of market malpractice by the big boys. This was and still is pretty visible for insiders.

They can get double - just so long as they have to work harder for it. Admittedly the BofE will likely step in with a QE package, bags o' cash and suck their plums, but still, at least I've tried.

The EU impose a max 2x cap on bonuses. If you get Brexit, you remove that cap.

And this is why I'm voting for Brexit - because it will make it hard work for these wankers - and they need some hard work. The Useless. Lazy. Tossers.

My 30 years old Aspie son works the night shift at a local garage for £8 per hour, something to do with having a limited skill set. I doubt that I can explain how others also with a limited skill set according to reports earn so much more.

It pays me to stay with RBS because of the travel insurance deal they do me with pre-existing conditions. I won't cut off my nose to spite my face, but once I decide not to travel abroad any more, they will be history for me.

It does seem a shame that the senior management team lack the necessary skill set to do do their jobs, other than knowing how to trouser undeserved bundles of cash.

It's hardly worth moaning about this any more. When the next crash arrives, and it's any day soon, hopefully we can have a second crack at reforming this corrupt system that doles out massive rewards no matter what.
