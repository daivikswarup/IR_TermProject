Eurozone recovery falters as Greece slips back into recession

<p>The eurozone recovery remains disappointingly weak after <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/greece">Greece</a> fell back into recession and Italy slowed to near stagnation.</p>

<p>The single currency area grew by just 0.3% in the final quarter of 2015, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/12/market-turmoil-eurozone-gdp-growth-figures-france-germany-live-updates">statistics body Eurostat reported on Friday</a>.</p>

<p>On an annual basis, the eurozone expanded by 1.5%, down from 1.6% three months earlier, suggesting growth remains weak despite the European Central Bank’s stimulus measures and the positive impact of cheap oil.</p>

<p>Greece was the worst performing member of the eurozone, with GDP falling by 0.6% in the last three months of last year. That followed a steep contraction of 1.4% between July and September, when capital controls were imposed and its banks were shut.</p>

<p>“Greece continued to be hampered by fiscal austerity and capital controls,” said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany">Germany</a>, the eurozone’s largest economy, grew by 0.3% in the last quarter.

<p>The country was affected by the slowdown in the global economy, according to Anna Zabrodzka<strong>, </strong>economist at Moody’s Analytics.</p>

<p>Zabrodzka said:</p>

<p>The slowdown in emerging markets, particularly China, has dampened external demand for German products. The upside should come from the weaker euro, which should partially mitigate soft external demand</p>

<p>Carsten Brzeski of ING fears that Germany could struggle in 2016.<br/></p>

<p>“On top of the well-known risk factors like slowing China and emerging markets or a still struggling eurozone, low oil prices and the possible weakness of the US economy could give the German economy a hard time,” he said.</p>

<p>“In particular, any slowdown of the US economy could turn out to be a double whammy for Germany.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/portugal">Portugal</a> only grew by 0.2% in the last quarter, down from 0.4% in the third quarter. That’s a blow to Lisbon’s new leftwing government, as it tried to unwind some of the austerity measures implemented by its predecessors.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</a> was the big disappointment, with expansion slowing to just 0.1% against predictions of 0.3% growth. Italian growth has slowed steadily through 2015, since managing growth of 0.4% in the first three months.<br/></p>

<p class="tweet-body" dir="ltr" lang="en">Ouch. Italy real GDP growth up by just 0.1% qoq in the final quarter of last year.</p>

<p>And Finland, one of the most fervent supporters of austerity during the debt crisis, is also still shrinking. GDP fell by 0.1% in the last quarter.</p>

<p>The Netherlands expanded by 0.3%, while the Spanish economic recovery continued with growth of 0.8%. That made Spain the only large EU member to grow faster than <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2016/jan/28/markets-braced-for-fourth-quarter-uk-gdp-growth-figures-live">Britain, which posted growth of 0.5%</a>.</p>

<p>Holger Sandte of Nordea Markets warned that the eurozone faced “big risks” this year, if the recent stock market turmoil fed through to the real economy.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>We currently pencil in GDP growth of 0.3% q/q for Q1. The big question is how much the turmoil on financial markets will weigh on growth. The wealth effect may not be very strong in the euro area, but it is still negative. </p>

<p>“Moreover, the euro is about to strengthen which dampens both exports and inflation. On top of that, problems in the banking sectors might mean that bank lending soon will decline before long.”</p>

<p>IHS’s Howard Archer also warned that the eurozone figures could be disappointing this year.</p>

<p>We have been expecting eurozone GDP growth to improve modestly to 1.7% in 2016, but this is currently looking ever more questionable and may well need to be revised down. </p>

<p>“There are clearly mounting downside risks to the eurozone growth outlook coming from global growth problems and financial market weakness and volatility.”</p>

<p>European stock markets <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/12/turbulent-week-stock-markets-investors-safe-havens-gold-yen">rallied on Friday morning, after days of heavy losses</a>.

I found your writing quite positive even if some of your fact are distorted and I believe that is not all your fault. I do believe that the Turks and Greeks should form closer cooperation and relationships although that seems like it requires more effort on Greeks side than Turks. Greeks seem to have a chip on their shoulders when it comes to dealing with Turkey.

It is strange that people who are normally talking fiscal orthodoxy are silent when economies are growing when the real question should be is this growth sustainable over the long term? And if growth is coming from QE stimulace and loose monetary policy the answer is obviously no it is not sustainable growth.

Greece won't get out of of its predicaments (and they are many) until its people embrace a liberal, truly democratic, meritocratic, open values. Ah, and until its family life becomes a little more closer to modern times (all this reliance of the young to the old destroys the young). It will take generations, the long march of history...

Nice that you basically ask Germans to be nice to the civilized Greeks but not to be nice to the allegedly uncivilized Syrians who were already filling Greek Islands even before Merkel said anything. I am surprised by the ability of some people to project all evil in the world onto her and I am definitely not a fan of her.

Greece's problem is its political elite sold it to the financial elite and it is completely corrupt. Neither is going to change and the financial elite are destroying the country.

Greece helped itself to a 20% increase in private incomes between 2002 and 2010 that outperformed all EZ countries, but was not matched by any rise in productivity, tax revenue increases, or current account surpluses. In other words, it was all borrowed money, that the ND government at the time handed out to get elected. Greece was having a party and not thinking about ever paying a bill for that. It's a little worse than 'fiddling a few numbers here and there'.
