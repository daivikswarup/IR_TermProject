Suddenly, G4S looks a long way from home

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">T</span></span>his time last year shares in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/g4s">G4S</a> were 300p, surpassing their level of 2012, the calamity year in which the firm failed to supply enough security guards to the London Olympics. Ashley Almanza, the chief executive recruited to bring order to the sprawling empire built by predecessor Nick Buckles, seemed to be halfway to success.</p>

<p>He’d put some muscle into the balance sheet with an early rights issue – £350m in 2013 – and the rest of the job seemed to be a decluttering exercise to restore G4S to its security roots. Buckles’s disjointed vision of G4S as a jack-of-all-trades outsourcer would soon be forgotten.</p>

<p>The picture looks very different now. The share price stands at 187p, down 12% on Wednesday; G4S is out of the FTSE 100 index; and the past still haunts the business. On a flattering definition, G4S’s earnings rose 14% to £227m in 2015; on a statutory basis, there was a slump from £145m to just £8m.</p>

<p>Almanza’s desire for “focus” and “discipline” remains, but it’s hard to concentrate when there are contracts like the one to house asylum seekers in the UK. G4S is struggling with a “material increase” in the number of asylum seekers and is obliged to foot hotel bills when its can’t find suitable accommodation. The result was a £20m increase in the provision to cover losses until August next year; but if the Home Office extends the contract by two years, as it can, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/09/g4s-57m-loss-if-government-extends-asylum-seeker-housing-deal">G4S estimates further losses of £57m</a>.</p>

<p>With numbers like that flying around, G4S ought to be conservatively financed. But the figure that scared the City was a rise in debt to £1.78bn, about 3.3 times earnings before all nasties. Almanza is flogging unwanted business as fast as he can (23 gone since 2013; 38 still to go) but that debt ratio still looks too high. This corporate recovery story has veered seriously off track. The City is right to fear another rights issue.</p>

<p>What was it Sir Philip Green said when he sold BHS for £1 almost a year ago today? Oh, yes: “I am deeply proud of the work ethic displayed by the very many people I have worked with for so long at BHS, both within our head office and across the stores.” </p>

<p>The great retailing knight now has a chance to express his gratitude in more than mere words. To the surprise of almost nobody, BHS has not prospered under the ownership of Retail Acquisitions, the obscure outfit to which Green sold the department store chain. BHS has filed for a form of insolvency and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/bhs-pensioners-face-cuts-to-payouts-insolvency">current and former employees face deep cuts in their pensions</a>.</p>

<p>Green, reportedly, has offered £80m as a contribution to BHS’s underfunded pension scheme. Before we call that generous, let’s see the size of the underfunding. If the hole is much bigger, Green should be asked to find more. The management of BHS under its new owner is plainly not his concern, but, when you’re selling a loss-making business with a large pensions deficit, your moral responsibilities to pensioners should not evaporate within 12 months.</p>

<p>The Green family enjoyed £400m of dividends from BHS in happier days. A substantial contribution would be the honourable course – but substantial may mean more than £80m.</p>

<p>The problem for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/mike-ashley">Mike Ashley</a> is that declining an invitation to appear before MPs isn’t a practical option for long. Sports Direct’s founder got away with it last year, insisting he was too busy and then dispatching his chairman, Keith Hellawell, to bat against the Scottish affairs committee.</p>

<p>With the business committee, his tactic was to offer a personal tour of the company’s Shirebrook warehouse. No thanks, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/sports-direct-mps-mike-ashley">committee chair Iain Wright has now replied</a>, we’ll do this on our turf, in Westminster and in public; and, by the way, you may be in contempt of parliament if you still decline to come.</p>

<p>At this point, even Ashley should realise that procrastination has reached its limit. If his appearance turns into a battle of wills, the MPs will win. Ashley’s best approach now is to accept that he should go and get on top of every detail.</p>

<p>The rest of us should hope the MPs also do their homework. Back in 2007, a different committee was terribly pleased with its power to summon the bosses of the private equity industry but incapable of handling vaguely technical answers. The result was three hours of frustration on all sides.</p>

<p>Note to Wright’s committee: make sure you know the difference between a zero-hours contract and a contract a temporary Sports Direct worker has with an employment agency. Ashley will.</p>

My understanding is that he or any other person called before a Parliamentary Select Committee can be compelled to attend. Failure to do so is contempt.

The Committee can huff and puff as much as it likes as far as Ashley at Sports Direct is concerned!
