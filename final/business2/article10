Tesco to launch 'wonky veg' range




DateTime::::2016-03-11T14:52:48+0000



<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco">Tesco</a> is stepping up efforts to tackle food waste with the launch of a “wonky veg” range and a pledge to send all unwanted fresh produce to charity by end of next year.</p>

<p>The Perfectly Imperfect will initially offer parsnips and potatoes before expanding to include a further 15 types of produce, including carrots and apples, over the next few months. The scheme is launching in about 200 stores from Friday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tesco is to extend its partnership with Fareshare, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.fareshare.org.uk/">food redistribution charity</a>, from 14 to about 100 stores from Friday and to its 800 largest outlets by the end of the year.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/04/tesco-fareshare-charity-reduce-food-waste">Under the partnership</a>, store managers are linked with local charities to collect unwanted food several times a week. The scheme has been tested at more than 100 stores in Ireland and has been running at at 14 stores in the UK over the past six months, including outlets in Glasgow, Belfast, on Merseyside and London.</p>

<p>The trial generated more than 22 tonnes of food – the equivalent of 50,000 meals. Now Tesco and FareShare want to join forces with 5,000 charities and community groups which would receive free surplus food. <br/></p>

<p>FareShare and the tech company <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://food.cloud/">FoodCloud</a> link stores with charities that provide meals to vulnerable people, including the homeless, substance addicts, children and the elderly.</p>

<p>Tesco generates more than 50,000 tonnes of food waste a year within its stores – about 1% of the food it handles – and it estimates that more than 30,000 tonnes of that is edible.</p>

<p>It is the only UK retailer to publish details of the amount of waste food it generates. Dave Lewis, the chief executive, said tackling waste was a priority. <br/></p>

<p>The grocer’s attempts to tackle the food waste problem come as Lewis tries to revive the supermarket’s image, which has been tarnished by a £263m accounting scandal and criticism about its service as well as its treatment of suppliers.</p>

<p>Lewis said: “This is not to get people to like us again. This is about being a responsible business. Customers today want to know businesses where they choose to shop at are responsible. We have an opportunity, given our size and scale, to make massive a contributions to the communities in which we operate in, and why wouldn’t we do that?”</p>

<p>The issue of food waste has risen up the agenda after being highlighted by celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.</p>

<p>MPs have also discussed whether legislation to ban the disposal of edible food by retailers should be introduced after a ban was imposed in France.</p>

<p>Tesco’s wonky veg launch comes after Asda and Morrisons announced similar ranges in recent weeks. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/05/asda-puts-uks-first-supermarket-wonky-veg-box-on-sale">Asda is selling boxes of in-season vegetables and salad ingredients 30% cheaper than its standard lines</a>.</p>

<p>In December, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons">Morrisons</a> reported <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/18/morrisons-waste-initiative-wonky-vegetables">brisk sales of wonky potatoes and carrots after a trial</a> in in Yorkshire and the north-east.</p>

<p> Most of the supermarkets have been distributing food left over at their warehouses to charities for several years. Sainsbury’s and Marks &amp; Spencer have schemes under which they send waste from stores to charities, but the vast majority of food waste from stores is sent for use as animal feed or to be loaded into anaerobic digestion energy plants. Lewis said: “I think the industry should work together on this. I don’t see it as a source of competitive advantage.”</p>

<p>Tesco would share its systems with other retailers, he added, and FareShare hoped to sign up another major supermarket to the scheme by the end of the year. “I don’t think this is just a trend. Demand won’t go away and no business wants to waste anything,” Lewis added.</p>

<p>Just over 1% of food wasted in the UK comes from stores, amounting to about 200,000 tonnes, according to figures published this year by the government-backed <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/">Waste Resources Action Programme</a>. Of the estimated 15m tonnes of food disposed of annually in the UK , more than half is thrown away by households. </p>

So, the supermarkets are basically admitting that they are over-charging their customers so that fruit and vegetables look nice. There is no justification for this premium.

A bit rich this! They (supermarkets) were the ones that only wanted perfectly shaped produce, forcing farmers to more or less throw away fruit and veg for no other reason but that it did not look good on their shelves. This then forced up the price that the customer had to pay.

Everything has to be marketed these days, common sense included.Otherwise no-one buys into it. It's just plain old BS holding everything together like a glue.No wonder we have the governments we do.

The wonky veg thing is brilliant. Unfortunately I can't buy it at the supermarket I use because for some reason it's only available 'in store'. Why why why Asda?

Wonder how much the farmer received? To sell produce at below or at cost prices supermarkets have to make a profit somewhere else.

That's the cause of so much waste. Even shopping for two keen veg eaters, we can't get through some of the bags.

Nope, they are no laws, there are rules that classify class 1 ,2 etc - but there has never been a law that says you cannot sell any of them.

I saw the wonky carrots in Morrisons this evening. Unfortunately I can't get through the enormous bagfuls they have on sale as I'm shopping for one. Much as I love me veg, I can't get through that much.

This story can't be true. I am sure the Daily Express (could have been Mail) told me that there were EU laws forbidding the sale of wonky vegetables, curved bananas and the like :-)

What's the percentage of wonky vegetable being sold as animal feed? 40% waste seems a tad high if the animal feed percentage figure is included to the 60% used.

We keep being told about these wonky vegetable schemes and that something like 40% of produce goes into landfill. If there's so much of it around, how come none of it ever appears for sale in my local Asda, Morrisons or Tesco ?

I would be more impressed if they launched a program of full time contracts and ended zero hours and workfare slavery. Wonky employment.

Well, except for the bland taste of course. These are still the ones that have been bred to grow fast, be disease resistant, and look uniform, all at the expense of taste. I'm afraid a bit of wonkiness isn't going to stop the tomatoes tasting like shiny bags of water.

A move in the right direction, but it will never be a solution to the problem as long as there is a distinction between 'wonky' vegetables and just 'vegetables'.

They're not wonky, just natural.

Are these going be renamed organic or premium in the future?



Author::::barbkay

The issue of food waste is simply gargantuan. In the US, for instance, 40% of food is sent to landfill, and the figure in Europe is nearly as bad. It's an insane situation given socioeconomic inequity, levels of poor nutrition in the West and the embodied water, fertiliser, soil use and labour that is lost, along with nutrients, when food is discarded. This move by Tesco's is positive, but supermarkets' part in the waste (and the rot) has to stop: the UK should definitely follow France's lead here.
