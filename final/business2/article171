<p>Leading shares have started the month on a positive note despite some mixed company news and poor manufacturing data from China.</p>

<p>Mining shares are having a mixed time, however. <strong>Anglo American</strong> has added 20.15p to 500.4p after positive news on diamond sales from its De Beers’ subsidiary. Rough diamond sales for the second sales cycle rose to $610m from $545m in the first cycle. De Beers chief executive Philippe Mellier said:</p>

<p>Retailer restocking after the end of year holiday season is supporting demand for polished diamonds and in turn, we are seeing improved demand...for rough diamonds. However, we remain mindful of the need for a cautious approach as the recovery continues.</p>

<p>But <strong>Fresnillo</strong> has fallen 26.5p to 973.5p after the Mexican precious metals miner reported a 15.4% drop in full year profits to £212.4m.</p>

<p>And <strong>Glencore</strong> is down 3.35p at 129.9p as it unveiled a 32% fall in annual profits to $8.7bn as well as $5.8bn of impairment charges.</p>

<p>But overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has added 18.20 points to 6115.29, with the disappointing Chinese purchasing managers survey prompting talk of further stimulus measures from the central bank. </p>

<p>UK manufacturing activity slumped to a near three year low, suggesting any interest rate rise is unlikely to be on the agenda for some time. Meanwhile<strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/mar/01/china-factory-slowdown-pmi-europe-uk-markets-business-live?page=with:block-56d55a2de4b063ffa7f26e4a#block-56d55a2de4b063ffa7f26e4a"> eurozone PMIs also disappointed.</a></strong></p>

<p>Elsewhere <strong>Barclays </strong>has fallen 17.1p to 154.95p following <strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/barclays-cuts-dividend-as-profits-fall-8-percent">a 2% drop in full year profits.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Ashtead</strong> is down 131p at 793p, the biggest loser in the leading index, despite a 20% rise in nine month profits. Analysts are concerned about the impact of a US slowdown on the equipment rental group. Charles Huggins at Hargreaves Lansdown said:</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/ashteadgroup">Ashtead</a> generates the bulk of its profit in US non-residential construction markets where conditions remain favourable - for now. However, the market is clearly worried about a potential US slowdown. Ashtead’s plans to cut back capital expenditure and reduce leverage are sensible in this context, but do little to allay investors’ concerns of tougher times ahead.</p>

<p>But <strong>Direct Line </strong>is up 11.5p at 400.1p as the insurer reported better than expected full year profits of £507.5m.</p>

<p>The biggest rise in the FTSE 100 is <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong>, up 199p at £28.77 as <strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/01/nyse-owner-plots-offer-for-london-stock-exchange-deutsche-borse">US group Intercontinental Exchange said it was considering making an offer</a></strong>, thus barging into the proposed merger with Deutsche Börse.</p>

<p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Greggs</strong>, 157p better at £11.92, and <strong>Just Eat,</strong> 16.2p better at 401.9p, both benefited from positive updates.</p>

<p>On Just Eat, Peel Hunt said:</p>

<p>The margin performance in the UK is materially better than we had expected and this appears to be long-term fundamental as opposed to a short-term boost. There is a lot of noise around the delivery market and whilst there are risks, we believe these have been overplayed in the short term. Given the margin surprise and recent share price weakness, we move to add from hold. </p>
