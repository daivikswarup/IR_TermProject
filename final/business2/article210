<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">‘W</span></span>e should miss Britain a lot. But Britain would miss the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> even more.” The speaker was a senior member of the Italian government, in response to a question about the attitude of Italians to the thorny issue of Brexit. The occasion was the annual Venice Seminar, where members of the Italian government speak frankly, but not for direct attribution, on the political and economic scene.</p>

<p>For many years the views expressed at those seminars about the Italian economy have been a triumph of hope over experience. For example, the Italian economy managed, after the initial impact of the great recession of 2008-10, to contract further in 2011 and 2012 when even the British economy was beginning to recover.</p>

<p>There was then a period of flatlining during which optimistic forecasts were offered to us, but never fulfilled, as Italians hung on to their substantial savings and spent little.</p>

<p>It now looks as though Italian “consumers” – ie citizens – are dipping into their savings and the economy is finally growing again, assisted by various measures which it is claimed have boosted confidence.</p>

<p>There is also, of course, the beneficial impact on real incomes of the lower price of oil. At a time when much of the gloom and doom emanating from Davos stems from the impact on the finances of oil-exporting nations, the bonus to oil-importing nations seems to have been underestimated.</p>

<p>I hope I am not alone in being slightly surprised that, after the serious recessions experienced in the west and Japan as a consequence of the two oil shocks of the 1970s – when huge increases in the price removed purchasing power and caused a serious inflationary spiral – the reverse movement in oil prices should also be considered an all-round disaster. There are winners and losers.</p>

<p>Apart from anything else, the impact on inflation is such that policymakers have a lot of scope to relax fiscal policy without in any way breaching their inflation targets. Italian ministers and officials are rightly calling for greater flexibility from Brussels with regard to fiscal rules on taxation and public spending. They feel they have gone a long way in meeting cries for “structural reform” of the economy, although there is no doubt plenty of scope for more. Meanwhile, as prime minister Matteo Renzi points out: “The EU fixation on austerity is actually destroying growth.”</p>

<p>The difference drawn by Italian officials between current attitudes towards the EU in the UK and Italy is between “Euroscepticism” in the UK and “Eurocriticism” in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</a>. (Edward Heath, who, as prime minister, took us into what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, had another word to describe the anti-Europeans in his party: “Euroseptics”, pronounced with some venom.)</p>

<p>The Italian government is already preparing for a conference in Rome next year to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Amid the travails of countries such as Spain and Italy during an economic crisis caused by the financial crash and exacerbated by the structure of the eurozone and its policies, the continued devotion to the euro has often puzzled outsiders.</p>

<p>In that respect, it is interesting to see that our own prime minister, after some ambivalence, has adopted the view I first heard from George Soros: namely that by being a member of the EU but not of the eurozone or the Schengen agreement – passport-free movement in continental <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> – the UK has “the best of both worlds”.</p>

<p>More than 60 years have passed since the Messina conference of 1955, where the groundwork for the Treaty of Rome was prepared, but which prime minister Anthony Eden refused to attend. His more enlightened successors spent most of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s trying to persuade the French that we wanted to rectify Eden’s mistake. It is difficult for many of us who followed all the shenanigans – including the successive “No’s” from President de Gaulle – to believe that, at a time when there are so many pressing problems that require pan-European cooperation, the Conservative party should be so obsessed with Brexit.</p>

<p>From now until the referendum, the public are going to be bombarded with statistics from both sides. It will not be the end of the world if we leave, but it will almost certainly be the end of the UK, on the reasonable assumption that Scotland would want to break away. The idea that we should tear up treaty arrangements negotiated over decades, and then renegotiate from a position of bargaining weakness, almost beggars belief.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is an ill-founded scare story that if we remain in the EU we are destined to participate in a political union. The others know our position and accept it, but are quite happy to go along with a Cameron claim that this reality is the result of triumphant negotiations on his part.</p>

<p>There is endless reading available on the pros and cons of being in or out, but one highly readable book is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/279455/" title=""><em>Brexit</em></a> by Denis MacShane, who was minister for Europe in the Blair government. It is subtitled “How Britain Will Leave Europe” but that is a publisher’s come-on. MacShane hopes it won’t happen, but fears it will unless the pro-Europeans get their act together.</p>

<p>My own view is that the British remain essentially conservative with a very small “c” and, other things being equal, would balk at such a retrograde step. But the opinion polls are worrying for us pro-Europeans, and the prime minister, although now apparently having stood up to be counted, is terrified of how migration will affect public opinion.</p>

<p>I therefore draw solace from the fact that last week the odds at William Hill were 2-5 for a vote to stay in and 9-5 for Brexit. The big question is: will voters follow the money in the end?</p>

Well it seems you have more direct experience of it than I. I guess if what you say is correct, then Cameron will get a very good deal for the UK . If this happens, then I'm sure most of us would be happy to stay in the EU. I just feel that Cameron wont get it. I hope I'm wrong. For many of us , we just see the EU giving out rules & orders to us about how we must behave - dropping many traditional British ways of doing things. We don't like this. Also, when anybody has speaks out against the EU in any way whatsoever, that person is usually written off as some kind of "fascist " or "racist" or "bigot" - and given only negative reporting by the media. This doesn't allow for free open debate about the peoples' issues regarding the EU. Therefore people want to leave. I mean if you guys gave more open debate about the issues and justify EU decisions through debate instead of throwing rules at us. For eg, anyone concerned about immigration is just written off as a bigot - instead of allowing the matter to be freely debated

There's no doubt that some lets say ....temporary, seasonal type of immigration is required by most countries; and these people will be on temporary work visas - not citizenship - and their rights aren't the same as citizens (this is an arrangement I have regularly been on myself during my travels ). But permanent immigration (with passports etc ) in a country which is already over populated, has its own working unemployment probkems, and limited space in housing, educations , health care is going to have many negative effects for that country. Some countries like Sweden & Germany , for eg, have different demographics - and probably need extra permanent residents). One also need to look at the culture & religion of the migrants becos some types will fit-in better to the host country than other types (this isn't racist - it's an absolute fact). Incidentally, I'm not suggesting we shouldn't help & support migrants - we should - but there are ways to do this other immediately going the route of permanent citizenship

Yes, I understand that, have been doing for years as a part of my work but it seems that the only part of any negotiation we would be on is outside the door, waiting to hear what the rest of the EU wanted to dish out. Given that more and more of them are pretty pissed off with Cameron's ineptitude (not to mention those in his own party) I'd have thought that we wouldn't be getting the best terms on a future relationship. I'll post the specific Treaty Reference here as soon as I find the copy of Prospect that it is in...

I'm not sure what debate you think is being prevented inside the EU. There is a debate to be had about the balance of powers between the elected parliament, the bureaucrats and the heads of governments but it seems to me that UK has all the key powers it needs to maintain independence. In truth, if you have ever had experience of the EU decision processes (as I have) you see its almost entirely about benign and beneficial actions to ensure a level playing field between the EU nations.

It's conceivable that migrants have had a depressing effect on wages in some locations and in some jobs but the extent to which this has occurred is far from certain. Where I live there is a mass migration of foreigners every year to deal with agricultural needs, yet farmers still experience shortages. But if proven then there are sensible measures to deal with it other than border controls, which damage the economy. Net immigration does have a mathematical effect on total growth, however this can't be a source of criticism since we have also experienced per capita growth.

re you saying that the problem is that contradictory rulings by the ECJ and UK courts have to be resolved to clarify possible exit negotiations? i.e does one interpretation mean that the UK would have relatively little status in negotiations and there other imply that it does have more status?

"It needs to be a bigger debate with Britain taking a leading role in finding long-term solutions " The problem is that we're "not allowed" t have this debate from inside the EU.

The rusting stern of the Cornelis Vrolijk towers over the quayside in Ijmuiden, an immense port near Amsterdam. She is one of the largest trawlers in Europe: a mighty 370ft long, capable of hauling in 150 tons of herring and mackerel each time she throws her giant nets overboard.The captured creatures are sucked down tubes, sorted for size on conveyor belts, and then frozen in a factory-style process deep in the bowels of the boat. But astonishingly, the Cornelis Vrolijk – which has reportedly stopped for less than ten hours in the UK over the past year – holds nearly 23 per cent of the entire English quota.

Oh one further point, adoption of the Euro requires entry into the ERM which is entirely voluntary. See Sweden for an example of an EU country committed to adopting the Euro that hasn't and has no intention of adopting the Euro in the foreseeable future.

You might ask yourself if the issue for you is immigration per se or the effects of immigration. If the latter there are many things the government could do at local, national and EU levels. We also might find greater powers of control emerge from the current negotiations.

I don’t think the debate about Britain’s membership of the EU is really about the balance of costs and benefits since most people would be unable to objectively calculate where their personal balance sits at the individual level. Various groups make arguments at the national level on the basis of their own vested interests which don’t necessarily include the rest of us. At one level there is a psychological fear of being dominated by Europe or by federalist ambitions in Brussels. However Britain has defended itself quite successfully in this respect by ensuring we kept out of both the Euro area (Gordon Brown) and also the Schengen area (Conservatives) and I can’t envisage any other major challenges to our sovereignty that we couldn’t deal with similarly. Free trade threatens uncompetitive corporations but the rest of us benefit from lower prices and more jobs through increased economic growth. For many people I suspect the debate is mainly driven by the fear of immigration to Britain with the right of free movement of EU citizens and also refugees and economic migrants currently coming from outside. It’s concerning that xenophobic and even racist considerations might be the dominant driver, where the only acceptable solutions are border controls and isolation. It needs to be a bigger debate with Britain taking a leading role in finding long-term solutions at the EU level rather than trying to isolate itself.

No WE are not. The Politicians and the Rich are perfectly positioned. The staggeringly wide wealth gap is absolute evidence of the extreme exploitation of working people by the rich and the connivance of the political classes in ensuring that the poor stay poor and that the importation of migrants will ensure that the exploitation will lower wages and reduce the quality of life for ordinary people. While rich fund them the Politicians appear to have their own agenda which at present looks to be getting medals for visiting Migrants camps and ignoring the worse plights in their own constituencies where UK electors and taxpayers are dirt under their feet.
