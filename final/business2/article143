<p>Despite the market continuing to drift lower <strong>Whitbread </strong>has recovered some ground from its recent falls.</p>

<p>A trading update last week showed <strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/costa-whitbread-mild-weather-high-street-growth-weak">signs of a slowdown</a></strong> in its two main businesses, Costa Coffee and Premier Inns, but analysts at Jefferies believe the decline in its shares may have gone too far.</p>

<p>Jefferies moved its recommendation from underperform to hold, although it slashed its price target from £41 to £36. The company’s shares are currently 65p higher at £37.66. </p>

<p>Analyst Ian Rennardson said:</p>

<p>With evidence of slower growth in Whitbread’s two main businesses we lower our earnings per share forecasts by 5-7% and our price target falls to 3600p, close to the current share price. We move to a hold following a near 35% fall in the share price, which we now believe may not fully reflect the potential spin-off of Costa Coffee. </p>
