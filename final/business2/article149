BAT bucks market fall amid talk of interest in Reynolds America

<p><strong>British American Tobacco</strong> is bucking the downward market trend following weekend reports the company could be on the acquisition trail.</p>

<p>Its shares are up 39p at 4083.5p in a FTSE 100 which is now down 50.41 points at 6149.02. The Sunday Telegraph reported that BAT has added Centerview Partners to its advisory team which led to speculation it could be contemplating a bid for the 58% of US group Reynolds America which it does not already own.</p>

<p>But analyst Martin Deboo at Jefferies said BAT holds most of the cards in any industry consolidation and can afford to bide its time until exchange rates are more favourable. He said:</p>

<p>We reflect on media speculation around a move by BATS for Reynolds. We keep any excitement firmly in check. We think BATS holds most of cards in any consolidation end-game and can afford to bide its time, pending a more favourable fx climate. But it all goes to show that BATS is a fabulously strategic asset, still trading on a compelling valuation despite a robust opening to 2016. </p>

<p>Centerview is advisor of the moment, having advised on the recent ABI/SAB, Kraft/Heinz and Reynolds/Lorillard transactions. So it’s perhaps no surprise that BAT might value its expertise. But we are inclined to keep our excitement in check on the imminence of any deal by BAT, for either Reynolds or indeed Imperial Brands.</p>

<p>Reynolds ... isn’t exactly cheap, trading on 22 times earnings. The back of our fag packet suggests that acquiring the remaining 58% of Reynolds at a 30% premium would cost BAT just over £39bn. Including Reynolds’ net debt, the cheque would be around £47bn in toto...</p>

<p>[Any deal] would probably require new equity.... We think BAT would want to think carefully about any dilutive raise....</p>

<p>Our principal caution around any big moves by BAT at this point in the cycle is that moving for any Developed Market assets like Reynolds or even Imperial means paying for predominantly $, £ and € earnings with Real, Rand and Rouble-denominated cashflows. Cashflows that have depreciated by over 30% in the past couple of years.</p>

<p>Our near-term caution apart, it seems almost inevitable that there will be some sort of end-game consolidation in global tobacco over the next five years... We think BAT holds most of the cards in such an end-game, which is part of what makes it such a great (and cheap!) asset for us. Philip Morris can’t lead global consolidation apart from recombining with Altria, which is arguably competition-neutral. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we think it is BAT, not Japan Tobacco, that holds the key to any consolidation of Imperial Brand. BAT’s Reynolds stake blocks any move by Japan Tobacco for RAI. So BAT has multiple choices, and can afford to bide its time, suggesting that Centerview is only at the beginning of a beautiful relationship. </p>
