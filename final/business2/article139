<p>A day after <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/10/plate-77-penny-red-uk-second-most-valuable-stamp-495000">selling a rare Penny Red stamp for £495,000</a>, <strong>Stanley Gibbons</strong> has seen its shares on offer as investors bailed out of the business.</p>

<p>The rare stamp and coin seller has fallen 42% to 21.5p after it gave more details of a proposed fundraising. It said it was close to concluding a deal to raise around £13m, but revealed that new shares would be offered at just 10p each.</p>

<p>Last month Stanley Gibbons announced the fundraising plans alongside its third profit warning in less than a year, and news that its auditors had quit. </p>

<p>The proceeds of the equity issue will be used to pay off its £6m overdraft as part of a restructuring of its £22.6m debt, as well as hiring consultants to help intergrate art dealer Mallett into its existing operations.</p>

<p>The 100 year old company has suffered over the past year or so - as have its shares - as the collectibles market declined and a series of acquisitions stretched its resources. </p>
