Spelling mistake prevented hackers taking $1bn in bank heist




DateTime::::2016-03-10T18:31:51+0000



<p>A spelling mistake in an online bank transfer instruction helped prevent a nearly $1bn heist last month involving the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> central bank and the New York Fed, banking officials said. <br/></p>

<p>Unknown hackers still managed to get away with about $80m, one of the largest known bank thefts in history. </p>

<p>The hackers breached Bangladesh Bank’s systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers, two senior officials at the bank said. They then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from the Bangladesh Bank’s account there to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, the officials said. </p>

<p>Four requests to transfer a total of about $81m to the Philippines went through, but a fifth, for $20m, to a Sri Lankan non-profit organisation was held up because the hackers misspelled the name of the NGO, Shalika Foundation. </p>

<p>Hackers misspelled “foundation” in the NGO’s name as “fandation”, prompting a routing bank, Deutsche Bank, to seek clarification from the Bangladesh central bank, which stopped the transaction, one of the officials said. </p>

<p>There is no NGO under the name of Shalika Foundation in the list of registered Sri Lankan non-profits. Reuters could not immediately find contact information for the organisation. </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank declined to comment. </p>

<p>At the same time, the unusually high number of payment instructions and the transfer requests to private entities – as opposed to other banks – raised suspicions at the Fed, which also alerted the Bangladeshis, the officials said. </p>

<p>The details of how the hacking came to light and was stopped before it did more damage have not been previously reported. Bangladesh Bank has billions of dollars in a current account with the Fed, which it uses for international settlements. </p>

<p>The transactions that were stopped totalled $850m to $870m, one of the officials said. </p>

<p>Last year, Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab said a multinational gang of cyber-criminals had stolen as much as $1bn from as many as 100 financial institutions around the world in about two years. </p>

<p>Iraqi dictator <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/07/iraq.garyyounge">Saddam Hussein’s son Qusay took $1bn from Iraq’s central bank</a> on the orders of his father on the day before coalition forces began bombing the country in 2003, American and Iraqi officials have said. In 2007, guards at the Dar Es Salaam bank in Baghdad made off with $282m. </p>

<p>Bangladesh Bank has said it has recovered some of the money that was stolen, and is working with anti-money laundering authorities in the Philippines to try to recover the rest.</p>

<p>A bank spokesman could not be reached for comment late on Thursday. </p>

<p>The recovered funds refer to the Sri Lanka transfer, which was stopped, one of the officials said. </p>

<p>Initially, the Sri Lankan transaction reached Pan Asia <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking">Banking</a> Corp, which went back to Deutsche Bank for more verification because of the unusually large size of the payment, a Pan Asia official said.</p>

<p>“The transaction was too large for a country like us,” the official said. “Then [Deutsche] came back and said it was a suspect transaction.” </p>

<p>A Pan Asia spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. </p>

<p>The dizzying, global reach of the heist underscores the growing threat of cybercrime and how hackers can find weak links in even the most secure computer networks. </p>

<p>More than a month after the attack, Bangladeshi officials are scrambling to trace the money, shore up security and identify weaknesses in their systems. They said there is little hope of ever catching the hackers, and it could take months before the money is recovered, if at all. </p>

<p>Security experts said the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution’s internal workings, probably gained by spying on bank workers. </p>

<p>The Bangladesh government, meanwhile, is blaming the Fed for not stopping the transactions earlier. The finance minister, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, told reporters on Tuesday that the country may resort to suing the Fed to recover the money. </p>

<p>“The Fed must take responsibility,” he said. </p>

<p>The New York Fed has said its systems were not breached, and it has been working with the Bangladesh central bank since the incident occurred. </p>

<p>The hacking of Bangladesh Bank happened sometime between 4-5 February, over the Bangladeshi weekend, which falls on a Friday, the officials said. The bank’s offices were shut. </p>

<p>Initially, the central bank was not sure if its system had been breached, but cybersecurity experts brought in to investigate found hacker “footprints” that suggested the system had been compromised, the officials said. </p>

<p>These experts could also tell that the attack originated from outside Bangladesh, they said, adding the bank is looking into how they got into the system and an internal investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>The bank suspects money sent to the Philippines was further diverted to casinos there, the officials said. </p>

<p>The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, which oversees the gaming industry, said it has launched an investigation. The country’s anti-money laundering authority is also working on the case.</p>

80 Million $ money hacked by the government of Bangladesh , including her son Sajeb Oaijid jai .He is also it-specialist in Bangladesh , but many people said that He can not do anything for our country , in particular It-sector. there is no suspect that We could not get money . that's reality of Bangladesh . Many workers in foreign countries employed with different types of works and they send much money for their family . That's meaning "foreign Reserve money" This money came from General people like garment workers one of them .

Nicking the odd million or two with thermal lances, white vans and crawling through the sewers to the vault access point is romantic material for a heist movie; a bunch of hackers netting $80 million typing away while consuming beer and Cheezels isn't.

I really don't understand your reply but if you are implying some kind of conspiracy theory then I suggest you look up the senate hearings involving senator Grayson where he grills the fed reserve members and also the so called independent auditors who are unable to explain where all the printed dollar bills went . But since these videos were never presented in the main stream media then I wouldn't be surprised that you are unaware of their existence . You are probably of the ilk that thinks the fed is a government entity .

You've only got to look at the way Saddam and family used the central bank as their own personal piggy bank when in power. A blind man could see that this dictator clearly believed all the country's riches were his and his alone. And his sons were even worse custodians!

The blame lies with the Bangladeshi central bank as the weakness in the system was clearly down to the quality of its controls.

I'm not sure you read what I wrote. Where did I say de Gaulle "took money from a bank"? Why do you simply repeat the bizarre assertion that the Iraqi Head of State ordering the transfer of cash out of a vault in Baghdad to a safer location on the eve of a foreign invasion was "stealing"? Repetition is no argument. Where do you get the idea that he was taking money "for his own personal use, probably..."? You're just making the same assumptions as the Guardian's lazy biased journalist, aren't you? Are you a Guardian journalist?

Surely the biggest bank robberies have been things like selling off gold reserves at bargain basement prices. I believe Canada did this last month, and Gordon Brown, the prudent one, a few years back. Then does everyone forget the bank bail-outs? That was a spectacular act of theft. Then there are the bank bail-ins, with a magnificent slight of hand your money in the bank belongs to ... the bank. Handy with another economic collapse on the way.

I've read a theory that email scammers of various kinds use bad spelling and grammar on purpose. They need to find the tiny number of people among all those who they send their spam too who are stupid and gullible enough to fall for the scam. Therefore, anybody who's smart enough to notice the obvious mistakes and ignore them is too smart for them.

Except for the slight difference between a government fearing invasion transferring assets to safer places (which European countries did too in the 1930s - several transferred most of their gold reserves to Britain or the US, to the great chagrin of the invading Germans, who found the central bank vaults mostly empty), and a dictator who knows his days are numbered stealing a billion dollars, in cash, from his own country's central bank, for his own personal use, probably in the hope of being able to live on it after he'd fled (that didn't work out, did it?). And the slight problem that De Gaulle never took any money from any bank.

Nah no one is pulling off a job like this if its gonna cost you 81 million just to finance it even if it was 1bn return. An Insider with the bank maybe a former employee or a disgruntled worker. A couple off hackers, and people to set up the bank accounts where the money is going to land. very very cheap to pull off. Look at the countries involved as well. All it would of taken was a jobs worth to be monitoring their computer and raising the red flag at the first transaction and it would of been over before it began. This was an online smash and grab, although carefully planned out, it was a case as take what we can get, convert into bitcoins or keep splitting and bouncing the money around, remove themselves from the public area with wifi but no cctv, destroy the brand new laptop they used to commit the crime then dispose of it in a fire just for good measure. go home play world of warcraft get nagged by mum about not having a job quietly smirk to themselves and sit a few years out. Then make a kickstarter or gofundme, with a terrible idea, buy a burner laptop again transfer money anomalously to that idea and repeat in small doses. As long as they used a VPN and never used windows 10 or had a laptop with a camera, dont talk to their accomplices online about it, then they should be living happily ever after.
