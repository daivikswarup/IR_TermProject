<p>Housebuilding shares are subsiding after a mixed picture from the latest surveys of property prices.</p>

<p><strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/03/house-price-creeps-up-nationwide-mortgage-stamp-duty">Halifax said the average price of a house fell 1.4% over the month in February, while Nationwide said they edged up just 0.3%.</a></strong> Overall, prices are expected to continue rising over the year, but the forthcoming EU referendum could weigh on the market.</p>

<p>So <strong>Taylor Wimpey</strong>, which reported<strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2016/mar/01/taylor-wimpey-builds-up-record-results"> a record performance for last year earlier in the week,</a></strong> has fallen 4.7p to 177.6p, <strong>Barratt Development</strong> is down 11.5p at 566.5p and <strong>Berkeley</strong> has dropped 55p to $30.63. <strong>Persimmon</strong>, whose shares have also gone ex-dividend, has lost 46.9p to Â£19.87.</p>

<p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Crest Nicholson</strong> has lost 19p to 543p and <strong>Bovis Homes</strong> is down 28.5p at 913.5p.</p>

<p>Elswhere <strong>Standard Chartered, </strong>which has been under pressure for its exposure to flagging emerging markets,<strong> </strong>has climbed 27.65p to 482.5p on recovery hopes after a buy note from Berenberg. The bank said:</p>

<p>Restructuring a bank tends to be a difficult process where supportive markets are usually helpful. Unfortunately for <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/standardchartered">Standard Chartered</a>, it faces a weak operating environment but, unlike other banks trying to restructure in the sector, Standard now seems to be in control of its destiny. While we expect further losses during the first half of 2016 as Standard finishes dealing with legacy issues, the focus is moving from capital to revenues as balance sheet concerns fade. For that reason, we continue to believe Standard is a bank restructuring that is attractive, considering its 60% discount to tangible book value.</p>
