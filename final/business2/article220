EDF's Hinkley Point nuclear nightmare adds to company's woes




DateTime::::2016-03-07T11:40:19+0000



<p>Building an £18bn nuclear power station such as Hinkley Point C would be a huge financial commitment for any energy company – even one that is mainly state-owned.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.edf.fr">EDF</a>, the company at the heart of the Somerset project that is 85% owned by the French government, has brought in Chinese state-owned firms as partners and negotiated generous subsidies with the UK government.</p>

<p>However, the resignation of EDF’s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, shows nervousness at the top of the group <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns">about the dangers of a project of this magnitude</a>, even though chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy insisted on Monday that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/hinkley-investment-decision-soon-says-edf-chief-after-finance-director-resigns">he still wanted to reach a final decision on the Hinkley investment soon</a>.</p>

<p>EDF is under tremendous pressurefrom inside the company to stop but also to proceed, with the British government desperate to avoid a flagship energy project being abandoned at a time when few other schemes seem to be going right.</p>

<p>The French president, François Hollande, told UK PM David Cameron last week <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/03/dobsons-switch-at-schroders-corporate-governance-anyone">that he wanted to see Hinkley go ahead</a>, but he has loaded EDF with added financial responsibilities at a time when it could least manage them.</p>

<p>Hinkley Point in 2012 might have looked like just another ambitious but doable scheme. But the intervening years have brought trouble – a lot of it – to the French company.</p>

<p>EDF has been building a European pressurised reactor (EPR) plant in Normandy, <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a>. The latest EPR has been dreamed up by EDF in conjunction with its engineering partner Areva.</p>

<p>It was meant to be a showcase to the world, allowing EDF and Areva to market and build these plants globally, not least at Hinkley in Somerset. But<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/12/edf-energy-delays-hinkley-point-nuclear-decision"> Flamanville has turned into a nightmare project </a>with endless delays, regulatory problems and cost overruns. </p>

<p>The situation has been made worse by another scheme involving EPRs at Olkiluoto in Finland. This too has turned into a huge public relations embarrassment. It has been plagued with contract disputes, broken budgets and is 10 years behind schedule.</p>

<p>The Japanese nuclear disaster that occurred five years ago this Saturday has badly dented confidence in nuclear power, the technology that EDF specialises in. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/30/germany-to-shut-nuclear-reactors">Germany has decided to abandon atomic power</a> in the aftermath of Fukushima. </p>

<p>France relies on it for almost all of its electricity and will continue to do so. But the Paris government has insisted EDF must introduce new safety mechanisms on its reactors in France. The cost of these changes have been estimated by some experts at up to €50bn (£38.7bn).</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21587782-europes-electricity-providers-face-existential-threat-how-lose-half-trillion-euros">wholesale cost of electricity has been tumbling</a> in Britain and the rest of Europe, making it harder for relatively higher-cost nuclear to compete. </p>

<p>Some of this is temporary, due to falling oil and gas prices, and some is more permanent because of subsidised renewable power. Wind and solar technologies are developing fast and reducing in price, which puts more pressure on rival energy sources. </p>

<p>EDF, which has already large debts, has already been forced to borrow money to pay for dividends to shareholders, notably the French government. The share price has been hammered by these financial stresses and is now almost 90% lower than it was in 2007. </p>

<p>News of the finance director’s resignation led EDF shares to plunge 10% in early trading on Monday. Even many financial analysts in the City of London have concluded that Hinkley would be a step too far. </p>

<p>RBC Capital Markets said: “To proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity.”</p>

<p>EDF has in turn said it is willing to sell a bundle of €6bn worth of assets to raise cash in the meantime. Among the stakes that could be sold is a 30% holding in <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/edf">EDF Energy</a> in Britain, the formal developer of Hinkley. It is not clear at this time who would want to buy these assets and what price they would pay.</p>

<p>A lot of EDF’s problems have been caused by the near financial collapse at its nuclear engineering partner, Areva. This company designed the EPR and has been at the heart of the Olkiluoto plant delays. It is said to need a €7bn cash injection over the next couple of years to keep going. </p>

<p>The French government has in effect demanded that EDF take over Areva – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="https://next.ft.com/content/58610c04-c502-11e5-808f-8231cd71622e">putting even more pressure on EDF’s finances</a>. Areva has designed the proposed new Hinkley reactors and was meant to be lined up to win some of the biggest contracts there much to the frustration of British engineering firms.</p>

<p>The financial pressures on EDF have led to the company announcing in January a 5% reduction to its workforce. </p>

<p>The French unions, who have places on the group board, are furious and blame Hinkley for some of the problems. They want the Somerset project ditched to avoid further difficulties. </p>

<p>They are accused by some nuclear industry experts of leaking negative information from board meetings to try to undermine the Hinkley plans further.</p>

<p>The resignation of Piquemal, which apparently happened last week but was only confirmed on Monday, suggests even he believes Hinkley could break the EDF camel’s back. For such a senior executive to walk out at such a crucial point puts enormous pressure on Levy not to proceed too quickly. </p>

<p>Piquemal is believed to have wanted to delay the decision on Hinkley until new money was successfully raised from the proposed asset sales. Levy may yet get his way over the dissenters inside the board but the stakes are now very, very high. </p>

DateTime::::2016-03-09T12:29:14Z
And when you've finished providing those workings to back up your assertions and gainsay what I provided above, have a ponder as to why if there is all this capacity available in the UK per your latest google finding, why Coir Glas isnt being built...you may find its related to your latest google finding not bothering with all those irrelevant things like cost projections...



Author::::mull
DateTime::::2016-03-09T12:12:54Z
Indeed, lets see your workings for how they are going to do better than the numbers you plucked out of a report and then scaled up wrongly then. Let's have detail.

Your guessing was spectacularly wrong, to put it mildly, wasn't it?



Author::::TBombadil
DateTime::::2016-03-09T11:21:02Z
you cant extrapolate like that. The relationship between power capacity and energy stored is not deterministic.



Author::::mull
DateTime::::2016-03-09T09:57:32Z
So, now we've seen that you cant subtantiate there is enough power capacity to meet demand even if cost is ignored coupled with ridiculous assumptions on ignoring regulatory rules, enviromental concerns and simultaneous 100% availability of all plants plus total dispatachability across a continental land mass and its islands, lets move onto the 2nd constraint.

Sorry I agree I should have said TWh. I was suggesting that if we more than double the energy output from 522TWh to 1172TWh it is likely that we would at the same time more than double the capacity from 233GW to 523GW.



Author::::mull
DateTime::::2016-03-08T22:33:12Z
You're mixing up power and energy - GWh is a measure of energy, not power generation needed to meet peak demand. It's TWh of energy as well incidentally, not GWh.



Author::::TBombadil
DateTime::::2016-03-08T22:08:51Z
From my link it says they have already developed 522GWh of generation and have another 650GWh available for development. Assuming the capacity increases proportionally that would mean they should be able to create a total of 233x(522+650)/522=523GW i.e., almost exactly what would be required for hydro to supply peak demand on its own.

what about damage to the estuary and whole region in the event of a meltdown, leak, or 100 other unknowns?



Author::::mull
DateTime::::2016-03-08T19:28:05Z
No, from your link:



Author::::TBombadil
DateTime::::2016-03-08T18:39:08Z
Peak demand is 522GW. Europe has developed less than half its potential for hydro, it already has 233GW of capacity so should be able to produce 100% of peak demand from hydro if required.



Author::::Rick Shea
DateTime::::2016-03-08T17:49:29Z
And again, you didn't answer my question.

As a start for your costings, the Morrocan CSP cost $9bn for c580MW, thats the most generous figure I can find for it.



Author::::mull
DateTime::::2016-03-08T17:39:32Z
So, from your numbers and on the heroic assumption that all the hydro is available for dispatch, it can't supply anything like peak demand needs. That's a bit a problem wouldn't you say given hydro is supposed to covering the cold winter evenings across the continent when there's an anti cyclone sat over us?

Annual consumption in Europe is 3210 TWh and peak demand 522 GW. Hydro output in the Eurelectrci group 553TWh and capacity 198GW. There is also about 35GW of pumped storage capacity built, under construction or planned. Less than half the hydro potential in the Eurelectric group has been developed, a further 650 TWh of generation has been identified.

So you basically went to all the effort to come in here, and invent a scenario to malign him and say that he'd change his tune when he sat down and thought about his wonderful paycheck, based on nothing more than a desperate belief that money deservingly corrupts, and the whole point of it was WHAT exactly? Do think about what you're alleging.

 Nuclear is convenient in that you can just swap it for coal pretty much, no expensive grid upgrades needed.

Pumped hydro allows one to store surplus supplies from wind and solar. It can then be added to the much larger conventional reservoir storage to match supply to demand. There is extensive conventional hydro in Europe as well as some pumped hydro. Both are being expanded.

If what you want to do is make more ants, sure. But this isn't about making more ants, this is about winning a race. In fact, you don't want to have a greater weight for the same outcome. That analogy works well with nuclear and renewables, to achieve the same energy output, with the latter we have to use a hell of a lot more natural resources.



Author::::mull
DateTime::::2016-03-08T13:41:11Z
Pumped hydro stores the electricity surplus on the grid available when wind output is high and releases at times when it is low eg Dinorwig could operate like this and hence accomodates renewable intermittency to the extent of their capacity/output, provided of course we accept the cost penalties of doing so and loss of the cold start when it might be needed.

There are no EPR reactors in operation because they are a new design.That too (and the fact that France destroyed the industrial sector and knowledge base which allowed its existing reactors to be built and had to start from scratch) is why the first ones are taking so long to build.When they are running, each plant will produce double the power of AGR reactors.The trouble with trying to build another AGR reactor is that, even more than in France, all the skills and knowledge about how to build them has been destroyed through neglect.Drawing something on paper / computer is one thing. Knowing how to ensure high quality concrete is made to the same standards day after day on remote building sites and poured to form a safe reactor surround is another.At least one AGR reactor had to be closed early because the concrete failed because a worker peed in it. The salt from the pea, reacted to the radiation and the concrete started to flake.Similarly in Finland 18 months of work had to be re-done because the sub-contractor did not read the specifications and poured concrete suitable for France and not for Finnish winters.....So to build nuclear power stations (relatively) cheaply, you have to have government policies which ensure there is always at least one site on the go.A bit like solar, where over €1 billion in factory investment has been scrapped in Europe (that includes the UK) because governments first introduced subsidies then took them away...

I am puzzled as to why nuclear is seen as any kind of solution. It has a negative learning curve, in other words it consistently becomes more expensive, not less. It requires vast subsidy over decades beyond the most expensive commercial renewables, and it is based on the outdated notion of 'base power'. The future is flexibility through digitisation in the power industry - the tech is leaving one-way power supply from giant stations behind.

From the information I have been able to find, there do not seem to be any examples of this EPR design operating, anywhere in Europe. The idea behind the design seems to have been around for a decade, and those reactors being built on the principle have run into all sorts of delays and problems.
