<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor">Bank of England</a> boss Mark Carney has accused the G20 of failing to adopt measures to boost global growth as he defended central banks and their power to play a role in stimulating economic growth following attacks from critics who say they have run out of ammunition. <br/></p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2016/885.aspx">Speaking at a meeting of G20 finance ministers</a> and bank governors in Shanghai on Friday, Carney turned on City economists who say the world’s major central banks have done all they can to prevent the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/feb/25/uk-growth-figures-gdp-imf-warning-china-g20-business-live?page=with:block-56ceb19ae4b0b3733c630661#block-56ceb19ae4b0b3733c630661">global economy from slipping back into recession</a>.</p>

<p>He said: “Several commentators are peddling the myth that monetary policy is ‘out of ammunition’. This is wrong, but the widespread absence of global price pressures demands that our firepower be well aimed.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/bank-of-japan-shocks-markets-by-adopting-negative-interest-rates">The Bank of Japan</a> recently joined the European Central Bank, the Danish central bank, the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in cutting rates to below zero to rescue their economies from deflation and the prospect of recession.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/06/federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike-close-call-minutes">The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December</a> to calm what it thought was a strongly growing US economy, but a string of poor economic figures since then has put pressure on Janet Yellen, the Fed chair, to reverse the policy at the central bank’s next meeting in March.</p>

<p>Carney has hinted that he is <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/23/bank-of-england-could-cut-interest-rates-to-zero-but-not-below-says-mark-carney">prepared to cut the base rate from 0.5%,</a> but has ruled out following the trend for negative rates, saying it would damage the stability of UK banks and building societies.</p>

<p>William White, a former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the central bankers’ club, who now chairs the OECD’s review committee, warned that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/20/investors-run-cover-repeat-of-2008-financial-crash-davos-bear-markets">central bankers had “used up all their ammunition”</a> ahead of the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos last month.</p>

<p>Amid steep falls in stock markets that some economists said were a sign of panic among global investors at the worsening economic outlook, he said: “The situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up. </p>

<p>“Debts have continued to build up over the past eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief.”</p>

<p>The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending that eventually led to the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/13/lehman-brothers-collapse-five-years-later-shiver-spine">Lehman Brothers</a> crash. </p>

<p>Carney, who is also head of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/09/mark-carney-warning-banking-reform-fatigue">G20 financial stability board</a>, said the banking system remained strong despite the recent downturn and could withstand shocks from volatile markets. </p>

<p>He added that central banks still had a role to play to boost lending and confidence among businesses and consumers, but politicians should not rely on cuts in interest rates and quantitative easing to turn around an “unforgiving” global economy.</p>

<p>He accused <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/g20">G20</a> governments, which include the UK, US, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India and Indonesia, of failing to keep their side of a bargain that meant ending trade protections and enacting financial reforms to boost growth.</p>

<p>“At the Brisbane summit in 2014, the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/23/g20-finance-ministers-global-growth-target-two-percentage-points">G20 leaders agreed an ambitious goal</a> to lift the level of G20 GDP by at least 2% by 2018. But only 18 months on, the two in five commitments are starting to look more like the 5/2 diet. </p>

<p>“Less than half of the measures have been implemented, and only around one third of the promised impact on global GDP has been delivered. Moreover, whilst implementation has lagged, the need to boost growth has increased in size and urgency.”</p>

<p>He said the Bank of England expects the level of global GDP in 2018 to be more than 3% below what the IMF expected at the time of the Brisbane summit. </p>

<p>“We need to live up to China’s G20 priorities: structural reforms with a long-term focus but a short-term implementation horizon, determined reform of the global architecture for sustainable capital flows and the development of our essential macroprudential frameworks and the implementation of our financial reform commitments to address new vulnerabilities.”</p>

If you try to unpick what he says, it means "allow money to be shifted round the world by hedge funds to dodge taxes leaving unemployment behind them, tighten controls on government spending, and put more taxpayers money aside to bail out the banks again.Everything that needs undoing not doing!

I agree, but the problem with Keen is thatA) He evades the fact that people are the true source of money B) He evades the fact that banks are laundering our promissory notes, and that the debts they claim to themselves are fraudulent (they give up no comenserable consideration.C) Any economy subject to compound interest on the currency, will suffer perpetual price inflation/volumetric deflation.

They lack money because banks control the issuance of money, falsify the debts to themselves and charge compound interest...No bank has *anything* until an obligor signs a promissory contract, at which point money is issued against a home/property.

The quick enactment of structural reforms with long-term financial stability mind, reforms to prevent harmful financial speculation, development of models that actually reflect the real economy as to better inform policy makers and a government with the guts to actually put this all in place for the betterment of its people.

There is an inherent problem in debt sustainability. I agree with most of what you say. You mention personal income tax cuts. However most of the government revenue comes from those taxes directly or indirectly (VAT i.e.). Also, all the infrastructure investment will go to the private sector, and is unlikely to boost salaries, and is likely to increase the profitability of sources that will not boost demand, if anything they will boost supply. The only improvements that remain in the general population are unemployment and welfare. Turning those people into workers and in turn taxpayers, could improve the situation slightly, but it is unlikely to do much because unemployment in the UK is relatively low, and people on welfare are locked in that situation either by genuine lack of capacity to work or by genuine inability to survive on current wages. And in any case any temporary benefits will evaporate with the next wave of automation. Most of the capital is still locked and reproducing in places that cannot boost traditional demand. Put simply, a billionaire can only drink and eat so much. But the problem of demand is a problem of affordability. The need is there, however the equilibrium of supply and demand is tied to inequality of wealth distribution. The taxes that will sustain the debt can realistically only be increased by two ways: Generous salary raises, and severe increase in corporate taxation. However both of these things stumble on globalisation. Generous wage increases will increase migration which will in turn prevent them from being sustained, and corporations will just move on to the next lowest bidder country, depriving UK of any income whatsoever. The idea was that negative rates in a global scale could deflate debt as a proportion of GDP, however as we've witnessed the capital will be channelled into the same dysfunctional source, derivatives, and potentially further asset acquisition, creating asset bubbles, while increasing wealth inequality and debt in the process. And the same goes for all countries. This problem can only be solved now with a global consensus that includes income increase and corporate taxation (and possibly with new inheritance capping laws hindering the ability to pass on any amount of capital/assets from one generation to another) or else it will eventually solve itself by complete economic collapse in the future.

There appears to be an urgent need to accord primacy to the role of aggregate demand in expanding real GDP. Following from this, policymakers will necessarily have to sustainably boost aggregate demand through a combination of: (1) personal income tax cuts, (2) expenditure on critical infrastructure renewal, (3) concerted efforts aimed at removing existing distortions in the global trade in goods and services and (4) good-value-for-money spending on productivity-enhancing education and re-skilling initiatives. However, this will require exquisite mastery of empirical data that enable targeting those consumer segments with the highest marginal propensity to consume and by extension facilitating the application of an appropriate multiplier.

Yes indeed. Unfortunately, from the perspective of the current neo-liberal (flat earth) ‘ruling elite’ any change of tack is unthinkable. And so we must suffer the worst economic crisis of all time. History shows us that tends to lead to the risk of ‘charismatic leaders’, that introduce radical change, coming to power. But there is legal imperative that those changes must be to our benefit.

“structural reforms with a long-term focus but a short-term implementation horizon, determined reform of the global architecture for sustainable capital flows and the development of our essential macroprudential frameworks and the implementation of our financial reform commitments to address new vulnerabilities.”What a load of waffle. The problem is we have hit the point of peak global (private) debt, and encouraging more private debt is pushing on a spring. This was the inevitable consequence of our debt based monetary system. And without the debt increasing you get deflation. They need governments to start borrowing more to fund new (GDP enhancing) infrastructure, and know that ‘austerity’ is hindering this process. But of course Carney cant say that out loud, because it undermines the governments neo-liberal policy position. So the boat will continue to sink.

When Ben Bernanke said that the problem with QE was that it worked in practice, but didn't work in theory he was effectively admitting that Economics is not a science - it's an art. A political art. The G20s' reluctance to spend money on infrastructure investment and instead frame the political debate in terms of "austerity" is a strategy that places the burden of the recovery on the poorest in society. There is an alternative to Central Banker and Government complacency. I'm an optimist and I see the rise of Sanders and Corbyn as proof that people are beginning to see the light.
