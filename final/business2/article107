No 10 concedes Sunday trading defeat after Commons rebellion




DateTime::::2016-03-09T19:45:37+0000



<p>No 10 has conceded that its plans to relax Sunday trading laws are dead in the water, after <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron">David Cameron</a> suffered his biggest Commons defeat since the election at the hands of his own Conservative MPs.</p>

<p>The government’s attempt to let larger shops trade for longer than six hours each Sunday was voted down after 27 Tory backbenchers teamed up with <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> and the SNP.</p>

<p>It lost by 31 votes after Cameron failed to reach a compromise with unconvinced MPs, who argued that it was necessary to “keep Sunday special” and protect family time for shop workers.</p>

<p>The defeat is the second of this parliament in the Commons for Cameron, and the first major one since his failure to win a vote on military action in Syria in 2013. His first loss of the parliament was a vote won by Tory Eurosceptics and Labour over the “purdah” rules governing the EU referendum in September.</p>

<p>Downing Street was quick to blame the SNP, whose MPs helped scupper the measures relating to England and Wales even though Sunday trading laws are already relaxed in Scotland.</p>

<p>But the real damage to the government was done by 27 of its MPs, whose rebellion underlined Cameron’s weakened grasp over his parliamentary party and highlighted the fractious mood of backbenchers in the run-up to next week’s budget and June’s referendum on membership of the European Union. </p>

<p>The defeat was particularly painful because ministers had offered to significantly water down the plans by rolling them out in only 12 pilot areas, in a last-ditch attempt to stave off the rebellion.</p>

<p>However, the government submitted its amendment too late to the Speaker, John Bercow, and MPs were unwilling to accept a promise by Brandon Lewis, a communities minister, that the concession would be introduced in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>It is understood No 10 then rang round Tory MPs to try to bring them onside, but was unable to persuade enough to make a difference to the result.</p>

<p>After the vote, Downing Street sources confirmed they were conceding defeat and there were no plans to proceed with more pilot schemes or find a way to circumvent the SNP’s opposition. The source said it was a clear result so they would not expect there was any way forward.</p>

<p>The plan would have allowed local councils to make a decision about whether to let larger stores stay open for longer than six hours on Sundays, which ministers said could benefit the UK economy by an estimated £1.5bn or more over 10 years.</p>

<p>But the successful rebellion was led by David Burrowes, who laid an amendment to kill off the plans completely by striking them from the legislation.</p>

<p>The Burrowes amendment was supported by 317 MPs from across the parties, including Labour, the SNP, the DUP, some Tories and some Lib Dems, while 286 voted against it.</p>

<p>Speaking against the plans, Burrowes said: “We have a job to do in parliament, we don’t just devolve every decision out to our constituents. </p>

<p>“If we listen to our constituents … I have many shopworkers, many faith groups and many others saying: why are we doing this? Why are we trying to unpick something that’s fairly settled? </p>

<p>“That’s me listening to my constituents. But also we have important principles as well. Those are complex arrangements for Sunday trading and it’s a duty on us to look at it carefully, to consult widely and also scrutinise it fairly. </p>

<p>“None of those things have happened to the regard that did happen back in the 1990s and 1980s. It shouldn’t surprise us that we are in this situation now where there is a lot of concern, a lot of cross-party concern.” </p>

<p>Ministers had hoped to avoid a defeat by doing a deal with the SNP but the party <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/08/government-faces-sunday-trading-defeat-after-snp-flip-flop">decided on Tuesday night</a> to vote against the measures – giving the government little time to thrash out a compromise with Tory rebels. The SNP said it acted to avoid a “knock-on impact to Scottish workers who would be at risk of pay cuts”.</p>

<p>Responding for the government, Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said he respected the will of MPs, who opposed the measures out of principle, despite the “extremely disappointing” result.</p>

<p>However, he condemned the “childish and hypocritical actions of the SNP”, saying it had sought to deny shoppers in the rest of the UK the same freedoms enjoyed in Scotland and pointing out that a majority of English and Welsh MPs had voted in favour.</p>

<p>Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said it was Labour which had led the charge against the government’s plans to deregulate Sunday trading. </p>

<p>“We support the current arrangements, which work well and mean retailers can trade, customers can shop, and shopworkers can spend time with their families,” she said. </p>

<p>“I warned the government that unless they pulled their plans then they would face a public and humiliating defeat on the floor of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/houseofcommons">House of Commons</a>. That is exactly what we have delivered.</p>

<p>“The government must now listen to the settled will of the House of Commons and confirm that they will not attempt to bring back these plans, which were not in the Tory election manifesto, for a third time.”</p>

<p>The defeat was greeted with delight by John Hannett, the general secretary of the shopworkers’ union Usdaw.</p>

<p>“This is the third occasion in five years that Conservative ministers have attempted to permanently change Sunday trading regulations and the third time they have been unsuccessful,” he said. “We hope now the government will leave this great British compromise alone and focus on providing real support for the retail sector, not the unwanted and unnecessary bureaucracy that devolution would have resulted in.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>“The current Sunday trading rules are a fair compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years.”</p>

How long ago were you living in London ? Because in my neck of the wood we have one supermarket open 24 hours for 6 days a week and two open until 11pm Monday to Saturday and all 10 to 4 on Sunday!

Combined opposition can also win if the majority party's turnout is light. Not, however, entirely relevant.

idiot, I'm not saying that nobody works on sunday. but clearly not everyone does, and clearly some people don't want to be able to. and, moreover, clearly many people don't want anyone to be able to. this despite the fact that at the same time people in this country are bi**hing about migrants coming to take their jobs. read before you comment next time, jackass.

Sometimes I do. And sometimes I don't. When I have work to do that needs to get done before Monday, you bet I do. And I'm glad that regulations haven't prevented it. My girlfriend's office is mandatorily closed on Sundays and that just means that people either end up working later on Friday or coming in on Saturday (when they might otherwise have plans). Work doesn't just go away because it's 'god's day'.

Actually I was taking the point of view of people who work. Spending evenings and and the supposed rest day in shops because they close early is not an efficient use of free time. Yes, I online order but y'know what sometimes I run out of food or change my mind.

Wonder whether YOU would like to work EVERY Sunday? You are the selfish one insisting that serfs like me should work to satisfy people who cannot manage to find the time to shop on the other 6 days of the week.



Author::::Andrewp5818

Agreed. This extended Sunday trading law would be the thin end of the wedge and the next move would be Christmas Day opening (on a voluntary basis of course)

Rubbish. Its 2016 and retail consumption fuels the economy. Why shouldn't someone be able to shop on a Sunday if that's their preference. The idea of protecting precious "family time" is laughable.

This always used to infuriate me when living in London. Going to the supermarket before dinner (or supper for you posh twats) was always out of the question because of these stupid laws. Of course here in New Zealand we have the ridiculous situation where pretty much all shops are open 9 to 5.30 making it virtually impossible for anyone who works normal hours to do any shopping until a mad rush around on a Saturday. Not that I'm one for retail therapy but these "traditions" don't make any sense. With Easter coming up I'm stuck with 2 days I can't even by booze at the supermarket because people believe in a fairy tale from 2000+ years ago.

Well here in Germany the shops remain firmly closed on Sundays.Until recently shops actually closed at 2.00pm on Saturday.The only shops that open on sunday are bakers. Often even the pub's don't open on Sunday.Very occasionally here in Hamburg, the shops are allowed to open on sundays usually to coincide with some city attraction.The amazing thing that also happens is that all public transport is free for the day.Sunday in Deutschland is family tag. Spending time with the parents/kids. Not for the religious beliefs of get rich quick.

Saying the SNP acted immorally voting against the bill is far from claiming Labour was morally just in doing the same. They both acted hypocritically. And you call people stupid?
