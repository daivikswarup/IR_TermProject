<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/tesco">Tesco</a> has halved the pace of its sales decline in the past month as price cuts have helped stem the loss of customers elsewhere.</p>

<p>The UK’s biggest supermarket enjoyed its best performance since July, with sales down 0.8% in the 12 weeks to 28 February, compared with <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/uk-grocery-market-gets-a-boost-from-detox-january">a 1.6% decline revealed a month</a> earlier, according to analysts Kantar Worldpanel. </p>

<p>Separate figures from analysis firm Nielsen suggested Tesco was doing even better, with sales falling by just 0.5%, the chain’s best performance since November 2013.</p>

<p>Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retail and business insight, said: “Tesco has been improving the basics, including its pricing. This has encouraged more visits and attracted back shoppers who had previously defected. <br/>“Their new customer proposition highlights the benefits of having a large variety of store types – physical and online. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/supermarkets">Supermarkets</a> offering more locations, good private label and a superior customer experience – not just lower prices – tend to be more successful, and these are some of the areas where Tesco are focusing.”</p>

<p>The strong sales performance is good news for Dave Lewis, Tesco’s chief executive, who is under pressure to show results from his turnaround plan, which kicked off in autumn 2014.</p>

<p>The improvement in sales came alongside a general pickup in the grocery market in February. Sales for the sector rose 0.5%, the fastest pace of growth since October, as chocolate sales rose 13% in February – thanks to Valentine’s Day and early preparations for Easter. Sparkling wine sales also continued to soar – up 15% last month.</p>

<p>Tesco’s trade increase came at the expense of Asda and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/morrisons">Morrisons</a>, where the pace of sales declines increased. Asda’s sales fell by 4% in the three months to the end of February, the chain’s worst performance recorded by Kantar.</p>

<p>The struggling retailer has lost 0.8 percentage points of market share over the past year. It controls 16.2% of UK grocery sales, putting it behind Sainsbury’s, which is now the UK’s second biggest supermarket with 16.8% market share. Tesco’s market share is 28.4%.</p>

<p>Asda boss Andy Clarke has said <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/18/andy-clarke-asda-determined-not-shelve-five-year-plan">he is sticking to a plan of protecting profits and cutting prices</a>, despite 15 months of falling sales culminating in the company’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/18/asda-quarterly-loss-christmas">worst quarterly trading period</a>. But he is under increasing pressure to turnaround performance before the arrival this autumn of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/13/asda-poaches-top-sainsburys-director">his potential successor, Roger Burnley</a>, a former Sainsbury’s director.</p>

<p>Sainsbury’s was the only one of the big four chains to see growth over the three-month period. Its sales rose by 0.5%, its eighth consecutive period of growth.</p>

<p>Morrisons’ sales declined by 3.2%, compared with a 2.2% fall revealed by Kantar last month. The Bradford-based chain’s sales continue to be impacted by store closures and price cuts.</p>

<p>The changing face of the grocery market is clearly marked in the latest figures as the German discounters Aldi and <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/lidl">Lidl</a> continue to grow rapidly. Lidl’s sales rose 18.9%; Aldi’s sales rose 15.1%, taking their combined market share to 10%.</p>

<p>The Co-operative Group also continued its strong period of growth, with sales up 1.9%, as it benefits from the trend towards shopping little and often, as well as improvements to its stores, pricing and product range.</p>

I dunno.I'm not a regular Lidl shopper - but I can see the appeal. Definitely cheaper and produce is actually pretty good quality. It's that last bit I love - fruit, veg and meat better than my local Sainsburys/Coop and noticeably cheaper.Whilst they look "no-frills" - staff actually seem competent and they manage to keep shelves stocked.I think where the big supermarkets went wrong was their continuous reduction in the quality of their 'premium ranges' - Waitrose and M&S aside, they're pretty much universally mediocre now. To take an example, there's half an aisle of bacon - all the cuts/brands/cures you could want - but every f'in one of them (Denhay aside) seems to produce that nitrate-water scum when you cook it. My shopping now is almost going back to the 'high-street-of-yore" model - half a dozen shops required each week to actually fill a kitchen with decent value (in a non-derogatory sense) food.

The Aldi/Lidl backlash can't be far away.

Just returned from Sainburys it would not be hard for Tesco to leap frog Sainburys on with lower prices

I believe their clothing is better than the food section, loving Aldi currently, not going back to tesco, still too expensive

People should be supporting their local shops if they are lucky enough to have them, not bland giants like Tesco.
