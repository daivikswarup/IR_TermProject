Mario Draghi rejects global recession fears and says refugee crisis is an opportunity




DateTime::::2016-01-22T09:33:04+0000



<p>Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, has said coping with the refugee crisis will be a boost for growth and brushed aside fears that the<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/world-stock-markets-bounce-back-nikkei-ecb-draghi"> turmoil in global markets</a> heralds the start of a recession.</p>

<p>Draghi said it was important that <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> worked together to turn the challenge of coping with refugees into an opportunity and said one knock-on impact would be higher public spending.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos-2016">Speaking in Davos</a>, the ECB president said 2016 had begun with “market gyrations” and “heightened sensitivity to risk” but said it was too early to say that the economic fundamentals had changed for the worse.</p>

<p>He added that the eurozone was continuing to recover at a modest pace due to the ECB stimulus, lower oil prices and an easing of austerity programmes. A fourth driver of growth, which had yet to have an effect, would be “the increase in government expenditure that will be necessary to cope with the refugees”.</p>

<p>Draghi eased the jitters in financial markets on Thursday when he <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/ecb-interest-rate-hold-steadies-markets">signalled that the ECB would provide more stimulus in March</a> to raise the eurozone’s inflation level closer to its target of close to, but below, 2%.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2016/jan/22/davos-2016-imf-lagarde-draghi-kerry-live">Davos 2016: Refugee crisis will change Europe, says Draghi - live</a> </p>

<p>In <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/davos">Davos</a>, he again sought to reassure nervous investors. “We have plenty of instruments, especially the determination and the willingness of the [ECB] governing council to act and deploy these instruments.”</p>

<p>The annual World Economic Forum gathering has been marked by <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/22/french-pm-manuel-valls-says-refugee-crisis-is-destabilising-europe">warnings from European politicians</a> that the arrival of more than 1 million refugees last year, and the expectation of a similar number in 2016, is putting immense strain on the EU.</p>

<p>Draghi said: “Our society will be changed by this. In which direction, we can only guess. It is also premature to know how long it will take to transform this challenge into an opportunity.”</p>

<p>The ECB president said Europe needed to show determination, confidence and a willingness to cooperate, “because the size of the challenge could actually undermine the confidence and make fear prevail over any other consideration. And the challenge is lost.”</p>

I will take that as a yes, a global recession and probably worse are now inevitable in 2016. These types of people attempt to calm the markets so that they have time to move their assets around before everything goes bad. Stocks and real estate are a bad bad investment right now. Cash is king.

Draghi will lose his smile when all those Europeans start asking what happened to our savings and pensions. Oops your savings and pensions are just private bank IOUs that can never be honoured because banks accepted IOUs that will never be repaid!

It means mass uncontrolled immigration is happening whether we like it or not. If the system starts too collapse (or the actual plan may be) that they want us too blame immigrants instead of them & the banksters, either way they'll get our wealth, It's a win win for the elites, as we are too wrapped up in greed and misinformation to see.

That's because you're a moron, we've been killing children & their families in the Middle East for too long now. We continue funding 'rebels'(I$I$) to do our dirty work, further destabilising, as we stamp on our own working class. Why do we deserve peace? we've sat back and allow these corporate politicians to Murder millions of innocent people, the poorest people in the Middle East all in the name of oil. If you think we're are the good guys & Muslims are the enemy, then I'm lost for words.

Draghi says he doesn't know what the future will bring to Europe but we must trust it will be good and let things happen and we will see. He might know better next time he swings a chicken.

"A fourth driver of growth, which had yet to have an effect, would be “the increase in government expenditure that will be necessary to cope with the refugees”.So why not just give me £20 Billion if that's how economics work? I promise I'll spend every last penny if it means helping my Country :-) £25 Billion next year please - it'll be tough but Draghi says it will help, who am I to argue...

Refugee crisis is an opportunity. Yes, an opportunity to destabilize Europe according to French PM. Most people may love this opportunity get rid of the "EU Project" altogether as it has only helped feather the nests of certain political class. Ordinary citizens feel the loss of their country's sovereignty.
