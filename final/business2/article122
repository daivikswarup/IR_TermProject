If we get smarter, we won’t need so much power. Tell that to British Gas

<p>The competition watchdog will on Thursday announce remedies aimed at addressing the dominance and excessive profits of the big six energy suppliers in the UK retail market. But the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority">Competition and Markets Authority</a> is set to yield to lobbying by the big six and drop plans for a safeguard price cap and, probably, lift a ban on multiple confusing tariffs. It has already turned its back on demands to break up these large utilities.</p>

<p>While it’s true that the big six have severely distorted the retail market, their biggest crime will not be mentioned anywhere: that they have been acting as a massive brake on work towards modernising and decarbonising Britain’s power sector.</p>

<p>In Germany, politicians have seized the initiative on behalf of their citizens by introducing the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://energytransition.de/wp-content/themes/boell/pdf/en/German-Energy-Transition_en.pdf"><em>Energiewende</em></a> – energy change – to fast-track the country into a low-carbon era. They ignored the critical screams from their (and our) utility companies, including RWE and E.ON.</p>

<p>In Britain these utilities have for decades used their financial and political muscle to keep their vested interests and fossil fuel assets in place.</p>

<p>The CMA should have gone ahead with breaking up Centrica, SSE and the rest – not because it would have had a dramatic impact on immediate prices, although it would have helped, but because it would undermine their power base.</p>

<p>And big six should really read big seven, because the National Grid, too, is stuck in the past and frightened of the future, just as the lights are in danger of going out because of a lack of new investment.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/national-grid-warns-on-electricity-management-handover">The grid is also compromised by the twin jobs</a> it has been allowed to carry on doing: balancing power demand and supply; and running an energy transmission business.</p>

<p>All of this is an extra problem at a time when an ideologically driven Conservative government has been <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/energy-policy-u-turns-may-cost-households-120-a-year">undermining investor confidence in wider energy sector </a>with a series of policy U-turns or <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/04/solar-thermal-panels-latest-to-be-hit-by-uk-subsidy-cuts">attacks on solar</a> and wind power.</p>

<p>Ministers seem to feel that the only thing that stands between us and blackouts is desperate bungs of cash to the big six to keep their gas or coal-fired power stations running a bit longer.</p>

<p>The only new power stations energy secretary Amber Rudd seems determined to pursue are nuclear, but even the first proposed one – at Hinkley Point in Somerset – is much delayed and dependent on a yet-to-be agreed French financing package for EDF.</p>

<p>But amid all that gloom there came a glimmer of hope at the end of last week, courtesy of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-smart-power-revolution-could-save-consumers-8-billion-a-year-adonis">National Infrastructure Commission in a report</a> for the Treasury.</p>

<p>The report, entitled “Smart Power”, says what this newspaper, many energy experts and businesses without legacy fossil fuel interests have long been saying: you do not need to build that much new power capacity if you put more emphasis on reducing demand.</p>

<p>Lord Adonis, the former Labour peer who heads the commission, says managing demand, combined with improved energy storage and the use of interconnectors to hook up supply from abroad, could save consumers up to £8bn a year by 2030. “We do not call for new subsidies or significant public spending,” he said, “but rather a level playing field through fairer regulation and a better-managed network, to allow these exciting new technologies to compete.”</p>

<p>Demand flexibility in Britain currently is below 1%, while in some parts of the US, thanks to smart metering, it is as high as 15%. Such plans will do nothing for British Gas and the rest, but they will do everything for British consumers. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/04/when-it-comes-to-a-shift-to-low-carbon-energy-key-players-need-a-history-lesson">Transformation can come quickly</a>. Let’s get on with it.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/brazil-police-raid-home-former-president-lula-petrobas">arrest of former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> could mark the beginning of the end of a political and financial crisis that has ensnared politicians and plunged the economy into recession.</p>

<p>Lula, who served for eight years until 2011, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/brazil-police-raid-home-former-president-lula-petrobas">is accused along with many others</a> of siphoning cash from the government-owned oil firm Petrobras and spending some of that money on bribes and electoral campaigning.</p>

<p>One line of inquiry in Lula’s case concerns construction companies giving him preferential terms in the development of a ranch and a luxury beachfront apartment. The accusations may not be true – Lula certainly denies them – but the point is that the allegations will be aired and investigated, with the possibility he could go to jail.</p>

<p>This, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/26/senior-brazilian-senator-and-billionaire-ceo-arrested-for-corruption">together with the recent arrest of a billionaire Brazilian banker</a>, is enough to tell the world that the rule of law operates in Brazil and wrongdoers will be apprehended. Markets in Brazil reacted strongly to the news of Lula’s arrest, and the Brazilian real surged. São Paulo’s main stock exchange index rose more than 4% last Friday.</p>

<p>Among Bric countries, China and India are also making a show of rooting out corruption. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/01/nearly-a-million-scammed-in-chinese-online-ponzi-scheme">Beijing has made countless arrests</a> as it tries to tackle construction scams and pyramid selling in the financial sector. But the suspicion must be that the politburo works on favours, as it ever did. Narendra Modi’s India, while growing quickly, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/06/india-corruption-bribery-zero-rupee-note">remains riddled with uninvestigated corruption scandals</a>. Russia? Enough said.</p>

<p>Investors looking at Mint countries – Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey – must also be wary. Mexico is trying to rid itself of corrupt practices, and Turkey’s sizable middle class is resisting the fear tactics of its president. But these countries could fall back on the old certainties.</p>

<p>Corruption is one barrier to investment that all these countries must tackle. In the short term Britain, considered a safe haven, benefits from this. But fears over corruption limit global economic development, which hurts us all.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Green sold BHS for £1 a year ago this week. That may turn out to be a great deal for the billionaire retail tycoon.</p>

<p>The new owners of BHS last week revealed their dramatic turnaround plan – demanding that landlords reduce the rent on half of its stores and cutting hundreds of jobs.</p>

<p>This is a make-or-break moment for BHS. The loss-making chain desperately needs to cut costs so it can fund a modernisation of its increasingly tired-looking shops.</p>

<p>But BHS has got off on the wrong foot by trying to pin the blame for store closures – which are inevitable – on landlords who refuse to reduce rents. BHS’s cause has now been further undermined by the news that, in March 2015, its owners took <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/04/owners-84-million-pound-loan-from-bhs-staff-job-losses">an £8.4m loan out of the business</a>.</p>

<p>If BHS is to survive and thrive, it needs all the funds and help it can get. Alienating its landlords en masse and borrowing large sums from the business are not the answer.</p>

In Germany solar generates most when its needed least (summer) and least when its needed most (winter). Hence all that coal is burnt to provide electricity when it isn't generating/its output is severely reduced at the coldest/darkest time if year.

You fail to note that "wild, speculative spend on transmission infrastructure is not permitted" Connections can only be made where generation has consent from the secretary of state, a connection agreement has been signed, and the appropriate fee paid.

I thought the article was rubblish - for the following reasons:So we have an anti-NG article, aimed at supporting the idiot Adonis (remind me about his track record in education & his support for the dark lord aka Blair). Had the writer had any professional contact with NG then clap trap such as " National Grid, too, is stuck in the past and frightened of the future" would not have been written. NG only balances supply & demand in a half hour time frame - that is what it has done since the T-vermins decided it was a good idea to privatise generation and network monopolies. If you operate a transmission network you HAVE to maintain network stability - and that means balancing supply and demand - operationally over some period of time. The cut-off between markets and operations is set at 30 mins - it could be 15 mins. The NIC is a bunch of place men with Adonis at its head. The report is a pile of shite & whilst trying to undermine NG (and fails to find my support for its break up) never gets to grips with the DNOs, DECC and Ofgem - the real villains of the piece.Adonis would not know a "better managed network" if it fell on him - he was seen by the T-vermins and the towel folder as a safe pair of hands & sure enough he has delivered. In the case of demand flexibility - the reason the Uk has done badly is purely down to DECC (run by that brainless tart Amber Dudd) and Ofgem - who have consistently failed to regulate the big six. Oddly, NG is doing something about demand response - but you would not think that from the article.Re-nationalise the networks.Tell NG & the DNOs that their rationale is:a reliable supply, support for the more effective use of electricity, support for more embedded generation & the socialisation of network costs to support that, abolition of Ofgem, bring back the Eleectiricty Council. There - done.

And it seems that the PV capacity figure I quoted may be out of date. In July 2015 it was forecast that the UK's solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity was set to exceed 10GW by March 2016. That is today. So 10GW of PV producing nothing.

Meanwhile in the real world it is late afternoon on a bright day if not sunny day in March, within sight of the vernal equinox, and electricity demand is 40GW. And the installed wind and PV power, with a combined capacity of 22GW, is producing less than 1GW. http://www.gridwatch.templar.co.uk/Absolute madness.

Germany could reduce their CO2 output further by closing a few coal fired power stations. They are net exporters of electricity to Switzerland, Netherlands, Austria and Luxembourg. Their electricity exports have now risen to 10% of their production. CO2 output in Germany fell to its lowest point in 2014 at 902 million tons equiv., down from 1248 million tons equiv. in 1990. Their target is 749 million tons equiv. in 2020 and 562 million tons equiv. in 2030.
