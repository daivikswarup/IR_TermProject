Dobson's switch at Schroders: corporate governance, anyone?




DateTime::::2016-03-03T19:30:21+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">W</span></span>ell played, Michael Dobson, that was a terrific 14-year innings as chief executive of fund manager <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/schroders">Schroders</a>, one of the few grand old City names to flourish in the modern world. A loss-making company in 2001 now makes profits of £600m. Take a bow, throw a party and enjoy your retirement.</p>

<p>Hold on, Dobson isn’t retiring at all. He is merely <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/schroders-corporate-governance-chief-executive-chairman-role">moving into the chairman’s office</a>, a switch that – as usual on these occasions – looks like a triumph of chumminess over common sense.</p>

<p>There are good reasons why the UK code on corporate governance – born as a reaction to ancient boardroom scandals like Polly Peck and Maxwell – states baldly that “a chief executive should not go on to be chairman of the same company”. One individual can end up with too much power and resist new thinking. Boardroom virtues of independence and openness can be lost. The new chief executive operates under a shadow.</p>

<p>Schroders says it seeks “stability and continuity”. Almost any company, after a good run, could make the same plea. They all think their boardrooms contain only strong personalities. It is rarely a persuasive argument.</p>

<p>The code, it should be noted, is not an absolute prohibition. Non-compliers are told to consult their major shareholders. But, in Schroders’ case, this is hardly onerous. The family controls 44% of the stock and Bruno Schroder, a board member since 1963, has given a thumbs-up, which will tend to dampen outside dissent.</p>

<p>If they really don’t like it, non-family shareholders can sell their shares. But there is wider principle here. Schroders, managing £313bn of other people’s money, is a firm we expect to read the riot act on governance to quoted companies. That job has just become harder.</p>

<p>Schroders says there are cases where, having assessed the merits, it has approved of a chief executive becoming chairman – for example at Wood Group in 2013. But it was in the oppose camp in 2014 at Experian, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/15/experian-under-fire-over-corporate-governance">the last time this issue blew up</a> at a FTSE 100 company.</p>

<p>The point remains. Dobson’s experience may be hard to replicate, but a firm of Schroders’ standing should be able to attract a top-notch chairman who is properly independent – and see the sense of doing so.</p>

<p>Little can be read into a single month’s sales figures, said Alison Brittain, chief executive of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/whitbread">Whitbread</a>, at the end of last year. Fair enough, a warm November seemed a reasonable explanation for why Costa Coffee’s like-for-like sales growth had slipped to 2.5%, the slowest quarterly increase for five years.</p>

<p>But here comes Costa’s latest reading, covering the next 11 weeks to mid-February – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/03/costa-whitbread-mild-weather-high-street-growth-weak">it’s even slower at 0.5%</a>. Brittain is sticking to her line about “lower footfall on the high street and an unusually warm winter” but this is starting to look like more like a trend rather than a blip. Maybe the UK is simply saturated with coffee shops.</p>

<p>This would not be surprising if the entrepreneurial classes have been reading Whitbread’s accounts. The last set showed a return on capital for Costa of 46.3%, a ratio so fat it invites independent operators to try their luck. The average hipster lacks Costa’s buying clout but the chance of a 20% return on capital, or even 10%, is worth a shot.</p>

<p>From Whitbread’s point of view, there is a fair argument that actual growth at Costa – as opposed to same-store increases – is more important. On that score, the rate is still 10.5%, so this is a long way from being a crisis. And, anyway, Premier Inn is far more important to Whitbread in profit terms.</p>

<p>But you can also understand why Whitbread’s share price has fallen from £54 a year ago to £38, down 6% on Thursday. Costa, having outrun all competitors with ease over the past decade, is suddenly looking tired.</p>

<p>Is Hinkley Point, the planned £18bn nuclear power station in Somerset to be built by French firm EDF, a runner or not? Here’s the latest dispatch from the Anglo-French summit:</p>

<p>“EDF is currently devoted to prepare [sic] all necessary elements for the announcement of a FID [final investment decision] for Hinkley Point C in the near future, with the full support of the French government.”</p>

<p>Top marks for ambiguity and obfuscation. In the mouth of EDF, “in the near future” could mean next year, which is what the latest stories of delays have suggested. Last October, remember, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed">the company said the contract was ready to sign within weeks</a>.</p>

<p>As to the actual decision, “France and the United Kingdom welcome the major progress made in recent months with a view to confirming the project.” A view to confirming? Call that a definite maybe.</p>

<p>It would be funny if our government hadn’t based its entire energy policy for the 2020s on Hinkley and neglected to draw up a back-up plan. The sooner the Hinkley farce is called off, the better.</p>

Yes it's fair to note that the combined code says:

If you had a choice of getting radiation poisoning from a nuclear power plant or getting paid in an office to write software for trading algorithms, which would you choose?

What is the use of a UK Code on corporate governance if it " is not an absolute prohibition. Non-compliers are told to consult their major shareholders. "?

Why can't Britain build its own power stations? Well We've sold all our expertise to the Japanese and the Americans and all our good engineers now work in the city.

According to Private Eye the amount of bribery, sorry guaranteed return, being offered to EDF to build Hinkley is mind boggling. As just one example the guaranteed price for supplying electricity is linked to inflation so as wholesale prices are dropping the guaranteed price to EDF is going up! This whole sorry farce should be abandoned as soon as possible.Why can the UK not build its own power stations? We have a proud history of engineering innovation which seems to be ignored by this government in favour of making things as cosy as possible for the city.
