UK watchdog accused of bowing to pressure from 'big six' energy suppliers

<p>The competition watchdog has been accused of bowing to pressure from the “big six” energy suppliers after proposing a watered-down series of remedies aimed at stopping UK consumers from being overcharged. </p>

<p>Opposition MPs, independent power companies and fuel poverty groups all warned <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-sets-out-energy-market-changes">the Competition and Markets Authority</a> review would do little to stop householders paying £1.7bn a year too much for their energy.</p>

<p>Ovo Energy, one of the new breed of suppliers, said the last 18 months of investigation by the CMA had been “a complete waste of time and taxpayers’ money”.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/10/cma-energy-report-q-and-a-licence-to-print-junkmail">CMA energy report: a licence to print junkmail?</a> </p>

<p>The competition watchdog has called for a price cap on tariffs covering the 4m households on prepaid meters and wants a customer database to be set up to make switching supplier more easy.</p>

<p>However, the CMA has not widened that safeguard cap to include those stuck on high-cost standard variable tariffs and wants to scrap a four-tariff limit established only recently by energy regulator Ofgem to make price comparisons easier.</p>

<p>Earlier speculation that the big six would be broken up to separate their supply from their power generation arms was shelved by the CMA as a proposal last summer amid endless lobbying by the companies. </p>

<p>Lisa Nandy, Labour’s energy and climate change spokeswoman, said the latest remedies represented a missed opportunity: “This investigation has confirmed that millions of families and businesses have been overcharged for their energy bills to the tune of billions of pounds yet energy companies are still being let off the hook.<br/></p>

<p>“This was a critical chance to shake up a broken energy market and make sure savings from falling wholesale prices are passed on to customers. Only more transparency and competition can deliver this.”</p>

<p>Steve Thomas, a professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, also believed the remedies would not prevent UK consumers being unnecessarily subjected to some of the highest energy bills in the European Union. </p>

<p>“The CMA report has failed to tackle what really concerns consumers: the UK is supplied by a cosy group of six companies who know very well without the need to collude that the last thing they need is the price war that real competition would lead to. The CMA measures will do little to change this.”</p>

<p>Laura Hill, for campaign group Fuel Poverty Action, said: “Today’s announcement is a testimony to the stranglehold of the big six over this investigation. Extensive lobbying has resulted in these pathetic watered-down recommendations which will have little impact on the majority of hard-pressed households who have spent the winter shivering in their home.”</p>

<p>But Roger Witcomb, head of the CMA investigation, said the “coherent and comprehensive package of reforms” would transform the energy sector.</p>

<p>He admitted the six largest suppliers had been taking existing domestic customers – some 70% of whom are on “default” standard variable tariffs – “for granted, not just over prices, but with their service and quality”.</p>

<p>But he added: “In those parts of the retail markets where competition is working, customers are benefiting to the tune of hundreds of pounds a year by switching. We’re proposing a wide range of bold, innovative measures to enable competition to grow further across the market so that millions more households will benefit.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-sets-out-energy-market-changes">The CMA inquiry</a>, launched in June 2014, was intended to clear up once and for all whether SSE, Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, British Gas-owner Centrica, RWE npower, E.ON and EDF Energy were abusing their dominance of the market.</p>

<p>However, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/04/energy-bills-cap-uk-households-competition-markets-authority-watchdog">the regulator has retreated</a> from more radical proposals amid ferocious lobbying from the energy sector.</p>

<p>Centrica shares rose slightly as the City realised the changes would not affect the supplier very much.</p>

<p>Iain Conn, the chief executive of Centrica, made clear he was happy: “We believe that, provided they [the CMA remedies] are implemented thoughtfully, the majority will benefit our customers. We will work through the full report once we have it and submit a formal response in line with the required timetable.”</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/eon">E.ON</a> described the report as a “major milestone” of the CMA’s investigation and said it would review the material before making a detailed response. “We have been open and fully supportive of the investigative work undertaken by the CMA and we will continue to provide all necessary and relevant information as we move towards the final report in June.”</p>

<p>The big six have always argued the market is highly competitive and the profits commensurate with the risks they take.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>The secretary for state for energy and climate change, Amber Rudd, said: “This is a wakeup call to the big six. Energy customers should get a fair deal from a market that works for them. That’s why we called for the biggest ever investigation into the energy market and won’t hesitate to take forward its recommendations.</p>

<p>“This report goes hand ­in ­glove with everything this government is doing to deliver a fair, competitive energy market that puts the families and businesses paying the bills first and the power back in their hands.” </p>

Cost plus raising capital for investment and a strong regulatory framework and a state owned supplier will suite me fine.

Yes, same argument, but heating is perhaps more important than a car.

This is perhaps the same argument as whether or not we should have a road tax (vehicle duty) on vehicles or whether the levy should rather be gathered through the fuel consumed.

over 600,000 people have sunk into absolute poverty under this government and food banks have proliferated .People have been randomly sanctioned ,benefits have been cut ,the bedroom tax has been introduced , the number of people on zero hours contracts has escalated radically ,public sector workers have had their pay frozen or inadequately increased for over five years (except for Liz Windsor , MPs and NHS bosses ) ..of course I reject what you are saying -it's rubbish.

True the costs of moving into new housing stock are higher than existing, but the electricity network has to be maintained, and renewed on a regular basis, the call centres need to be staffed, and someone has to pay for perhaps questionable things like smart metres.

I think it has legal status as a Stadtwerke, but it's because the cable for our village and a few others comes from Switzerland. It was a bit annoying, because the switching company knew nothing about this exception.

The costs of providing and reading your meter are much the same irrespective of whether you burn 100kWh/year, or 10,000. As are the costs of operating and maintain the grid to supply your house (mostly...)

You'd need a pretty remarkable level of concentration in the generation market to achieve that, though - 40% would be my gut feel. EDF's currently the biggest at <25%. A bit of a moot point.

Alternatively we could just have the one state-owned supplier with a charter obligation to sell at cost and full transparency about what that is.

To be fair a lot of houses back then didn't even have central heating, did they? We do live better today than back then, but that is because of general technological progress rather than free market capitalism. And to focus on absolute poverty rather than relative poverty ignores the increased control of the economy by the rich which the latter represents.

But a large proportion of the costs of supplying a household are fixed. Even if you used 100 KWh per year, no one would want to connect you for less than £200 per year.

Why must we behave like energy whores to achieve best value when all that is needed is fair pricing in the first place. Instead of telling me to try the next alley along just match the fairest price instead of profiteering.

Affordable energy is a good idea. Price capping is an obvious way to achieve it. What a shame people never voted for it when it was offered.

So you object to the notion that people that buy in bulk get a discount do you despite them being more valuable as customers to the supplier? Its pretty standard that people who buy more get better discounts. I don't see why energy pricing structures should be any different.

The findings from the report suggest the market needs more competition, not less. Even the Labour spokesperson is saying:

The unfettered capitalism that you refer too didn't occur in the energy markets until 2007. Between then and 2013 Energy company profits went up tenfold. In fact under Margaret Thatcher's government energy price rises were capped. It was the removal of these caps and the abolition of true competition that things went wrong. Privatisation isn't necessarily a bad thing, but a lack of proper competition and proper control by an independent regulator is a problem.

WE're already at the point where standard duration is 28 days, of which 14 is the cool-off; the industry is in the middle of the "faster switching" programme, which will bring the post-cool off time down to something like 5 days. The"customer own read" option for was blocked by the regulator until something like 2010, on the grounds of the volume of supplier-supplier disputes it causes.

"Finally, the author of the report contradicted himself on many points by even saying on the News that if you wanted cheaper capped prices then that you'd be talking Nationalisation ...and then in the same sentence goes on to say that Nationalisation would mean higher prices."

I switched today, I was on a fixed tariff that was a very good deal when I got it but isn't now and it had a £50 exit fee. Even with the exit fee I was better off switching, there was a fixed deal with exit fee which was the cheapest, a fixed deal without exit fee was second, a deal with my existing company came in about 5th but if they chose to waive the exit fee then I would only be a few quid worse off over a year and not need to change company and they'd keep me as a customer. So I phoned them and said will you charge me the exit fee if I switch to another tariff with you and then said yes we will charge you so I've switched companies, will pay the exit fee and still be better off, I went for the second cheapest 'fixed with no exit fee' since price are so volatile at the moment.What this shows is that energy companies, and this wasn't one of the big six, are so bureaucratic they'll cut off their nose to spite their face.

It didn't take long, it could be made easier. I am very sceptical about the need for so many tariffs that complicate the process.

DateTime::::2016-03-10T16:11:43Z
well it still takes a long time, I switched today and it was easier than last time (year ago) which was easier than the time before that but it's still going to be a month, agreed 14 day cooling off period doesn't help. A few switches ago the big 6 company I was leaving played silly beggers with the (last) meter reading to deliberately screw things up and the other big 6 company I went to was never able to sort it out properly despite me having an accurate self meter reading. I've been with smaller companies since and they seem to have fixed that problem by the new supplier asking for a separate reading rather than just the old company getting a meter reading

there will be an opt out procedure though they couldn't say exactly what and people who have switched in the not too distant past will be automatically opted out. The problem is that it gives suppliers carte blanche to try & con customers into believing they'll be cheaper when they won't necessarily.I think it would be better however to improve the info you company has to give you further (they have forced them to improve it) and to promote switching comparison sites more including making sure people without the internet at home can access them,dedicated terminals in libraries perhaps or at least instructions in all libraries with computers.

some of of them do display the unit price on the main page, Energylinx to name one, most/all have it if you click down a link or two.

You are wrong twice. Tenants can change suppliers but it needs the landlords consent. Power Companies do not charge twice as much for pre-paid power, its landlords who set the tariff on their tenants meters that results in such outrageous charges.

It takes about 15 minutes using one of the switching sites, if you have your latest bill to hand, which states your annual consumption. You'd have to be abnormal not to do it, which is apparently the case with millions of accounts.You can lead a horse to water.....
