<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">K</span></span>eynes’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/texts/keynes/gtcont.htm">General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</a> is to economics what Joyce’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2012/06/james-joyces-ulysses">Ulysses</a> is to literature: a classic that lots more people start than finish. The same applies to two other seminal works from the dismal science: Adam Smith’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN.html">Wealth of Nations</a> and Karl Marx’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Capital-Volume-I.pdf">Capital</a>.</p>

<p>It is a fair bet, though, that a good chunk of the Keynes devotees at last week’s British Academy celebration of the 80th anniversary of the publication of the General Theory in February 1936 had ploughed their way through Postulates of the Classical Economy to Notes on Mercantilism, while only occasionally thinking they would rather be reading <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/17/reading-group-tinker-tailor-le-carre">Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdixUVCB0Kw">event </a>pitched Lord Robert Skidelsky, author of the magnificent three-volume biography of Keynes, in a debate with Sir Nicholas Macpherson, shortly to retire as permanent secretary to the Treasury. Its title, From Keynes to Corbynomics: the General Theory at 80 was a bit of a misnomer because Skidelsky didn’t dwell on the Labour leader’s economic ideas and Macpherson said that, as a civil servant, it wasn’t proper to do so. Instead, the pair took up two themes: whether Keynes and his ideas had made a comeback following the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09, and what Keynes would have made of the handling of the economy by the Treasury since the crash.</p>

<p>Skidelsky said there had been no lasting return to Keynesian ideas since the market meltdown, paradoxically because a brief burst of Keynes prevented a <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/17/remember-great-depression-no-doesnt-seem-anyone-does">1930s-style collapse</a> that might have led to a more fundamental re-think of the status quo.</p>

<p>This seems an accurate assessment. The initial response to the crisis followed Keynes’s ideas pretty much to the letter, with an assumption that action should be taken to prevent what was clearly going to be a painful recession turning into a full-blown depression.</p>

<p>Central banks were the first to act. They sought to make money cheaper and more plentiful through <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/06/interestrates-interestrates2">deep cuts in interest rates </a>and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm">quantitative easing.</a> Keynes was primarily a monetary economist who believed that governments should only turn to fiscal policy - raising public spending and cutting taxes - when all other options had been exhausted. Fiscal policy was deployed in 2008-09, but only as a supplement to monetary policy.</p>

<p>Up to a point, the strategy worked. There was no second Great Depression and within six to nine months output had steadied across most of the global economy. Attempts were then made to return to business as usual as quickly as possible. That meant reducing the budget deficits that had ballooned during the recession and making only cosmetic changes to the debt-driven economic model that had been found wanting from 2007-09.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7745340.stm">Fiscal policy was relaxed by Alistair Darling</a> during the depths of the crisis, but the Treasury was already returning to a more orthodox approach to the management of the public finances even before Labour left office in 2010. George Osborne then adopted the sort of approach that would have been followed in the early 1930s: using low interest rates and QE to boost growth while at the same time cutting spending and raising taxes in order to rein in the budget deficit.</p>

<p>Macpherson said the mix of loose monetary policy and tight fiscal policy had been right, and mounted a robust defence of the Treasury’s reluctance to run deliberately higher deficits in an attempt to boost growth. The nine arguments presented included a lack of “shovel-ready” projects for the government to finance, the fear that any increase in demand would benefit foreign importers rather than UK firms, and the likelihood that individuals and businesses would anticipate that spending increases now would necessitate tax increases or spending cuts later, and reduce consumer spending and investment as a result. One questioner asked whether Macpherson was right to say that Keynes would have approved of the government’s economic strategy since 2008. “Of course not”, Skidelsky snorted.</p>

<p>So what would Keynes say if he were still alive today and updating the General Theory? Firstly, that one of the book’s main themes - the difference between risk and uncertainty - has been borne out by the financial crisis. Keynes argued that risk could be quantified but uncertainty could not, which made all the algorithms that sought to measure the riskiness of complex financial instruments useless in a market gripped by panic.</p>

<p>The second lesson he would draw would be of the need to rethink the way economics is taught, with a much reduced emphasis on mathematical models and the restoration to the curriculum of economic history.</p>

<p>His third conclusion would be that the global financial system has been made more vulnerable by the stripping away of controls that hindered the free movement of capital. Supporters of capital liberalisation argue that it makes financial markets more efficient, but Keynes said efficient markets were not necessarily effective markets and drew a distinction between capital used for productive purposes and capital used for speculation. The story of the years leading up to the crisis (and the years since, for that matter) is that there was too much of the latter and not enough of the former.</p>

<p>The fourth lesson would be contained in a special chapter in the 2016 edition of the General Theory devoted to the eurozone. Keynes would have been at his most acerbic in detailing the manifold failings of monetary union, from its <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.voxeu.org/article/design-failures-eurozone">flawed design </a>to the succession of avoidable blunders made by the European Central Bank and European finance ministers since 2007.</p>

<p>Seeking an explanation for why the eurozone has performed so poorly in the past eight years, Keynes would say the answer is simple: the ECB was not only slow to cut interest rates <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/07/ebc-raise-interest-rates-debt-crisis">but raised them twice in 2011</a>; it took more than half a decade longer than the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England to get round to QE; and, most damagingly of all, European policymakers insisted on austerity programmes that resulted in still weaker growth and even higher levels of unemployment. Fiscal policy becomes even more important in a monetary union, because individual countries give up the right to set their own interest rates and to devalue (or revalue) their currencies.</p>

<p>In the fifth and final lesson, Keynes would seek to explain why the recovery from the crash had, so far at least, been tentative and incomplete. His argument would have been that cutting interest rates to zero and boosting the money supply through QE were enough to halt the downward spiral in 2009 but not sufficient to bring about a lasting recovery.</p>

<p>Keynes would say the way to achieve this would be through a global growth pact, including more aggressive use of fiscal policy. His detractors would say what’s needed is a dose of Joseph Schumpeter’s <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/creative-destruction">“creative destruction”</a> so that new, dynamic enterprises can replace old, inefficient ones. In truth, policy is neither Keynesian nor Schumpeterian, which is why we are where we are.<br/></p>

His theories still apply...much better than some of the more extreme monetarist theories. It is a bit like saying, Einstein's theory of Relativity was written over 100 years ago and so doesn't apply now because things have moved on. I always have smiled at the monetarist economists who were so sure of themselves until the market collapsed in 2007/8 and then cried out for a Keynesian solution to the problem.

I am sorry but the government is not stimulating the economy because if the way it is managing the deficit. Most significantly it is funding speculation not investment (see above, Keynes 3).The government itself withdrew funding from key areas: from Forgemasters to wind turbines. It has chosen not to protect British industry, from the steel mills to the railway engines, spurning special EU funding. It has cut public investment, and it has deliberately fuelled housing speculation, which feeds land prices: handing unearned profit to landowners who do not invest in production. Finally his economy is based on the "walk- out of the makers" not the march. His increased reliance on the financial services is key. Half the shares on the London Stock Exchange are owned abroad, with no commitment to reinvestment here. They are traded on average every three months: not on decisions to invest in developing production, but on tiny movements in prices detected by algorithms. It is a gambling den, not a market-place for ideas. And the gambling boss sits in No11.

Yes, well, that depends on where we are in the business cycle, doesn't it? During downturns many people turn to the safety of cash, at precisely the time that you need people to spend it. But those without a substantial buffer (the poor) will spend cash almost as soon as they have it. The wealthy won't. Ever read the writings of...oh, shit, what's that guy's name again? Keynes, was it?

How does UK manufacturing get off it's knees? It can only do this by responding to an increase in demand. Massive scale housebuilding would hugely increase demand on the ground for glass, bricks, cement, tiles etc, etc. Sure, some of this will be ordered from abroad but by no means all. It's chicken and egg. That's why your position is defeatist and just plain wrong.

A poor try at a put down comment and way, way off the mark. We do not have negative rates. VAT, the largest of the indirect taxes, has actually been increased. not decreased. Companies could be asked to submit investment plans and followed up year by year with breaks only coming after the investment has been made. The current tax breaks for companies are far from massive and ineffective to promote investment. What government will spend on HS2 is peanuts compared to what it needs to spend to make up for the decades of lack of investment. This is the time to do it because money is cheap.

Public debt as a share of GDP has fallen in normal times under both left and right. The times it rose in modern times are: WW2, 1973 oil crisis (slightly), ERM crisis, and 2008 recession. All which necessitated fiscal stimulus.

andy, there is no doubt that the combination of QE, low interest rates and fiscal stimulus was recovering the economy in early 2010 from the depth of recession - exactly as any Keynesian would have predicted.There is also no doubt that Osborne's premature austerity cuts in capital spend and increase in VAT stifled that nascent recovery until even he could see, by 2012, that continuing austerity would lead to disaster.And so in 2012 he relaxed his policies, and surprise surprise, economic growth began to reemerge as the 'automatic stabilizers' kicked in.Whatever the detail of the deficit that Osborne inherited, his austerity measures in 2010-2012 were a mistake, completely the wrong policy, flatlining the economy and losing huge values of production, imposing hardship on millions, damaging the future productivity of the economy through his short-sighted capital expenditure cuts, and delaying recovery by at least two years.A litany of incompetence that should have seen him removed from office.

andy, your comment is correct insofar as to establish any form of fiscal surplus when the economy is growing and public expenditure is expanding, tax revenues must increase.Some of that increase will come about from 'natural' growth in the tax base as employment expands and incomes rise, but whether that is enough to cover government expenditure is unlikely. The only alternative is to raise tax rates, reduce tax allowances, cut back on tax-breaks, intensify taxation in the highly profitable areas such as the City, e.g a Tobin tax.And no government is willing to do this - indeed the neo-liberal belief is exactly the reverse, i.e. cut taxes on the rich in order to stimulate enterprise that will benefit all.

Actually there's a great deal that shows that Keynesian policy is what saved the UK economy - Osborne's moves to stimuli such as help to buy. He didn't advertise it as such but that was when the GDP slump started to reverse. Similarly in the Netherlands at around the same time they began to introduce austerity and saw their GDP fall. Depends on what papers you read, really.
