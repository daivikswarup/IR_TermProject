Barclays chairman complains about 'disproportionate' fines




DateTime::::2016-03-01T11:42:05+0000



<p>The chairman of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay">Barclays</a> has hit out against the £20bn in fines and taxes imposed on the bank in recent years as it chopped its dividend and announced it was scaling back in Africa to focus on the UK and US.</p>

<p>As Barclays reported an 8% fall in profits to £2.1bn in 2015, John McFarlane warned about the “societal costs” of multibilllion pound taxes and finesand complained that last year’s £1.5bn fine for foreign exchange rigging <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/banks-hit-by-record-57bn-fine-for-rigging-forex-markets">was one of the highest imposed, even though Barclays’ offences were the same as rivals</a>. </p>

<p>“A £50m fine or penalty is the equivalent of employing 1,000 fewer employees, closing 100 small regional branches, or forgoing the capacity to lend over £500m to small businesses or consumers,” McFarlane wrote in the bank’s annual report. “The charges are not proportionate to our smaller size and ability to pay relative to many of our peers.”</p>

<p>The bank is to cut its dividend payout to shareholders by more than 50% for the coming two years. However it has cut its bonus pool by only 10% to £1.6bn and paid 323 staff more than £1m. The highest paid director, whose identity is not revealed, received £9.5m.</p>

<p>Its shares ended 8% lower at 158p on Tuesday – and at one point were suspended because of the volatility in trading – after the bank reneged on a promise made by McFarlane only in June to pay a higher dividend every year. </p>

<p>The bank’s new chief executive, Jes Staley – who only took<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/28/barclays-appoints-jes-staley-new-chief-executive"> the helm in December</a> – instead stunned the City by announcing the full-year dividend for 2015 of 6.5p would be cut to 3p in each of 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/mar/01/new-look-barclays-the-same-but-worse">New-look Barclays: the same, but worse</a> </p>

<p>“Note to the board: don’t cut the dividend (again) without ample signalling beforehand,” said Sandy Chen, analyst at brokers Cenkos.</p>

<p>Since July, when <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/barclays-john-mcfarlane-board-double-share-price-three-years">McFarlane promised he would double the share price in three years</a>, the shares have fallen from 260p and Staley, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/05/barclays-boss-jes-staley-spends-6m-bank-shares">who bought shares at 233p</a>, said there would be “tremendous upside” in the shares once all the conduct issues were dealt with.</p>

<p>Making his first presentation since being hired to<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins"> replace Antony Jenkins, who was ousted in July</a>, Staley said addressing these conduct issues were his priority as he ended Barclays global ambitions to become instead a “transatlantic” bank.<br/></p>

<p>The bank published a list of of regulatory and legal matters it faced after taking more than £4bn of provisions for 2015, including a £1.5bn increase to cover the cost of more payment protection insurance mis-selling claims. New issues which could result in substantial charges include:</p>

<p>An American who spent much of his career at US bank JP Morgan, Staley quashed concerns Barclays would need to bolster its financial strength through a cash call, saying there was “no need for a rights issue”.</p>

<p>Attacking pay practices in the industry in the past, Staley, who was paid more than £250,000 for one month’s work, said: “It is fair to question whether bankers lost their moral compass during the 90s and first decade of this century, because of the single minded pursuit of personal wealth.</p>

<p>“A company that retains the loyalty of its employees solely based on compensation is a company that gambles with its institutional culture. </p>

<p>“I want Barclays to be a bank where our employees choose to work here because they believe in the institution, and its intrinsically valuable role in society.” </p>

<p>Jenkins received £3.4m for his six months at the helm but will continue to be paid until July this year. He also received £106,000 in legal costs and could receive up to 1.9m shares – worth £3m at current share prices – in the coming years.</p>

<p>Staley expects the number of jobs at Barclays – which stands at 130,000 – to fall by at least 44,000 as he pulls back from Africa. Barclays expanded into South Africa in 2005 <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/may/10/southafrica.money">when it bought a 60% stake in local bank Absa</a>. He said the headcount had fallen by 5,700 as a result of a hiring freeze he put in place in December.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>Staley is preparing for the UK ringfencing rules being introduced in 2019 which require banks to separate their high street and investment banking businesses by creating two divisions. </p>

<p>Barclays UK will be the ringfenced high street operation, while Barclays Corporate and International will house the once powerful investment banking division. <br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>He defended the model of having both investment banking and high street banking and quashed speculation that the investment bank, once of the powerhouse of the business, might be spun off. </p>

<p>“There is no doubt that having a balance between a consumer bank and wholesale bank and has been the safest place to be through virtually any financial crisis. We will have another financial shock – it’s inevitable.” </p>

<p>Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, described the results as “dismal” and noted the bank was ditching targets previously set to measure returns to shareholders. </p>

Let no one ever forget Barclays was the principle bank of the gold mines & Apartheid government in South Africa.For this alone it should have been closed down years ago. Having now been found guilty of what most fair minded people would call fraud it has the gall to complain.As Grahame Green once wrote " the corrupt always have hope they never reach the freezing point of total despair"

No they're not...the US is not prosecuting for most offences....check out HSBC's Deferred Prosecution Agreement in 2012...the bank laundered millions for drug cartels et al....knowingly...The Monitor's report detailing whether HSBC complied with the terms of the agreement, is so damning, that it remains "under seal"... It has taken the courageous endeavours of an HSBC customer to change the judges mind...except he has given the bank over one month to redact the report before its release...no doubt the report will be unreadable by the time we see it.......

The price that the shareholders must pay for the bank executives/officers/employees not having to be charged, arrested and prosecuted for fraud, embezzlement, and money-laundering. Amazing how consistently money influences law enforcement and the judiciary.

Without proper personal accountability for individual bankers it's entirely unrealistic to expect a lenient fine for the bank. It's also a sad reflection on their general level of morality that they consider the fine as disproportionate by measuring it against the fines imposed on other banks. It should be measured against the financial harm caused and the need to incentivise banks in general to deal honestly in future. From this last angle it's tempting to suggest that the fine was not nearly big enough.

What did man do in the days before there were banks?Barclays sadly relies & invests more in technology rather than human power.If you for instance pay your Barclay Card in advance of the Direct Debit, technology will still present the Direct Debit and duplicate payment. Conversely compared to a human being who would immediately not represent for payment.

By 'free money' you mean the stolen promissory notes of the working population...banks do nothing more than launder peoples promissory notes, republish them as money, falsify the debt to themselves and charge compounding interest for the privilege.

Are the fines in proportion with the salaries of the chief executive :) .. what is proportional for a chief executive .. what belongs to the bank .. what belongs to the shareholders .. what belongs to the ones who administer.. what belongs to society.. If the Bank can give away loads of money to those who make the mistakes shouldn't it have the cash to do the same for to compensate the society these administrators have wronged.. after all they were "chosen" by the Bank .. they are the "best" .. they competed for these bright sparks in the "open market" and "pay them the going rate"! Banks can't pay enough to those who did wrong.. Fines may be the way to stop daylight robery by the administrators and stop them helping themselves..

Perhaps the board of directors should get the same prison term that Hayes got for his part in the Libor rigging. Barclays have been able to pay the fines effortlessly, which shows even 20bn was too low compared to how it profited.

Companies don't commit crimes, people do. As such fines should be directed at all those responsible for instigating illegal policies.

Are you kidding? Bonuses aren't suffering. The more dubious dealing they do, the more they improve profits, so the bigger the bonus. Barclays have done so much dubious dealing that even the small percentage which can be proven and the relatively cautious fines being imposed represent a substantial hit. So who pays? The shareholders and customers. Not the people who did the dastardly deed. They go on earning. It is right that Barclays should be fined. They benefitted from the cheating, now they should pay up. Stop whingeing!! The size of total fines is a measure of the extent to which they did unacceptable deeds - not forgetting that it's only the small poercentage which can readily be proved! But the cheaters should pay. Or face jail. Man up, Barclays. You boasted while other banks struggled, all the while covering up the nasaty ways you adopted at the time. Now be man enough to accept what you had coming to you.

How about regulating directors' contracts - via the EU, of course. Two birds with one stone - a limit to how much these people can take from their shareholders and customers, and a much needed PR coup of the EU. No doubt competition law would be a stumbling block, but that too could be changed.

Barclays can fire back by putting the money they created in the cash flow account before the deposit creation and - presto ! - they can pay all the fines they are asked for. Criminal charges are just an optional, outside of Iceland...

Its only because HSBC is more linked with the markets outside the UK and it sort of has the upper hand in twisting the governments hand... Too often it has threatened to move and the ploy has worked. They will do it again as they have nothing much to lose here and will get their way.

It must be extremely difficult to run a profitable business when you are having to stump up large fines for the fraud and other bad practices that are being uncovered with depressing regularity. And that bloodless chump Osborne wants people to stop bashing these crooks, I am staggered that they are still at large as the general public would happily see many of them banged up for a long stretch.

When you say very bad time don't you mean global crash, and the only reason the rules were changed is because of the crash. I'm sorry but you are just going round in circles now, why don't you just accept that the financial sector simply got too big.
