China's exchange rate trap




DateTime::::2016-02-09T15:26:10+0000



<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">C</span></span>hina’s exchange rate policy has been roiling global financial markets for months. More precisely, confusion about that policy has been roiling the markets. Chinese officials have done a poor job communicating their intentions, encouraging the belief that they do not know what they are doing.</p>

<p>But criticising Chinese policy is easier than offering constructive advice. The fact is that the government no longer has any good options. No question, the country would be better off with a more flexible exchange rate that eliminated one-way bets for speculators and acted as an economic shock absorber. But the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=2695.0">literature on “exit strategies”</a> – on how to replace a currency peg with a more flexible exchange rate – makes clear that the moment when China could have navigated this transition smoothly has now passed.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/08/whats-holding-back-world-economy-joseph-e-stiglitz">What's holding back the world economy?</a> </p>

<p>Countries can exit a pegged rate smoothly only when there is confidence in the economy, encouraging the belief that the more flexible exchange rate can appreciate as well as weaken. This may have been true of China once; it is no longer true today.<br/></p>

<p>This puts Chinese policymakers in the position of the Irish tourist who asks for directions to Dublin and is told: “Well, sir, if I were you, I wouldn’t start from here.”</p>

<p>What, then, is China’s least bad option? The authorities could continue with their current strategy of pegging the renminbi to a basket of foreign currencies, and push ahead with their agenda of restructuring and rebalancing the economy. But convincing skeptical observers that they are committed to this strategy will take time, given recent missteps. Meanwhile, investors will bet against them.</p>

<p>They already are. Capital outflows have been running at $100bn (£69bn) a month. Simple arithmetic suggests that with $3tn of reserves, the authorities can hold out for at least a couple of years. But capital flight tends to rise dramatically as the end draws near. A two-year window is an illusion.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the renminbi could be allowed to fluctuate more freely. The People’s Bank of China could permit it to depreciate against the reference basket by, say, 1% a month, in order to enhance the competitiveness of Chinese exports and address concerns that the currency is overvalued.</p>

<p>But, given weak global demand, this kind of modest depreciation won’t do much to boost exports and support economic growth. Moreover, with the renminbi losing 1% of its value each month, capital flight would accelerate further.</p>

<p>A third option is a one-time devaluation of, say, 25%. This would enhance export competitiveness at a stroke. Depreciate the currency to the point where it is significantly undervalued, the argument goes, and investors will expect it to recover. Capital will then flow in, not out.</p>

<p> <span>Related: </span><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/13/perils-of-china-currency-devaluation-yuan-renminbi">The perils of China's currency devaluation</a> </p>

<p>This assumes, of course, that everyone buys into the idea that one devaluation doesn’t augur another. It assumes that investors would be unperturbed by the authorities’ abandonment of their prior vow to shun a mega-devaluation. It ignores the fact that Chinese enterprises, already in dire straits, have as much as $1tn of foreign currency debt that would become significantly more difficult to service. And it minimises the devastating economic impact of a mega-devaluation on countries with which China competes.</p>

<p>By process of elimination, the only option that remains is tightening capital controls. Strict controls can prevent residents and foreigners from selling renminbi for foreign currency on onshore markets and transferring the proceeds abroad.</p>

<p>Protected by this financial Great Wall, the authorities could let the exchange rate fluctuate more freely and allow it to depreciate gradually without provoking capital flight. They would gain the time needed to implement confidence-building reforms. They could curtail the provision of liquidity to loss-making enterprises, forcing firms to eliminate excess capacity. They could restructure problematic debts. They could recapitalise banks that suffered inadvertent balance-sheets damage as a result of these reforms. They could repair their damaged credibility.</p>

<p>A few observers, like the Bank of Japan head, Haruhiko Kuroda, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-23/kuroda-advises-china-to-impose-capital-controls-to-defend-yuan">have suggested</a> that China might consider tightening controls. But most economists are reluctant to contemplate this option. Capital controls would undermine China’s efforts to internationalise the renminbi and would embarrass the International Monetary Fund, which recently added the currency to the basket of four major currencies underpinning its unit of account, the SDR.</p>

<p>The most powerful objection, though, is that reimposing controls would remove the pressure to reform. Freed of pressure from international capital markets, the Chinese authorities would defer to state-owned enterprises and local officials who prefer continued easy provision of liquidity and would rather see the banks simply roll over their loans.</p>

<p>This risk of backsliding is real. If it materialises, the time bought by capital controls would be squandered. The problem would then metastasize, at some point, from an exchange-rate crisis to a growth collapse. China’s best hope – and the world’s – is that the Chinese authorities understand that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.</p>

The experience of Malaysia in 1997 (Asian Financial Crisis) may be instructive. The Ringgit went from 2.50 to 4.40 to the USD and exchange controls were imposed. But many anticipated this and had moved money out of the country, capital flight just as China is experiencing now. The article mentions a 25% devaluation, I think 50% more likely.

China's market has been closed this week while Western markets fell out of bed. Monday morning should be interesting.

A case of ' window dressing ' and a perfect foil for skewed currency management ? This is what will happen when the Central Banks surrender their legitimate authority of open market operations to bureaucrats and the likes of commissars.

Looks like China has the most USD Reserves on the planet, as of July 2015 it was USD$3.65 trillion, three times more than Japan in second position and nearly thirty times more the the USA itself. The national debt of the US has just hit USD$19 trillion mark.

We in the West seem to enjoy worrying about China too much, being nervous about it economy "hardlanding" and caring about Chinese living in a country like a hell without money and "no freedom of movement" ... and yet if you are in China, you don't get that feel of depression or unhappiness at all. When I visited China a couple of moths ago, I saw a country and its people that were nothings like what we are worried about. Let's deal with our own problems first. Chinese know what they are doing and they know whether they are happy or not. Probably they are the happiest people while we in the West insist they are the ones to be rescued by us.

Well - that is assuming you believe Chinese numbers of 6.9%... most do not. The consensus is more like 3% .. that really is not that spectacular, although still not bad when compared to developed economies. Unfortunately, not nearly good enough for what China needs. The Chinese numbers have been extremely inflated for years.... all a façade.

So China cannot try the US/UK trick of keeping interest rates lower than inflation while also jacking up the economy with quantitative easing, because there's the problem of not having all your debts in your own currency, and being more export driven.So the only way out, if you refuse to devalue big time, is with import tariffs and export subsidies....Trade war coming.

It is nothing to do with the fact that they are Asian that nobody believes the Chinese government's plans and claims. Chinese people don't believe them....

Why don t they let the yuan float freely ? After all, the Chinese economy is still doing rather well compared to most other countries. And they have enough currency reserves to any short to medum term consequence of a free floating currency. Letting the markets set the "real" value of your currency should't be impossible for the world's second economy. This one measure would built investors confidence and show that China finally accepts (like evrybody) the fact that it can not beat the markets. But probabaly this still sounds unacceptable for the communist hacks in charge.

Is there any "trap" "mistake" "command economy" "high handed market interference" incompetent Chinese who don't know nothin' 'bout no capitalism story the Guardian will not, in its willful ignorance of China, print and humiliate itslef with its display of Westerners with no idea what they are talking about analyzing China?

It's not a government. It's a regime. I agree with you regarding the culture though. I thought it was very interesting that the lunar new year celebrations in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taiwan, San Francisco and others involved dragon dances, cuisine and shows (i.e. culture) while in China itself it was a nonstop parade of fireworks.

They should go back and do whatever they were doing before monetary fund geniuses talked them into doing whatever had to be done in order yuan to be added to that ridiculous basket of currencies that server very little purpose and is more of a decoration than utility.
