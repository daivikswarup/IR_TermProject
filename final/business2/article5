EDF chief executive warns France over Hinkley costs




DateTime::::2016-03-11T19:14:34+0000



<p>The boss of the French state-owned company behind the UK’s first new nuclear power station for 20 years has threatened to pull the plug on the £18bn project without further backing from François Hollande’s government.</p>

<p>Jean-Bernard Lévy, chief executive of EDF, said he needed more financial support from the Elysée Palace to proceed with construction of the plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset.</p>

<p>A letter sent to the company’s staff admits the “tense” financial situation at EDF and the potential danger to a scheme that is at the centre of British energy policy.<br tabindex="-1"/></p>

<p>“We are negotiating with the [French] state to obtain commitments allowing us to secure our financial position. It is clear that I will not engage in this EDF project as long as these conditions are not met,” said Lévy.</p>

<p>Pressure on the EDF bosss <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edfs-hinkley-point-dilemma-adds-to-project-woes">increased last week when his finance director resigned</a>, saying Hinkley needed to be postponed for at least three years while the company restructured its finances. French trade unions on its board, angry at planned job cuts in France, have also called for Hinkley to be shelved. Those concerns were echoed on Thursday by country’s top public auditor, which warned over the cost and complexity of the project. </p>

<p>Explaining why he was taking the usual step of addressing staff, Lévy said: “In recent weeks, our group is the subject of much debate, especially around the renewal of our nuclear fleet and the construction of two EPR [European pressurised reactors] in the UK at Hinkley Point C. </p>

<p>“You know, the financial situation is tense, and this issue deserves to be clarified. I receive your messages of encouragement, but I also hear some concerns. That is why I address myself directly to you.”</p>

<p>Despite the problems facing the group, Lévy underlined both his and the French government’s desire to make the Hinkley project successful. </p>

<p>“Hinkley Point C has the support of the French government and the British government, which places it at the heart of new nuclear energy policy. The UK needs to secure its supply of electricity and decarbonise its energy mix.”</p>

<p>Referring to the British government subsidy for the project, represented by a guaranteed electricity price of £92.50/MWh , he added: “I am convinced of the robustness of the guaranteed selling price, approved by Brussels.” </p>

<p>EDF’s share price has slumped and its debts have risen over recent years. It has also been hit by falling energy prices and demands from the French government that it took over ailing nuclear engineering group Areva.</p>

<p>Its difficulties have put enormous pressure on the British government, which has already promised generous financial subsidies for Hinkley, to be paid for by taxpayers. The subsidy agreements have drawn scorn from investment bankers in the City.</p>

<p><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edf-unions-call-for-hinkley-point-project-to-be-postponed">One analyst earlier this week described the Hinkley project as “insane” because of </a>the problems EDF and Areva had experienced at similar schemes at Flamanville in Normandy and Olkiluoto in Finland.</p>

<p>The Japanese prime minister at the time of the Fukushima nuclear accident has warned that <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower">nuclear power</a> is unsafe and too expensive to justify building new plants anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the disaster on Friday, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoto_Kan">Naoto Kan</a> said he was against the idea of Japanese manufacturers such as Hitachi and Toshiba building nuclear plants in the UK.<br/></p>

<p>“Nuclear power is not safe. In the worst case scenario up to 50 million people would have had to be evacuated. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/nuclearpower">Nuclear power</a> is not a suitable technology and renewable power is much better,” Kan told the Guardian.</p>

<p>He insisted he did not want to tell other countries such as Britain what to do but said he did not support the reactors being switched back on in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a>. Neither did he support the idea of Japanese companies working on new nuclear schemes.</p>

<p>While EDF is at the centre of the Hinkley scheme, Hitachi and Toshiba are behind similar initiatives being developed for new reactors at <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.horizonnuclearpower.com/_admin/wylfa">Wylfa</a> on Anglesey, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.horizonnuclearpower.com/_admin/oldbury">Oldbury</a> in south Gloucestershire, and Sellafield in <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.nugeneration.com/">Cumbria</a>.<br/></p>

<p>Kan said it did not make sense to construct new atomic plants because of the cost, especially in those countries where there were no long-term storage facilities for high-level radioactive waste. This includes Britain and Japan.<br/></p>

<p>“What I experienced as prime minister made me feel that it does not make sense to rely on nuclear. New generation plant designs are supposed to increase safety but all these do is increase the cost,” he added.</p>

<p>Tom Greatrex, chief executive of Britain’s atomic lobby group, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.niauk.org/">the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA)</a>, said he was comfortable that Hinkley and the other reactors being planned in Britain would be safe because they would go through the UK’s most rigorous regulatory scrutiny.</p>

<p>“The process of assessing the reactor design is done in a different way in the UK and that gives confidence that the reactor design [EDF’s European pressurised reactors] will be safe and that is what we need to see,” he said.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the Department of <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/energy">Energy</a> and Climate Change said the safety of British reactors would be paramount. “Any nuclear power station built in the UK will need to comply with our world-leading nuclear safety regulation.</p>

<p>“The British government is backing new nuclear. It is an important part of our plan to give hardworking families and businesses clean, affordable and secure energy that they can rely on now and in the future.”</p>

Well it seems no matter whether it going to be the most expensive power station ever built by a huge margin going by the cost of other power stations fairly new and new elsewhere. The cost for the electricity it produces (never mind the pollution) is going to cost double, are we also going to have to subsidise some of the costs as well? Here are the costs for other power stations recently built or being built. OFFSHORE WIND TURBINE SCROBY CANDS NORFOLK (2005) 60mw = £75 million = £1.25bn per GW.RUSSIAN 9.6GW NUCLEAR S. AFRICA (NEW) = $10bn = $1.04bn per GW.OLKILUOTO FINLAND NUCLEAR (NEW) 1600mw = £2bn = £2.5bn per GW.NEWPORT WALES GAS (NEW) 800mw = £400million = £500million per GW.

The majority of the material in spent nuclear fuel is a relatively stable form of uranium called uranium 238 (U-238). It has a half life of over four billion years, so it will be around for a long time. The next largest fraction of material is unspent uranium 235 (U-235) and plutonium fuel with half lives of 700 million years and 24 thousand years respectively. These materials are do not change substantially in character except on geological time scales. That is, they are not going away very quickly if we just wait.http://www.visionofearth.org/news/does-nuclear-waste-last-millions-of-years/

If it all goes tits-up, that's fine by me. Replace it with a solar farm instead, put solar panels/photovoltaic cells on all new-build housing, retro-fit existing housing where possible, and give us more locally-generated green energy.

Then the more fools them. It has never been cheaper for a government with a sound credit score to borrow. You can bet if other people are borrowing to finance this project then they will be paying interest rates way above what we could get and this is reflected in the strike price. I actually suspect the government is restricting borrowing so they can meet the Debt/GDP criteria when they take us into the Euro.

With each passing year the economics of renewables improve. You'd need to be seriously pessimistic on our ability to innovate and improve to think that over the lifespan of these power stations, the price of competitive energy sources won't fall drastically. There are much better ways to spend £18bn, and we can use gas/ coal for base load.

It's good to see to see that nuclear is such a good commercial prospect that this project can't go ahead without financial backing from three Governments. Whatever you may think about the rights and wrongs of using nuclear power let's not ever kid ourselves that it is commercially viable or indeed brings cheap energy. Phasing out greenhouse gas power generation is indeed what we should be doing, but let's have an honest debate about what the real whole life costs are for the options available.

The point is the energy does not require fuel so (in this sense) is free. Using it in pumped water schemes to store energy is merely a way of providing a continuous supply not subject to the natural variability of wind or solar input.

Britain should ask Germany about the "Energiewende" . Germany has the technology for renewables and winds similar to Britain. Of course, this would be a long term project but , anyhow, on a much safer basis than building nuclear plants under foreign control. The French EPR is still under construction both at Olkiluoto and Flamanville. So it hasn't even been tested under working conditions. How can British people delegate such crucial decisions to incompetent, lobby driven politicians ??

We should be seriously concerned about the government's direction of travel on nuclear. EDF's projects in Flammanville and Olkiluoto are out of control. Nobody actually knows when they'll be finished, or how much they'll end up costing. Second, we should not let China fund, build and operate our power plants, which is what they want to do. Its record for efficiency, safety and accountability in projects abroad is very poor. We mustn't be seduced by wads of cash.

EDF are very important to the French domestic market and if they are about to go bust then it's odds on they will get state aid to survive.
