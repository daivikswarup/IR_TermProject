Lloyds passes government break-even point for first time this year




DateTime::::2016-03-02T09:48:39+0000



<p>With the week’s market rally continuing, <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> has passed the break even price on the government’s stake for the first time this year, paving the way for further share sales by the chancellor.</p>

<p>In early trading the shares breached the 73.6p level, the average government purchase price, and hit 73.8p before slipping back to 73.38p, a 0.31p rise.</p>

<p>In October chancellor George Osborne unveiled plans to sell a £2bn stake in the bank to the public - billed as the biggest privatisation for 20 years - when the share price was nearly 78p.</p>

<p>But in January <strong><a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/george-osborne-postpones-sale-sell-off-last-publicly-owned-lloyds-bank-shares">he postponed the move </a></strong>after the stock market turbulence during the first weeks of the year, particularly in the banking sector where investors became concerned about the outlook for profits as well as the effect of negative interest rates on the sector’s balance sheets.</p>

<p>The government has been gradually cutting back its stake, from 43% to less than 10%, but Osborne is unlikely to revived the public offer until after the EU referendum in June.</p>

<p>But if the shares remain above the break-even level for a sustained period, he may well decide to edge down the stake by selling in the market or to institutions.</p>

<p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:<br/></p>

<p>The continued recovery in the banking sector has seen <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloyds-banking-group">Lloyds Banking Group</a> shares move back closer to its 73.6p level breakeven price, increasing the prospects that we could well see the government look to pare down its remaining stake in the bailed out bank.</p>

<p>Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said:<br/> <br/></p>

<p>Lloyds bank has reached the magic 73.6p, average government purchase price, for the first time this year. The slump in share price had caused George Osborne to postpone the proposed sale of their last tranche of Lloyds shares. If the share price stabilises above their breakeven level, this opens the door for the Chancellor to resume the share sale, which would be welcome news for both the Government and prospective investors.</p>

<p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has continued its revival, up 21.31 points to 6174.19. But it has come off its best levels after weaker than expected UK construction data.</p>

<p>Mining companies continue to benefit from recent Chinese measures to stimulate the economy, with <strong>Antofagasta</strong> adding 15.1p to 505.5p and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> 20.8p better at 761.2p.</p>

<p>Positive results have lifted <strong>Virgin Money</strong>, up 27.5p to 367.76p, but testing group <strong>Intertek</strong> has dropped 98p to £29.06 after final results saw a 3.5% rise in revenues to £2.1bn but a loss after a £577m impairment charge on past acquisitions.</p>

<p>Oil and gas services group <strong>Amec Foster Wheeler</strong> has jumped more than 6% to 414.8p after it announced the completion of a £1.7bn refinancing. Analysts at Haitong said the shares were being lifted by the news and strength in the crude price but added:</p>

<p>Full year results are due on March 10. We see a risk that that company may be forced to write down a significant portion of the goodwill associated with the Foster Wheeler acquisition at these results. We are a buyer of this stock so our message is use any weakness that may ensue from 2015 results to pick this stock up. </p>

Why are investors waiting for a public sale they should have got in early when the share price was in the mid 50pences two weeks ago. People really need to think for themselves

Not too sure why the government doesn't hang on to Lloyds now that it looks like it will start making a profit and paying dividends. Same story with the East Coast Mainline franchise - it showed that companies can be run by the public sector whilst being efficient and making a profit. The idea that the public sector is incompetent is a bit of a myth I think.

Are we not adjusting the breakeven point for dividends?

Shhhh. Don't you know the Corbynite agenda depends on the bankers having taken the British state to the cleaners.

And what has really changed with HBOS with Lloyds owning them? £125 if you switch to them today!

This tranche can be dumped quite easily. But remember Lloyds was viable it HBOS that sunk it.

Good news. I suspect Osborne might be able to make a profit on Labour's mess in the long run.
