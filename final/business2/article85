Britain’s pro-EU firms should put their mouths where their money is

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">I</span></span>n or out? It’s time to shake a few more ideas about. More than 200 business leaders have <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/22/brexit-eu-referendum-top-firms-sign-letter-times-pro-eu-shell-easyjet-bae-systems-supermarkets-sainsbury-morrisons-tesco" title="">signed a letter calling for Britain to remain in the EU</a>. Over the next few weeks David Cameron will regurgitate their views as he campaigns in favour of staying in by warning of the damaging effect leaving could have on the economy.</p>

<p>It was to be expected that the leaders of Britain’s biggest companies would want to maintain the status quo. They are, after all, already the biggest companies. Why would they put that at risk? They are already facing a slowdown in China, major technological changes, and a slide in global stock markets, let alone issues within their own markets and companies. Brexit is one thing they could do without.</p>

<p>In contrast, leaders of businesses that thrive on instability and uncertainty, such as hedge funds, have come out in favour of Brexit. These include the chief economist at Toscafund, who warned earlier this month that Britain would be a “better place” outside the EU, and Crispin Odey.</p>

<p>There are of course exceptions, based on the political views of an individual boss or particular EU regulations. Tim Martin of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/jdwetherspoon">JD Wetherspoon</a> appears to tick both boxes. Others on the “out” side include Snappy Snaps owner John Timpson, while JCB boss Lord Bamford has said at least we should not “fear” Brexit.</p>

<p>However, the battle lines are fairly clear. It would be a shame, therefore, if businesses did not try to contribute more to the debate over the next few months than simply allowing Cameron to act as if their letter was a welcome surprise. The fact that only a third of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/ftse">FTSE</a> 100 companies signed the letter is the more striking fact.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, few businesses have stepped up to the mark so far. <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/whitbread">Whitbread</a>, owner of Costa and Premier Inn, did not sign the letter but said in a separate statement that the impact on the company is likely to be “relatively minor”. But it added: “However, the uncertainty arising from a vote to exit and the subsequent potentially lengthy negotiations could negatively affect consumer confidence and the general economic outlook in the UK, which would be both unwelcome and potentially damaging to our business. On this basis, we believe that Whitbread’s best interests are served by remaining within the EU.”</p>

<p>The views of Britain’s businesses on Brexit are more enlightening when you prod them on what it could mean for their day-to-day operations. Both Unilever, which signed, and ARM, which didn’t, say that if Britain voted to leave the EU it probably would not affect operations because there are many other reasons to invest in the UK, and both firms have been based here a long time. Akio Toyoda, boss of carmaker Toyota, made similar remarks.</p>

<p>It is also telling that HSBC has decided to keep its headquarters in Britain despite the Brexit threat, and that the merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse appears to be carrying on regardless.</p>

<p>Ultimately, businesses are pragmatic, so their reasons for wanting to stay or go could be enlightening for voters struggling to comprehend what is actually on offer.</p>

<p>Engine maker <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/rollsroycegroup">Rolls-Royce</a> has said it has drawn up contingency plans. Again, it would be far more helpful for chief executive Warren East to say what these plans were rather than putting his name to an inane letter warning that Brexit could put jobs at risk.</p>

<p>If businesses believe they have a duty to get involved in the debate, they should start by helping their own staff understand how it could affect them, then do the same with their customers.</p>

<p>Those who genuinely believe in the EU and the single market should be leading the way. If they don’t, the Remain campaign risks being hijacked by doom-laden letters signed with encouragement from the government press office. And that’s no way to have a debate.</p>

<p>Rhetoric in the telecoms industry has turned increasingly vitriolic in the past few years amid a fierce battle over TV sports rights and bickering over the development of ultra-fast broadband.</p>

<p>For Sharon White, a relative telecoms rookie one year into the job of Ofcom chief executive, the change of tone has come as something of a shock.</p>

<p>Speaking after the telecoms regulator delivered its view on the future of Openreach – the division of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/btgroup">BT</a> that houses Britain’s broadband network – the former Treasury mandarin declared that her “Christmas card list will be a bit shorter this year”.</p>

<p>The thrust of her verdict was that stripping BT of its control of Openreach would be too costly and complex, even if it might in theory deliver benefits. Instead, BT was ordered to make it easier for rivals to use its network of telegraph poles and ducts – underground pipes – to deliver ultra-fast fibre optic broadband to the home. The nuclear option of full separation was left hanging over BT if it did not cooperate.</p>

<p>BT’s rivals, who complain of poor service from Openreach and achingly slow roll-out of fibre, see the decision as a cop-out. But there is a smart piece of call-my-bluff logic at the heart of Ofcom’s decision to take the middle ground. If the likes of Sky and TalkTalk are serious about building cable networks, the way is now clearer than ever for them to do so, to the benefit of all internet customers.</p>

<p>However, BT chief executive Gavin Patterson made it pretty clear that he didn’t expect to be fielding many calls from competitors keen to get started right away.</p>

<p>He might be right. It will take a lot of money and effort to get from the UK’s current level of 2% coverage for ultra-fast fibre to the 70% currently enjoyed in Japan. But it must be the right thing for BT – whose tentacles now stretch through telecoms, TV and, via its takeover of EE, mobile – to be put on notice that it cannot have things all its own way.</p>

<p>Ofcom’s next review will be in 2026. In the meantime, the regulator would do well to stop telecoms firms trading brickbats so that they can focus on delivering the technological advances that people and businesses need to prosper.</p>

<p>What happened to public outrage over bankers’ earnings? A few years ago, this weekend’s news of the <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/26/rbs-chief-executive-ross-mcewan-pay-2bn-loss-results-royal-bank-of-scotland" title="">top man at RBS being paid £3.8m in a loss-making year</a> would have caused a stink. Back in 2012, former chief executive Stephen Hester chose to waive his £1m bonus amid the threat of a Commons vote.</p>

<p>These days, there’s barely a squeak. True, current RBS chief Ross McEwan gave half his “role-based allowance” of £1m to charity, but he still earned more last year than Hester ever did – despite the share price dropping to 2012 levels.</p>

<p>Over at Lloyds, the other bailed-out bank, the trio of top executives has shared £40m between them in the past two years. Yes, Lloyds has improved faster than RBS, but that’s still a staggering sum.</p>

<p>Why the near-silence? Well, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, surprisingly, doesn’t seem interested. Chancellor George Osborne just wants to get rid of the state’s bank shares. Mostly, the bankers, by declaring that they have learned “restraint”, have persuaded the outside world that times have changed. It doesn’t look like it.</p>

Top bankers have got away with it and it's business as usual because the last 7 years as shown the 99% only have hot air when it comes to retribution; and the politicians and regulators have proven to be impotent anyway. Worse, I guess they hope to get away with it again when the next disaster strikes.

and the Pro EU companies are eager to have TTIP signed by the EU elites, where secret courts can overrule governments with judges appointed by the corporate. Having the UK in the EU will be a money spinner with the NHS up for full privatization.

If companies were supposed to have a voice in all this, they would have a vote but they don't. Most of what they come out with is unsubstantiated and all we end up with is politicians' allegations backed up not by evidence but by more unsubstantiated allegations from more and more businesses. This referendum is about people not business so business should just shut up and go back to what it is good at - milking society for all its worth and tax dodging.

Companies do not need to waste energy on Brexit it is something that they cannot influence.

The attempt by the Media and Political parties to politicise the EU referendum is DISGUSTING.

So UK workers are paid over the real market rate - same in many western European countries. They rob the nation's consumers by their overcharging, backed by unions - especially in public sector activities like the health system. Any country in which public servants like the doctors strike...........

Wouldn't their real commitment to the EU be if they stop hiding their profits offshore?

Many British companies are thriving on huge numbers of low paid foreign workers beavering away for quite low wages. It's no wonder at least some of them don't want the supply to dry up.Remember how Farage was vilified across the entire Media when claiming the numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians would soar if restrictions were eased?It hugely ironic that he was not only correct, he totally underestimated the numbers that would arrive.

I agree. I certainly wouldn't sign it. Don't vote Farage and never will. 20 million people and rising every day are currently voting out. UKIP got 4 million votes at the last election. Come and join 16 million Labour and Conservative voters.

Not sure companies should put their mouth where their money is. Corporates have a pretty poor public image currently. They only look after themselves and their shareholders because, guess what, that what they are supposed to do. There is an inherent conflict of interest. Sure we will all be better staying in, but the same old same old just doesn't sell papers and TV time so the other gets the headlines. The electorate aren't rational, look at the Scottish indy. ref. Sold a pup there and swallowed it whole. This be no different. Just remember it's the Sun wot does it.

And how many of the FTSE 100 signed Farage's letter to the UK? If such letter existed, that is. In reality Farage never bothered to write one, because nobody would sign it anyway.

despicable government overtures, was it in a private company, for not doing anything, they would get the sack.Constantly we are met by the statement, it is not worth doing, it would cost to much.No one say well this will cost to much for me to get my hands out of my pockets - I don't dispute some Parliament members work hard and may achieve much, but I do not see this trickle down to the tax payer - despicable ....

It would be good for UK consumers to also enter the debate by choosing to ignore the greedy and selfish businesses that support the EU.I no longer shop at Asda or use BP and Shell petrol stations. The consumer is king, not corporations corrupting our democracy.
