Finally, someone at EDF sees the £18bn farce that is Hinkley Point

<p><span class="drop-cap"><span class="drop-cap__inner">H</span></span>allelujah, at last somebody close to Hinkley Point farce can see that the £18bn nuclear adventure makes no sense. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edf-unions-call-for-hinkley-point-project-to-be-postponed">EDF’s finance director has quit</a> rather than be associated with a project that – we must assume – he judges so financially risky that it could sink the French energy firm. Last week, the official line from the Anglo-French summit maintained that “major progress” was being made in getting Hinkley towards sign-off. The reality, we can now see, is that there has been a major row and EDF remains mired in confusion.</p>

<p>The good news is that Thomas Piquemal’s resignation should oblige the governments of <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a> and the UK to acknowledge the uncomfortable fact about Hinkley that, until now, they have preferred to brush away. It’s simple: EDF’s nuclear technology for Hinkley hasn’t been proven to work. Until it can be shown to be reliable, there will always be a material risk that the Somerset project becomes a disaster for both buyer and supplier.</p>

<p>EDF is building two other reactors in Europe to the same European pressurised reactor (EPR) design and, instead of low-carbon nuclear power, both have produced only massive cost overruns. The plant in Finland is nine years late and the one in Flamanville in Normandy is four years behind schedule.</p>

<p>EDF’s crisis flows from those flops and Piquemal’s analysis that the company can’t afford to double-down on its EPR bet is surely correct. As it is, the debt-laden firm’s share price has fallen 90% over the past decade and there are other calls on its capital and resources, not least France’s nuclear power stations, which require an expensive upgrade.</p>

<p>The now ex-finance director wanted the investment decision on Hinkley to be delayed by three years, which would be wise from EDF’s point of view. The trouble is, the UK cannot afford yet more delays. Our crisis in energy generation will arrive in the mid-2020s and Hinkley, according to the official script, was supposed to do much more than merely produce 7% of the UK’s energy. The plant was also intended to help develop the infrastructure to support other companies’ new nuclear plants. If Hinkley were to be delayed by three years, the UK hasn’t got an energy policy worthy of the name.</p>

<p>The latest saga should lead to a simple conclusion in Downing Street: EDF and its unreliable EPRs were always the wrong choice for the UK. Consider how many subsidies have already been promised to compensate for EDF’s weaknesses and the unproven nature of its EPR. EDF was given 10 years to build Hinkley and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed">the UK guaranteed to buy its output at twice the current wholesale price for 35 years in an inflation-linked contract</a>. This was almost case of pricing in the cost over-runs and delays before they had even happened, with UK consumers footing the bill.</p>

<p>The best approach now would be to call the whole thing off. EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Lévy may continue to whistle cheerfully about Hinkley but his company looks to be only one more resignation away from capitulation. Abandonment would be politically embarrassing for chancellor George Osborne (remember last year’s grovel for Chinese cash to shore up the financing) but it would be far worse to let this show drag on.</p>

<p>If the UK’s future is nuclear, there are alternative suppliers – from Japan, the US, and China – who have smaller models that can be built more quickly, but their willingness to commit capital won’t be encouraged by the sight of the current Hinkley shambles. If the future is non-nuclear, then get on with the job of making hard choices about the best infrastructure.</p>

<p>Either way, the important thing for the UK is to have an energy policy that doesn’t rely on paying top-dollar to an over-stretched supplier that hasn’t been able to get its new kit to work.</p>

<p>The Competition and Markets Authority’s final report into the banking industry, due in May, will now appear in the dog days of August. This is not because the contents will be so frightening that leading bankers will need to lie down on the nearest beach. We already know the CMA has rejected structural reforms, such as a break-up of the big banks, in favour of technocratic fiddles, such as setting up a comparison website to encourage punters to shop around.</p>

<p>Such a remedy was <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/22/high-street-banks-survive-competition-inquiry">damned as feeble</a> by most observers when it was announced at the interim stage last October. That, presumably, is why the CMA has given itself an extension to come up with something that sounds more chunky. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/bank-customers-overdraft-fees-could-be-capped-say-regulators">Caps on overdraft charges</a> and grace periods for customers to avoid the same charges may improve the lot of a few. But none of these late additions by the CMA will deliver a shot in the arm for competition in the banking industry.</p>

<p>Blame Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank has turned the process of separating 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches into something resembling the labours of Hercules, thereby killing all appetite for further structural reform. Thus the “striking” stability in market shares identified by the CMA is virtually guaranteed to be striking in another decade’s time. The interim report felt like a missed opportunity; prepare to be disappointed again.<br/></p>

<p>Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish first minister and leader of Scottish National party, is a fierce opponent of the artificial tax tactics of some major companies. So, here you would think, is an open goal – <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" draggable="true" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/stagecoach-loses-court-case-over-11m-tax-avoidance-scheme">a court defeat for a Scottish company</a> that used a complex scheme to wipe £11m off its tax bill. The company is Stagecoach, whose chairman, Sir Brian Souter, happens to have been a major donor to the SNP. Sturgeon’s condemnation, one trusts, will be forthcoming anyway.</p>

Nuclear energy is classed as non-renewable mainly because uranium reserves are limited, and existing reactor designs extract less than 2% of the energy in the fuel before scrapping it. Combined, these factors mean that uranium will not last any longer than oil. The inefficient use of the fuel is also what leads to the stockpiles of high level waste.

As far as I am aware, EDF has no reactors of this design operating anywhere. They have attempted to build one or two but have run into difficulties. Whether you support nuclear power or not, this is not a good way to go about it.

Wave power uses the small up-and-down movement of the waves. The device itself bobs up and down on and this movement generates electricity. It works on the surface usually and is weather dependent but as you say, we have a lot of weather in this small island so there are usually lots of waves.Tidal power uses the bulk flows of water I the tide itself. It's powered by the moon so its utterly predictable and practically inexhaustible. You can use submerged turbines (think small-scale waterproof wind turbines) in high-flow areas or allow the rising tide to fill lagoons, which then drain through turbines at low tide. We are world leaders in developing tidal power generation and we have the best tidal resources in Europe, but as usual, we are doing a crap job of exploiting our advantages. In fact, the first commercial tidal barrage will be built off the Normandy coast by a French company, Alsthom, after they bough the British company that developed and demonstrated the technology.http://www.marineturbines.com/http://www.emec.org.uk/about-us/our-tidal-clients/alstom/

ThornburyBoy, I bow to your superior knowledge, although I am not sure what the difference is between tidal power and wave power.As far as the strength of waves is concerned, having recently being to the West coast, the waves there were impressive, even though the wind was light. The North sea can be rough as well, especially in winter, when wave/tidal power would be very useful.So, what is the difference between wave and tidal power - I would be interested to know?

Ouch! All those highly paid civil servants, all those pensions, all those loans to organise to finance construction. The Tories believe in small government and farming out jobs to companies like G4S who pay minimum wages with no pension benefits. If they need clever people they hire companies like Siemens or EDF to organise it. Even if Labour nationalised everything, the Tories would privatise it again. It's no way to run a society but it's how it works these days. Crapola all round.

Atomic energy creates these three problems: High Level Nuclear Waste (HLW), Plutonium and tons & tons of irradiated metal. There is NO solution for the wastes, Plutonium or the irradiated scrap iron at the end of the reactors life. There are two countries in Europe that are phasing out atomic energy. One is even reducing their dependence on it.  Over here in the states, the utilities are wanting rid of the HLW. They want a national repository that is funded by tax payers $ and not their $. That is a problem too. The nuclear wastes have the inherent ability to destroy any type container. So every 250 years or so...the containers will have to be changed out. Tax payers $ at work for 120,000 years ! This means there will be more wastes at the end than what we started with.  The UK is fortunate the Gulf Stream warms it. Be rather cold with out it, eh ? While I am going that way...we are also solar powered. We eat the food the sun & rain grow for us.  Whiskyeyes, below is on the right track. It will take however, lots of wind generators for night time electricity. Which is ok, because, the nice part of true renewable energy ( atomic energy is disqualified because of it's HLW) is: we can take apart a wind turbine (at the end of it's useful life) and put the metals from the old wind generator in the clean scrap metal stream. There is no mixing irradiated scrap from atomic energy into the clean scrap metal stream we now enjoy. There will have to be world wide, many scrap iron piles that accept iron from reactor sites...and KEEP it there. We can do much better than trash our only planet with atomic energy's HLW, Plutonium and irradiated metals. Cheers, Everyone, Pete

A more sensible approach would be to mothball Hinckley and let EDF get on with upgrading the French power stations, we can then contract to get any shortfall in electricity generation via the interocitor/ interconnector or whatever it is called. Got to be cheaper than commissioning Hinckley and paying double or treble the current price for electricity. Let's not forget the Eurozone is in deep recession and likely to stay that way for the immediate future, there should be stacks of spare electricity for us to buy.

Waves are as unreliable as wind - waves are indeed affected greatly by wind, ask any sailor about wind over tide. Tides are completely predictable and are therefore much easier to model when designing a tidal power scheme.

You're talking about HSUK. It's a load of old cock. They've just spent 250,000 quid on a PR agency, yet claim they can't show anyone their detailed maps because they can't afford the ordnance survey fee.Part of their scheme involves building a new underground line under the Thames from Euston to Waterloo. They're going to 4-track all the way to Sheffield. And it's going to be cheaper than HS2. Really.

Meanwhile, the French and every other nation can snigger over the general incompetence of 'Bumbling Britain' to sort out its energy needs in a sensible and coherent way.

Omega, one answer to the winter blackout is wave power. As an island, surrounded by often rough seas, wave power would seem an obvious area of development, but it does not appear to be happening.

The argument against any further nuclear power station builds are as follows:Cost: as the EDF fiasco shows, nuclear power is prohibitively expensive in terms of capital investment, requiring huge subsidy from the customers to make the investment even remotely commercially viable.Delivery: all nuclear builds inevitably go into costly overruns, both in terms of investment and time. EDF's experience with its own builds show this, but the history of nuclear power in this country was similar - years behind schedule and billions over cost.Security: the risks of terrorist attacks or accidental meltdowns are slight, but the damage that could be caused is potentially catastrophic, with the examples of Chernobyl and Japan to illustrate.But the major cost of nuclear is the opportunity cost - by diverting huge investment and time into nuclear, we are neglecting the alternatives - short term, the building of gas fired stations, quickly and cheaply, but in the longer term, investment in green alternatives.Just think what even half of the cost of Hinkley would do if invested in the development of wind, wave and solar power.

I understood that the cost was partially due to multiple layers of fail safes and redundant systems, over and above what is normally done. This was a requirement when planning was submitted. I am not saying the choice is easy but if we abandon nuclear we may regret this during future Winter blackouts, waiting for the wind to pick up, or begging Russia for more gas.

No doubt the control systems may incorporate some Chinese electronics - has there been a risk analysis done on the reliability and security aspects of doing this? Also, you are of course aware that none of the similar models of nuclear power plants being built by EDF, under construction already for several years in France and Finland, with a very signifiacant timescale and cost overrun, have yet to produce a watt of electricity?

A valid point, but it is this government which has pulled the feet from under renewables - there was a carbon capture coal plant on the Firth of Forth, but they pulled the plug on that as well ( maybe because it was in Scotland, but that's another story...)
