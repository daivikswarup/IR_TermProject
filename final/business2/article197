Carney: Bank of England could cut interest rates to zero, but not below

<p>The <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor">Bank of England</a> could cut interest rates to zero, but will seek to avoid following Sweden, Denmark and the eurozone by setting negative rates to bolster growth and inflation.</p>

<p>Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, said Threadneedle Street had “no intention and no interest” in implementing negative interest rates and <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/10/global-stock-markets-face-rout-amid-fears-central-bankers-out-of-ammunition">would adopt the full range of the Bank’s other powers</a> to deal with a downturn in the economy.</p>

<p>He said: “If we were in a position where the economy needed additional stimulus ... we could cut interest rates towards zero. We could engage in additional asset purchases, including a variety of assets. </p>

<p>“We could also provide a perspective where we could adjust our policy horizon – in other words we could shorten our policy horizon over which we wanted to return inflation to target.”</p>

<p>Carney, <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/feb/21/central-bankers-on-the-defensive-as-weird-policy-becomes-even-weirder">who was responding to questions from MPs on the Treasury select committee</a>, said the world economy had entered a period of low growth and low interest rates and was likely to be prone to financial shocks. </p>

<p>He added that Threadneedle Street might need to respond with additional stimulus measures, but to protect the profitability of the UK’s banks and building societies, the<a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/bank-of-england-votes-9-0-to-keep-interest-rates-on-hold"> monetary policy committee</a> (MPC) would avoid cutting from the current base rate of 0.5% to below zero.</p>

<p>The message that negative interest rates would be a last resort comes before an expected push by the <a class="u-underline" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank">European Central Bank</a> to deploy the measure on a bigger scale at its next meeting to increase lending and growth in the eurozone.</p>

<p>Japan and Switzerland have also adopted negative interest rates in recent months.</p>

<p>Carney said negative rates in the UK would damage building societies, which would find it difficult to make a profit on mortgage lending if they were forced to pay an interest rate on funds deposited at the Bank of England.</p>

<p>The aim of negative interest rates, which effectively puts a charge on savers depositing funds, is to discourage commercial banks from leaving cash on deposit with Threadneedle Street and lend it to businesses and consumers instead. </p>

<p>Some central banks have also pushed rates below zero to discourage foreign investors from depositing funds and putting pressure on the exchange rate. Sweden and Denmark did so to drive down the value of their currencies to maintain parity with the euro. <a class="u-underline" data-component="in-body-link" data-link-name="in body link" href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/29/investors-love-cheap-money-and-hate-optimistic-central-bankers">Japan cut its rates</a> to to depress the value of the yen.</p>

<p>Carney said building societies would find it difficult to make money in a negative interest rate environment.</p>

<p>“We take very seriously the potentially counter-productive impact on the building society sector and the financial sector more broadly.”</p>

<p>He said in Switzerland, mortgage rates have gone up despite the country’s central bank setting negative interest rates. “So it is not clear that the domestic transmission mechanism has been effective,” he noted.</p>

<p>Deputy governor Minouche Shafik said she was sceptical that negative interest rates were passed on by banks to the benefit of customers.</p>

<p>“What we observe from that experience is that the effect is passed on to lower money market rates, but what we don’t see is that it gets passed on to deposit rates,” she said.</p>

Low interest rates=lower repayments=greater liquidity. Same with the 'disastrous' oil prices and their impact on the cost of petrol! On a microeconomic level these are good things for (some of) the men/women on the street.

Author::::glit00
DateTime::::2016-02-24T13:49:45Z
Why is it interesting? GDP (nowadays at least for the UK) is a function of debt, the "investment" increase is the investment in shares, not capex, which explains why the real money in the economy (consumer spending) only went 10% (and chances are, that 10% is 99.9% made up of debt that ~75% of people can just barely keep up the interest payments on as many are crying about the reduction in state support and funding, the so-called "benefits").

Yes. Reserves are hot potatoes. Banks keep passing them to other banks. If you stop passing them on you end up under pile of hot spuds, so you pass them on ASAP.

Why couldn't the asset purchases be new UK infrastructure rather than BOE bonds? The infrastructure would add to the capital account of the country there would be no net loss especially at zero interest.

The head of the BoE is one of the most powerful and most prestigious jobs in the world and one of the hardest to get. You have a better chance of being an actual rock star than you have of becoming the head of the BoE. And some people still act surprised that it pays a fucking lot.

But it's a closed loop - a zero sum game. Lending does not effect the total amount of reserves in the system. It temporarily moves ownership of them. No amount of private bank lending will rid the system of unwanted reserves.



Author::::NorthernL4d

Your example assumes reserves move on a 1:1 basis with newly created deposits from loan issuance. The reconciliation of reserves between banks represents only a fraction of new lending as reserves transfers are netted out.

I agree with Michael. If you (re)read Keynes (A tract on Monetary Reform), written at a time of hyper-inflation in 1923, you would notice many countries tried to grapple with new realities that couldn't be based on pre-1914 economic theories.

central bank's rates are what the central bank lets other banks "borrow" money. there is absolutely no obligation on the banks to pass the savings on (and for most part they don't do it with regular things that have become way cheaper for them to do over the years owing to advances in technology).

True, but chances are, the price difference was always there, and the three bed house in E.Suss would always have cost proportionately similar (cheaper but in the same proportion) to your flat in Harts.

Like I said, what is supposed to happen in theory doesn't translate into practice, as the first thing that the game theory teaches us is that people are irrational. So instead of stimulating spending (capex) the money goes to share-buybacks (commonly referred to as using debt to pay down debt).

The aim of negative interest rates, which effectively puts a charge on savers depositing funds, is to discourage commercial banks from leaving cash on deposit with Threadneedle Street and lend it to businesses and consumers instead.
