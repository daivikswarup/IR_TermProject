John Lewis apologises to mother told to leave over toddler's tantrum




DateTime::::2016-03-07T17:00:45+0000



<p>The department store John Lewis has apologised to a mother who was asked to leave its shop in Greater Manchester because her toddler was having a tantrum.</p>

<p>Lindsay Robinson was shopping at the Trafford Centre branch in Dumplington when her 16-month-old daughter, Heidi, had a crying fit.</p>

<p>As Robinson was trying to calm her child, a member of staff from the menswear department approached and made the pair leave the shop.</p>

<p>“He said to me, ‘I’m afraid we’ve had a complaint, you will have to leave,’” Robinson, 36, said. “I was shocked. I dropped a keyring and rucksack for Heidi that I was about to buy, and this staff member escorted us out of the store.</p>

<p>“Heidi has only just learned to walk, so I use a harness for her as she is a bit unsteady on her feet. I was carrying her and she started to lose the plot. I was trying to put the harness back on and Heidi was loud and vocal. I was trying to do my best to calm her down, and get her harness on so she didn’t crawl off … Then I was asked to leave. I felt quite upset.” </p>

<p>Robinson, of Prestwich, made a formal complaint to John Lewis, which has apologised but confirmed that staff had asked her to move.</p>

<p>Robinson said: “I called customer services and someone did call me back. They apologised and said the member of staff’s behaviour was out of order. They said they would send a £20 voucher as an apology. I don’t think I will be going back to that store.</p>

<p>“I am not interested in any voucher or money. My point is that when shops see a mother trying to deal with a child having a tantrum they should cut them a bit of slack. I was made to feel like a rubbish mum.”</p>

<p>She said the incident was embarrassing: “Everyone was looking at me. It is a shame because I am a loyal customer. When I got married we had a wedding list of presents from there.” </p>

<p>The incident happened at 12pm on Saturday when the store was packed with people shopping for Mother’s Day gifts.</p>

<p> Robinson said she wanted a personal apology from the member of staff responsible.</p>

<p>John Lewis said: “We are very sorry that Mrs Robinson was upset after visiting our shop. One of our managers spoke to her on Saturday to sincerely apologise and today our head of branch has written to Mrs Robinson to formally apologise again, and has also sent her flowers.</p>

<p>“Although our partner didn’t escort Mrs Robinson out of the shop, he did ask her to leave in response to other customers’ complaints. We’re speaking to the partner about what happened, and how we could have been more sympathetic to Mrs Robinson and her daughter.”</p>

She may not have considered that solution because she is either thick or arrogant in lack of consideration for others.

Because complaining about crying children and inconsiderate parents is the same as executing hostages and raping prisoners?

Being anti-natalist in principle, and about as child-friendly as Herod by nature, yes, screaming children and mothers who checked their brain in when they entered the labour room and forgot to collect it on their way home do spoil my day. I actively avoid them as much as I can, and thankfully, given that the UK is a place where there are fewer women having children than ever before, finding kindred spirits to spend my happily child-free time with is surprisingly easy.

I'm a loyal shopper. .... when we got married we had a wedding list from there". So you're not really a loyal shopper at all then are you. Get a life! Is not the end of the world if others don't like a noisy child. I've had 2 of my own and didn't make this fuss.

palpable hostility/indifference/callousness to and wilful ignorance of children, of parents, of the nature of even our own families (of what we all in fact are - clumsy, struggling, utterly interdependent animals being socialised and trained, often not quite in the nick of time to ourselves then try out and pass on the skills with great difficulty simply so we don't eat each other)… that societal swamp glimpsed in this thread and children being battered and raped and neglected in the swamp - yes you read me exquisitely right.

It is not an excuse. It was a small part of my comment. I'm not suggesting that there aren't adults who bring up children with at times total disregard for others and yes that pisses me off. But this situation does not appear to be in the same league. As you will see below people with more specialist knowledge than I have actually suggest that moving a child having a tantrum may make the child more likely to repeat that action as they see that they have forced their parents into taking action. My main point is that we are too eager to judge without having any understanding of the salient points in regard to the mother and child. Unfortunately parenting appears to be skill little rewarded these days.

As a father myself, whenever I see some poor parent dealing with their child freaking out, I think "there, but for the grace of God.....". Does your average punter really find an upset child in a shop to be grounds for a complaint to the staff? You're shopping FFS, not attending the opera! Awful, nasty, precious (and presumably childless) people here.

As long as you don't expect any patience or assistance at any time over the next 18 years of looking after your child, you are perfectly entitled to take that position.

Oh dear, I can't help but feel you'll pay the price for your spiteful remarks. Roll on the day when ID is wrestling with a toddler in a very public place or maybe the noisy toddler will one day be caring for the old ID in the nursing home. Learn a little humanity, it will serve you well in life.

She wasn't on her own with the child, the woman was shopping with a friend while the toddler had a tantrum. (See the story in the Manchester Evening News.)

Sad, but true. Also, bear in mind that animal charities are far richer than children's charities in the UK. Says a lot.
