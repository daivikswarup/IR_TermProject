<comment>The only NORMAL country in that part of the self-imploding, bloody, islamo-fascist world of death and brutality is Jewish Country of Israel that remains to be Stable Strong and Successful.</comment>

<comment>After woefully failing in Yemen, for the umpteenth time, the Saudis shall continue to fumble around in the Middle East seeking for a name until trouble meets them at home. It is already clear the filthy kingdom cannot hold its own for long again after so many years betrayals and aggression of and on other Arab countries.</comment>

<comment>Get that piece of junk off The Temple Mount now.  It looks like a bunch of squatters on a Beverly Hills Estate.  They knew The Temple Mount belonged to Israel and they went ahead and built on it anyways thinking they could claim it as there's.  The Mosque definitely looks out of place and does not belong.</comment>

<comment>The entire purpose of the video feed was supposed to be so that the Arabs could see for themselves that Israel's claim that there is no change in the status quo at the Temple Mount is in fact true. This objective does not require a feed from inside the Mosque and the Israelis should actually want the Waqf to control the video so that there can be no doubt to anyone what is happening on the site.</comment>

<comment>Better to support a civilized nation like Israel than muslim barbarians still living in the 12th century. I don't see any stories about Jews or ANYONE ELSE but muslims doing Beheadings, kidnapping and raping young girls by the HUNDRED, destroying historical sites, running thru cities and malls shooting innocents, blowing up buses and planes, laughing while burning people alive in cages, dancing in the streets after 9/11 etc etc.. ONLY MURDERING MANIAC MUSLIMS do these horrible things. Face it, muslims arriving in any civilized country are BAD NEWS my friend ! (and obama's trying to bring in 10,000 of these maniacs. )</comment>

<comment>All the Jewish people want is to pray in peace, but this angers the Arabs and provokes hatred and violence. Poor Israel, surrounded by such a hateful and violent Arab world. Look at the Arab vs Arab killings going on today in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Saudia Arabia, Yemen, bahrain, Tunisia, Algeria, Lebanon. Israel is the only true peaceful democracy in the region and the U.S.'s only real friend.</comment>
