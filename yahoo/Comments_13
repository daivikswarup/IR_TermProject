<comment>This will only allow them time to re arm.  This will go on as long as the leaders are from the elite religious factions that control the money and the power over the people.  I am not a liberal but I see in the background of the pics that are shown a way of life we cannot imagine.  At the very worst our women and children  were never treated the way these women and children are, so the western world has no idea of how or when it can be changed.  We the women of the world raise the children and it is our words and our actions which form our children's lives. If we band together and show these women that they DO have the power to change their world, it would help.  Women are meant to bare children and to teach them from birth the love of life.  But I see little children used as bombs, as soldiers and as no more than cattle.  Little girls before or shortly after puberty used as breeding stock, sold to the highest bidder.  This is 14th century mentality and there needs to be a way to educate and help these women.  Even as I am writing this I think, "but we in the western world are seeing our young women voluntarily entering into marriages with these men"  There must be a death wish rampant in the world..  I watch our tiny babies being herded into "schools" and regimented into a different way of live that we know is not right, so maybe this is the cause.   Education is one of the most important part of our freedom but it is not all of it.  The early years of a child are the years of instilling the humanities in a child, not the indoctrination of </comment>

<comment>And so Syria and Russia are expected to be able to carry out airstrikes against Al-Qaeda in Syria, without killing the so-called "moderate Syrian rebels" that are included in the ceasefire, as well as the Al-Qaeda terrorists? Not likely. Almost all of the other so-called "Syrian rebel groups" cooperate closely with Al-Qaeda in Syria, sometimes simply because Al-Qaeda in Syria is the most powerful group fighting against the Syrian military on the battlefield, and sometimes because, in addition to the fact that Al-Qaeda in Syria is the most powerful group fighting against the Syrian military, the so-called "Syrian rebels" are ideologically aligned with Al-Qaeda, as well. </comment>

<comment>Great start!!  US and Russia must first come to terms.  The rest of the nations will follow thru or else suffer the consequences of facing the two militarily strongest powers on the same side.  The challenge to the West and US is to bring Russia back into Europe social network of politics and economy.  The benefits for Russia are huge and the benefits for the rest is a peaceful manageable world order. Even China will take the cue and mend it's fences. Wishful thinking! Hardly.  A stable world is good for the stock market, good for economic development, good for democracy, good for environment and good for putting an end to the Islamic terrorism which is playing on the global unrest more than any thing else.</comment>

<comment>Does anyone really expect anything to come out of this? Kerry is all proud of himself, only because he's ignorant enough to think something was accomplished.</comment>

<comment>Lmao what moderate rebels 2 devisions left the area they were in one group gave al their weapons and equipment o Al-Qaeda so that they can leave safely, President Assad let another group leave and go to a ISIS held territory and in another report some rebels are siding with the A-Qaeda group so what rebels are there left? Reports of the Syrian people happy to see the regimes army coming in running out the terrorist phq head obama calls moderate rebels yes to the elections and when Assad is elected again phq head obama needs to sit down and shut his mouth. The only time he needs to open his mouth is to eat the chit sandwich that President Putin will give him for cleaning up his mess.</comment>

<comment>There are whopping 97 different opposition groups, most of them radical Islamists, most mixed with and friendly with al Qaeda, Nusra Front, many of them foreign terrorists, some of them openly hostile to the Kurds who are not part of the 97.   As Obama has mentioned that the primary US objective still remains regime change in Syria.  As in Libya, Assad is to dragged in chains behind a white Toyota pickup truck and, afterwards, a new Syria order is to emerge from the 97 groups of squabbling HNC friendly terrorists.  Obama has already given notice that all cease fire violations will be blamed on Assad and Russia.  Kerry will be issuing plenty of warnings in the coming days.</comment>

<comment>"Syrian opposition and rebel umbrella group said dozens of factions - 97 groups in all - have agreed to abide by the cease-fire."  So how about a list AP, at least of the major ones.  Apparently Jaysh in Douma is included, which is idiocy.  Some may remember they were the ones driving Alawite women and children around in cages in the back of their pickups as human shields.  Not terrorists, ha?  Guarantee you Ahrar is one of the 97.  The only difference between them and Nusra is that they don't talk to Zawahiri, in every other way; doctrine, methodology, funding ... they are the same.  The Russians should be doing much more to publicize specific instances of US's insistence they do not hit these terrorist jihadis on a case by case bases, as well as when US claims they are hitting "moderates" commingled with Nusra - a line of argument that has already been foundationally prepared.  If such "moderates" are so enmeshed with Qaeda as to provide cover for them, how about getting unmeshed in the context of the ceasefire?  Shine a bright light on the details where the devil lurks and force Barry and Kerry to publicly pick a side.  The Russians still have so much to learn from the Americans about modern spin / propaganda.</comment>

<comment>In other news, the UN Secretary General begged President Lincoln to reign in General Sherman. "The scale of the atrocities against civilians is unprecedented.” "The US has invented a new kind of war," he said further. The Free Southern Observatory has reported General Sherman as saying ”, " I intend to make it a howling wilderness where a Crow flying across will have to bring it's own lunch"!</comment>
