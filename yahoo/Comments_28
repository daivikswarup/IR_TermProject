<comment>Only 2 of the tapes were found to be doctored what is the fate of the remaining 5 tapes submitted by the Delhi Government. Why is the Left, Kejriwal and others not talking about these 5 tapes. When the Investigating Agency has clearly stated that 2 of the tapes were doctored it clearly states or implies that the other 5 are genuine. Let it be played on TV and let the Indian citizens decide who is on which side. It is proved beyond doubt that JNU has rogues in it and is only hiding behind the fa√ßade that most of its students are from the backward classes. Let them introspect as to who has left them to be backward in all these years after Independence. Who ruled India for the maximum period. Perverted minds and casteists rule the roost in JNU. It should be asked to be self reliant and send out overstaying students who don't complete their degrees even in 10 years.</comment>

<comment>Sita Ram Yechhury should have read the comments of the learned Judge before approving interim bail to Sri Kanhaiya Kumar. She commented that if the infected limb does not respond to antibiotic, same may be amputated. Hope you understand the simple English Mr Yechury! I don't blame you but, the Red Book may not have such things!</comment>

<comment>Yechury should also demand investigation for his forged signature on petition to USA president Obama not to issue visa to Modi. Correct !</comment>

<comment>Mr.Yechery is not bothered at all about the anti national activities in side the campus but he is very much bothered about the action against the doctored tapes.  Shame on you.</comment>
