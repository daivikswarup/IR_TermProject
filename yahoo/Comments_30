<comment>Not just the govt magazines but also all history books (school, colleges, university etc) should be revamped and should be rewritten to bring the right perspective of Indian history especially the freedom struggle which stinks of gandhi-nehru exploits as if there were the only freedom fighters and no one else did anything. Also, the jinx called corrupt communal congress and nehru family's exploits in the post independence era should be scrutinized to bring out the havoc they actually wrecked out in India to bring in communal divide, abject poverty, divide and rule policy etc. It's time Indians learnt the true history of India instead of concocted and manufactured one.
