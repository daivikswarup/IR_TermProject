New Delhi, Mar. 2 (ANI): With JNU Students' Union president Kanhaiya Kumar getting interim bail from the High Court, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday slammed the Centre for 'covering-up its all round failure' and asked to file charges against who doctored the tapes."Kanhaiya is free. Now, Accountability anyone ? Govt must file charges ag those who doctored tapes. So much energy wasted by Modi govt. This government can go to any length to cover-up its all round failure. Victimisation of innocent students is only one case in point," Yechury said on twitter.Yechury, who has been critical of the Centre for booking the JNU students under sedition charges, accused the Modi government of whipping up false hysteria against JNU students."Kanhaiya and others set up to mask other national security failures. False hysteria whipped up. But who framed Kanhaiya and JNU. Questions about this will continue to be raised inside and outside Parliament. This country expects answers from the government," he said.JNU student Kanhaiya was granted bail today by the Delhi High Court, nearly three weeks after he was arrested on sedition charges in a case that has led to mass protests and opposition allegations that the government is trying to crush dissent.Granting the student leader bail for six months with conditions, the court appeared to liken his alleged offence to infection in a limb.
