<comment>JNU has become a den for anti nationalists and marxists. Now that Kanhaiya is facing sedition charges he is singing a diff song. This man was organiser of the meet with terrorists in JNU where anti national meetings and slogans were raised I saw his speech on TV he ridicules the PM and his cronies make fun of the PM He has been doctrined by LeT and hence talks like that Parents should not send their wards to JNU unless the professors, staff and hostels are screened</comment>

<comment>None of the Opposition Parties are supporting patriotism.  They are for dalit votes.  They dont hesitate to  give Crown of Martyr for terrorists for the sake of vote and to be in power.  They have done in Ishrat Jahan case to bring down Modi Government in Gujarath.  The politicians would stoop to any extent to get power and to be in limelight.  They are visiting Pakistan and shamelessly advocate for ouster of Modi Government with them.  Let us wait till all the files of Nethaji Subhas Chandra Bose is cleared for public view then so many hidden facts would come out of Pandora Box.  We Indians are mocking at Democracy even though we boast of being Biggest democratic country in the world.  We are fit to be ruled and do not know how to rule our country and build our nation as one of the strongest nation.</comment>

<comment>It is appalling to see the wide publicity being given to Kanhaiya. What is shocking is the whole opposition and media are supporting him as though he is a freedom fighter. One question none is addressing - Is it true or not that anti - India and pro-militants slogans were raised, which is the culmination of all problems? who raised those slogans ?.How they need to be treated ? Can they be left scot-free?. Do they agree raising anti India slogan is the freedom of speech they want ?? This is what is meant by tolerance ?</comment>

<comment>Its quite evident that this 50 minute discourse which although humorous is full of issues that are nothing new and we Indians (all of us) want freedom from them.But our politicians and the media always need to wrap old things in new packages as there survival depends on it.So these discourses come along which are uni-dimensional in their narrative and are nothing but an extension of our great political minds.</comment>

<comment>he is research scholar or a politician one can easily understand. his communist ideas can easily lure students but he should also tell that their are not many takers of his ideas. communism has failed in all countries and democracy has taken the roots.he should not hide himself behind poverty caste (given to country by congress not by rss abvp bjp)if he feels to abuse or criticise modi rss he is misplaced.fight against corruption poverty along with praise of rahul  is not matching.</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya Kumar and his supporters are acting as if he has been vindicated by the court. No such thing has happened. The court has merely taken a merciful stance and given him conditional bail. But Communists will remain communists. They have a problem understanding and accepting any view other than their own. They are the most hateful, vengeful, intolerant and abusive people in the world as we have seen in the cases of all the communist regimes around the world like Cambodia, Myanmar, China, USSR where millions of innocents were massacred simply because the communist leaders did not "like" their way of life.</comment>

<comment>Communists have dwindled down to single figure in the Parliament. Both their traditional forts, i.e., Kerala & West Bengal are not with them. Being in such pitiable condition in Indian democracy, they are trying to nurture their political ideology among students in JNU. For too long JNU was allowed to be the breeding ground for anti national thoughts, to the extent that terrorists have infiltrated their supporters there. That is how one hears Afzal Guru being a martyr, India to disintegrate and Pakistan Zindabad. Although Kanhaiya may not have uttered these slogans he was aware that ISI sponsored supporters were there in the Campus and he was physically present when these slogans were being shouted. As student leader neither did he try to stop the anti national sloganeering nor did he leave the scene. On the other hand he continued shouting slogans, albeit not using anti national words. Thus he becomes an accomplice. Any one who reads the Delhi High Court bail order in full can make out that the court has taken this view. There is nothing to celebrate about his bail. The bail is conditional and is limited to 6 months, within which period the onus of proving his innocence is on Kanhaiya. He cleverly avoided any anti national sentiment now in his speech yesterday, instead changing his tack to anti PM. He also cleverly utters 'Satyameva Jayate', albeit sarcastically. Whatever he does, if not 'sedition' he will have to answer for being an accomplice. Let us see how he defends himself in the Court against that.</comment>

<comment>Kanhaiya speech was spoken in very wicked way. It is fashion to target our PM ; thanks to dirty politics played by kejriwal and congress. Kanhaiya is from Bihar...he should start his fight in that state and uplift the standards of Biharis in every manner...social, legaj, financially, education , irrigation, industry, agriculture etc. Yesterday on TV we saw the "copy" culture of Bihar education system. SHAME SHAME.....Bihar is full of problems and they voted for Lalu who is facing corruption charges and his 9th standard educated son is deputy CM!!! Come on Kanhaiya first Bihar than India...</comment>
