<comment>You want azadi within the country??? What are you talking about, Mr. half-witted anti-nationalism-infected lazy bum ??? Every free Indian is again bound by several laws of the country which is required for living peacefully in the country. Do you want to be free from everything and spread anarchy in the country? What is the need to give slogan for freedom? What is your contribution for eliminating poverty and unemployment from the country ???  Instead, you are fed by the govt of India and still a burden for the country.</comment>

<comment>In Goa beaches girls and boys go naked. Do you think it is Azadhi? RSS is thinking for Bharat and working for majority Hindus unlike Pakistan muslim congress which works exclusively for muslims and dalits only for vote bank thus keeping them poor and illiterate, So you want Azadhi, then go to Pakistan. First be a responsible son at 29 years??? for your ailing father, low wage earning mother; an irresponsible son cannot be a responsible citizen of any country.</comment>
