Unhappy with the state of government publications, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reportedly asked for an overhaul of magazines published by various ministries — both in content and their revenue model — with a special focus on nearly 20 regular publications brought out by the Tourism and Culture ministries, it is learnt.Antim Jan, a Hindi monthly magazine produced by Gandhi Smriti and Darshan Smriti (GSDS), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Culture, is one of the magazines Modi is said to be unhappy about. And it is likely to be the first to undergo a revamp. Until now a compilation of essays by eminent citizens on Mahatma Gandhi, the magazine will now be made “more newsy and exhaustive in terms of content,” says GSDS Director Dipanker Shri Gyan.“From March, we will have special issues on Gandhi’s Champaran Satyagraha, in the run-up to the historic event’s 100 years,” he says. “Gradually, we will have more special issues based on other themes and events related to Gandhi.”The Prime Minister is the chairman of GSDS.According to sources, the move to overhaul many of these publications came after Modi was reportedly dissatisfied with the content of Air India’s in-flight magazine, Shubh Yatra, during one of his recent trips abroad. He is said to have told officials that the magazine could do better to promote tourism in India, as also to promote Air India.Another magazine that is said to be in for a revamp is Airports India, the monthly magazine of Airports Authority of India, available at all major airports.
