It was a lovely and real sweet moments to capture between Karan Johar and Suhana Khan, who came back from a trip to Mumbai and were spotted together in a fun mood and enjoying each other's company.Karan Johar, has always been a friend, a family member for Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan, everyone in the world knows about their strong bonding and the way they are there for each other. They don't just work together but even party and celebrate each other's success and are there to support in difficult times. That's just too sweet, good to see such real relations in the world of showbiz.Karan is so protective about Suhana Khan, you don't believe me. Check it out in all the pics here. They speak volumes about the sweet relation n bond between KJo and Suhana. Ever before did you see a pic of Suhana laughing, smiling this way as she is with Karan in these pics. Karan Johar, takes SRK as elder brother and he also said in one of his interviews that he respects Shah Rukh Khan so much, that when King Khan walks in his office or set it doesn't take too long for Karan to leave his chair and stand for SRK as a form of respect and greet and talk as many times they come across each other. Wowww !! No wonder, why Karan is matching steps with Suhana and is being right next to her in all the pics. Because, if anything goes wrong there, Karan knows who he will have to give answer to and face.But it was really good to capture such moments between them. It also shows the kind of trust SRK has on KJo. And KJo had mentioned long back of launching Shah Rukh's son Aryan Khan, if he decides to join Bollywood. We will see that if KJo keeps his words or not, but now KJo will have to plan a project not just for Aryan but also for youngest heartthrob "Abram Khan" and for the beautiful Suhana Khan.
