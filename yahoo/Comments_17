<comment>Merkel, who has said that those fleeing violence deserve protection, so with that thought in mind we must provide a new designation to those immigrating from Turkey. They fled violence in their homelands to the safety of Turkey. They left Turkey, not fleeing violence, but to settle in a new homeland. That's it! We will now refer to them as "settlers" entering Europe to settle the countries within. Sorry European Union. If there is a Brexit, expect in short order there will be a shaving away of additional countries. Sovereignty is not something that can be taken from individual nations with a plea of "there must be a European solution to the settler crisis." Especially when you proposed solution is against the well being of those you plea to. The only solution to your bleeding heart problem is apparently to ask the settlers where they want to go. If they chose a country that does not welcome them, give them a second option. Then bus the settlers to Germany. However, the open borders will dissappear since only the most foolish doesn't realize the settlers will move on until their satisfied. Hence, border check will remain in force to prevent resettling.</comment>

<comment>UN is an International organization with more than 100 members yet UN has not offer any assistance to relocate these people away from Europe!  Pretty sure that all is aware that Eruope is not what is use to be and some countries cannot even take care of their own yet everyone is expecting them to take care of a milion + additional people with different cultrure, language and religion.  UN needs to find better solutions than just blaming EU for closing borders!</comment>

<comment>The UN has lost any credibility with their incessant pleas that all borders must remain open even though there are countless millions of Muslim refugees that would do anything to get into Europe.  Instead of the UN dealing with these refugees at the source the UN "DEMANDS" that Europe accept them all.  Go away UN.  The only thing the UN has become is a collection of diplomats living the high life in their plush Manhattan apartments.</comment>

<comment>The UN is guilty of corrupt leadership, to whom the EU bows to. The only way to to bring back sanity, morality, and constitutional based law is for a grassroots movement from the bottom up. That's how change happens. The people in power won't change voluntarily. They must be pressured, and removed. Then replaced with people who are limited by law not to act without the consent of the people. Anything else is anarchy, fascism, communism, etc. New social ideas must be balloon tested and introduced slowly. Why isn't the UN doing what it was created for- helping people better their own countries. Eventually, if the world put war aside, the world population would meld together, and racism would finally begin to fade away. But that is a slow evolution, not the crisis unfolding in Europe today. It is obvious the reasons for this crisis can be traced to the economic war over resources, using a regions culture, religion, economic pressure, etc to control the masses and direct them where they want them.</comment>

<comment>Tell me exactly how many " migrants " has the UN chief taken into his home? How much money and resources has he PERSONALLY lent to the care and support of all these people? Has the UN chief spent any time on these borders personally to help see to both the safety of the "migrants" and the native people's? I am guessing he would not like to have to answer those questions and  I really wonder how he would feel if we just dropped off a couple of these "migrants" on his door step and forced him to take them in!!!! Bet his mouth would stop spewing #$%$ then!!!!!</comment>

<comment>Big talk from a man whose own country, South Korea, is not taking in any refugees.</comment>

<comment>Maybe he should read the refugee act it states you file in the first safe country you come to not the one with the best benefits. If the UN gets to pick and choose what laws they want to follow so do we. The UN is doing nothing to relieve the pressure on our countries expecting us to pay out the backside to take care of a bunch of people who we know now are mostly economic migrants, it's hypocrisy at its finest.</comment>

<comment>Wow! Wow! Wow!  Six stories on Yahoo in the last 72 hours about the poor, pathetic invading refugees with attached photos of old men, crying children, and weeping women. Not one photo that reflects the true demographic profile of the invaders that being young chicken #$%$* makes between the ages of 18 and 30 who are to chicken #$%$* cowards to fights to protect their families back home. </comment>
