<comment>Suicidal for DMDK... Better be a responsible opposition than trying to align with a corrupt party like DMK. Vijaykanth would lose his little credibility by aligning with DMK and hope better sense would prevail while taking a final decision. By joining with BJP there is chance for 15 seats but by aligning with DMK the chances of getting 5 seats look very bleak and leave alone forming the govt. In all probability DMK is going lose badly in this election which is very much aware by the DMK so they are trying to save their face by aligning with DMDK to look for some ray of hope. Hope better sense prevails with Vijaykanth</comment>

<comment>An Himalayan Blunder by Captain who will not be even Vice-Captain in the Alliance.He is aligning with 2 of the worst corrupt parties . If Raja and Kanimozhi are convicted , the stains will wear off on the great Captain.If  the Alliance does not get majority , DMDK can forget their future . captain will be 50 plus in 2021 and he will have Anbumani, Stalin, & others to fight to become CM.</comment>
