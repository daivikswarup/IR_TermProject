Kanhaiya Kumar, president of the JNU students union, delivered an impassioned speech in front of thousands of students at the university on Thursday night, shortly after being released on bail from Tihar jail. Kanhaiya was arrested on sedition charges and accused of raising anti-national slogans. But subsequent investigation found that he in fact had not raised such slogans and that the videos featuring him were in fact doctored.WATCH VIDEO: Kanhaiya Kumar's Speech At JNU Campus After ReleaseIn his speech, Kanhaiya spoke about the farmers who commit suicide every year and the apathy the government shows towards them.
