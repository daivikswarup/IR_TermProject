<comment>There is only ONE solution to this problem. Immediately deport them all back to their own countries and tell them to fix their own problems instead of bringing their problems to OUR countries! This is how the muslims will take over the world, by getting bleeding hearts to allow them to come into non muslim countries, allowing them to become citizens where they will then vote for change to muslim ways. They will ruin all the cultures in all these countries.</comment>

<comment>The EU is members self interest struggles showing as inertia... the Eurozone is another brawl... the Schengen Accord was to serve EU member state citizens, NOT refugees NOR illegals. The big issue was formerly a few thousand Roma from a few locales roaming. Now it's millions of nomads from multiple lands bouncing across borders looking for the best deal. EU, the welfare state, is doomed. The subsidies, housing, schools, hospitals, & all will buckle & collapse. Those "temporarily" sheltered will NEVER go back. Mark my word, the EU, a failed state, is doomed. </comment>

<comment>This will not end well no matter how they try. There are far too many refugees seeking new residence, and nobody is talking about what will happen to their native countries once the violence has stopped. There is a big difference between political and economic refugees and those seeking to escape the violence and destruction caused by the warring parties and the Islamists attempting to destroy the cultural and historic significance of these countries. I just hope everyone can be made aware of this fact.</comment>

<comment>The Med Group should be escorting these invaders back to Trukey rather than allowing them on to their own soil.  Once they are allowed in, they should take responsibility instead of crying about it!  Why should anyone take in these people if they do not have capacity or desire?</comment>

<comment>AP continues to shill and propagandise for the invading animals using nothing but images of women and children who are in the vast minority, while ignoring the majority of military age males and reports of the crimes they commit.</comment>

<comment>The Balkan states action may compel the EU med to act seriously.</comment>

<comment>Sanctions and arms embargo's on Turkey and Arab kingdoms that are causing the refugee problem would solve the problem.</comment>

<comment>You know...if you tell a bunch of dirt poor people that, not only, will you accept them into you nice green prosperous country, but you will also support them...do you think they are going to stay in their third world, desert sheet hole country...or come flocking by the millions to yours?</comment>
