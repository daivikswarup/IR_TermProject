New Delhi, Mar. 3 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the continuous disruptions in Parliament are a result of the 'inferiority complex' of the Opposition."Some people have aged physically, but not in maturity; some people don't understand, but just want to oppose for the sake of it. There are such bright MPs in the opposition, they were not to be seen in the previous two sessions," he said."Nobody in the opposition must look stronger and this is the inferiority complex," he added.Quoting former prime minister Indira Gandhi's 1974 speech made at the Indraprastha College that one shouldn't portray the nation as 'weak', Prime Minister Modi appealed to the Opposition to help pass important bills in both Houses of Parliament."GST Bill is your bill and you (Congress) are only opposing it, said Prime Minister Modi.He further said that poverty is so deep-rooted in the country that if he tries to tackle the problem, he himself will get uprooted."The opposition is concerned about why we are doing better work than them. You (Congress have sown seeds of poverty. NREGA or MGNREGA has been put to use in less needy states," he said."No one will deny that if Congress would've helped the poor in 60 years, the poor wouldn't still be facing trouble. We must admit that MGNREGA is not a symbol of our success," he added.Comparing the spending in sectors like Railways and MNREGA, Prime Minister Modi said that the Opposition is more concerned on how the government is doing better than it."How a functioning government can serve the people and progress in every sector with good results - NDA government has shown the way. One MP said Fasal Bima Yojana is only for few districts. I want to say that this scheme will be applicable everywhere. We need fresh ideas for Parliament; we can't ignore 60 yrs of misgovernance; there should be a week when only 1st time MPs speak," he said. (ANI)
