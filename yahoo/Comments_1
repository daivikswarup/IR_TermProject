<comment>The Most tedious and chilling Ghat section in Agumbe,Shimoga District of Karnataka, must have found place in this group. 18 hairpin curves on the side of a almost vertical Ghat section is a challenge to drivers and riders. The Hill side is so vertical, that if you stand at the top of the Ghat ( at Agumbe sunset spot) and throw a stone with all force, it will land in Someshwara, almost 1800 feet below, in South Cenara District</comment>

<comment>I wondered at nature of this kind and asked a friend what made this rock to be stable yet looks so precarious.  He replied," God said ,hold on and it stopped".When He orders it to fall it will fall off instantly. Life goes on unruffled by conditions in which many dare not relish.</comment>
