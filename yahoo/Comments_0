<comment>Surprised on development. First the slogans were declared not categorized as anti national. Then few media persons wrote articles calling oneself yes  am anti nationalist. Now overnight a hero emerges with national problems, as if these are very new and our staunch media and leaders are overwhelmed with its recent knowledge. Recently one State was burnt in hope to get benefit for certain section, another States may also face such problems, what to talk of terrorism country is facing. What is required that problems be deliberated and solutions be proposed. When budget is discussed then it is declared continuance of old schemes. Logically problems are there which is outcome of development. There are many universities in the country and have capable leaders, waiting for Media's attention to highlight their strength. Nobody can belittle their strength by ignoring them; they are also in making of New India</comment>

<comment>Oh really? If a bunch of left leaning lunatics speaking in favor of a delusional immature crazy brainwashed so-called student is massive then wonder if this is the new definition of massive. first of all jnu is not India. secondly, the bunch of lunatics supporting him are mainly anti-BJP and their worst enemy's enemy is a friend to them. So, it's natural that they are praising him. Thirdly, his speech is full of empty rhetoric, rants and bias with no substance, logic and rationale. It's becoming increasingly apparent that if one graduates at jnu, they will atleast get into one of these corrupt communal left wing political parties if they don't get any job. so kanhaiya is no doubt getting ready for that. It's about time when he surfaces as one of them that he already is. No wonder politics sucks in India where anti-nationals, cheats and people of low-caliber become politicians of the left kind. Jai Hind!!!</comment>

<comment>Indian Express should focus on some other national building issues. It is an non issue. People are not fool they will leave reading this news paper. There are so many people in each state which fight with governments . If he is so much interested in public issues then first he must quit university so that public money on such students can be saved. He can serve to uplift his home state Bihar where a huge unemployment under the 10 years leadership of JDU. Communist(CPI & CPM) ruled west Bengal for 40 years & ruined the economy. Poverty rise to unexpected level under communist regime.</comment>

<comment>His leanings are clear. If he has so much sympathy for people of this country he should do something about the deteriorating conditions in the States where his party is in majority (if at all). Secondly do not take jibes at our country because he and his fellow JNU ites are availing all subsidies - thanks to tax payers like us. We are feeding snakes with our tax money. Also this man who has been hailed as future leader etc should nip the terrorists JNU has, in its bud. Ghar ghar mein Afzal Guru. Who shouted these slogans?</comment>

<comment>Basically I don't believe in oratory and speeches, because speeches mask the real character of a person. Best example is Modi. Though I haven't watched Kanhaiya's speech, I admire him for what he is and what he is doing currently. He is standing firm against the dangerous fascist groups such as VHP and RSS, which are hellbent on dividing the country on the lines of religion and caste. These fascist groups still aren't ready to digest the fact that India was formed as a secular country, after independence, where all people have similar rights. Though the contribution of these fascist groups to the independence movement was absolute zero, their vision of India was totally different. They wanted an India where religious minority groups and people of lower castes would be considered as secondary citizens, with no fundamental rights. Youth of the country should stand firm against these demons, who are planning to take the country backwards. These groups have utter disregard towards humans rights in general and towards the plight of poor people and minorities in particular. They exploit lower caste Hindus for votes, by pitting them against the minorities just before elections. I wish Kanhaiya all the best, on his journey of enlightening the youth of this nation and exposing the lies being spread by present government and its henchmen.</comment>

<comment>As if he has done a great thing by shouting anti national slogans and openly abusing motherland!  He is clearly a front for the hate India brigade. A few traitors are spoiling the atmosphere of entire nation and sadly Yahoo India is also supportive to them!</comment>
