<comment>He can start by kicking the Mexicans out of Conmebol Tournaments! Mexicans are not South Americans, Never have been and never will be. They don't belong. Brazilian, Argentines and Uruguayans absolutely hate traveling to mexico much less playing with them. Everyone needs to go back to their own Confederations. Let's see how long this corruption of mexico playing with the Conmebol will last.</comment>

<comment>Congrats! Who says destiny doesn't exist? But i was shocked when CAF refused an African candidate to endorse Salman.Yet some of them betrayed at the last minute to vote Infantino.It shows how unreliable Africans are.Look at UEFA that stood by Infantino like one man.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't want an endorsement from Blatter. If I were the new FIFA president, wouldn't want him to ever mention my name.</comment>
