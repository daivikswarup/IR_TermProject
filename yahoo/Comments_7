<comment>Really in this army of impotent, eunuchs and parasites sitting in both Houses of Parliament who are just barking, barking and barking, this fellow, irrespective of which background, political party or character, has slapped all those in power by speaking the Truth.  No other punishment than DEATH penalty is perfect for all those who indulge in corruption and are found guilty by judiciary.  Just one act of giving DEATH penalty to corrupts can change everything.  All the ills our Motherland is facing are directly or indirectly related to corruption.  If all the corrupts are given DEATH penalty, only honest politicians (though there is doubt if blood of honesty is running in the veins of any of them) and a select group of competent, patriotic, devoted and action oriented  government officials will remain there and they can without any fear make India most beautiful, liveable and prosperous country.  Then there will be no need to see like beggars in the face of NaMo Mamu and ask him ' When will those Achhe Din come'?</comment>
