                            Point is, if they did ask for independence, there would be civil, perhaps heated, discussions and debates and arguments. But will their government come down on them with their law enforcement tools, would they be slapped with sedition charges? Would the troll army come out to drown their voices, cower them, and tell them to go live in another country? Now do you understand the anguish of thinking Indians who are talking more and more about intolerance? This simple word is now making people go ballistic!!

Let him not forget that nationalism defined Europe for centuries and ultimately led to the terrible world wars. So, we do not need an Englishman preaching to us about listening to diverse opinions. Indian political discourse is inclusive and abhors any extreme sentiment. This is the reason, why, all political dispensations that may start out as revolutionary, ultimately settle down in to a smooth rhythm of give and take politics and compromising on their extreme positions. Any extremist position is naturally shunted to the extremities of the political landscape.

Many will be mainstream, some will not. And thats fine - it hasnt done any harm to the nation in all these decades since independence. <br/><br/>
However, if a mob is allowed to take justice into its own hands within a courtroom for two successive days in our capital city, and the judges and police stand by as mute spectators - that certainly shames the nation. It shows we are a country without the rule of law. Thats a damning indictment. <br/><br/>

I would draw your attention to the fact In India thousands of small communities with their cultures, languages, customs and religions are surviving and florishing for the last 7000 years under Indian Civilisation. Do not lecture India about humanity and morality. You are the scums of civilisation as you impose your system on others by creating a hubis that it is the best, which is not. Fact indicates otherwise. You and your ilks understand the language of force and after decimating your opponents preach peace.

Labeling people as Anti_Nationals who hold a contrary view has become a norm in this country. Need of the hour is to engage, discuss and debate. Incarcerating people isn't the answer.  I also hold a section of our media responsible for this. We are in a day and age where media is influencing public opinion. And everyone in the TRP business knows,,, Fear sells. Media houses know portraying these students as terrorists hatching a devious plan to break our country will sky-rocket their TRPs. Yeah,,, because that's how terrorists work right? First they will hold a march,, announce what they are planning to do in public,,, and then act on it. Really??? And this actually sells. And last but not the least,, we'll have guest appearances from Rahul because he's really concerned about the growing intolerance.. Dude.. come on. Politics is not for you.

                            This leftist channel knows that those leftist students were way out of the line and went too far with their slogans. But it is too egoistic to accept that fact so has been publishing all kinds of silly opinions trying to change people's perception of this whole episode!

                            Hello Prof Andrew:<br/>
I disagree with your views. India is known for its revolutionary leaders and visionaries who were first nationalists rather than any other "-ists". They themselves have been masters at what they studied and believed in core values. Unfortunately, that is NOT the current situation. In the name of socialism and communism the real core values have been long forgotten of equality and social justice. <br/><br/>
No one in India would have had an objection if there was a debate about a policy for example a death sentence (to anyone) but terming those who helped terrorists as martyrs and shouting against India - is completely unacceptable. UNACCEPTABLE. <br/><br/>
More Importantly, these "students"(?) play into the hands of those against India, sometimes, even unknowingly. If we do not nip it in the bud, it will spread - see what happened in Jadavpur university? <br/><br/>
To summarise - "Can India Really Not Cope With A Few Anti-National Slogans?" - a better question would have been "SHOUD India Really Not Cope With A Few Anti-National Slogans?" and the answer is NO NO NO.

So there is a need to stop propagation of their destructive ideology. Yeong minds are easy prey to that.Had their been a timely ban of deobandi terror ideology then there wouldn't have been a taliban. Too much democracy turns it into hypocrisy. We have a beautiful constitution to be a democratic, free country. But that does not mean we let anyone/group misuse the liberal provisions of the constitution to freely propagate destruction of the country undermining the same constitution which provided them the freedom in the first place. We don't want 'animal farm' in India.

                            The context of India's angst must be understood Mr. Whitehead. From Afghanistan to Japan, Indian thought (philosophy, art and math) and its indigenous religious beliefs (Buddhism, Hinduism etc) spread and co-mingled with the sciences, arts and faiths of the local population. Different strands of rich thought was developed. However, ever since the Judaic religions mainly Islam and to a certain extent Christianity started its assault on this rich tapestry, which started obliterating people who thought any differently, the trouble has started. Wherever, a fight was not put up entire communities have been wiped out - Hindus in pakistan and Bangladesh have all but disappeared in 50 years. The same happened in Indonesia and Malaysia 300 years ago. The Buddhists are under major attack by Christians in Korea, China and Japan (one of the key reasons why the North Korean state is propped up by China - to avoid the Christian evangelists overrunning South east China and North Korea).  Thailand, Srilanka, Burma Buddhists are under threat from Islamists and the list can go on. So, any seditious behaviour has existential dimensions in Indian mindset. This is not about Scotland and England coexisting as mainly white Christian neighbors.

                            Dr.Radhakrishan's observations were right . Indian students in Britain vilifying that nation. Pl  do not quote Bedi. American students rose  for a cause that they thought was good for their country and people. Here in India, besides raising slogans on Kashmir, the students were shouting slogans about destrying India. This is not good and if the govt acted it was the correct step.  The author can as well stay away from such issues that do not concern him and his country. Everyone offers his or her opinion on India. Try it with China, Pakistan, North Korea, and all theocratic states.
