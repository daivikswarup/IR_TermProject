<comment>They have already said he wouldn't be appointing squat.  Move on.</comment>

<comment>Republicans in leadership, i.e. the establishment, have said they wouldn't consider any nominee. That shouldn't stop Obama from fulfilling his constitutional duty. Besides, what people say and do are often two very different things.</comment>

<comment>fer sure</comment>

<comment>Especially when it comes to Oliar!</comment>

<comment>Sure, Constitution-nullification is the new normal... .</comment>

<comment>New ?  Slow burn maybe but not new.</comment>

<comment>Normal since Barrack Obama took the oath of office in 2009.</comment>

<comment>Out in the open.</comment>

<comment>There is a tad of nullification built into Constitutional processes, what with three branches, etc.  But the Congress vowing to cripple the Executive is new....</comment>

<comment>Can't argue that.</comment>

<comment>Aren't they vowing to cripple the Judiciary?</comment>

<comment>True. They're going for a trifecta.</comment>

<comment>There can be only one!</comment>

<comment>No.  Oliar thought he could cripple the Judiciary.  He found out that he was not elected Der Fuhrer like he thought and even though he buffaloed congress, he could not stomp the Supreme Court into the ground.</comment>

<comment>Yes! But first they are crippling the Exectutive who puts the judges in the seats.​ The are crippling the entire government, in reality.</comment>

<comment>The Congress has always been the constraint upon Der Fuhrer presidents like Oliar from becoming a dictator.  The problem is that Oliar never realized that he was not a dictator and has consistently tried to dictate to the Congress and to the American people what his wants were.</comment>

<comment>It has been established law since 1860-something that the president has discretionary as well as ministerial powers.  It's hilarious when you people want Obama to be both toothless and a fearsome tyrant all at the same time.  (Yes you...)​</comment>

<comment>Wow!  it is really a hoot that some of you ignorant Obama lemmings continue to disregard the fact that the idiot community organizer is so inept that he can't seem to do even one thing right.  He IS toothless and is a supreme bullshiter without a "smidgen" of integrity or honesty and has sold America down the river at every occasion the moron has had an opportunity to do so.  The community organizer is by far the most worthless, inept president the U.S. has ever had!</comment>

<comment>Actually, the executive vowing to cripple the Congress is new.  Oliar thinking he was elected Der Fuhrer is the first idiot to think he is the supreme leader of the U.S. that can impose his wishes upon Congress, the Supreme Court and the citizens of the U.S.  The Community Organizer thought he was elected monarch and has never realized he is supposed to uphold the constitution, defend our nation and put our citizens rights first.</comment>

<comment>​*Mississippi v. Johnson* 71 U.S. 475 <https: en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" case_citation=""> (1867)Read it. If you learn one thing a decade, you will be low functioning by the time you die.</comment>

<comment>Well, there is one consolation.  I will always be a superior functioning individual than you can ever aspire to be.</comment>

<comment>Read the effing case, "patriot."</comment>

<comment>And? They should actually be faced with non-hypothetical appointee.Its a stupid position. What if they were to REALLY like his appointee? What if Trump gets elected? What is Sanders wins? Those two won't produce more palatable nominees to the GOP.</comment>

<comment>I understand this.  Just repeating what they said.</comment>

<comment>Uhmmmmm, perhaps you could restate your comment when you get sober?</comment>

<comment>Not sure what you find unclear?Its easy to say "we're not holding a hearing" when its hypothetical (ie no person has been nominated). Its a little different when Obama puts a person forth.The stupid position is the "wait until the election" position the GOP has taken. If its President Trump or President Sanders, they'll nominate someone that the GOP REALLY hates. Clinton to a lesser extent.</comment>

<comment>Wow, that makes sense!  Let Oliar appoint a traitorous politician because MAYBE a more traitorous politician will get in the White House and appoint an even more traitorous politician!  You head has been up your posterior for so long that your eardrums are coated with feces!</comment>

<comment>Obama should nominate someone because he is the president until the end of the year. His term doesn't end just because there is election in November. The constitution doesn't say the president should stop being the president because it's his last year in office.</comment>

<comment>The inept piece of pig dung has never been president - he just sat in the White House and pretended to be a community organizer.  He would have been impeached long ago if he was not our first black president.  It is a shame that our first black president turned out to be such a miserable failure.</comment>

<comment>Grifter, stick to grifting and leave the important decisions and comments to people that have an IQ greater than a carrot.</comment>

<comment>Grifty, go to bed and quit smoking.  You are really a stupid little person when you are sober and off dope.</comment>

<comment>Just because Mitch McConnell refusees to do his job doesn't mean the president should follow suit.Our taxes pay both their salaries but only one of them is earning that money.</comment>

<comment>Neither are earning the facking money.</comment>

<comment>Uhmmmmmm - Oliar has been in office for over seven years and still is not doing his job!  Dirty Harry was such a little angel - HA, HA, HA ......</comment>

<comment>I'm glad to see you feel Mitch is earning his salary, because everyone knows that the Chicago thug is not earning his!</comment>

<comment>The moronic president has never earned even one month of his salary.  He is still stuck in the community organizer/bullshite orator mode and still doesn't have a clue to what he is supposed to be doing.</comment>

<comment>I can think of no nomination that most clearly shows the utter depravity of the GOP's position on this issue.If they accept him they have given in and the GOP elite gets hammered for collusion with the enemy.If they reject him they prove they have no interest in governance and the GOP candidates get hammered in the next election.</comment>

<comment>True, the Democrats got hammered the last time for doing it.</comment>

<comment>Doing what? I'll remind everyone that Scalia was confirmed by a Dem Senate.</comment>

<comment>Great comment, and an important reminder.</comment>

<comment>Not in an election year.</comment>

<comment>That makes it ok, I guess.</comment>

<comment>The work of the country stops in an election year? Where is that in the constitution?</comment>

<comment>McConnell made a massive mistake when he showed his hand literally an hour after Scalia's death had been announced. He left himself zero wiggle room.This will haunt him, and the Republicans who lined up to repeat his nonsense.</comment>

<comment>No it won't. If Obama appoints a Republican to the court, McConnell's won. If this drags on until the election, McConnell's won. The only way he loses is if Obama picks another Ginsburg and gets him/her in (which he absolutely should).</comment>

<comment>Wow, you are not only a moron, but you do not have America at heart.  This was never supposed to be a party politics agenda, but a nominee that would put aside his personal feelings and politics and render unbiased judgements based upon constitutional law.  You people, including Oliar, that try to make this a political issue are contemptible.</comment>

<comment>Actually some commentators think that it was shrewd - it was where they wanted to end up and he avoided appear to cave from pressure from the Ted Cruz's of the world.</comment>

<comment>Uhmmm, Betty, better lay off the weed and sleep some before you make another moronic statement like thatl</comment>

<comment>How do you think it harms the republicans?</comment>

<comment>Don't.  It is just an idiotic statement which indicates you are on dope or just a stupid person.</comment>
