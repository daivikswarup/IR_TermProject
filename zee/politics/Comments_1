<comment>The single biggest issue that catapulted Trump into the GOP lead was his outspoken comments on illegal immigration. When he did this he captured the attention of a large segment of the populace who feel left behind by both parties on this issue. Protecting American workers from unfair competition from immigrants legal and illegal should be a Democrat issue, but the Dems are much more concerned with flooding the country with new perceived Democrat voters. Establishment GOP say they want to control illegal immigration with a nod and a wink, but the truth is, they want the cheap labor - they just want to keep them illegal so they are easier to exploit. If Trump is elected president who knows what he will really do, but the thing no one can deny is he knows how to hit the hot buttons with average Americans when he says non PC things that the career politicians are afraid to say. In my view, the real key to Trump's success is he really doesn't "give a flying f--- "whether he is elected or not elected.</comment>

<comment>He plays to stupid.  He plays to hate.</comment>

<comment>Some people have valid reasons to hate.  25,064 illegals were arrested for murder, 14,788 for kidnapping, 213,047 illegals were arrested for assault, 42,609 for robbery, 115,045 for burglary, 81,710 for auto theft, 125,322 for larceny/theft in the study period.  That is a lot of dead and victimized Americans that would not have been dead of victimized had we secured our border.http://www.gao.gov/assets/320/...</comment>

<comment>You conveniently forgot to mention that the "Study period" started in August of 1955.  Now compare that to crime totals in the same period by US citizens.  oops.  Not so frightening, is it?</comment>

<comment>Did you really just try and reduce the severity of 25,064 murdered people?Also, you conveniently missed the part where, "About 90 percent of the arrests in our study population occurred after 1990.  ".Even beyond that though, 25,064 murders / 60 = 417 murders a year, or a murder per day by an illegal.</comment>

<comment>Reduce?  No.  Place in a perspective which you intentionally concealed in order to deceive people?  Yes.</comment>

<comment>I mentioned the total number of crimes and said absolutely nothing about dates because the dates don't change the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have been victimized by people that shouldn't even be in this country.  Placed in its proper perspective about 5% of murders are caused by illegal aliens.</comment>

<comment>And as for the 90% figure, that only means that the study population is hopelessly corrupt for the purposes to which you are attempting to put it (It almost completely ignores the crack epidemic of the '80s).  Either way, big fail on your part.  Try again.</comment>

<comment>To my original point it is disgusting you are trying to minimize the significance of 25,064 murdered people by suggesting the period of time over which they were killed is sufficiently long enough to make them insignificant.  Sorry, but 417 murders a year is roughly 5% of our total homicides.</comment>

<comment>Since most murders are domestic in nature, and overwhelmingly committed by socio-economic familiars (not strangers) one would have to suppose that the vast majority of these 417 homocides attributed to "illegals" have both an immigrant perpetrator AND immigrant victim. Imp[lied in your "valid reason to hate" comment above, is that these are 417 bloodthirsty immigrant savages slaughtering 417 blonde and blue-eyed Jr. Miss Nebraskas, and that simply isn't the case. </comment>

<comment>Fear and resentment is the Republican platform. A year ago these people were convinced we were all going to die of Ebola, imported by sneezing ISIL operatives.</comment>

<comment>#BLM! #Handsupdontshoot Eat the rich! White people suck!</comment>

<comment>The Democrat Anthropogenic warming alarmists take the cake as major fear mongers, in my view.</comment>

<comment>Kate Steinle's family would like to have a word with you.</comment>

<comment>That's not the point.The point is that we do enough on our own without illegals to contend with so let them do their hideous things in their own countries.But Mexico definitely, decidedly, is the one to be punished as well for allowing all those illegals to tromp through the country and urge them on to cross the border into the US.The punishment should be severe, more than paying for the Wall.....a re-negotiation of NAFTA in the interests of the US.</comment>

<comment>Your rebuttal is just as selective in its truth, since I don't see any passion on your part to examine per capita crime rates among illegal immigrants.You apologists for illegal immigration, and the general complete abandonment of social democracy to neoliberalism are why Trump can score points so easily.  This article was after all, written by a journalist who ostentatiously overflows with concern for racism against black Americans, but backs economic policies, by his own admission, identical to the Koch Bros.</comment>

<comment>yet you make no comments about the trade agreements that have gutted the republican base and middle clase/working class!!!!</comment>

<comment>As long as the agreements are truly free trade and not crafted in a way that subsidies one group over another there isn't anything to be said other than "adapt or die".  You can't expect to earn $25 an hour in a world full of people willing to work for $2.50 an hour with similar skill levels.</comment>

<comment>You know, I'm intrigued that you mention that.  Trump has indicated that is the reason for falling wages in the States.  But what - if anything - can a President do about that?</comment>

<comment>They can change the tax code to stop providing incentives for companies that offshore labor.  They can change regulations that handicap the competitiveness of American labor. They can change the tax code in an attempt to lure foreign companies here.  That would be three things I'd investigate right off the bat.</comment>

<comment>Sure you can, if the worker being paid $25/hour is working within a stable society nearby to the market for his output, and the worker being paid $2.50/hour is on the other side of the planet within a society that might revolt and nationalize the factory tomorrow.  Except they aren't really going to revolt because the US is spending 600B annually to be the planet's police force and protect our "global interests."  How can anyone insist the America worker is being screwed by irresistible "free market" forces, when his income is taxed, and his children provide the cannon fodder, to make globalization possible, by reducing the risk to the investor class?  Let us at least fund our military with import/export duties.  That would make a fairer market.</comment>

<comment>Government is the largest distorter of free markets.</comment>

<comment>True, but you need it to enforce property rights and contract law without which it is just the law of the jungle.</comment>

<comment>Gee whiz!Did you happen to notice that the Kalamazoo mass murderer was a native born white guy?  So was Tim McVeigh.  Hey, Ted Bundy!Your statistics are meaningless, but your hatred and cowardly xenophobia are disgusting.   You make me want to puke.</comment>

<comment>He never said that Americans don't kill other Americans. He rightly pointed out that without illegal aliens, there would be 25,064 fewer murders. As is typical with race-obsessed liberals/ leftists/ progressives, you turned it into a racial issue. Then, as if on cue, you commence with the ad hominem attacks. It is responses like yours to a legitimate, objective opinion that are fueling The Donald's rise.</comment>

<comment>What about more deaths? Poverty creates death and more poverty among blacks and latinos surely increasing the amount of crime and its victims. Illegal immigration pushes wages down and workers out therefore creating more deaths.These are the type of things difficult to count but obvious truths.'“Such an increase in lawful workers would have a deleterious effect on low-skilled American workers, particularly black workers,” Mr. Kirsanow said. “Illegal immigration has a disparate impact on African-American men because these men are disproportionately represented in the low-skilled labor force.”'</comment>

<comment>What are you smoking, Cheech?  Want a fact?  Here is an objective fact:  Immigrants are FAR LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIME than native born Americans, and LESS LIKELY TO BE JAILED.http://www.wsj.com/articles/th...Check it out, you freaking moron.  And enjoy your Trump.  Trump for Chumps!</comment>

<comment>True. They usually farm that task out to their children.</comment>

<comment>What a stupid comment. I would believe the vast majority of American's realize that they live in a world that is not perfect, and that bad things happen. The difference is that millions of Americans also don't think we need to import killers either. But since your the one who focuses more on the race of people instead of actions of people, you import your own prejudices to others. Psychology calls that transference. I just say it makes me want to puke. Racism is racism. But then where would progressives be without their racism?</comment>

<comment>The Real Racists!  That is some good stuff. </comment>

<comment>Ahem.  No comment as brainless and hypocritical as yours should insult others.I would critique your comment, but it really does a great job of critiquing itself.  Thank you for such stunning evidence that you are stupid.Are you white?</comment>

<comment>Being white is the worst thing ever. They've never done anything positive in American history. The United States will be much better off when its population approximates that of Jalisco.Thanks for dealing with these racists who think they have a say in the demographic future of their country. Wait until we have a brown plurality, amirite? We're really going to stick it to them.The only reason they oppose immigration is racism and irrational fear.</comment>

<comment>Got a new account, eh?  Same old troll, same old schtick.  New name new avatar.Yawn.  Wonder how long before they delete this account?</comment>

<comment>Why would you obliquely call for the deletion of my account for the crime of expounding upon what you believe and write in bits and pieces?White people should welcome their demographic decline and eventual extinction, yes? You agree?</comment>

<comment>They're very relevant to the families of those 25,064 people that were killed and to the survivors of the hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes they have committed.Also, what does the existence of domestic killers have to do with 25,064 people murdered because of non-native ones?</comment>

<comment>I know, all serial killers are white people or so goes a popular "observation".> The racial breakdown of serial killers is about the same as> that of the U.S. population at large, according to the FBI.> http://www.theatlantic.com/…/t...> …just 46 percent of serial killers since 1910 have been> white men. Richard Ramirez, or the “Night Stalker,” is one > well-known non-white killer—he was the son of a Mexican> policeman.</comment>

<comment>So how does that support your racist position?Clue:  It doesn't.Freaking moron.</comment>

<comment>It completely destroyed your implication that all mass murderers are white -- a common assertion among liberals.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  The "destruction" of an "implication" I did not imply.And a characterization of me that is false.You kind of rock, dude, I mean, for an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Your choice of words reveals a lot about 1. education and 2. identification while not providing evidence of my personal beliefs."Although the short Anglo-Saxon words constitute only about 10% of total English vocabulary, they are the mainstay of everyday conversational English used words in the English language. The longer French, Greek or Latin-origin words are found in formal settings such as education and government."</comment>

<comment>Another "on point" response from the Troll of Disaster.Thank you for teaching me an important lesson--to leave trolls alone.</comment>

<comment>Once the fields are bare...http://www.canada.com/windsors...“I do not help economic refugees,” said Roberts, adding her non-profit organization assists the fleeing victims of torture and war crimes and has no affiliation with the JHCC.“This is a problem the U.S. has allowed to create. It’s really unfair for Canada to have to face this,” said MP Joe Comartin (NDP -- Windsor-Tecumseh), his Party’s public safety and national security critic.“This is very much being driven by (the U.S. Department of) Homeland Security,” he said, predicting that, “with few exceptions,” most of these “economic claimants” will eventually be sent back.</comment>

<comment>Statistics are not meaningless simply because you can cite other ways to die from murder in the United States.</comment>

<comment>America for Americans, you globalist butthole</comment>

<comment>Freaking bigot.The America you want never existed.  You don't know what America is.  And you don't deserve America.</comment>

<comment>Only if there's stupid and hate around to dissemble that he's not and can't stand it.</comment>

<comment>He's no Bernie Sanders if that's what you're getting at.</comment>

<comment>Illegal criminal Mexicans and Musli9m jihadi savages DESERVE hate, you girly-man</comment>

<comment>Oh please. Reagan famously offered amnesty, Bush worked on an immigration deal with Ted Kennedy and bragged about speaking Spanish. The GOP regularly increases limits on HB1 visas. Think. Big business wants more immigration of all kinds, and big business gets what it wants. From both parties, but ESPECIALLY from Republicans. Immigration in America exists for the same reasons Japan and Europe have been forced to embrace immigration even though they clearly don't want to: in a consumer economy you need and increasing population to keep spending enough to raise the GDP.As for "PC" you people love to bring up the time Obama said people cling to guns and religions and got huge blowback for it. Obama saying that was, by definition, EXTREMELY politically incorrect. Yet you don't cheer that, because PC is a meaningless slur.</comment>

<comment>Obama's statement was not EXTREMELY politically incorrect. Gun control is the Zeitgeist of the academia and media classes. Obama suffered zero backlash from the mainstream media, so by default, the comment was politically correct. In order for something to be politically incorrect, it must challenge liberal dogma. Obama's statement was the epitome of liberal dogma.</comment>
