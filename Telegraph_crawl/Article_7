<div class="body"><p> All Naypyidaw’s roads lead eventually to Burma’s most powerful seat, but there is only desolation along the way. The only signs of life along mile after mile of empty highways are the straw-hatted street sweepers. The battle against the dust amounts to an unceasing demonstration that remoteness provides no insulation against reality. The master plan has, however, proved to be no guarantee against change from within. </p><p> Since the 77-year old general retired in March, his successors in Naypyidaw have already abandoned the obsessions that shaped the city. A reformer sits as the first occupant of the presidential palace and the parliament is braced for an influx of opposition democrats. </p><p> Last year a flawed election returned 435 members of Burma’s first sitting parliament in 25 years. But the opposition – which boycotted the elections – is now preparing to contest 48 by-elections. If all goes as hoped, the city will become the unlikely launching pad of Asia’s newest democracy. </p><p> The parliamentary trappings are already in place. Than Kywe, the deputy security director, is a secret policeman turned parliamentary aid. In the chamber of the lower house, he explains its legitimacy is symbolised by the mace placed on the rostrum. Next door in the speaker’s office a green gown similar to that worn by the Speaker of the House of Commons hangs on a suit rail. A copy of Parliament, a guide to procedure, traditions and protocol in the Mother of Parliaments, is well-thumbed on the desk. </p><p> Mr Than claims the experiment in democracy is far-reaching, with some members having carried pictures of the opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her slain father Gen Aung San into the house. </p><p> “There are people here doing actions that I would have arrested them for a few months ago,” said the special branch detective. Burmese journalists posted to cover the sessions in the parliament claim a surprising amount of genuine debate has taken place, even though the military or its allies hold 88 per cent of seats. </p><p> “I didn’t expect it before I went up to Naypyidaw, but the MPs are really serious about their roles,” said a reporter at Eleven Weekly, the country’s most outspoken newspaper. “OK, so most don’t really know how to do the job yet, but most are determined to try.” </p><p> As parliament opens up to diplomats, its members have shown themselves eager to learn from abroad. Members of the public accounts committee are reported to be considering an offer of assistance from the Westminster Foundation, a public body that assists parliaments in developing countries, to draw up their own operational rules. </p><p> Amid the grotesque splendour of the showcase capital, the announcement raised the prospect that the descent of </p><p> a clutch of pin-striped Sir Humphreys would subvert Gen Than’s dreams in the very marble halls that he erected to safeguard his legacy. </p></div>
