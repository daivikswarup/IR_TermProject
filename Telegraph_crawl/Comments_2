<p>VOTE REMAIN</p>

<p>Kindly Foxtrot Oscar...you xanker!</p>

<p>and you too Sir</p>

<p>It's Saturday night, you're 35 and you're on here, you sad muppet.</p>

<p>And you Sir?</p>

<p>I'm an old fart, what's your excuse.</p>

<p>same here. &amp; trying to disrupt the ol' kippers</p>

<p>As I said, you're a sad muppet.</p>

<p>admitted</p>

<p>You should flag your own comment, thus bringing it to their attention.</p>

<p>flagged</p>

<p>You know, I was just about to post something similar myself. He appears on all EU discussions with the same garbage each time.</p>

<p>Cameron seems to have become a second-rate Blair.</p>

<p>Blair was the master</p>

<p>Elsewhere it is claimed that farmers will receive fewer subsidies, if we leave.  Has it crossed their minds that they might get a fairer price for their produce?</p>

<p>Exactly. The ruination of our countryside is in part due to the CAP. Increasing field sizes and ripping down hedgerows.</p>

<p>the EU is subsidizing hedgerows actually, at our expense</p>

<p>And you as well don't forget .</p>

<p>&amp; you gramps</p>

<p>Set us free ... no chains and no straight-jacket - we'll never kow-tow to a European President.</p>

<p>how about a president of the world?</p>

<p>How about you stick your head down a toilet</p>

<p>barf barf</p>

<p>Winning the referendum is only the first stage of freeing ourselves from the utterly corrupt and anti democratic EU. SECOND, WE NEED TO GET RID OF CAMERON and get a pm and negotiating team who will get us the right deal.</p>

<p>What would be the point; we had an election 9 months ago, and the answer was Cameron in the absence of any credible opposition.</p>

<p>But we didn't actually vote for HIM did we?  It was his party.</p>

<p>huzzah</p>

<p>chicken madras</p>

<p>yum yum</p>

<p>run away !!!...peace at last</p>

<p>so cowardly kipper types, not much action on here eh</p>

<p>German chancellor Angela Merkel gave her support on Sunday (18 October) to a new start in EU-Turkey membership talks.</p>

<p>"How can we organise the accession process more dynamically?" Merkel asked, after talks in Istanbul with Turkey's prime minister Ahmed Davutoglu and president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>

<p>Bosnia will officially apply to join the European Union on 15 February, the country’s presidency said, marking a major milestone in the former Yugoslav republic’s integration with the European mainstream two decades after emerging from war.</p>

<p>VOTE IN KIPPEURS</p>

<p>Quisling Dave is the boil that needs lancing. </p>

<p>What did my great uncles fight for in WW2? Why did one lose a leg at Dunkirk and another face a POW camp in Eastern Europe? They fought so we could be an independant nation. Not governed by a bunch of arrogant Eurolanders. Ignore the Quisling cowards below and vote OUT</p>

<p>My Great Uncle Stan was killed at Dunkirk.</p>

<p>He was never the same again after that.</p>

<p>the celestial woof</p>

<p>Lost the argument, finally?</p>

<p>You can't lose something you never had ;-)</p>

<p>you can shut it too</p>

<p>It seems another village has just lost its idiot.</p>

<p>The EU's center offered what key political insights in the last few hundred years?</p>

<p>I remember.</p>

<p>The Reign of Terror   .   .   .   Communism   .   .   .   The Third Reich</p>

<p>Portugal under dictatorship produces Barrosso.  Spain under Franco.  Germany under the Kaiser and then Hitler. France under Petain turning 80,000 of their Jews over to Hitler.  Yes the EU has a great heritage and models itself on Babel.  May it die and die swiftly.</p>

<p>And Fascism, Vichy, Quisling.........so progressive.</p>

<p>are you 100 years old then</p>

<p>He can read, unlike some people.</p>

<p>Those who ignore history are bound to repeat it.</p>

<p>that is exactly what the EU is trying to avoid</p>

<p>Er, I think you'll find they are making exactly the same mistakes as the USSR did, for example by ignoring the wishes of their citizens.</p>

<p>And they will build wonderful autobahns!</p>

<p>Like on the one on a tiny Pacific Island, which is used by about 100 cars?</p>

<p>indded . better than we can build</p>

<p>another clegg</p>

<p>You really didn't understand, did you.</p>

<p>yes</p>

<p>Best to ignore the 5th columnist trolls as are being encouraged to disrupt the message board - just ignore them and put the breX-it case across with a clear narrative as is vital if we are to get the message across for breX-it and achieve freedom for the UK ?</p>

<p>If we vote to stay in Merkle, Junker, Tusk and all the rest will be able to impose anything they like knowing we are led by a bunch of gutless, weak-kneed politicians who bend at the slightest puff.</p>

<p>you are a slight puff</p>

<p>Pathetic</p>

<p>better than your effort</p>

<p>No. No one sane would support the EU. It is an awful organisation of fascist communists.</p>

<p>Time for your medication........</p>

<p>El Presidente del Mundo :</p>

<p>A couple of thoughts occur to me.</p>

<p>01. Anyone who calls himself the President of the World is:</p>

<p>       a. Not in possession of the full facts<br/>       b. Not in possession of his full faculties<br/>       c. Something of a Walter Mitty fantasist<br/>       d. Unlikely to have any profound political insights</p>

<p>02. Anyone who, in debating a serious and future-changing event such as the forthcoming yet-to-be-rigged-but-we're-working-on-it-as-fast-as-we-can EU referendum can state only "VOTE IN YOU D...HEADS" pretty much conclusively makes the case that I am completely and utterly correct at point 01 above.</p>

<p>Out of your own mouth you condemn yourself as an immature troll, probably not more than about eleven years old and possibly less than that in terms of emotional and intellectual development.</p>

<p>I enjoyed describing you to yourself but I shall ignore any reply to this post on the grounds that you don't know how to use big words and are certainly incapable of expressing any thoughts more sophisticated than the ones you have so far chosen to share with us.</p>

<p>It was delightful but the grown-ups really have humoured you enough for one night and, now, it really is time you kissed Mummy goodnight and took yourself off to bed. School again on Monday so you will need all the sleep you can get.</p>

<p>And</p>

<p>e. not in possession of his marbles.</p>

<p>Which we've all known for some time.</p>

<p>i WILL GIVE YOU FULL MARKS ON MONDAY</p>

<p>No chance.</p>

<p>bark bark</p>

<p>Yep. You are barking.</p>

<p>It's the drink. Usually.</p>

<p>Really, Mr Cameron. It's one thing calling people 'fruitcakes' and such like, but that's rather rude and dictatorial, isn't it?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Fine, as long as I can decide who rules me. I don't have that choice with the EU.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>The point, El Presidente del Uded, is that I can boot out the current rulers and replace them with someone more to my liking. I can't do that with the EU.</p>

<p>why bother. sit back &amp; relax. take it easy. let the EU take the strain</p>

<p>I knew it. You're on benefits.  Or the EU gravy train.  No wonder you are so keen on it.</p>

<p>That reminds me of another problem: the Brussels Gravy Train:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/eu/12144060/EU-Force-One-Juncker-commutes-to-Strasbourg-by-private-jet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>Still, looks like its about to hit the buffers shortly - or should that be 'buffets'?</p>

<p>Internet idiot.</p>

<p>And that will be Cameron's final entreaty to us all.</p>

<p>it;s the only way he can get through</p>

<p>He might need some more factual evidence to support his proposition.</p>

<p>And did you read Jacob Rees-Mogg's thoughts entitled Nothing Britain does can stop the EU monster from swallowing all in its path, Simon ?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12142236/Nothing-Britain-does-can-stop-the-EU-monster-from-swallowing-all-in-its-path.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>We shall most surely be on the road to ruin if our People do not see the light and vote to leave the EU.</p>

<p>Another Islamic terrorist atrocity, this time in the UK, should do the trick. Except some desperate Remainers will probably claim it was a 'false flag' operation.</p>

<p>There's a distinct smell of drink on here.</p>

<p>Vote leave.</p>

<p>Vote leave Britain.<br/>That is all that will save you.</p>

<p>you 're the only one in the room</p>

<p>And 30 million other people. It's a big room.</p>

<p>Vituperative guff from a splenic scribbler. The dream of independence; the dream of Great Britain and the arrogance of an anachronistic past.<br/>The success and power of the Empire, the sense of self-driven and self-directed autonomy is GONE FOR GOOD. Not even the USA, a real country, not the tinpot inconsequentiality that is modern Britain can do that!!!</p>

<p>Defeatist Quisling.</p>

<p>Pardon?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>So you're not British, then?</p>

<p>Lovely stuff Simon, give it to 'em with both barrels.</p>

<p>Let's see the rest of the MSM pick this up and run with it.</p>

<p>Except the stupid, charter-breaching BBC, anyway.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>No, time you did. Leave.</p>

<p>We will leave the EU. Question is will it slaughter tens of thousands or tens of millions? With crazed fascist communists it's just statistics.</p>

<p>As you are the President of the World have you nothing better to do?</p>

<p>Ever since he got promoted from being President of Clacton there's been no living with him.</p>

<p>my latest pronouncement is....<br/>kippers you will lose<br/>pres. decree no. 333</p>

<p>Lucky you're really just a c*nt and not a Presidente then.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Your ego is impresive. Your character less so. That bridge you bought? I sold it to you. Run along now.</p>

<p>The DT readers posting comments on here about the EU are very much like the Corbynists.<br/>Loud, fixed view, dedicated and on the losing side.<br/>But after they have lost the vote will they shut up about it?</p>

<p>Which "side" do you suppose to be the winning one?</p>

<p>The British people will chose.<br/>If they chose to leave then well and good but if they chose to stay will you respect the sovereign rights of the British people?</p>

<p>What 'sovereign rights'? Even Cameron has finally admitted that the British people have given up their sovereignty.</p>

<p>There isn't one!<br/>Britoland is done for. <br/>Either way, indebted, ill-educated, de-industrialised, muslimised, socialist, over-crowded, rubbish infrastructure, dreadful state 'education' and a murderous healthcare 'system'.<br/>Anyone with any brain at all leaves or has left.</p>

<p>The usual abuse from a fearful EUphile with no arguments to back up his demands.</p>

<p>Go away you silly little person.</p>

<p>You have Terry Thomas as your pic a cad if ever there was one.</p>

<p>There is not any abuse at all.<br/>And don't tell me to get away'<br/>My family go back a thousand years in this Island and I'm 6 ft 6 tall and 22 stones.</p>

<p>That's way overweight.  You should eat less.</p>

<p>Corbynists.<br/>Why do you think you can shout down people who have a perfect right to air their views?</p>

<p>Corbynist? Only about 180 degrees and three light years wrong.</p>

<p>If you spent more time reading up on stuff and less time with the fridge light on you might benefit.</p>

<p>Er, isn't that what you said in your original post? I believe that makes you a hypocrite.</p>

<p>Er no.<br/>Consistant.</p>

<p>What? Consistently hypocritical?</p>

<p>You can't say that. It's non-PC and fattist.</p>

<p>Sorry, but I hate fat b*st*rds, especially those with attitude.  Can't even manage their own self-discipline, telling us how to lead our lives.</p>

<p>Don't be sorry for your irrational hate.<br/>I don't give a damn how you live your life.<br/>When the result is announced will you respect the sovereign will of the British people whichever way the chose?</p>

<p>I won't give a monkeys.  I'll have done all I can to get the facts out there.  More than half of the country is younger than I am so they'll have to live with whatever they decide long after I'm gone.</p>

<p>Were you alive in the war?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Not really an old git then.<br/>More of a nipper.</p>

<p>My kids have been calling me an old git since I was 40.  Simple choice of moniker, means nothing.</p>

<p>Blobby, blobby, blobby!</p>

<p>I was a tight head prop.<br/>What position did you play?</p>

<p>Which team did you play for? Was it a pub team? Maybe that explains why you're obese.</p>

<p>I played for my school and my college.<br/>My muscles are well toned.<br/>I boxed for a few years. <br/>I was born in WW2 so a bit old for you to be throwing insults at.<br/>Why do you do it?<br/>You appear to have a lot of hate inside you.</p>

<p>If you're in your 70's, how can you still be so uninformed as to favour staying in the EU?</p>

<p>I lived when the only thing that saved me from rickets was the school milk we got.<br/>Our people were dressed in rags and no one owned a car within half a mile.<br/>We had nothing.<br/>The prosperity of this country is staggering by comparison.<br/>Also we are not governed by elected MPs.<br/>It's an illusion.<br/>We are governed by the tens of thousands of civil servants in Whitehall.<br/>If they don't like some legislation passed in Westminster they water it down, delay it or just ignore it.<br/>They are the real masters and I don't like being ruled by unelected faceless bureaucrats that perpetuate the class system in my country.<br/>I prefer to be ruled by unelected faceless bureaucrats in Brussels because they don't perpetuate the totally corrupt UK honours system and unfair class system that curses our nation.</p>

<p>Good Lord.  I'm just a couple of years younger than you, but I have to say that you have a most peculiar and distorted view of life.  I wonder why?</p>

<p>Me and Mrs Thatcher both.<br/>She said exactly what I am saying.<br/>She fought the civil service tooth and nail and lost.</p>

<p>Maybe, but the bit I don't get is your believing that somehow Brussels bureaucracy is preferable to ours.  No matter.</p>

<p>Your muscles are well toned? How do you know when they're obscured by rolls of fat?</p>

<p>If you're going to claim to be big and hard on the Internet, expect to be mocked for it.</p>

<p>Where do you get the hate from son?</p>

<p>Are you looking to buy some?</p>

<p>I really feel sorry for you.<br/>You must have had a hell of a life.<br/>Take care.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone to feel sorry for, take a look in the mirror.</p>

<p>That's right prove your point by shouting and insults.<br/>You're obviously not British are you.</p>

<p>I would say 'jog on' but roll on seems more appropriate.</p>

<p>Will you respect the sovereign rights of the British people whichever way they chose?</p>

<p>As I said above, what 'sovereign rights'? The UK Government signed them away in 1972.</p>

<p>Big girl, eh?</p>

<p>And?</p>

<p>Fond of blouses. ;-)</p>

<p>As I said Corbynists.<br/>Or the other lot in Scotland that think Braveheart is a documentary.</p>

<p> Worst of it is Dave is going to try to manipulate us to guarantee we stay in even if he has to Lutfur Rahman the vote.</p>

<p>In spite of Despot Dave's lies, broken promises and bullying, Brexit it looking more likely with each day that passed.</p>

<p>The next thing we need to see is a big beast coming to unite and rally the OUT camp.</p>

<p>i very much doubt it. when it comes to the crunch i think that most people will stick with what they are used to rather than taking a giant leap into the unknown.</p>

<p>For the n'th time, there is no such thing a the 'status quo' when it comes to the EU. That's like suggesting a drowning man wouldn't grab hold of a lifeline thrown to him because he's used to being in water and slowly sinking.</p>

<p>most people have never known a time when we werent in the EU. that is what they are used to whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean that they won't wake up one day and say "The EU has lost the plot, we must get out ASAP".</p>

<p>Businesses are now taking seriously the possibility of an OUT.</p>

<p>So are the bookies - odds have shortened considerably recently and they are still shortening.</p>

<p>Staying in is as much a leap in the dark as leaving. Europe is undergoing some seismic political and demographic changes right now.</p>

<p>Especially if one is female.</p>

<p>once camerons slick PR machine gets running the leave campaign will start to lose ground.</p>

<p>Hmmmm ...the public may not be taken in so easily by a "slick PR machine".</p>

<p>We'll just have to see.</p>

<p>fraid not . methinks you will lose. sorry ol' kipper</p>

<p>Thanks Mr Juncker . Can I have a spin in your private jet someme .</p>

<p>anytime bruv</p>

<p>It doesn't really matter what you think. What matters is how the vote goes - and you have no clue how that will play out.</p>

<p>if you wish it, it shall be true</p>

<p>If I wish what?</p>

<p>Nope. I am in Sweden. I live here. Nice little town by the coast - with a rather embarrassing name.</p>

<p>with rampant canine abuse.</p>

<p>Rampant canine self-abuse.</p>

<p>We're into bonios.</p>

<p>Ok</p>

<p>Yes ... keep the breX-it narrative clear.</p>

<p>Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty of European Union, in December 2009. This (Art.6(2)) makes it a treaty obligation  that the EU “shall accede to the ECHR”.</p>

<p>This means that the UK is bound to loss of our sovereignty forever and a day while the UK remains an EU member state - as Treaty change is now impossible.</p>

<p>The EU may well 'accede to the ECHR', but it isn't actually signed up to it. I wonder why? Is it because it isn't actually a Country or a State - yet.</p>

<p>Are you being serious? It's there in black and white and it is binding on all EU member states.</p>

<p>Sorry, I mean the EC. Oh, hang on, the EU as an organisation isn't either. As you say, it is mandatory for EU <u>member states</u> to be a signatory to the ECHR.</p>

<p>Never mentioned the word mandatory ... but it is implied and it is fully binding and it is very damaging to the UK and as owing to the the devious and malevolent way in which the clause has been written.<br/>Its there in black and white.</p>

<p>Not in spite of, precisely because of.</p>

<p>He's Brexit's greatest tool.</p>

<p>And he's not just a big tool because of that.</p>

<p>That's the way, Simon. Confront your deepest fears. Well done.</p>

<p>Where shall we be in a hundred days from now?<br/>Where shall we be in a hundred days from now?<br/>Traitors votel in and patriots vote out<br/>Woa-oh-oh-oh<br/>Where shall we be in a hundred days from now?</p>

<p>What is less trustworthy than a PR Consultant turned PM?</p>

<p>A Labour leader who turns his back on years of opposition to foreign rule.</p>

<p>A labour leader that originally had promised a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and then sneaked in to an empty auditorium, after everyone else including the media had gone home ... to sign the wretched Treaty ?</p>

<p>I though he signed it in a broom cupboard?</p>

<p>Probably a commodities broker.  The Swiss Tony of British politics.</p>

<p>It's the original village idiot again .</p>

<p>No.  No idea who you might mean.</p>

<p>Do you farage to Farage?</p>

<p>Better give him the link. ;-)</p>

<p>Mr. Farage, I can assure you, is a man of his word.  He is totally unlike your leader.</p>

<p>Once you accept that Corbyn is a raving lunatic and always has been, anything is possible.</p>

<p>I do not believe he is.  I think he is misguided on a number of issues and on this issue he has made a catastrophic error.</p>

<p>Great thing about the far-right in this country, couldn't organise a p1$$-up in a brewery:</p>

<p><a href="http://politicalscrapbook.net/2016/02/pegida-uk-march-branded-an-embarassment-by-own-supporters-after-just-127-turn-up/" rel="nofollow">http://politicalscrapbook.net/...</a></p>

<p>Far right of what? Stalin? Pol Pot? Mao?</p>

<p>Hey,<br/>This has to be one of the most irresponsible headline and article I have read about the EU referendum, people seem to have forgotten what happened the last time the conservative party imploded over Europe. The Labour party were in power for 13 years and nearly destroyed the country.</p>

<p>Do people really want to take the risk of handing the country over to Labour, with Corbin and McDowell?</p>

<p>Seems you can't win with some eurosceptics, not only do they have the chance to vote for it but they might actually win.</p>

<p>If they decide to come together properly ....</p>

<p>Perhaps you could just explain how the way people might vote in a referendum this year or possibly next will affect the outcome of a GE in 2020.</p>

<p>If you vote to stay in there may very well not BE a GE in 2020.</p>

<p>I'm an Outer through and through.  We'll win and we'll survive.</p>

<p>Survive and be able to look oneself in the mirror unlike these subterranean rock crawling treasonous cadavers.</p>

<p>Personally, I'd rather take the chance that a democratically elected Labour Government enacted some policies that I didn't like than end up with the anti-democratic EU governing the country in perpetuity.</p>

<p>We could vote out a Labour Government after 5 years and repeal their bad laws.</p>

<p>We can't do anything about the EU ......... it's unelected, unaccountable and completely immune from democratic control.</p>

<p>If Cameron is so determined that we remain then I hope he bolsters our security services and recruits hundreds of more police officers to deal with sexual offences. Aside of course from vastly expanding all of other public services to deal with the influx.</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen - we have finally dragged those who think they know what they are talking about into the ring with regard to what is oft referred to as Subsidiarity.</p>

<p>So, I invite  you to follow this post and its replies, make your own mind up.</p>

<p>So, you do like it up you. I suspected you and maillbiter had something in common.</p>

<p>That hot cocoa has got to you again, try something more soothing like Horlicks.</p>

<p>Is that what you and mailbiter drink?</p>

<p>A little further above, he is quote the document that I gave <i>him</i>!</p>

<p>And yet he still cannot understand it.</p>

<p>Actually I didn't, you quoted an extract provided by Ed Milliband from the original I provided - now instead of wriggling down below - up you pop and debate the content of what I have provided.</p>

<p>It is the text from the treaty, man!</p>

<p>You ran away.</p>

<p>I never went anywhere - man!</p>

<p>I am still here but instead of debating the lower level detail contained within the protocol I have gently and albeit frustratingly 'guided' you to where you should have started the debate from and that is : ARTICLE 5 - then and only then should the protocols contained within be debated.</p>

<p>Horse and cart and all that.</p>

<p>Best to ignore them.</p>

<p>So many unsubstantiated opinions, so many headline only knowledge of the issue - is there anyone, just one, on the side of those who support remaining - who ACTUALLY know the detail of what it is they are supporting.</p>

<p>@Mailbiter for one - certainly does not!</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Mailbiter, after our little bit of new-found rapport a couple of nights ago I hesitate to confront you as I have many times in the past, but the fact is that you admitted that you'd vote to stay in the EU because of the impact leaving would have on your business.  You added that how your heart felt was another matter and I respect that.</p>

<p>I have to say though that if I found such a conflict between my business interests and the future of my country and my grandchildren, I'd find another job.  I certainly wouldn't be on here prostituting myself against my inner beliefs.</p>

<p>Hi Oldgit.</p>

<p>I don't deny any of that.</p>

<p>But I do think that what is good for my business, is good for <i>all</i> businesses and therefore good for the country.</p>

<p>Having said that, my preference would be for the EU to deal purely with economic issues, and to leave political and social matters to the Council of Europe (which is, after all, what it was founded to do).</p>

<p>But it won't M.  We know that.  You might just as well wish for Santa Claus to be real.</p>

<p>It's entirely speculative whether what is good for your business is good for all businesses.  I know for a fact that it will make no difference whatsoever for the business for which I work or any of the businesses with which we deal, because none of them have anything to do with EU countries.</p>

<p>Even if it did make a difference to businesses, that's small beer compared to the damage it's doing to the cohesion of society.  As I said, if you have grandchildren then put their future first.</p>

<p>Making new friends again, Bunsen?</p>

<p>Not many additions to my Christmas card list so far.</p>

<p>Ah well...time yet, it's only February.<br/>So we should vote IN, you think?</p>

<p>Back later. But I will give an honest answer. TTFN</p>

<p>So, slowly but surely you are dragged to the centre of gravity.</p>

<p>Article V.</p>

<p>I gave you the document from the HoC Library. But you ran away.</p>

<p>I don't know if you are UKIP or BNP, but you seem to be typically on transmit, but not on receive.</p>

<p>Yes, we know. The Internet brought you (pillowbiter), SmokedBinDipper2015, and tedsanitrytowel together!</p>

<p>I just did that one. Do try to be original.</p>

<p>What did you just do?</p>

<p>Well we gave him his time to negotiate and we gave him the benefit of the doubt. In trying to now tell us, the British public, that he has secured a great deal for Brtain, David Cameron treats us with contempt. How naive, gullible or stupid does he really think we are? What rubbish.</p>

<p>We will never extract a worthwhile deal from Brussels and they will never change. The powers to be in the EU are hell bent on creating a socialist super state on the continent. They treat us with contempt particularly as we repeatedly prove them wrong. Wrong on enlargement, wrong on Shengen, wrong on the Euro.</p>

<p>Let's leave that socialist rabble to their own devises and get out before they drag us down with them. </p>

<p>This referendum vote is at least as much about the blue collar workers/ patriots and those  white collar  Labour voting strivers as it is about a divided Tory party. <br/>The former large  groups  are even more determined to vote for less  immigration  and more  self government that will  mean tight border controls and laws being made only here.  <br/>Add the bankable 4miilion  who have just voted UKIP and the now  alienated  ' small c'  Conservative Party activists and the numbers in favour of " leave" are overwhelming. <br/>Come July, there are going to be a lot of very miffed and worried  back-sliding Conservative ministers.</p>

<p>Even if In wins the vote this time Brexit is not going away. Pressure will be keep on building until the country votes Out.</p>

<p>If Brexit is achieved, those Politicians who claimed that Britain would fall apart as a result should not be voted back into office.  They have already declared their inability to govern the Country.</p>

<p>They should hang!</p>

<p>Early in its history, Bilderbergers decided “to create an <br/>‘Aristocracy of purpose’ between Europe and the United States (to reach <br/>consensus to rule the world on matters of) policy, economics, and <br/>(overall) strategy.” NATO was essential for their plans – to ensure <br/>“perpetual war (and) nuclear blackmail” to be used as necessary. Then <br/>proceed to loot the planet, achieve fabulous wealth and power, and crush<br/> all challengers to keep it.</p>

<p>Along with military dominance, controlling the world’s money is <br/>crucial for with it comes absolute control as the powerful 19th century <br/>Rothschild family understood. As the patriarch Amschel Rothschild once <br/>said: “Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes its <br/>laws.”</p>

<p>who are these bilderbergers? please give us some names.</p>

<p>Blair , Cameron , Heseltine , Major , Clarke , Obama , Clintons  ,need I go on ,,,,</p>

<p>according to wiki those who attend bilderberg conferences come from all walks of society, all classes of society, and all political persuasions. they are there to contribute their expertise to make the world a better place. they are certainly not out to rule the world.</p>

<p>You forgot Mandelscum.</p>

<p>Osborne who was there before Cameron and got Cameron to be the BB's new Puppet after Blair.</p>

<p>Just one or is it two or maybe three questions, if Cameron says the 'agreement' is permanent while the EU suggests otherwise with the almost impossible 55% minimum EU states agreement to apply any er, er emergency brake.</p>

<p>But to throw the whole shebang into further confusion Cameron claims the changes/agreement are to be lodged with the UN thus making the negotiations irreversible in international law. And yet now &amp; just to make our confusion complete the UK government announced yesterday the UN legal panel that suggested Assange had been arbitrarily detained had no legal force in the UK......its quandary Jim, but not as we know it.</p>

<p>With a slimy, lying jerk as the PM it is difficult to see how anything other than open rebellion could alter the ruinous march of folly on which we are embarked.</p>

<p><b>EU ‘out’ campaign surges to record lead - <br/>Nine-point gap as voters reject referendum deal</b></p>

<p>:-D</p>

<p>The lead is 12 per cent when you discount the don't knows (don't knows don't vote)</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Ha ha . Did you leave school at 13 .</p>

<p>127 too many.</p>

<p>Smoke Kipper embarrassed by his shouted spelling mistake.</p>

<p>And your point is what. Of course nobody in the UK supports these thugs.</p>

<p>I'd like to see Simon Heffer's views on this:-</p>

<p>Article 6 of the Lisbon Treaty of European Union, in December 2009. This (Art.6(2))<br/>makes it a treaty obligation  that the EU “shall accede to the ECHR”.</p>

<p>This means that the UK can never be sovereign while it remains as an EU member state - this appears to have been so far over-looked by the media and OUT campaigners?</p>

<p>I would like to see constructive comments on this please?</p>

<p>Simon spoke in Manchester last night at the GO (Grassroots Out) meeting, 2,300 people attended. He is the second speaker in after the introductions. I think you will agree with his excellent speech.</p>

<p><a href="http://livestream.com/accounts/16851580/events/4782876" rel="nofollow">http://livestream.com/accounts...</a></p>

<p>The Tory party were one of the driving forces behind the ECHR in the first place.</p>

<p>Constructive comment: read some history before commenting.</p>

<p>You call that a constructive comment?</p>

<p>Good-bye ... (hint, hint)</p>

<p>The ECHR and the EU are two separate (although sympathetic) organisations. The UK can leave the ECHR without leaving the EU. We won't, though.</p>

<p>The ECHR, EU and ECJ are like the Trinity ........ separate but one.</p>

<p>You call that a constructive comment?</p>

<p>Article 6 (2) binds the UK to loss of sovereignty ... forever and a day and Treaty change on that, will never happen.</p>

<p>I take it you do not wish to continue our debate below - why is that I wonder?</p>

<p>Because you're boring?</p>

<p>Man alive, he sure is.</p>

<p>Eh? I answered you. Care to address the point I made here? No? Why is that, I wonder.</p>

<p>When we end up staying is Europe, which we will, Heffer and the rest of the right wing whingers will still not be satsfied . Heffer , along with most Tory MPs can' t stand anyone outside of Kensington and Chelsea. They get very good money for writing endless articles about how bad Europe is.</p>

<p>Odd, given that he lives in the constituency of Saffron Walden.</p>

<p>Huh we are in Europe and always will be. It's out of the EU that I want. Do you not understand the difference?</p>

<p>im not sure this is about right or left wing. I think there is many people from different ends of the spectrum that want sovereignty and democracy and believe that it is ebbing away staying in Europe.</p>

<p>The day that the president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said "there can be no democratic choice against the European treaties", was the day every voting citizen in the EC was betrayed</p>

<p>The latest polls show Leave now has a healthy lead.</p>

<p>Today's political class don't want to lead the country, they see the role of Prime Minister as that of being a middle manager, within a larger global structure. They are inadequate and rather than concede the point, they wish to trick you into believing that their approach is correct, that the alternative is too scary to contemplate.</p>

<p>Pink poncy Pig.</p>

<p>Heffer or Cameron?</p>

<p>Cameron</p>

<p>Speak for England Simon!<br/>Cameron is a disgrace and his ministers will be long-remembered as a cabal of cowards if they continue to conspire in this deceit.</p>

<p>Someone may have commented before but Simon asks, <i>"Would he really sack perhaps a quarter of the payroll if they did?"</i> Revolt that is. The problem is that the majority of the current, so-called, Conservative Party are too frit to conserve a jam sandwich.</p>

<p>There is no <b>charismatic</b> politician amongst the current breed of troughing, self-serving, bunch of politicos who has the balls to stand up for <i>our country</i> and say it like it is - we want OUT of the EU.</p>

<p>To stay in, is to become a sub-serviant state, or region in the 'Democratic' Republic of the United States of Europe with no say over Federal Policy, decided in Brussels by a bunch of unelected 'Commissioners' with nary a word of consultation, let alone a vote, as to what is right or wrong.</p>

<p>Funny that - Commissioners, as a word is very close - in etymological terms to the Russian word 'Commissar'. What conclusion may we draw from that?</p>

<p>For those who have not seen the Manchester event of <b><b>Grassroots Out</b></b> here is a link:</p>

<p>It lasts nearly two hours so settle down with your popcorn and enjoy.</p>

<p>Note how united the representatives of the three largest UK political parties are.</p>

<p>Which campaign is your money on to get the official designation?</p>

<p>David Cameron is leading the Leave campaign. A rather fine job he is doing, too.</p>

<p>Do you have a point to make?</p>

<p>I'd guess that he's trying to make the point that Brexit doesn't have a charismatic leader, not the we need one. Meanwhile the BSE crowd have that bloke from M&amp;S and flip-flop dave.</p>

<p>Leave has Nigel Farage, Kate Hoey, David Davis... Who needs anyone else?</p>

<p>The EU interferes with every aspect of our lives and ordinary decent people need to send a strong message to those feeble politicians and business leaders as will trap the UK in a Roman-nazi, centralised EU empire as is set to become much a more corrupt, crime ridden and bankrupt super-state, with its own army (to which the UK will be the 2nd main financial backer), open door immigration within its borders and with the ROtW and as to have a FIFA style president to go with it.</p>

<p>A vote to stay in the UK will kill everything that is still good about the UK.</p>

<p>Only breX-it as an X in it for me!</p>

<p>NB<br/>I don't respond to anyone making any kind of offensive comments - they must wallow in their own self inflicted ignorance.</p>

<p>Thank You!</p>

<p>i hope nurse come to help you soon, the medicine is clearly a bit to strong for you.</p>

<p>He is one of the Telegraph readers Heffer claims to talk to....</p>

<p>i believe there is a good chance that cameron will get an opt out from ever closer union.<br/>EU leaders recognise that britain is not committed to the european project in the same way as the rest of europe. they understand that the british people do not want to become part of a federal superstate. so rather than forcing us into more integration which will only cause further resentment and antagonism they are likely to be conciliatory and less dogmatic.</p>

<p>Dream on, buster. If your IN, you're part of 'Ever Closer Union'. No ifs or buts, the Commission's word is law.</p>

<p>The Commission's word is not law.</p>

<p>Legislative power resides in the European Parliament.</p>

<p>The European Parliament has no power to introduce legislation, it is merely a rubber stamp for the Commission.</p>

<p>There really are suckers born every minute if you truly believe the comment you posted.</p>

<p>not if there is an opt out - buster!</p>

<p>...and you really believe that the EU will honour an 'opt-out'?</p>

<p>Still, keep on with your Ostrich political view. The trouble with that point of view though, is that you are in a good position to be shafted.</p>

<p>Why haven`t they told us, and demonstrated to us, before then? They`ve had at least 40yrs to make that clear!<br/>Why did they ask us to sign Maastricht?</p>

<p>probably because it is only in recent times that the strength of anti-federal sentiment in britain has become apparent.</p>

<p>With all due respect, that is quite an incorrect assessment of the views of certain members of the EU - who most definitely do not see a European Superstate as their endstate.</p>

<p>with all due respect that is what the european project is all about - and has been from day one.</p>

<p>Agreed - but there are more than just the UK who have no intention of being dragged into it.</p>

<p>as i said earlier i think it is likely that the EU will eventually reform into a two tier structure. those countries that wish to integrate further will do so while countries like britain will opt out but remain in the single market.</p>

<p>You can believe what you want but the EU is committed to ever closer union. If we remain any opt outs will quickly be ripped up and we will be dragged further into the mire.</p>

<p>is this so? evidence please rather than flag waving.</p>

<p>Google 'EU founding fathers' or similar. The intention of closer union is all there in their words, not mine.</p>

<p>Funny how they accuse those in favour staying in of scaremongering.</p>

<p>the opt out would be binding just as the euro opt out is binding.</p>

<p>What do you think "ever closer union" means? It is a complete smokescreen. It has nothing to do with uniting nations. In fact, the treaty specifically protects subsidiarity.</p>

<p>You would make a formidable Commissar.</p>

<p>Subsidiarity within a unified totalitarian state IS NOT wanted.</p>

<p>That's not what is written in the treaty, though.</p>

<p>We both know that that is EXACTLY what is meant within the treaty.</p>

<p>But the treaty says the opposite. How can you interpret it 180 degrees off course?</p>

<p>Ok - let us explore that thought...</p>

<p>Provide the chapter and verse within the treaty that supports your view and I will refute it.</p>

<p>"an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."</p>

<p>Just to ensure we are on the same page - you wish to debate the provisions of Protocol No.2? Yes?</p>

<p>Let's deal with the text from the Lisbon Treaty (my post above) that you said you were going to refute.</p>

<p>The Lisbon Treaty!???</p>

<p>You REALLY have no idea of what you are talking about whatsoever do you?</p>

<p>Here's an appropriately simplified version for you:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228848/7310.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/government/...</a></p>

<p>You know as well as anyone what the end game is regarding the EU - a European federal superstate. Subsidiarity is strictly temporary and is therefore meaningless.</p>

<p>So say you. The treaty says something else.</p>

<p>You're very trusting. The EU has a long and dishonerable record of conning its citizens into getting what it wants.</p>

<p>Well, it is in the treaty, and that makes it law. If you want to disregard that, then that is up to you.</p>

<p>It matters not a jot to DC and his ilk what happens in the EU referendum for he and they will continue to enjoy a lifetime of well paid sinecures and speechifying that will allow them to continue living a lifestyle that they majority can never even dream about.</p>

<p>They will be handsomely rewarded for the part they are playing in the EU charade,</p>

<p>Handsomely!</p>

<p>Funny how you never give about sinecures and speeches that the Tory Party are beneficiary of due to the Westminster system.</p>

<p>It's almost as if it's one rule for Britons and another for Johnny Foreigner.</p>

<p>I hope all you keyboard warriors are signed up to campaign for LEAVE.  We need boots on the ground;  delivering leaflets;  manning street stalls;  canvassing.</p>

<p>Volunteer ....... your country needs you.</p>

<p>Flagged as a racist comment</p>

<p>I'm not really feeling or noticing the benefits of benefits of being in the EU, so if I can't feel or notice them, and a lot of other people can't either, then I suppose we will vote to come out.</p>

<p>keep taking the lotion, it makes you very eloquent.</p>

<p>Troll bizarre-grammar, weird-point, half-*rse has spoken!</p>

<p>THE most insightful comment DC has ever let slip in his political career happened two days ago.</p>

<p>Ignore those who selected you.</p>

<p>Ignore those who elected you.</p>

<p>Ignore those who expect of you.</p>

<p>DO AS I SAY!!!</p>

<p>David Dipstick Camera on has overstepped the mark, by effectively ignoring the voters to pursue his own aims, he has shown himself to be unfit for purpose.<br/>Now it became a simple job to get rid of Maggie, Haigh, IDS etc using a formula that they hold in Tory HQ so invoke it on this plonker quickly. The Government is safe for quite a few years so do it now, and we can actually get a leader we can trust to represent us</p>

<p>Why should the opinions of someone who refers to "Haigh" be of any concern?  If you can't be bothered to learn how to spell some of our most prominent politician's names, you clearly don't pay much attention to anything.</p>

<p>Every day I read comments and see responses that either disagree or take a totally counterpoint, and I think, now there is the start of an intelligent debate. Some days I make comments and likewise receive either counterpoint or disagreement. Today I got a Troll with a limited ability to say anything sensible, so it's just as well I don't intend responding beyond this, preferring instead to do something far more inspiring and watch the England Scotland match again in the hope that Marlinspike 2014 is a porridge wog!!</p>

<p>The one and ONLY thing that will determine the outcome of this problem is how YOU will vote.</p>

<p>What DC thinks or says is irrelevant.</p>

<p>What any individual in any party thinks or says is irrelevant.</p>

<p>What any individual in any part of the EU thinks or says is irrelevant.</p>

<p>What anyone of the establishment or celebrity world thinks or say is irrelevant.</p>

<p>YOU have the power to determine whether the next generation of this nation are able to enjoy a Free, Democratic and Sovereign life.</p>

<p>YOU!</p>

<p>You are not a fool at all. You are an aware person who has woken up before it is too late. </p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>The Tory Cabinet aspirants so often full of wind must now see the way the wind blows, the assumption that the fight culminated sometime in 2019 for the leadership is not as certain now, if the UK does vote to leave then the local Tory parties &amp; activists will remember well those who refused to throw their hat into the ring until such time as the work was done, rather than lead the voters.....thus no leader at all.</p>

<p>The Gove's, May's &amp; IDS's of this world had better make their position known PDQ as any wish to further their career will most definitely rely on the Tory voters wish to exit the EU.</p>

<p>Cameron is a spent force no matter the outcome of the referendum, his lack of any intention to demand real changes for the UK, his approach to the whole fiasco is best described by the great rugby/sports commentator Bill McLaren as shilly shallying, but the real truth is that he has shown a contempt of the UK &amp; its people, not just in the deception of the UK voters, but contemptuous of their intellect to grasp just what he was actually 'up to'.......whatever the result Cameron must go, he has let down both pro &amp; anti, the pro by not using the present economic situation  in the EU to bring about greater advantages for the UK, while the anti EU knew he'd give it all away with his disingenuous negotiations/demands...those anti EU Cabinet Ministers should say as such, that is if they want to replace the soon to be gone PM.</p>

<p>Who is 'everyone' !<br/>I</p>

<p>Has our PM not have any pride?!<br/>He is representing our country and all he is doing kissing a-ses. It humiliating to watch.<br/>He would gain much more respect if he turns around and comes back home and says enough is enough, and I may have been wrong to want to stay in the EU. I will lead an exit for Britain and will start making overtures to countries outside of Europe for trade agreements and co-operation</p>

<p>I know, I know, I am a fool to even think he would do this.</p>

<p>Nice thought, but you are correct in your summary of yourself.</p>

<p>Yes you are right. I am having a G&amp;T at the moment. I do not think I will have another one as I will get depressed.</p>

<p>So am I :-)</p>

<p>He will return from the EU summit in two weeks clutching a little bit of paper to wave at us.</p>

<p>Given the very short list he took with him that Shultz &amp; Co have shortened further......'little bit of paper' could well be over-exaggeration.</p>

<p>Postage stamp?</p>

<p>Not to sure of that, Cameron has certainly not pushed the envelope.</p>

<p>Everyone is staying IN</p>

<p>This is seriously boring trolling. Go away and grow up..</p>

<p>If the vote is IN there will be a surge of people leaving the UK for lands outside the EU.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>When we vote to stay Juncker will know he has Cameron by the balls.</p>

<p>Hence Cameron will bail out, collect his peerage and set about making himself seriously rich, a la Blair.</p>

<p>He will need the wherewithal to pay his son's school fees won't he?</p>

<p>Vote Leave to get another vote on a slightly amended relationship in November.</p>

<p>Hilary Benn is voting IN</p>

<p>His old dad would turn in his grave......Hilary is also MP for Leeds Central Islington....its an optional thing, he like to keep them open.</p>

<p>His dad was a penis though.</p>

<p>So what?</p>

<p>That is an excellent reason to vote OUT.</p>

<p>Well, I'll go to the foot of our stairs.</p>

<p>Of course he is.</p>

<p>Corbyn is voting IN.</p>

<p>Catweazle has absolutely no influence on anyone except a few BBC luvvies and a 1000 or so north London Marxists.</p>

<p>Ah yes that man his supporters say has been one of the most principled politicians.....odd that up to becoming leader he was anti-EU....</p>

<p>Mind you he was so proud of the numerous times he'd voted against the Labour whip &amp; now ? Well his MP's have ordered a tanker of TCP to apply to the scars.</p>

<p>He can vote any way he likes. He has no real substance, </p>

<p>Moron alert</p>

<p>As above with Benn junior.</p>

<p>That could just tip the scales towards OUT.</p>

<p>Maybe. We only have Hillary Benn's word on that</p>

<p>My bet is that most Tory voters will vote to stay when push comes to shove. They will feel lousy about doing it though and will go home and kick the cat.</p>

<p>I have been in the past a very loyal supporter of the Tory party, but in the last 2 years or so I have come around to UKIP. UKIP is far from perfect for me, But I do like Paul Nuttell, and Farage.</p>

<p>I live in Wales and the local UKIP would be candidates for the am are getting annoyed that central office wants to impose outsiders for  some of the seats. I hope they can resolve this. If not I may vote Conservative for the am. I much rather they got in than the Labour ones now in power..</p>

<p>An act of treason will have that effect.</p>

<p>We are staying, whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>Sorry, would like to reply but have no more troll food</p>

<p>We have a vote on that. That such a vote is obviously rigged and already cheated is evident but there is still the opportunity for the public to vote rationally and leave the toxic fascist dictatorship that is the EU.</p>

<p>"vote is obviously rigged and already cheated is evident"</p>

<p>Confident then?  Getting your moans in early?</p>

<p>Wibble...wibble..</p>

<p>Love Europe, loathe EU.</p>

<p>Leave!</p>

<p>There is a significant "soft" Eurosceptic view, that is highly critical of the EU, but which falls short of wanting us to pull out. I heard Peter Lilley on R4 espousing just such a view the other day.</p>

<p>I think there is a lot of the Tory party that thinks similarly. The chairman of our constituency association has told me in private that he thinks much the same. I doubt he would air these views too publicly though.</p>

<p>I think we can safely say the INs have it.</p>

<p>You can, if that is how you wish to see things but the referendum, however rigged by the state is still open. The Eu will end. It will do so slaughtering millions, as all communist dictatorships always do or it will end quietly and such a nightmarish poison be forgotten about for generations, and such suppression and abuses never considered again.</p>

<p>"The Eu will end. It will do so slaughtering millions, as all communist dictatorships always do "</p>

<p>Project fear?</p>

<p>Say it as much as you like. It won't be your decision.</p>

<p>What a stupid piece of underestimation!<br/>There is no one issue that it's worth tearing apart a party for. We should have a respectful debate and come together as friends after.<br/>I, for one, do not want a scintilla of risk of letting Corbyn in by attacking party colleagues.</p>

<p>The Civil war was horrible - just ask all the Irish former slaves living in Barbados.</p>

<p>Cameron isn't permitting a respectful debate.  He has muzzled EU-sceptics and told Tory MPs to ignore the views of the party membership.</p>

<p>A respectful debate isn't possible when you have someone like Cameron acting as though he has a divine right to govern.</p>

<p>Good luck with talking to the Bajan slaves.</p>

<p>Respectful debate? Dhimmi Dave doesn't want that, he wants to insult anyone who disagrees with him. He is the Heir to Blair and closer to Komrade Korbin than you know.</p>

<p>"There is no issue worth tearing apart a party for"  I would suggest the future of our nation and the future of our children and grandchildren is worth far more than any political party.</p>

<p>Quite - people like Moronic Lemur would be those who refused to fight the Nazis.</p>

<p>True, I just can't comprehend that mind set.</p>

<p>Simon Heffer is such a pompous tit.</p>

<p>What happened last time the Tories divided over Europe?  You got 13 years of Labour.</p>

<p>Who can tell the difference - he has announced himself as the Heir to Blair and has proved it.</p>

<p>You aren't gonna win FA with a rump Tory party led by some knuckle-dragging cretin like Bone or Hollobone.</p>

<p>Agreed - he doesn't have a clue about the dangers involved.</p>

<p>Do enlighten us.</p>

<p>Bollox.</p>

<p>EU Sceptic Cabinet Ministers and Junior Ministers should present Cameron with an ultimatum.</p>

<p>He either allows them to campaign to LEAVE, or they will resign en masse and force him to completely rebuild his Government.</p>

<p>It's time to play hard-ball with Flashman.</p>

<p>Cameron's position as prime minister is untenable!  Get rid of this lightweight, we cannot allow a British prime minister to beg, he's an embarrassment!!!</p>

<p>He is going anyway, forget Dave.  Let us concentrate on just voting out.</p>

<p>Yet again, it was not Croydon,  Chamberlain landed at Heston, in fact if you stop off at the Heston services for a coffee,  you will be sitting on the old runway. </p>

<p>On the button Simon. I suggest you put yourself forward for a leading role in the OUT Campaign. Straight forward, honest, clear and no waffle. We need you Simon.</p>

<p>Simon Heffer gave a sterling performance at yesterday's Grassroots Out presentation in Manchester.  You can watch it here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/05/livestream-grassroots-out-public-meeting-farage-pursglove-brady-and-special-guests/" rel="nofollow">http://www.breitbart.com/londo...</a></p>

<p>Thanks, y'know this is really worrying - the topic is huge and I had no idea, it's no good having a sterling performance that no one witnesses. We need Simon and his ilk on the box, we can have Nige, Bone, Cash, etc. but some are seen as divisive. We have to have sensible looking and sounding guys in the main stream media i.e. TV. We know the BBC is going to be as blatantly partial as normal.</p>

<p>Relax no one is voting out.<br/></p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Yes, they are. Countless tens of millions.</p>

<p>Countless?  There's only under seven tens of millions.</p>

<p>Even a rabid swivel-eyed Tory can count to seven.</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>I will.</p>

<p>Fine you need not go to the polling station then.</p>

<p>It's all about sovereignty, pure and simple.  I have a British parliament, and I cast my vote and then accept the winner.  I have a Monarch.  I don't need foreigners deciding what should happen in my country.  OUT.</p>

<p>Well Parliament has decided to share sovereignty with other nations under a multitude of international treaties.</p>

<p>Article 5 of the NATO treaty potentially commits us to fight in foreign wars without the approval of Parliament.</p>

<p>The EU is no different in this regard. Parliament has decided to pool sovereignty with the EU under a raft of treaties.</p>

<p>Actually, parliament has to be consulted over any and all conflicts.</p>

<p>You're pretending that one agreement with NATO suborns our own laws.</p>

<p>Correct. But it would be very difficult in practice not to follow your treaty obligations in such a matter.</p>

<p>Parliament had no right and no mandate to surrender our Sovereignty to the EU.</p>

<p>Treaty of Rome signed by Thatcher. Maastricht Treaty signed by John Major. Lisbon Treaty signed by Gordon Brown.</p>

<p>Thatcher didn't sign the Treaty of Rome, the Traitor Heath did.</p>

<p>Major didn't have a mandate for the Maastricht Treaty and Gordon Brown didn't have one for the Lisbon Treachery.</p>

<p>You are correct. Thatcher signed the Single European Act.</p>

<p>They had NO RIGHT in  law. Can you not read?</p>

<p>They had every right, they were elected head of the government.</p>

<p>The job of the eU troll is to disrupt - Isn't that right boys .</p>

<p>'Job' suggests it's work.  It's too easy on these threads to be considered a job.</p>

<p>Obviously someone who was banned and is back with a different name. Don't you people ever get bored of being told you're wrong?</p>

<p>Never been banned love,</p>

<p>Karma, can be a real nuisance and it has a long arm just for you. x</p>

<p>Just how old are you?  Really your attempt at humour is infantile to say the least.  Silly, I presume that your ancestors lie elsewhere.</p>

<p>I'm 32.  I'm guessing you're southern.</p>

<p>And a fine example of a tattooed, lager-swilling new British spotty yoof.</p>

<p>Lager?  Please.  You clearly don't know anything of the 'youth of today' (pleased as I am that you consider 32 'yoof'.</p>

<p>It's a mental thing, as it is plain that you have yet to grow up, and must live with your mum.</p>

<p>As much as you'd like to think so it's not true.  I moved out aged 18, owned my own house since 25.</p>

<p>Ha ha. Me thinks the lady doth protest too much. So you do live with your mum.</p>

<p>I doubt it. You are too infantile.</p>

<p>32! You come across as a puerile sniggering teenager. If only you realised what a t@at you're making of yourself.</p>

<p>Do go away you obnoxious whelp.</p>

<p>It's because they can't find a proper job, despite all the advantages the EU has apparently brought us.</p>

<p>It was this or Lidl.</p>

<p>It really is best to just ignore them. They add nothing to any thread they post on; they only do it to wind up people whose views they disagree with, because they aren't clever enough to change anybody's mind through argument and evidence. They are sad, bad and deeply unfunny losers. Best ignored.</p>

<p>You're right of course.  Their real purpose is to bury worthwhile comments a long way back in a pile of manure so no-one will see it.</p>

<p>I have just finished watching a documentary about the RAF in WWII on PBS America (Ch160) - and have become ashamed at what this nation has become since our fathers and grandfathers laid their lives on the line.</p>

<p>FIGHTING THE BLUE - I highly recommend everyone remind themselves of what this nation once was, and did, and the pride it could take in its people.</p>

<p>Actually Josef Frantisek a Czech was probably the RAF's top ace, he never bothered registering his kills. </p>

<p>That's when you had half the globe subjugated in your empire.</p>

<p>Newsflash - you don't anymore, and don't even produce anything that can't be made better and cheaper elsewhere.</p>

<p>True, but we do support the third worlds unemployables.</p>

<p>You do - and, newsflash - it's your own government that lets them in and chooses to support them, not the EU.</p>

<p>But it's easier to blame a foreigner I guess.</p>

<p>Except high performance cars. Razor blade packaging. Lasers. Glasses. Lenses. Plasma. Accountancy. Education. Biotechnology. No one does any of those better. That's why they are made in Britain Oh, and Harry Potter.</p>

<p>And no, not subjugated. That's your own terror and fear there. We were a trading empire. Your fanatical stupidity is laughable. Accept your place.</p>

<p>Funny how such a vast Empire could be subjugated by a relatively small army don't you think? Amazing don't you think how all those African countries were administered by a small corps of civil servants in second hand land rovers, now they are run by dictators in gold plated Rolls Royces. </p>

<p>I thank you for that. My father was in the RAF as a radio operator and rear gunner in Blenheims, and my father in law was a bomber pilot in Halifaxes, My father was shot down and ended up as a Japanese prisoner of war, my father in law was shot down over the North Sea and became.a Berman prisoner of war. My father weighted six stones when his camp was liberated, my father in <br/>Law has severe frost bite from doing the long walk home from his prison in Lithuania.</p>

<p>Now THAT is the British DNA that made us Great. You have much to be proud of - salutations.</p>

<p>Quite a few Poles flew in the RAF too</p>

<p>Seeing as we went to war because the Germans invaded their country, they were duty-bound to help the fight.</p>

<p>They did indeed and they were very brave. You would be amazed to know that many Romany men in the UK who were under the radar for conscription volunteered and served in the forces. My father, RAF Seargent Bill. Miller 84 Squardron was one of them.</p>

<p>You must be very proud. :-)</p>

<p>They were the most successful squadron in the Battle of Britain, but were betrayed by the new Labour govt afterwards, by being barred from taking part in the victory parade through London, for fear of offending Stalin, who was and is beloved by the Rotherham Party.</p>

<p>Priceless!<br/>He thinks they refought it for a new film.<br/>New documentary, old RAF film.</p>

<p>You are an ignorant, repulsive, and traitorous oik.</p>

<p>Oik?  Looks like the unelectable faction of the Tories is back in full flow.</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible for Labour to win in 2020, but never write off the Tories.</p>

<p>It is impossible for Labour to win. It is only due to the malicious, spiteful arrogant champagne socialists and the mentally incapable poor (nothing else explains why they vote for a party that continually, repeatedly promises them jobs yet always destroys the economy) that Labour ever see government at all.</p>

<p>To paraphrase a dim witted Northern Labour voter: "Laybuh! Pardy o't'werkin maaan'.</p>

<p>Interviewer: 'When did you last work?'<br/>Labour voter: '1983'.</p>

<p>Under a tax cutting strong, market driven Right wing Conservativ government.</p>

<p>It's so hilarious you have to laugh. Labour voters: Stupid people.</p>

<p>I am no Tory.</p>

<p>How dreadfully common of me.</p>

<p>Well, as a Northerner you have an inbuilt disability.</p>

<p>Do not feed the troll</p>

<p>I bet you had a right old farage to that film!</p>

<p>What does that even mean?  Rather don't insult our ancestors in such a fashion.</p>

<p>Is there one for my moniker?</p>

<p>You haven't complimented me on my Calcutta Cup avatar.<br/>Chosen especially for today.</p>

<p>Good win, not a great game but we did enough.</p>

<p>Rugger bugger!</p>

<p>You better believe it.  I rugger in both codes.</p>

<p>NOOOOO!<br/>He's watching it on a twenty minute delay!</p>

<p>You're joking! I'll get me coat.</p>

<p>No.<br/>It's true.<br/>Scroll down.</p>

<p>Well if it's any consolation many people in here claim I'm an SNP supporter so my comment could be about anyone.</p>

<p>Good save.</p>

<p>Well, my sporting Saturday is over.<br/>Time to log off and get something to eat.<br/>Play nicely, everyone.</p>

<p>;o)</p>

<p>:-D</p>

<p>:-(</p>

<p>What a lovely Calcutta Cup avatar, you have. Is that anything to do with the rugger?</p>

<p>Edward i.</p>

<p>My old beer buddy in Cambridge was a direct descendent.</p>

<p>That's all right.<br/>I don't judge you.<br/>Remember, I'm a republican.</p>

<p>I decided long ago to ignore Cameron. He's the most useless turd we've ever had as PM apart from Blair.</p>

<p>Heath?</p>

<p>Any more and this will start to sound like what have the Romans ever done for us :)</p>

<p>Brown takes some beating.</p>

<p>Yes and that pleb. However he wasn't voted in by anyone.</p>

<p>That's a Labour tradition.</p>

<p>Neither was Major the first time.<br/>Neither was Douglas-Home.<br/>It's a constitutional tradition.</p>

<p>Major not elected? What about the 1990 Leadership vote??<br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election,_1990" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p>

<p>True. And it is going to happen again when Cameron steps down.</p>

<p>Yes.<br/>It's getting a bit messy up there now.<br/>Hold tight.</p>

<p>Selfish, Career Politicians such as Johnson &amp; May make me despair. They wait to see which way the wind blows rather that supporting what they know is right. They put their careers and personal ambitions before the interests of the Nation. It is becoming apparent however that supporting Cameron is not in their selfish interests.</p>

<p>Well it looks like any aspiration that George Osborne had of becoming Prime Minister, has been consigned to the dustbin. In fact all of the pro-EU cabinet ministers will never get the top job, as they are linked by association to Cameron's dreadful instruction to his MP's over ignoring grassroots Eurosceptic sentiment.</p>

<p>So all bets are off who will succeed Cameron. I thought Theresa May was a cert, but she has impaled herself by nailing her colours to Cameron's mast. There is still a chance for Michael Gove to come through. Has he the guts to stand up for the majority of Conservative Party members, who are being so brutally ignored by Cameron? If he does, he is a future Prime Minister in the waiting.</p>

<p>He's already come out as an Inner.</p>

<p>Blast. Missed that. That is Gove washed up then.</p>

<p>Having said that, perhaps not.  I read the earlier report that he had but this contradicts it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4682358.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/...</a></p>

<p>Vote to "REMAIN" and you vote for UK to become like Sweden or Germany.<br/>Cameron will find a reason to accept quotas of (cough) "refugees" from Europe.<br/>The referendum is likely as early as June (remember it was to be "before the<br/>end of 2017") simply because Cameron is scared to death of the inevitable<br/>scenes to come (if the media show any semblance of accurate reporting)<br/>of millions more invaders breaking down the feeble borders of the EU,<br/>rioting in European cities, raping and assaulting European girls and women.<br/>That would be bad enough but imagine a Labour government with open borders!<br/>As a woman with two daughters, I will have no hesitation in voting to "LEAVE"!</p>

<p>You have to watch RT News to get a truthful picture of the migrant calamity in EU countries. The media in the UK seem reluctant to report the ongoing violence.</p>

<p>When you're siding with Putin, you're on the wrong side.</p>

<p>"You have to watch RT News to get a truthful picture"</p>

<p>Stop it, now.  I'm in stitches.</p>

<p>Exactly!  That's what I always say, for a true picture of the EU you can only turn to the Kremlin's official organ of propaganda.</p>

<p>Sweden and Germany are in Schengen - the UK is not.</p>

<p>"Vote to "REMAIN" and you vote for UK to become like Sweden or Germany."</p>

<p>Brilliant.  I might use this as a slogan.  Vote to Remain and you vote for the UK to become a successful post-industrial country.</p>

<p>Mr Heffer,</p>

<p>"How stupid does he think we are?"</p>

<p>Well, he knows after last May's General Election that the masses are pretty stupid.  Why not double down and see how much you can get away with?  Meanwhile, you're the one who voted for him; I sure as hell didn't!</p>
